tax rules 2 3 OVERVIEW The bill introduces a new approach to taxing foreign companies that are controlled by New Zealand residents. Current international tax rules New Zealand currently taxes its residents on their share of all income, both active and passive, earned by controlled foreign companies (CFCs) as that income accrues. A credit is provided for any foreign tax paid by the CFC. In addition, dividends paid by CFCs to New Zealand residents are taxed, with credits for New Zealand tax paid earlier on accrual and any foreign withholding taxes. The only exceptions to this approach are the grey list and conduit exemptions. If the CFC is located in one of eight “grey list” countries, all of its income is exempt. 1 Conduit tax relief reduces tax on CFC income to the extent the CFC is owned by a New Zealand company with foreign (non-resident) shareholders. There are several problems with the existing international tax rules: • New Zealand’s approach is unique: other countries exempt active offshore income. This creates an incentive for New Zealand businesses with offshore operations to move their headquarters to countries with more favourable tax rules. • Market growth and investment opportunities are increasingly outside of grey list countries such as China, South America or the Middle East. New Zealand businesses expanding into non-grey list countries may face higher tax and compliance costs than their competitors. • The grey list and conduit exemptions can be used to build structures that minimise tax on domestic income. The international tax changes are designed to reduce tax barriers to businesses expanding offshore, while minimising compliance costs and maintaining a level of protection for the domestic tax base. Changes that would be brought in by the bill The key features of the proposed new rules are an active income exemption for controlled foreign companies (CFCs), some accompanying measures to protect the tax base, and an exemption from tax on most foreign dividends received by companies. 1 The grey list comprises Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, Norway, Canada Germany and Spain. 4 Active income exemption for CFCs The bill introduces an active income exemption for CFCs. This means that only passive income will be attributed to New Zealand owners as taxable income. Passive income is defined in the bill as the “attributable CFC amount” (a gross concept) and “net attributable CFC income or loss” (a net concept). To reduce compliance costs in situations where there is limited risk to the tax base, there are some exceptions from the requirement to attribute passive income. For example, there will typically be no attribution of passive income for CFCs in Australia. There will also be an exception for CFCs that pass an “active business” test – no attribution of passive income will be required for CFCs if the passive income of the CFC is less than 5 percent of total income. The test may be undertaken using tax rules or financial accounting information. It is expected that most active businesses will pass the test, and therefore not have to undertake a full calculation of attributable CFC income. Base protection measures To limit the risk to the New Zealand tax base, it is essential that CFCs with significant amounts of passive income are subject to attribution on this income. This is because New Zealand-sourced income can be converted into passive CFC income to reduce a person’s tax liabilities. For this reason the existing eight-country grey list exemption and conduit tax relief rules are being repealed. Another key risk to the tax base arises from New Zealand debt being used to finance investment in CFCs earning non-attributable income. As a consequence of exempting active CFC income, it is necessary to extend the interest allocation rules, which currently apply to foreign-owned companies, to resident companies with CFCs regardless of ownership. These rules place an upper limit on the level of interest deductions that can be taken against income earned in New Zealand. This reflects the fact that offshore active income will be exempt under the new rules. There are several safe harbours in the proposed rules which will apply only if companies with a significant international presence choose to heavily debt-finance their domestic operations but not their foreign ones. Foreign dividend exemption The bill introduces a foreign dividend exemption. This complements the active income exemption by reducing tax and compliance costs on companies that repatriate CFC and FIF income back to New Zealand. Most dividends paid by a foreign company will be exempt from income tax when received by New Zealand companies. Dividends that are tax-deductible for the foreign company and dividends on fixed-rate shares will remain taxable, although a deduction will be available against any passive CFC income to mitigate double taxation. Foreign dividend payment (FDP) accounts and branch equivalent tax accounts (BETA) of companies are unnecessary under the new rules and will be phased out over time. 5 Key recommendations Twenty submissions were received on the proposed international tax changes. Submissions generally welcomed the active income and foreign dividend exemptions but were critical of the base maintenance parts of the package. This report sets out officials’ detailed responses to those submissions. It does not recommend changes to the fundamental design and structure of the rules in the bill. We continue to consider that it is in New Zealand’s overall interest to move to an active income exemption and to exempt companies from tax on foreign dividends. Equally, we remain of the view that the introduction of interest allocation rules, the repeal of the grey list (except for Australia), and the repeal of the conduit rules are necessary to protect the tax base. Nevertheless, the report does recommend some significant technical changes in response to submissions. Our general approach in developing these recommendations has been to accept submissions that simplify compliance as long as we are satisfied that the associated risks to the tax base are not too great. We would not rule out further modification of the rules once officials and taxpayers have more experience of how they operate in practice. However, we consider a cautious approach is appropriate at this stage. Active business test The active business test excludes CFCs from the attribution rules if their passive income is less than 5 percent of their total income. Submissions expressed the concern that the test was too complex. For this reason, this report recommends a number of important simplifications. We recommend allowing losses as well as gains from hedges to be netted off against the gains and losses relating to the underlying contracts; this may seem a highly technical change, but it should reduce compliance costs because it more closely aligns the test with the way financial accounts are formulated and presented. We also recommend that IFRS accounts with an unqualified audit should be treated as being in compliance with IFRS accounting standards unless there is evidence of fraud, intent to mislead, or incompetence or lack of independence on the part of the auditor. Finally, we recommend reducing the number of compulsory adjustments to IFRS accounts that are required to take account of differences with tax concepts. Interest allocation rules The interest allocation rules in the bill are an integral base maintenance element of the reform package. The bill already has minimum threshold rules for small and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs). In view of submissions about the ability of SMEs to raise finance offshore, some further relaxation of these thresholds seems sensible. As the bill stands, no interest will be denied if the total interest expense in New Zealand is less than $250,000. We recommend increasing that limit to $1 million, with interest denial then being phased in gradually as expenditure increases up to $2 million. At that point, the general interest allocation rules would apply. 6 Unusual forms of dividend The bill exempts most foreign dividends received by companies. However, deductible dividends and dividends from fixed-rate shares will continue to be taxed; the bill currently achieves this result by treating such dividends as interest. Submissions argued against taxing such dividends at all. Even if they were to be taxed, submissions argued for their reclassification as interest. We remain of the view that deductible dividends and dividends from fixed-rate shares should be taxed. However, in response to submissions, we have recommended that the bill be amended so that this is done by treating them as taxable dividends rather than by deeming them to be interest. Transition from existing rules The bill includes transitional rules to deal with CFC losses and foreign tax credits accrued before the application of the new legislation. Taxpayers are permitted to carry these “old” losses and credits forward, and to use them in the new system to relieve tax on passive income. However, taxpayers must reduce these amounts by reference to their total CFC income – not just their passive income. This reflects the fact that such losses and credits may, in fact, relate to active CFC income and should not be used to shelter only future passive income. Submissions focused on the complexity of the rules and associated compliance costs. We recommend simplifying the approach, in particular by allowing taxpayers to convert “old” amounts into ordinary CFC losses and credits using a two-year snapshot of their CFC income and by allowing the use of financial accounts to determine total CFC income for the purposes of these rules. Interest expenditure incurred by CFCs The bill provides that deductions for interest expenditure incurred by a CFC will be based on the proportion of the CFC’s assets that are used to derive passive income. Special rules apply to CFCs that are excessively debt funded, to prevent debt being concentrated in particular CFCs to maximise deductions against passive income. Submissions pointed out that these rules potentially interfere with intra-group financing arrangements, where a CFC performs a group treasury function, borrowing and on-lending to associated CFCs. To address this concern, we recommend amending the bill to allow for appropriate adjustments in such cases. Application date Uncertainty caused by late enactment of the bill potentially causes problems for taxpayers. These problems are particularly pronounced for taxpayers with earlier balance dates. This report therefore recommends that the new rules should apply for the 2009–10 income year to taxpayers with balance dates on or after 30 June, with the current rules applying to taxpayers with balance dates before 30 June. The new rules would apply for the 2010–11 income year to all taxpayers. 7 DIRECTION OF REFORM AND SCOPE OF BILL Issue: Agreement with the direction of reform and its underlying principles Submission (24A – NZ Law Society, 26 – Fonterra, 30 – Staples Rodway, 32 – KPMG, 35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 40 – Fisher and Paykel Healthcare, 53 – Ernst & Young, 54 – Business New Zealand, 59 – Fletcher Building, 62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 68 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 73 – Seniors Money International, 78 – Seaworks) The introduction of an active income exemption for controlled foreign companies is overdue. Other jurisdictions have long had such an exemption as an important feature of their tax system, and New Zealand firms have, up to now, been at a considerable disadvantage when competing against companies from these jurisdictions. The active income exemption and the exemption from tax of most foreign dividends will bring New Zealand’s tax rules for companies operating overseas much more in line with international norms. Although the reforms may not go far enough in some respects, and some elements of the package may impose an undue compliance burden on some firms, the guiding principles of the reform are sensible. Comment Officials welcome the general consensus in favour of the direction of the reform and its underlying principles. The provisions giving effect to these principles are necessarily complex and seek to balance a range of considerations. But it is reassuring that most submissions support the key principles that should underpin reform and on the broad direction of reform. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 8 Issue: Opposition to the introduction of an active income exemption Submission (38 – New Zealand Council of Trade Unions) An active income exemption for CFCs should not be introduced because it may lead firms to substitute investment in domestic facilities with investment offshore. Comment The submission notes that a more favourable tax environment for outbound investment may lead to some investment or production that would otherwise have occurred in New Zealand being relocated offshore. This is a legitimate concern, although there are a number of important offsetting factors which can work in the opposite direction. New Zealand is principally a net importer of capital. For firms that invest capital abroad, there is greater scope for other firms to profitably increase their investment in New Zealand. Moreover, investment abroad and domestic activity in New Zealand are not necessarily substitutes. Investment abroad can be complementary to the demand for products from New Zealand. Investment abroad can also lead to an upgrading of the types of jobs undertaken in New Zealand. These reforms seek to remove barriers to offshore investment without subsidising firms with offshore operations. This is a careful balance. Suggestions for further liberalising the rules should be considered not only in terms of the possible base maintenance risks but also with a view to their likely impact on investment location decisions. Proposals to further relax or dispense with interest allocation rules are a good example. Interest allocation rules restrict the amount of debt that can be loaded against New Zealand income. This protects the domestic tax base. It also limits the extent to which firms can use interest deductions in New Zealand to obtain an outright tax subsidy for offshore investment. As the rules are currently designed, officials believe there is no strong reason to expect that the reforms will reduce capital and productivity in New Zealand. Because these reforms provide incentives for firms to locate or stay in New Zealand and to expand and benefit from opportunities offshore, they are likely to have the opposite effect. Even if New Zealand wanted to prevent outflows of capital, it is unlikely that an internationally stringent tax treatment of CFC income would be in its best interests, given world trends for companies and workers to migrate to other countries. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 9 Issue: Active income exemption should be extended to non-portfolio FIFs and branches as soon as possible Submission (26 – Fonterra, 32 – KPMG, 35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 53 – Ernst & Young, 68 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Non-portfolio FIFs (those with shareholdings of between 10 and 50 percent in a foreign company) and branches have not been dealt with in the current changes. This will create a fundamentally different tax outcome between shareholdings of 50 percent (which, in the case of 50:50 joint ventures, are subject to the FIF rules and will continue to be subject to full attribution of income, subject to the grey list exemption) and of 51 percent (which will be subject to the CFC rules and will generally not be taxable in New Zealand). It will also create significant tax differences between foreign branches and 100 percent-owned foreign subsidiaries. Companies will continue to incur compliance costs in relation to non-grey list FIFs until the active income exemption is extended to cover these entities. The rules for branches and non-portfolio FIFs therefore need to be brought into line with the rules for CFCs as soon as possible. The active income exemption could perhaps be extended to non-portfolio FIFs in the current bill. Comment Given the complexity of the international tax rules, it makes sense to develop the reforms in stages. The international tax review’s fundamental reform is the introduction of an active income exemption for controlled foreign companies. In the second stage of the review, the key priority will be to extend the active income exemption to non-portfolio FIFs. The treatment of financial institutions and branches will also be addressed as part of the second stage of the review. However, non- portfolio FIFs, financial institutions and branches raise various policy and technical concerns which require careful consideration. It is not possible, for example, simply to apply the CFC changes in the bill in their entirety to non-portfolio FIFs. The application of the active income exemption to these entities needs to take account of the fact that the New Zealand investors do not control these entities. However, officials do agree that rules for non-portfolio FIFs in particular need to be aligned with those for CFCs as soon as practically possible. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 10 APPLICATION DATE OF INTERNATIONAL TAX CHANGES Issue: Taxpayers should be given the option to apply either the current rules or those contained in the bill for the 2009–10 income year Submission (24A – New Zealand Law Society, 35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The delay in enactment of the bill potentially causes problems for taxpayers, particularly in relation to the international tax changes, which are complex and far- reaching. Although the Committee’s report-back on the bill is not due until 30 June 2009, the new rules could apply to some early balance date taxpayers from as early as 1 October 2008. This could create real difficulties for some businesses in working out provisional tax payments. On the other hand, many taxpayers will have planned for the introduction of the new rules from the 2009–10 income year. Taxpayers should have the option to defer application of the new rules until the 2010–11 income year, with taxpayers who wish to do so being able to use the new rules for the 2009–10 income year. Comment Officials recognise the potential problems that may result from late enactment of the bill, and have discussed the issues with a range of firms and professional advisers. Allowing taxpayers to use either the current rules or the rules contained in the bill for the 2009–10 income year may appear attractive but there are some significant problems with this option. An “elective” option would not do away with uncertainty for taxpayers. Taxpayers choosing the bill rules might need to make provisional tax payments before the final shape of those rules is known, and so could face use-of-money interest and possibly penalties if they fail to correctly anticipate the final form of the law. A legislative approach that potentially builds in uncertainty for some taxpayers is not desirable. A set of rules for an elective mechanism would need to be designed by officials and legislated for in the bill. Matters that would need to be addressed include the form of any election, whether an election could be revoked, how groups of CFCs would be dealt with and the interactions between different CFCs and groups using the old and new rules. Any attempt to design an elective option for such a complex area in a short period could well result in a flawed system that would create ongoing problems for taxpayers and Inland Revenue. But obviously until such a system was designed taxpayers would not be able to take a final view on whether they should elect in. An elective option also raises compliance cost issues for taxpayers. An elective arrangement would allow taxpayers to opt into the system that provided the best overall result for them. To determine this accurately, taxpayers would need to evaluate their tax position under two different sets of tax rules. 11 Apart from the practical concerns and compliance problems with an elective option, it is not desirable in principle to allow different sets of tax rules to be applied to taxpayers in identical circumstances. Equity and certainty of treatment between taxpayers in the same situation should underpin the tax system. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Changes to the international tax rules should not have effect until the 2010–11 income year Submission (53 – Ernst & Young, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Given the uncertainties caused by the late enactment of the bill, if taxpayers are not given the option to choose between the current rules or the rules contained in the bill for the 2009–10 income year, then the new rules should not apply until the 2010–11 income year. Comment Delaying application of the new rules for all taxpayers until the 2010–11 income year is one solution to problems caused by late enactment of the bill. However, the reforms as a whole are intended to help taxpayers with interests in CFCs, and some taxpayers do want the reforms to be introduced as soon as possible. These taxpayers, who have late balance dates, would be able to deal with any potential compliance problems caused by the enactment of the bill. Taxpayers with later balance dates will not need to make their first provisional tax payments for 2009–10 until after the bill’s enactment, and they will have a clear idea of the bill’s provisions by the time of Committee’s report-back, which is scheduled for 30 June. This would make it possible to apply the new rules for 2009–10 only to taxpayers with balance dates on or after 30 June. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part. Officials recognise that the uncertainty caused by late enactment of the bill potentially causes problems for taxpayers. However, these problems are particularly pronounced for taxpayers with earlier balance dates. Applying the new rules to taxpayers with balance dates from 30 June should provide certainty for all taxpayers for the 2009–10 income year and allow at least some taxpayers to benefit from the new rules at the earliest opportunity. Officials therefore recommend that the new rules should apply for the 2009–10 income year to taxpayers with balance dates on or after 30 June, with the current rules applying to taxpayers with balance dates before 30 June. The new rules would apply to all taxpayers for the 2010–11 income year. 12 Issue: The international tax reforms should be introduced in stages Submission (53 – Ernst & Young, 68 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The complexity of the international reforms, and uncertainty caused by the late enactment of the bill, mean it would be sensible to introduce the reforms in stages. Introducing the active income exemption for the 2009–10 income year while retaining the grey list and not applying outbound interest allocation rules for that income year would allow firms to familiarise themselves with the new rules and minimise their compliance costs. Comment The international tax reforms have been designed as a coherent package. The central feature of the reforms is the introduction of an exemption for active CFC income. This exemption needs to be supported by the other key elements of the package – for example, the introduction of interest allocation rules and the removal of the grey list and conduit rules. It is not possible to pick out certain elements of the package without disturbing the balance of the package as a whole, with a risk of substantial revenue loss to New Zealand. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Attributed CFC income should be removed from any use-of-money interest calculation for 2009–10 Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) In the calculation of unpaid tax for use-of-money interest, any attributed CFC income should be excluded for the 2009–10 income year if the taxpayer has had no exposure to the CFC rules previously. It would be unfair to charge use-of-money interest in relation to attributed CFC income given the late enactment of the bill. Comment Officials recognise that it is difficult for taxpayers to calculate their provisional tax liabilities before the final form of the new rules is known. However, excluding all attributed CFC income from use-of-money interest calculations for some taxpayers would not be appropriate. It is preferable to find a solution that gives all taxpayers with CFCs certainty about their overall tax treatment for the 2009–10 income year. For this reason, we recommend that the rules in the bill should apply to taxpayers with balance dates on or after the date of the bill’s report-back – that is, 30 June. This should ensure that there are no significant compliance concerns around provisional tax payments and use-of-money interest. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 13 EXEMPTIONS FROM REQUIREMENT TO ATTRIBUTE Overview Under the proposed new rules, the passive income of a controlled foreign company (CFC) is attributed to its New Zealand owners and taxed. However, there will be no attributed income from some CFCs, even if they have passive income. These are: • CFCs that pass an “active businesses test”; • most CFCs that are resident in Australia; and • certain CFCs in the business of insurance that have obtained a determination from Inland Revenue. Active business test (5 percent test) Under the active business test, a CFC is classified as an active business, and none of its income will be attributed if its passive income is less than 5 percent of its total income. This relieves a taxpayer from the requirement to calculate attributed CFC income if the CFC’s passive income is incidental to the CFC’s other income. We consider the 5 percent threshold is generous; it would enable a typical active business to have a significant portion of its assets earning passive income. A CFC’s passive income and total income may be measured, for the purposes of the test, using either tax rules or – in most cases – information from audited financial accounts. The option to use financial accounts is intended to reduce the cost of carrying out the test, since much of the necessary information will have already been prepared for non-tax purposes. It is possible, in many cases, to consolidate CFCs by country for the purposes of the test. This may be an advantage to a taxpayer if there is a holding company in a particular country that receives passive income from other active CFCs in that country. By consolidating the CFCs, the passive income is not counted. Once enacted, the active business test will be monitored to ensure it is achieving its aims. We expect there will be some changes to the test over time. CFCs resident in Australia The “grey list” for CFCs has been repealed as part of the reforms in the bill, but CFCs resident in Australia will continue to be exempt from attribution of passive income. The Australian exemption is justified because a lot of smaller businesses use Australia as their first option when expanding offshore. For those businesses, the compliance costs of carrying out an active business test are likely to be proportionately higher than for larger businesses, and so a country exemption is particularly beneficial. The Australian exemption applies if the CFC is subject to tax in Australia, and is not taking advantage of certain tax concessions in Australia, such as those relating to overseas branches. 14 Insurers that have obtained a determination Income from insurance business is passive income under the new rules. However, taxpayers can apply for a determination from the Commissioner that an insurance CFC is an active business. The criteria for obtaining a determination are intended to limit the insurance exemption to cases in which the CFC generates all or nearly all of its income from premiums covering risks in its country of residence and from investment assets used to back the insurance. The exemption is not intended to apply to so-called “captive insurers”, which typically insure the risk of only a related party or related parties. Issue: Accounting-based active business test is too complex Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 66 – Telecom, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The accounting-based active business test is too complex and too many adjustments to the accounting measure are required. Comment The accounting-based active test is supposed to be a relatively low-cost filter that prevents taxpayers with active CFCs from having to complete attributable income calculations for those CFCs. To make the test low-cost, accounting information can be used. Adjustments are then made to that information to achieve an approximation to tax measures of passive and total income. Submissions argue that the adjustments are onerous and that the test will not be low- cost if adjustments are required. Officials agree that there will be situations in which the adjustments in the bill will not be straightforward. We therefore recommend a number of changes to the accounting-based test to reduce the cost of applying the test. These changes should mean that taxpayers can make more use of unadjusted summary financial reporting information. The changes to the legislation appear small, in the sense that they do not require major redrafting. However, we understand they will make a significant difference in practice, particularly in combination with the change recommended in the next submission (which will allow people to place greater reliance on audited accounts). The recommended changes are that: • derivative gains and losses be included, rather than just gains; • derivative gains and losses be included only when they affect the income statement (not when they are temporarily recognised in an equity reserve); • gains and losses on non-derivative financial assets be included, rather than just gains; 15 • more gains and losses on derivatives be included in gross income; • references to “tax calculations” be removed from compulsory adjustments in most cases; • there no longer be any compulsory downward adjustments to passive income or upward adjustments to total income (with one exception; see the next point on shares); • net gains on shares not be included in the test unless the shares are held on revenue account (this is not a change, but is mentioned for clarity); • certain personal services income be removed from the test entirely, but is always taxable. Derivatives and non-derivative financial asset changes Allowing the use of net gains and losses on derivatives and non-derivative financial assets simplifies the rules for two reasons. First, ledger accounts are frequently prepared on a net basis and it is therefore more likely they will be able to be used without adjustment. Secondly, it recognises that businesses often hedge risk and report their accounts net of hedging gains or losses. Example 1 illustrates this process. Example 1: Gains and losses on a derivative instrument A CFC makes sales in US dollars but plans to convert its sales income to New Zealand dollars and wishes to be sure about the amount it will receive. In the next three years, the CFC expects to make sales of US$100 per year. The CFC enters foreign exchange contracts, at the beginning of each year, to pay US$100 and receive NZ$200 at the end of the year (a forward exchange rate of 0.50 in each year). In the first year, the actual exchange rate at the end of the year is 0.80 and there is a gain on the exchange contract. In the second year, the actual rate is 0.50. In the third year, the actual rate is 0.40 and there is a loss on the contract. Actual sales in all years are US$100, as expected. Table 1 summarises the outcomes. Table 1 Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Exchange rate 0.80 0.50 0.40 Sales income (NZD) $125 $200 $250 Hedge gain/(loss) $75 $0 ($50) Reported sales income (per accounts) $200 $200 $200 Existing test (gross) Sales income $125 $200 $250 Derivative gains (gross) $75 $0 $0 Total income for test $200 $200 $250 Proposed change (net) Sales income $125 $200 $250 Derivative gains (net) $75 $0 ($50) Total income for test $200 $200 $200 The sales revenue figure reported in the accounts is NZ$200 in each year, being the actual revenue when converted at the actual exchange rate, plus the gain or loss on the foreign exchange contract. Under the rules in the bill, which bring in gains on derivatives but not losses, the NZ$200 figure could not be used in the accounting-based active business test in year 3. The taxpayer would have to “unpick” the derivative loss from the reported sales revenue. With the proposed change, the NZ$200 figure could be used in all years, allowing summary reporting information to be used in all cases. 16 The recognition of derivative gains and losses only when they affect the income statement will reduce the volatility of the passive income and total income measures used in the test. The change to the treatment of derivatives and non-derivative financial assets will not necessarily make the test easier in all situations. For accounting purposes, hedge accounting can only be used when there is proper documentation of a hedge at the outset. Some businesses, while actively hedging risks, prefer not to incur the overhead of documenting their hedges and do not use hedge accounting. Their hedges will always affect the income statement immediately, and hedge gains and losses may be reported separately from the hedged item (the latter is an accounting policy choice rather than a strict rule). There does not appear to be any way to further simplify the test in these cases, but a taxpayer who feels that undue volatility is introduced by this treatment is free to use the tax-based active business test, which contains alternative options for calculating derivative gains and losses. As currently drafted, the bill places limits on the derivative gains that can be included in total income for the purposes of the active business test. In particular, the derivative gains must be classified as revenue under the applicable accounting standard. This is inappropriate. Derivative gains and losses should be included where the derivative is in a hedge relationship, which need not be accounted for using hedge accounting, with other components of total income. In most cases, this will mean that all derivative gains and losses are included in total income, other than those relating to hedges of liabilities or expenses. This should considerably simplify the test. Fewer references to tax calculations The bill requires adjustments to the basic accounting measures of passive income and total income. Many of these adjustments are calculated using tax concepts and measures, by reference to the tax-based active business test or the calculation of attributed CFC income. For example, section EX 20E(8)(c) adds, to the basic accounting measure of passive income, “income from the alienation of revenue account property that is included in the attributable CFC amount for the accounting period under section EX 20B(3)(j)”. Section EX 20B(3)(j), in turn, refers to “income from the alienation of revenue accounting property \[...\] capable of giving rise to income of the CFC referred to in another paragraph of this subsection \[being EX 20B(3)\]”. Strictly speaking, this requires taxpayers to work out whether revenue-account property would give rise to passive income under the tax-based active business test. Officials recommend that references to the tax-based test be removed where possible. In particular: • that derivative income should only be included if it hedges a component of passive or total income 2 under the accounting-based test, if the derivative was not entered into in the ordinary course of business, or if the derivative is held for a business of dealing; and 2 Derivative income will be included in passive income if the derivative is hedging a component of passive income. Derivative income will be included in total income if it is hedging a component of total income. 17 • that gains on revenue-account property should be included only if the property is capable of giving rise to passive income under the accounting-based test. Some references to tax concepts remain. For example, the concept of revenue- account property comes from tax. Officials do not expect that many CFCs, particularly not those engaged in active business, will have revenue-account property that would generate passive income or revenue-account shares, and most CFCs will know if they have. Adjustments made optional Officials recommend that the legislation clarify that downward adjustments to passive income and upward adjustments to total income be optional. Many CFCs will pass the active business test without having to make these adjustments. The option to make the adjustments should be maintained, however, because some CFCs that are in substance engaged in active business would not pass the test without it. Exclusion of most gains on shares Officials wish to clarify that net gains on shares, which could include a loss, should be excluded from both passive and total income unless the shares are held on revenue account. These are already excluded in the bill, but the change from gross gains on financial assets to net gains (see earlier comments on this submission) makes this requirement even more necessary. Otherwise net losses on share investments could be used to shelter passive income. Most gains on shares are not taxable and most losses are not tax-deductible. Personal services income The active business test makes certain personal services income passive income (see section EX 20B(3)(h)). This is intended to apply where the CFC is essentially a vehicle for personal services delivered by a New Zealand resident, with little or no substantial business of its own. The active income exemption is not intended to apply in these circumstances. Officials recommend that the adjustment for personal services income be removed from the accounting-based active business test, but that a New Zealand resident owning a company that has such income will always be taxable. Officials have made a submission on this point. Limits on change The accounting-based test, while intended to be a low-cost filter, is also intended to be a reasonable proxy for the result that would be obtained if tax concepts were used. There is a trade-off between the simplicity of the test and the risk that significant tax liabilities could be avoided. If the balance tips too far towards the latter, there is a risk that firms will have greater incentives to move domestic activities abroad purely for tax reasons. The purpose of the international tax reforms is to remove disincentives to overseas business expansion from a New Zealand base; they are not intended to go further and provide a strong incentive to move domestic activity offshore. 18 Officials do not favour the “safe harbour” option presented in another submission made by the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants. This would be an oversimplified test and would not be a reasonable proxy for a tax-based test. Increased risk of revenue loss The simplified test does introduce an element of risk that passive revenue will be sheltered. This passive revenue could include income that is currently taxed as domestic income but is shifted abroad as a result of the new rules. If such sheltering does occur, and Inland Revenue will be actively monitoring the use of the new rules, it will be necessary to change the test. This may involve more complex rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and that the accounting-based active business test be simplified as officials have described. Issue: Use of reporting currency in the tax-based active business test Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Section EX 21(4) should permit a taxpayer to use the reporting currency to determine the active:passive ratio. Comment Section EX 21(4), as drafted, would require the use of the CFC’s functional currency. This is the currency that would be used under International Financial Reporting Standards. Officials consider that this poses a revenue risk, 3 and recommend reverting to the existing rules for currency conversion for CFCs. Our comment on the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountant’s submission about aligning the rules for determining passive income for the CFC attributable amount, provides more information. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part, by reverting to the existing rules for currency conversion for CFCs. 3 The revenue risk is examined in greater detail in the following submission. 19 Issue: Reliance on audited accounts to show compliance with standards Submission (32 – KPMG, 53 – Ernst & Young, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Financial reports prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) or their equivalent (IFRSE), or Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) should be taken as correct for the purposes of the active income test. Comment The new rules require compliance with IFRS, IFRSE or GAAP if the accounting- based test is being used. If a set of audited accounts is found not to comply with the relevant standards, because of an oversight by the auditor or for other reasons, then this requirement will not be met. This may lead to a taxpayer having to undertake detailed calculations and could lead to shortfall penalties if those calculations reveal that tax should have been paid. The submission states that accounting information used to prepare financial reports should be taken as being correct. The policy intent is that taxpayers that use the accounting-based active business test should normally be able to rely on accounting information that has been used to prepare audited financial reports. The explanatory memorandum for Australia’s recent Taxation of Financial Arrangement reforms states (paragraph 5.23): Whether or not a taxpayer’s financial reports have been prepared in accordance with relevant accounting standards is a question of fact. However, where an entity purports to have prepared a financial report in accordance with relevant accounting standards and there is an unqualified auditor’s report in respect of the financial report, the auditor’s report will ordinarily be indicative of, but not necessarily conclusive of, the fact that the financial report has been prepared in accordance with the relevant accounting standards. Officials expect that an unqualified auditor’s report would carry similar weight in the new rules and recommend that this observation be reflected in the legislation. The audit requirement has been introduced specifically to provide Inland Revenue with greater confidence that financial accounting standards have been met. Accordingly, an unqualified audit opinion should be taken as strong evidence of compliance. However, officials do not recommend a blanket rule that audited accounts are always to be taken at face value. There could be situations, particularly in countries with lax regulation of the accounting profession, in which the lack of compliance leads to a significant misstatement of the true position. 20 Officials recommend instead that an unqualified audit opinion be taken as evidence of compliance with applicable accounting standards unless there is a reasonable suspicion of fraud, intent to mislead, lack of auditor independence, or auditor incompetence. Inland Revenue may develop administrative guidance, such as a standard practice statement, to provide further certainty for taxpayers. An audit may be carried out at the individual CFC level or, when information from consolidated accounts is used, at the consolidated level. In the latter case, it is acknowledged that auditors will sometimes not audit an individual CFC if it makes a very small contribution to the overall entity (that is, it is immaterial). This does not, on its own, disqualify the entity from using the accounting-based active business test. In conjunction with the recommended change (to increase reliance on audited accounts) we further recommend that the accounting-based active business test be able to be used only for accounts that have received an unqualified audit opinion. The provisions in the bill would also allow “except for” opinions. “Except for” audit opinions were originally included because these are sometimes given to smaller organisations that deal in cash, simply because it is not possible to give assurance that all cash has been properly accounted for. For example, clubs and societies that charge event entry fees “at the door” may be in this situation. However, it seems unlikely that many CFCs would be in such a situation, and those who are may use the tax- based active business test. There are domestic and overseas precedents for requiring an unqualified opinion when audited accounts are used for tax purposes. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to the limitations and conditions outlined above. Issue: Anti-avoidance rule for manipulation of accounting test Submission (Matter raised by officials) An anti-avoidance rule should be introduced to prevent taxpayers manipulating the accounting-based active business test. Comment Our assessment is that changes recommended to the accounting-based active business test increase the potential for loss of tax revenue owing to manipulation of the test. For example, allowing net losses on derivatives or non-derivative financial assets to be used in the test could permit other sources of passive income to be sheltered by artificial transactions. 21 We recommend that a specific anti-avoidance rule be added to the legislation to discourage such manipulation. This would apply only when an arrangement was entered into with the purpose of enabling a CFC to satisfy the active business test under calculations using the financial accounts. It is aimed at serious abuse of the new rules. The effect of the rule, if it applied, would be to require a full tax calculation for the CFC in question. We would not expect the rule to apply when a transaction was undertaken in the ordinary course of an active business, because the purpose of such a transaction would not be to enable a CFC to pass the accounting-based test. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Financial arrangements with related parties Submission (Matter raised by officials) An anti-avoidance rule should be introduced to prevent taxpayers using loans between related parties with different functional currencies to shelter passive income. Comment A specific weakness of the accounting-based active business is exposed when one CFC provides a loan to an associated CFC (or to an associated New Zealand resident) that is denominated in the functional currency of one of the CFCs (or New Zealand dollars, in the case of the resident) and not in the functional currency of the other party. The loan may be a back-to-back loan via a third party. In this situation, there can be an overall net loss for New Zealand tax purposes, even though there may be no economic loss. This loss can be offset against (used to shelter) passive income. Requiring taxpayers to revalue all significant financial arrangements in New Zealand dollars, which is the recommended treatment under the tax-based test, is not a practical option in the accounting-based test, because the test is supposed to be simple to apply, using existing financial accounting information. Instead, we propose a specific anti-avoidance rule that applies to such transactions when there is an intent to defeat the application of the CFC rules. The rule would force a full tax calculation. The effectiveness of the rule in preventing abuse requires monitoring over time. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 22 Issue: Size of entity below which there should be no passive income Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) A minimum threshold for small businesses should be included in the provisions, below which passive income does not arise. Comment The submission proposes that taxpayers with CFCs should not have to pay tax on any attributed CFC income, regardless of the activities of the CFC, if the amount of passive income is small in absolute terms, or small relative to the taxpayer’s New Zealand income. This could enable taxpayers to shift passive investments into foreign investment vehicles they own to escape New Zealand tax. This is not the purpose of the international tax changes and would undermine the New Zealand tax base. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Simpler test for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) There should be a simpler definition of “passive income” and a simpler “active business” test for SMEs. Comment The submission argues for a simpler test for smaller entities. It suggests that passive income be limited to interest, royalties, rent, dividends and base company income. This would not necessarily make it easier for a small entity to undertake the test. For example, the line item “interest revenue” in financial reports may include hedging gains or losses. By not including derivative income in the test, summary accounting information could not be used in this case. Officials prefer a single accounting-based test, for businesses of any size, that is as simple as possible. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 23 Issue: The active business test threshold should be higher than 5 percent Submissions (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 38 – Council of Trade Unions, 66 – Telecom, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 68 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The complexity of the active business test calculations should be weighed against the active income threshold and/or the threshold should be raised from 5 to 10 percent. (PricewaterhouseCoopers, Telecom, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Corporate Taxpayers Group) The threshold should not be increased above 5 percent. (Council of Trade Unions) Comment Most of the submissions recommend that the threshold should be higher. Alternatively, it is argued that the threshold should be higher if the test is more complex or requires a greater level of accuracy. Officials acknowledge the concern about the complexity of the test, but our preference is to simplify the test rather than increase the threshold. This is because: • There is a relatively narrow definition of “passive income”, with numerous optional exclusions, which makes it less likely that the threshold will be exceeded. • While the figure of 5 percent may seem low, this threshold would allow a typical business to have a substantial portion of its assets earning passive income, because the gross return on typical passive investments is much lower than the gross return on typical active investments. 4 • The 5 percent threshold level is comparable with thresholds in Australia and the United States. • Even if a CFC fails to meet the 5 percent test, only passive income is attributable (there is no tax on the active income of the CFC). One submission noted that the effective threshold is higher than 5 percent in the United Kingdom. However, in the United Kingdom, if a CFC fails to qualify as an active business, then all its income is attributable. • A threshold of more than 5 percent could move away from the whole purpose of the reform, which is to remove impediments to expanding businesses based in New Zealand, to one that encourages “off-shoring” of domestic activity (a point that the Council of Trade Unions makes in its submission). Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 4 For example, if the active business activities of the CFC generate a gross return of 75 percent on assets employed in those activities, and the passive investments of the CFC generate a return of 10 percent, up to 28 percent of the CFC’s assets could be passive investments before it would fail the active business test. The 75 percent assumption is considered realistic – the average gross returns for non-financial private sector New Zealand businesses, including both passive and active returns, were 80 percent, 77 percent and 77 percent in the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 respectively. 24 Issue: Audit requirement Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 53 – Ernst & Young, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) A taxpayer should not be required to have audited accounts to calculate the active business test. Comment The proposed rules require taxpayers to meet certain requirements before they can use the active business test based on financial accounting information. One of those is that the accounts must have been audited by a chartered accountant (there is no such requirement if using the active business test based on tax concepts). The audit must result in an unqualified audit opinion, or another opinion that is neither an adverse opinion nor a disclaimer of opinion. If the accounts were prepared overseas, overseas equivalents to “chartered accountant”, “unqualified opinion”, “adverse opinion” and “disclaimer of opinion” are acceptable. The audit requirement applies whether the accounts are prepared in compliance with IFRS or in compliance with pre-IFRS (old GAAP) New Zealand accounting standards. The audit requirement is included to give Inland Revenue confidence that numbers used in the accounting-based active business test meet certain standards. It would be inefficient and costly for Inland Revenue auditors to attempt to police compliance with financial accounting standards. Audit requirements are present in some other tax legislation. In New Zealand, the use of the accounting profits method for calculating foreign investment fund income (see section EX 46(2)) is only permitted if the accounts have been audited and the result is an unqualified audit opinion. In Australia, amendments relating to the taxation of financial arrangements were recently enacted. These require an audit in accordance with auditing standards before several methods based on financial information can be used (see section 230–210(2) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, Fair value election, for example). These new rules also require an unqualified audit opinion in some cases (see section 230–215, Fair value election, where there are differing income and accounting years, for example). It is a requirement of the Companies Act that accounts are audited by a chartered accountant, but most closely held New Zealand-owned companies can elect – by unanimous vote of all shareholders – not to have an audit. One submission notes that some taxpayers, and particularly those with smaller businesses, may make this election not to have their accounts audited because the audit is not perceived to add value to the business. These taxpayers, as the submission also notes, can use the tax-based active business test. Smaller businesses would typically be expected to have relatively uncomplicated structures, which will reduce the cost of applying the tax-based test. 25 Officials note that there is a further submission from the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants on this issue, suggesting a less costly alternative to a full audit. Officials have recommended that the alternative be investigated for possible inclusion in a future tax bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Which accounts must be audited Submission (32 – KPMG) Proposed section EX 21E(2)(d) provides that the CFC test group accounts must be audited. The legislation should accept that it is sufficient if the New Zealand group accounts, which include the CFC test group, are audited. Comment Section EX 21E(2)(d) requires that audited and consolidated accounts that include the accounts of the CFC are prepared. Officials have recommended clarification of this point in response to another submission. As a result of that recommendation, New Zealand group accounts, containing the accounts of the CFC group and possibly the accounts of other entities, should be acceptable if they are audited. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part, and that the legislation be clarified. Issue: Alternatives to audit requirement Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) An audit certification approach could be considered rather than a full audit. Comment The submission suggests that an auditor could sign a certificate confirming the basis on which the accounts of the CFC have been prepared and that they meet the requirements of the applicable accounting standards. 26 If an audit certification could give reasonable assurance of compliance with financial accounting standards, but at a lower cost to the taxpayer than a full audit, this might be acceptable. However, at present it is unclear how much assurance could be provided by a certification approach. Officials recommend that this approach be investigated in the second phase of the international tax review. Recommendation That the submission be noted, and that an audit certification approach be investigated in the second phase of the international tax review. Issue: Independence of auditor when audited accounts used Submission (Matter raised by officials) The audited accounts required for the accounting-based active business test should be audited by an independent auditor. Comment Accounting information used in the accounting-based active business test must be taken from audited accounts. There should be a requirement that the auditor is independent of the CFC, related CFCs and the taxpayer. Officials understand that such independence would typically be required by New Zealand audit standards. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Use of alternative financial reporting standards Submission (30 – Staples Rodway, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Accounting standards specific to the CFC’s country should be able to be used in the active business test. Comment For most large organisations, only accounts that comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) may be used in the accounting-based active business test. 27 For many smaller companies, pre-IFRS New Zealand accounting standards (“old GAAP”) are also permitted. Submissions were made before the introduction of the legislation, asking that other standards such as US GAAP also be permitted. Officials recommended against this at the time. Allowing the use of further standards risks complicating the new rules, would be expensive and would require ongoing monitoring of those standards to ensure no large gaps between the accounting-based amount of passive income and the amount that would be calculated if the tax-based measure were used. IFRS is either a required or permitted set of accounting standards in over 100 countries. In addition, companies in New Zealand that have CFCs will commonly prepare consolidated financial accounts that comply with IFRS and include the accounts of CFCs, even when the CFCs themselves are not required by the law in their jurisdiction to produce IFRS-compliant information. Information from these consolidated accounts is normally allowed to be used for the active business test. Finally, if IFRS and “old GAAP” accounts are not available, the taxpayer has the option to use the tax-based active business test. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Pre-requisites for use of “old GAAP” accounting standards Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) In section EX 21C(6), the requirements to use “generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) without IFRS” should be linked to ASRB 9. Comment Financial information used in the accounting-based active business test must be compliant with relevant financial standards. Typically this means compliance with IFRS, but a concession was made for most small and medium-sized companies (SMEs). These companies are not required to adopt IFRS as a result of the government’s review of reporting requirements for SMEs and can use pre-IFRS New Zealand financial reporting standards (old GAAP). ASRB Release 9 sets out the companies that are not required to adopt IFRS for this reason. ASRB Release 9 is insufficient on its own. The bill sets out the minimum conditions that must be met. Setting out the conditions in legislation rather than incorporating them by reference will ensure that the conditions still apply if the ASRB release is updated to remove requirements. The legislation also imposes some additional requirements: because old GAAP has significant gaps in its coverage, relative to IFRS, the use of IFRS is strongly preferred when possible. The legislation therefore 28 requires companies to use IFRS if they have IFRS information available, even if they are covered by ASRB Release 9 (some SMEs will voluntarily adopt, or have voluntarily adopted, IFRS). The commentary to the bill explained that the use of old GAAP is intended to be a temporary measure. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Requirement to not have IFRS accounts if “old GAAP” standards are to be used Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Section EX 21C(6)(f) is superfluous given section EX 21C(6)(e). Comment The requirements are different, but we accept that if a person is required to prepare accounts using IFRS, they will usually prepare them. In this case, section EX 21C(6)(f) is redundant. We recommend that sections EX 21C(6)(f) and EX 21C(7)(f) be removed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Common ownership requirements for consolidation in the active business test Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The common ownership threshold for consolidation in the active business test should be clarified, and based on income interests rather than voting interests. Comment The rules in section EX 21D allow the taxpayer to consolidate certain CFCs for the purpose of the tax-based active business test. 29 Consolidation is permitted only when the taxpayer has a voting interest of more than 50 percent in each of the CFCs to be consolidated. This means that where a CFC has two (or more) New Zealand owners, at most one of them will be able to consolidate the CFC for the purposes of the active business test. For the time being, this is the intended result. If more than one person could consolidate a CFC, there is potential for complex interactions that have not yet been analysed. If the two owners feel that consolidation is necessary, forming a company in New Zealand and selling the CFCs to be consolidated to that company is one option they could pursue. Officials agree that we should use “income interest” rather than “voting interests” to determine whether or not the taxpayer has an interest of more than 50 percent. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part, by substituting “income interest” for “voting interests”. Issue: Accounting pre-requisites for consolidation under the tax-based test Submission (26 – Fonterra, 35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 53 – Ernst & Young, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) There should be no requirement to produce consolidated financial accounts in order to group CFCs in the tax-based test. Comment The New Zealand taxpayer may choose to consolidate certain CFCs for the purpose of the tax-based active business test. This is purely optional. There is no requirement in section EX 21D that the CFCs are also consolidated for financial reporting purposes. However, section EX 21D(1)(c) states that if CFCs are consolidated for tax purposes, the tax consolidation must use uniform accounting policies for similar transactions and for other events in similar circumstances. “Accounting policies” in this context means tax accounting choices, but officials accept that this may be unclear and should be clarified. As an example of an accounting policy choice in the context of the tax-based active business test, two CFCs to be consolidated might be parties to the same financial arrangement. Both would need to use the same option for accounting for that arrangement under subpart EW. 30 In other words, section EX 21D(1)(c) is an explanation of how the tax consolidation is to be done, rather than a requirement that there also be consolidation in financial accounts. (There are existing tax consolidation rules in the Income Tax Act 2007, but they relate to New Zealand-resident companies, are relatively complex, and have specifically not applied to CFCs in the past.) Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part, and that the meaning of “accounting policies” in the context of the tax-based test should be clarified. Issue: Treatment of nil income in the active business test Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 53 – Ernst & Young, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 68 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Businesses should not fail the active business test merely because they have nil income. There should be consistent treatment in both the tax-based and accounting- based tests. Comment Sections EX 21D(2)(b) and EX 21D(3)(f) effectively treat a CFC as not being an active business if the denominator in the tax-based test statistic – passive income divided by total income – is nil. Submissions argue that this should not happen. With the current active business test based on gross amounts (no losses or expenses are taken into account) passive income should never be less than total income. Therefore, total income can only be nil if active income is also nil, unless there is an unexpected oversight in the rules. If active income and passive income are both nil, there is a strong likelihood that the entity is dormant. It is therefore not engaged in an active business. There will probably, but not definitely, be no passive income to attribute. 5 It should not be hard to determine this. If there is an unexpected oversight in the rules, it is intended that a full tax calculation should be undertaken. Example A CFC has no income (no gains on financial arrangements and no other income). It does not pass the active business test, since it has no active business. The attribution calculation in this case is trivial – the CFC has nil passive income under section EX 20B. 5 If a CFC is allowed deductions under section EX 21D there may be a net attributed loss. 31 Sections EX 21E(2)(c) and EX 21E(4)(h) effectively treat a CFC as not being an active business if the denominator in the accounting-based test statistic is nil. The same arguments apply in this case, but are academic if other submissions relating to the use of net amounts (bringing in some losses) are accepted. In that case, both passive income and total income can be nil or negative, and different rules are required. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Removal of minority interest in consolidation for the test Submissions (32 – KPMG, 35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Minority interests should not have to be removed when consolidating CFCs for the active business test, or alternatively should not have to be removed unless they are substantial. The term “minority interest” is inappropriate in the tax test. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment Section EX 21D allows the consolidation of certain CFCs for the purpose of the tax- based active business test. Section EX 21E allows similar consolidation for the purposes of the accounting-based active business test. Minority interests are removed to prevent the sheltering of passive income by a larger amount of active income that is not truly referable to the taxpayer undertaking the consolidation. All minority interests are required to be removed. Having a minimum threshold would facilitate a certain level of sheltering of passive income, which is not the intention of the new rules. The term “minority interest” is a financial accounting term. Removal of the minority interest means that only part of the CFC’s income is included in the test. For the purposes of the tax test, the part of the CFC’s income to be included is the part that relates to the person’s income interest. Officials recommend that the tax-based test be altered to use the term “income interest”. By definition, no removal of any minority interest will be necessary when the CFCs to be consolidated are 100 percent owned by a single entity, as will commonly be the case. When there is a minority interest, explicitly requiring its removal provides more certainty than a specific anti-avoidance rule (such as a rule that requires removal of the interest only when there is an overriding intent to shelter passive income). 32 We are not aware of any specific examples where removal of a minority interest would be impractical. However, if explicit removal proves too difficult, it is noted that consolidation of CFCs is not compulsory. No removal of minority interests is necessary if there is no consolidation, since the test statistic is unaffected by the income interest of the taxpayer. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part, by replacing the test based on “minority interest” with one based on “income interest”. Issue: Conversion of foreign currency amounts into presentation currency in the accounting-based test Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The rules for currency conversion when using consolidated accounts in the accounting-based active business test should be alternatives (use average rates for the period or rates specified by the applicable standard). Comment Most entities within a jurisdiction will use the same functional currency (often the local currency), but in a minority of situations this may not be the case. When accounts of different entities are consolidated using IFRS, and those entities have different functional currencies, foreign exchange differences will arise when amounts are translated from those functional currencies into a common presentation currency. 6 To avoid these differences contaminating the active business test, section EX 21E(4)(g) specifies conversion of amounts from the functional currency to the presentation currency at an average exchange rate. That section also specifies that if amounts are to be converted into the functional currency before translation to the presentation currency, the normal rules in the applicable accounting standards apply to that earlier conversion. This is the intended treatment. The effect of translation from the functional to presentation currency at an average rate is that, in substance, the functional currency is always used. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 6 This can also occur if the entities have the same functional currency but a different presentation currency is chosen. 33 Issue: Worldwide consolidation of CFCs Submission (30 – Staples Rodway, 40 – Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, 68 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Worldwide consolidation for the 5 percent test (as opposed to the current jurisdictional approach) should be allowed. Comment Sections EX 21D(1) and EX 21E(2) allow CFCs to be consolidated for the active business test if certain requirements are met. One requirement is that the CFCs are resident in the same country or territory. The submission is that this requirement should be removed. Allowing worldwide consolidation would effectively sanction the sheltering of up to 5 percent of a group’s total income in tax havens. The ability to consolidate is not provided for this purpose. Rather, consolidation is allowed as a measure to reduce the costs of undertaking the active business test. Allowing worldwide consolidation also poses other problems. For example, a passive transaction between a CFC in a high tax jurisdiction and a CFC in a low tax jurisdiction could be tax deductible to the first CFC under the tax rules in its jurisdiction but not taxable to the second CFC under the different rules in its jurisdiction. Consolidation across countries would mean the New Zealand rules would “not see” the transaction and would ignore it, but it would have produced a tax advantage for the CFC. This would go further than the aim of the reform, which is to remove impediments to the global expansion of business from a New Zealand base. Instead, such consolidation would actively encourage “off-shoring” of domestic activity. Tax treatment is much more likely to be symmetrical between CFCs in the same jurisdiction. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 34 Issue: Requirement to have consolidated accounts to group CFCs in accounting-based test Submission (26 – Fonterra, 32 – KPMG, 68 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) CFCs should not need to be consolidated for financial reporting purposes in order to be grouped for the purposes of the accounting-based active business test. Comment Section EX 21E allows a taxpayer to consolidate certain CFCs into a “test group” for the purpose of the accounting-based active business test. This simplifies the application of the test when pre-prepared accounting information is available at a consolidated level, such as when a group produces segmental reporting by country. Section EX 21E(2)(a) requires that CFCs included in a test group are required to be consolidated under the applicable accounting standard. Section EX 21E(2)(d) requires that consolidated and audited accounts that comply with applicable standards are actually produced for the test group. The consolidation rules in both IFRS and old GAAP generally require consolidation of entities that are under common control. Since CFCs are, by definition, controlled by the taxpayer, it will be common for two CFCs of the taxpayer to be able to be included in a test group (when they are in the same country), as long as consolidated accounts are actually produced. There might be situations in which consolidated accounts that include the accounts of the test group and other entities are prepared. Information from these accounts is adequate for the purposes of the test. It is not a requirement that consolidated accounts be prepared for only the members of the test group. Officials recommend that this be clarified. There could also be situations in which the accounts from which information for the test is taken, are not required to be consolidated. For example, if an individual New Zealand resident directly owns two CFCs in a foreign country (not through a resident company, with neither CFC being a subsidiary of the other), IFRS accounts may be prepared for each CFC, but there is no reporting entity that would be required to produce IFRS consolidated accounts. This is in contrast to the cases in which (1) the New Zealand resident owns the CFCs through a resident company or (2) one of the CFCs owns the other. Officials would expect these situations to be relatively uncommon. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part, by clarifying that consolidated accounts prepared for a wider group than a test group are acceptable as a basis for consolidation of the relevant CFCs. 35 Issue: Consolidation and liability to tax in the foreign country Submission (Matter raised by officials) Consolidation for the purposes of the active business test should be allowed only for CFCs that are liable to tax in the same jurisdiction. Comment CFCs may be consolidated for the purpose of the active business test if certain conditions are met. One of those conditions is that: Each \[CFC to be consolidated is\] subject to the laws of the same country or territory under which— (i) the company is liable to income tax on its income because of its domicile, residence, place of incorporation, or centre of management \[and/or\] (ii) persons holding income interests in the company are liable for the income tax on its income and the country or territory is the source of 80% or more of that income” (see sections EX 21D(1)(a) and EX 21E(2)(b)). We consider that the second limb of the residence test in the definition should be removed. If it remains, income of an active business may not be taxed in any jurisdiction. The same general issue is discussed in further detail in the recommendations on attributable income (see “Holding company exemptions and liability to tax in the foreign country”). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Currency of CFCs when consolidating for the purposes of the test Submission (Matter raised by officials) Consolidation should be possible only when consolidating entities have the same functional currency (in the accounting-based active business test) or the same currency under section EX 21(4) (in the tax-based active business test). Comment Taxpayers are permitted to consolidate certain CFCs in the same jurisdiction for the purposes of the active business test. 36 When using the tax-based test, CFCs will be required to choose a currency conversion rule according to sections EX 21(4) and EX 21(7), if an earlier recommendation of officials is accepted. If CFCs that choose different methods are allowed to consolidate, currency differences can arise when transactions between the entities are eliminated. This could bias the test. It might also be possible to manipulate the test by a suitable choice of reporting currency (indeed, this has happened in the past in a different context, leading to the enactment of section EX 21(7)). When using the accounting-based test, CFCs will use their functional currencies, being the currencies of their primary economic environments. As with the tax-based test, when eliminating transactions between entities with different functional currencies, exchange rate differences can arise that can bias the test. There is less risk of manipulation of the test when functional currencies are used, but there is still the possibility of setting up a special-purpose entity with a particular functional currency. Officials acknowledge that there may be situations in which the recommended limitation means CFCs in a jurisdiction cannot be consolidated. It is hoped that CFCs operating in the same country will usually make the same choice of currency conversion rule, or use the same functional currency. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Currency of entities when using the tax-based test and grouping CFCs Submission (32 – KPMG) CFCs should be able to designate a common functional currency for a “test group”, when consolidating for the purposes of the tax-based active business test. Comment The submission argues that when CFCs in the same jurisdiction have different functional currencies, the taxpayer should be able to designate a common functional currency to enable consolidation. The use of a “functional currency”, with the definition of this term being similar to the definition under IFRS, was intended to prevent a CFC from freely choosing a currency and instead requires it to use the currency of its primary economic environment. This was aimed at preventing the exploitation of exchange rate movements by a calculated choice of currency. Allowing the test group to freely choose a currency would be a move away from this principle. 37 Furthermore, even the restrictions imposed by a functional currency requirement are likely to be insufficient to prevent problems. Therefore, and in response to another submission, officials have recommended that the existing currency conversion rules in section EX 21(4) be used instead of the rules in the bill. Officials have also recommended, in another submission, that CFCs only be allowed to consolidate when they use the same currency under section EX 21(4). Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Gains and losses of financial instruments / arrangements in the test Submissions (30 – Staples Rodway, 32 – KPMG, 40 – Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 68 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Both gains and losses on financial instruments / arrangements should be included in the test calculations. Alternatively, foreign exchange gains should not be included. Comment Some submissions relate to the tax-based active business test. The current drafting delivers the intended result in the case of that test. For a particular financial arrangement, there is either income for the period (typically taxable) or expenditure for the period (typically deductible), never both. Income is brought in under section EX 20B(4). Expenditure (including losses on financial arrangements) is brought in under section EX 20C. This is in line with the general scheme of the Income Tax Act, which requires calculation of income and deductions separately. The rules in section EX 20B are also used for calculating passive income in the tax- based active business test (as recommended in another of the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants’ submissions). In this case, recognising only income and not expenditure gives a better indication of the character of a business. For example, a CFC that trades derivatives as its only business could make a net loss on those trades, comprising gains on some and larger losses on others. The fact that it has made a net loss overall does not change the fact that it is engaged in a primarily passive business. The drafting of section EX 20B(4) would pick up the gains only, and so the CFC would not pass the active business test. As a positive side-effect, the CFC would then be able to calculate a loss – using both sections EX 20B(4) and EX 20C – to carry forward and offset against future passive income. In respect of the accounting-based active business test, officials have made another submission that, if accepted, would allow net amounts to be used (that is, net of losses). This concession is made solely to enable the use of summary accounting information, such as an “interest revenue” figure in the income statement that includes a hedge gain or loss. When the tax-based test is used, the concession is not appropriate. 38 Foreign exchange gains on financial instruments or arrangements do need to be included in the measure of passive income. Otherwise there would be incentives to invest in assets denominated in certain low-interest rate currencies, substituting interest income (which would be passive income) for expected exchange rate gains (which would not). Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Removing expenditure or loss from measures of income in the test Submission (53 – Ernst & Young, 68 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Proposed subparagraph EX 21D(5)(c)(i) should be deleted because the test is based on gross amounts. Comment In the tax-based active business test, only income is included (there is no “netting off” with expenditure and losses). Section EX 21D(5)(c)(i) then requires the removal of any expenditure or losses. The submission is correct in its assumption that there should be no expenditure or loss. However, the provision should remain. It is a revenue-protection measure, intended to apply if expenditure or loss has mistakenly slipped into the measure of passive income under the tax-based active business test. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Inclusion of gains on financial instruments in accounting-based test Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Proposed section EX 21E(7)(f) should be removed from the draft legislation. Comment Section EX 21E(7)(f) includes in passive income, for the purposes of the accounting- based active business test, gains from a non-derivative financial asset. 39 The submission argues that these gains should not be included because they are notional accounting entries rather than actual income and should not cause taxpayers to fail the active business test. Officials disagree. Many of the gains on financial assets taken into account under financial accounting standards are also taken into account in the financial arrangement rules in the Income Tax Act, and under the tax-based active business test. Indeed, the default treatment under the financial arrangement rules is based on IFRS (financial accounting) treatment. The rule only applies to financial assets such as loans to other parties, and most active businesses are unlikely to hold large quantities of such assets, particularly once the optional exclusions in section EX 21E(9) (which allows certain related-party transactions to be removed) are taken into account. Gains on financial liabilities, such as foreign exchange gains on loans taken out by firms to finance their active businesses, are not included. Gains on share investments are also not included, unless the shares are held on revenue-account. The tax-based active business test may be used as an alternative if it provides a more favourable outcome for a particular taxpayer. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Gains on derivatives in the measure of total income in the test Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 68 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) When calculating the denominator in the formula, income from derivatives should generally be included. Comment Officials agree with the submission. Derivative gains or losses should be included in total income (the denominator) when the derivative is hedging other components of total income, 7 is not entered into in the ordinary course of business or is held for a business of dealing. 7 Total income incorporates passive income, so gains or losses on derivatives that hedge other components of passive income are also included here. 40 The recommended treatment would still exclude some gains or losses on derivatives that are entered into in the ordinary course of business. For example, a floating-for- fixed interest rate swap on interest payable would be excluded, since no account is taken of borrowing by the CFC, or derivatives hedging that borrowing, for the purposes of the active business test. This is appropriate. Bringing in such gains or losses would effectively be importing expenses (or financial liability movements) into the test. Expenses (and financial liabilities) are not included in the test measures of income because they are not good indicators of the character of a business; even active businesses must pay “passive” expenses such as rent, royalties and interest to carry on their trade. It should normally be straightforward to separate hedges of income and financial assets from hedges of expenses and financial liabilities, since the risks applying to the first category will normally be opposite to those in the second category. Officials have made separate submissions on the treatment of derivatives that hedge items in different classes, and on the treatment of the ineffective portion of a hedge. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and that it be noted that officials have made related submissions. Issue: Hedges of both passive income and other income in the active business test Submission (Matter raised by officials) Where a derivative is in a hedging relationship with passive (or total) income and other items, gains or losses on the derivative should be apportioned on a fair and reasonable basis. Comment The active business test brings in, as passive income, gains on any derivative that is in a hedging relationship with passive income. This could bring in a gain on a derivative that hedges both active and passive income. For example, a business might hedge all foreign-currency receipts – whether sales, rent, royalty or interest receipts – against exchange rate movements using a single derivative. The rule could also bring in a derivative that hedges passive income and something that is neither passive nor total income (such as an exempt dividend). Officials recommend that in this situation, the portion of the gain or loss attributable to a hedging relationship with something that is not passive income, be removed. The calculation of the portion should be done on a fair and reasonable basis, as shown in the example below. 41 A similar issue applies to a derivative in a hedging relationship with total income, because the derivative could simultaneously be in a hedging relationship with something that is not total income (such as an exempt dividend). Officials recommend that the portion of the gain or loss attributable to a hedging relationship with something that is not total income, be removed. The adjustments increase the complexity of the test, but for at least some CFCs, not having the adjustment would incorrectly cause them to fail the accounting-based test when they have “active” derivative gains. In some cases, it could also allow CFCs to shelter passive income when they have “active” derivative losses. The adjustment is not optional, since an optional adjustment would be a “one-way bet” – taxpayers would only use it to take out an “active” gain which artificially increases passive income, and would not use it to remove an “active” loss which artificially lowers passive income. Officials do not expect the situation to arise often in practice, or for the amounts involved to be crucial to passing the test for a CFC carrying on an active business. This is simply because a CFC carrying on an active business will not usually have much passive income to hedge. An active CFC will not normally be receiving significant amounts of interest income or holding many non-derivative financial assets. An active CFC is more likely to receive royalty or rental income, but there are significant carve-outs from passive income for these items if they are received in the course of an active business. The adjustment would not apply when the derivative is entered into outside the ordinary course of business or held for dealing, since the entire gain or loss should be passive income. For example, if a person takes out a foreign exchange contract to exchange NZD for US$10 million but only expects to have USD income of $1 million, there is a strong case for arguing that the derivative is not entered into in the ordinary course of business or is held for dealing. Example A CFC expects to have active sales income of US$10 million, passive royalty income of $1 million and USD-denominated expenses of US$6 million in a period. It takes out a forward exchange rate contract to hedge net exposure of US$5 million to exchange rate changes over the period. The forward exchange rate is USD0.50/NZD1.00. The CFC actually receives US$9 million of sales income and US$2 million of royalty income, and has US$6 million of USD-denominated expenses during the period. The spot exchange rate throughout the period and on maturity of the contract is USD0.60/NZD1.00. There is a hedge gain of NZ$1.67 million. The derivative is effectively in a hedging relationship with the portion of income that is not naturally hedged by expenses. The income is made up of active income (nine-elevenths) and passive income (two-elevenths). A reasonable apportionment would therefore attribute NZ$1.36 million (9 ÷ 11 × 1.67 million) of the gain on the derivative to a hedging relationship with something that is not passive income. NZ$1.36 million would be removed from passive income. Other reasonable apportionments may exist Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 42 Issue: Treatment, in the test, of hedges that are not fully effective Submission (Matter raised by officials) This submission explains the treatment of the ineffective portion of hedges because the rules in this area may not have been clearly understood. This submission does not result in any recommendation to change the rules. Comment Gains on a derivative that is in a hedging relationship with passive (or total) income are themselves passive (or total) income. When a derivative is in a hedging relationship with passive (or total) income, it may not be fully effective. For example, a forward exchange rate contract might be taken out by a US CFC to exchange AUD for USD, and this might be used to hedge sales denominated in both AUD and NZD. It could be highly effective, given the normally close relationship between the AUD and NZD, but would not be fully effective if the AUD/NZD exchange rate did not remain constant. Some submissions have requested an explanation of the treatment of the ineffective portion of hedges in the active business test. The current wording of provisions in the bill brings in, as passive or total income (as applicable), the ineffective portion of gains or losses on derivatives that are in a hedging relationship, as well as the effective portion. Another provision removes the ineffective portion from total income, but if officials’ other submissions are accepted, that provision will be removed. Example A CFC hedges forecast passive royalty income of US$100 million against USD/NZD exchange rate movements, using a forward exchange contract. The forward exchange rate is 0.50. The spot exchange rate when the royalty payment is received, and on maturity of the contract, is 0.80. The forecast turns out to have been incorrect, and actual royalties are only US$90 million, which is NZ$112.5 million on conversion into New Zealand dollars at the spot rate. There is a gain on the derivative of NZD$75 million, of which $67.5 million is attributable to the hedging relationship with the royalty and $7.5 million is attributable to the ineffective portion of the hedge. The entire gain on the derivative, being NZ$75 million, is included in passive income. The ineffective portion of gains or losses on derivatives that are in a hedging relationship will often but not always appear, in financial statements, in a different line item from the effective portion. This is a function of accounting policy choices as well as applicable standards. The examples below assume typical accounting policy choices. 43 Examples 1. A CFC hedges passive royalty income against exchange rate movements using a derivative. The hedge qualifies for hedge accounting under IFRS and hedge accounting is used. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is combined with royalty income in a “royalties” line in the financial statements. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss, if any, appears in a “net gains and losses on derivative instruments” line. 2. A CFC hedges passive royalty income against exchange rate movements using a derivative. Hedge accounting is not used, perhaps because the CFC does not wish to incur the costs of complying with documentation requirements for hedge accounting. The total gain or loss on the derivative appears in a “net gains and losses on derivative instruments” line. When the ineffective portion of the hedge is not in a separate line item from the effective portion, the provisions in the bill impose no cost. When the ineffective portion of the hedge is in a separate line item, there is a potential cost of having to pick this out. However, in most cases, hedges taken out by an active business are likely to be highly or even 100 percent effective. In such cases, the ineffective portion will be small relative to other amounts and will only be of importance if the test statistic (passive income divided by total income) is close to the 5 percent threshold. This will reduce the number of situations in which additional costs are incurred in making the calculation. At a certain point of ineffectiveness, the derivative would cease to be in a hedging relationship at all. Gains on the derivative could still be passive income, however, because the derivative could be held for speculative purposes (not entered into in the ordinary course of business) or for dealing. For example, taking out exchange rate cover well in excess of expected foreign exchange receipts would be a speculative transaction. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Passive income received from other CFCs should be part of total income Submission (53 – Ernst & Young) Proposed section EX 21D(5)(c)(ii) should be deleted. Comment Section EX 21D(5)(c)(ii) removes certain interest, rent or royalties that are received from a CFC in the same jurisdiction and therefore are not attributable income. 44 The submission is correct that these items should remain in the measure of total income in the active business test. Officials recommend that the provision be deleted, but note that these items will in some cases be brought in anyway by section EX 21D(5)(c)(iii), which is required to prevent manipulation of the test. Recommendation That the recommendation be accepted. Issue: Elimination of inter-company transactions in the test Submission (32 – KPMG, 35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) There are provisions to eliminate transactions that are made for the purpose of increasing the denominator (measure of total income) in the test. These should be clarified. Comment Section EX 21D(5)(c)(iv) removes certain amounts from total income (the denominator) in the tax-based active business test, if they arose from a supply that was made for the purposes of increasing the denominator. In general the rule applies to cross-border transactions; a separate rule deals with most transactions between entities in the same jurisdiction. Section EX 21E(12)(j) is the equivalent of section EX 21D(5)(c)(iv) in the accounting-based active business test. These are anti-avoidance rules, to prevent CFCs from artificially boosting total income to pass the test, by repeatedly selling goods or services to each other. Most supplies between CFCs in different jurisdictions will boost measured income of the supplier. However, the intent is that the rule should apply only if the sale took place in order help the CFC pass the active business test. The wording in the bill limits application of the anti-avoidance provision to situations in which the supply was made for the purposes of increasing the denominator in the test statistic. If the supply was not made for that purpose, then even though an ancillary outcome of the supply is that the denominator rises, the supply is not caught by the rule. PricewaterhouseCoopers also argues that the use of the term “supply” could be confusing because it has a specific meaning in the GST Act. The term is used because – in its ordinary meaning – it captures a wide range of income-generating activities. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 45 Issue: Income from the disposal of revenue account property Submission (Matter raised by officials) In the active business test, only the gain on disposal of property, rather than the gross proceeds, should be included in passive income. Comment The gross proceeds from the sale of certain revenue account property are passive income under section EX 20B(3)(j). They are therefore also passive income under the tax-based and accounting-based active business tests (see section EX 21E(8)(c) for the latter). If a taxpayer has to attribute CFC income (if they do not pass the active business tests) a deduction will typically be available under section EX 20D for the cost of the property, and this will be deducted from the gross proceeds in determining the amount to attribute. However, the active business tests themselves currently do not take account of the deduction. The use of gross rather than net proceeds in the test is consistent with the general approach, which is to use gross amounts for the tests. Expenses are not inherently active or passive and so do not provide a good indication of the character of a business. However, the property referred to in section EX 20B(3)(j) is often likely to be high- value property. This means that a normally active business that happens, in a particular year, to sell such property could easily fail the active business test even though its (net) economic gain from the sale is small. To avoid this situation, we recommend that – at the option of the taxpayer – the income recognised in the active business test (via section EX 20B(3)(j)) may be reduced by a deduction for the cost of the property that would be available under section EX 20D. The income would not be able to be reduced below zero (no losses on sale would be included). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 46 Issue: Personal services income earned through CFCs Submission (Matter raised by officials) Businesses should not be eligible to use the active business test if they have certain personal services income. Comment Certain income from personal services is passive income under section EX 20B(3)(h). The provision applies when more than 80 percent of the CFC’s income is from personal services income performed by a person who is associated with the CFC, the CFC has few fixed assets, and the services are not essential support for a product supplied by the CFC. In substance, the section applies only when the CFC is a vehicle for a person’s personal services income and has no other substantial business. In the bill as it stands, the active business test can still be used for a CFC that has this type of income. This is inappropriate, because the active business test and the active income exemption are not intended to benefit entities that are set up to shelter personal services income earned by New Zealand residents from New Zealand taxation. Officials recommend that an entity with such income not be eligible to be an active business. In any case, a CFC with such income would be unlikely to pass the active business test, even if it were eligible to use it. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Use-of-money interest if tax underpaid or overpaid on passive income Submission (32 – KPMG) That passive income should be excluded from the use-of-money interest rules imposed on under or overpayments of provisional tax. Comment It is a fundamental feature of the income tax framework in New Zealand that use-of- money interest is charged by Inland Revenue on underpayments of tax and paid by Inland Revenue on overpayments of tax. 47 Businesses sometimes have to forecast their tax liability to avoid this interest – for example, when they pay provisional tax – and this involves some uncertainty. However, without the imposition of interest in the event of under-forecasting, there would be little incentive for a business to forecast correctly, and there would be less tax collected (in a present-value sense). Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Alignment of passive income and attributed CFC amount Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The rules for determining passive income for both the CFC attributable amount and the threshold tests should be aligned. Comment Taxpayers can choose between two threshold tests, one that uses tax rules to calculate income, and one that uses financial accounts and financial reporting concepts. The attributable CFC amount, being an amount of income that is subject to tax, is only calculated if the CFC fails the threshold test. If the CFC passes the test, there is no taxable amount. If the taxpayer uses the test based on financial accounts and the taxpayer fails the test, the taxpayer must calculate the attributable CFC amount using tax rules. It would be inappropriate for an accounting measure of passive income to be used once tax is determined to be chargeable. The threshold test that uses tax rules has two components, being passive income and gross income. Passive income for the test is calculated in the same way as the attributable CFC amount, with two differences. The first difference is that the test measure must be calculated using the functional currency of the CFC, whereas the attributable CFC amount is calculated using existing tax principles. These existing tax principles allow the use of either New Zealand dollars for all calculations, or the currency of the CFC’s financial accounts for all calculations except some involving high-value financial arrangements. If the currency of the CFC’s financial accounts is used, the end result of the calculations is translated into New Zealand dollars using an average exchange rate. Officials have identified a problem with the use of the CFC’s functional currency in the threshold test. This relates to financial arrangements denominated in a currency other than the functional currency. The problem would be resolved in the tax-based test by the use of the existing tax principles. Therefore, officials recommend that the same currency rules – using existing tax principles – be used for both the tax-based 48 threshold test and the calculation of the attributable CFC amount. This recommendation, if accepted, would lead to a result that is consistent with the submission. The second difference between the test and the attributable CFC amount calculations relates to consolidation. In some circumstances, there is an option to consolidate CFCs for the purposes of the test. However, CFCs are never consolidated for the purposes of calculating an attributable CFC amount. Rules are provided to ensure that optional consolidation for the test is undertaken using consistent accounting policies. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part. The calculation of passive income under the tax-based threshold test should be more closely aligned with the calculation of the attributable CFC amount, by removing the special currency rules used in the test and allowing existing tax principles to apply. Issue: Treatment of income from agency relationships Submission (32 – KPMG) The treatment, in the active business test, of income from agency relationships should be clarified. Comment A business may act as an agent for certain payments. For example, a business might receive, and pay on to a property investor, rental income. KPMG recommends that income from such agency relationships be “netted off” against related expenses to avoid inflating the measure of passive income. As noted in the submission on “netting off” of derivative and non-derivative financial asset gains and losses, the active business test is primarily a test based on gross amounts. Where an entity is receiving significant amounts of passive income, “clipping the ticket”, and passing the income on, it appears to fall into the category of businesses that should be classified as passive – those generating income that is not tied to any particular jurisdiction and could be easily relocated to a low-tax country. The fact that the entity then has deductions will mean profit is lower than income, but does not change the nature of the income. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 49 Issue: Resident CFCs Submission (30 – Staples Rodway) The active income exemption should apply to a CFC that is resident in New Zealand by virtue of having its centre of management here. Comment By definition, a company cannot be a CFC if it is resident in New Zealand. Resident companies will continue to be subject to New Zealand tax on their worldwide income, in line with international norms. A company’s place of management is an appropriate and internationally accepted criterion for determining its resident status. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Non-attributing Australian CFCs – hybrid entities Submission (53 – Ernst & Young) The definitions of “company”, “CFC”, “controlled foreign company” and “resident in Australia” should be reviewed to see if they require amendment along similar lines to the amended definition of “grey list company” introduced by clause 409(59). Comment Clause 409(59), which introduces a new definition of “grey list company”, is a remedial amendment. It picks up a change made to the Income Tax Act 2004 as part of the rules for foreign hybrids introduced by the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006. Specifically, section EX 24(1) of the Income Tax Act 2004 was amended by the 2006 Act to allow foreign hybrid CFCs to qualify as being “resident” in a grey list country, despite not being liable to tax there. This change was incorrectly omitted from the Income Tax Act 2007. We understand that the primary concern behind this submission is that a similar provision catering for foreign hybrid CFCs has not been included in new section EX 22 (Non-attributing Australian CFCs). Thus, an entity such as an Australian unit trust, which is a company (and therefore potentially a CFC) under New Zealand law but fiscally transparent in Australia, could not qualify as a non-attributing Australian CFC. 50 The reasons for the repeal of the grey list are well discussed elsewhere in this report. In particular, the government is concerned that passive income may not always be comparably taxed in grey list jurisdictions. This concern arises, in particular, when hybrid entities and/or financial instruments are involved. The purpose of the new exemption under section EX 22 for Australian CFCs is to limit the compliance costs for small to medium-sized active businesses expanding into Australia, which would otherwise be associated with repeal of the grey list. In the event that a business moves into Australia using a hybrid structure, we consider it appropriate to apply the active business test in the usual way. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Section EX 21E – drafting Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The amendment to section EX 21E(13) is unnecessary. Comment Clause 122(8) purports to replace section EX 21E(13)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007 with an identical paragraph. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and clause 122(8) be omitted from the bill. Issue: Miscellaneous drafting issues Submissions (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 68 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The rule in section EX 21D(5)(c)(iv) should be moved to subpart GB, because it is an anti-avoidance rule. Section EX 21C(2) could be better worded to simply state NZ GAAP. This term (NZGAAP) includes compliance with IFRS. The term “test group” should be defined in the legislation for the purposes of proposed section EX 21C. 51 In proposed section EX 21C(6), in the opening sentence the words “apply with” should be changed to either “comply with” or, alternatively, the word “with” should be deleted. Section EX 21C(6)(b) should be reworded as it contains a double negative which makes it difficult to understand. The reference to “test group” before sections EX 21D(3) and EX 21E(4) should be removed because those sections apply to individual CFCs as well as test groups. We submit that the terms “operating lease” and “finance lease” should be removed from the list of defined terms in proposed section EX 21E. Comment A general review of the drafting of the bill is being undertaken and these submissions will be considered as part of that review. It is not considered that they raise issues of policy. Recommendation That the submissions be noted, and considered as part of the review of the drafting of the bill. Issue: CFCs resident in Australia – Australian exemption and consolidated groups Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) For a CFC to qualify for the Australian exemption it must be subject to tax on its income in Australia. This creates an issue for CFCs which are part of an Australian consolidated group as technically only the head member of that group is subject to tax. The “subject to tax” requirement needs to be amended to accommodate CFCs which are part of a consolidated group. Comment Australia’s consolidated group rules treat a subsidiary company as part of the head company of the group. This may create an issue as a CFC has to be subject to tax on its income. The requirement should be redrafted to ensure that CFCs that are part of consolidated groups can ordinarily qualify for the Australian exemption. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and the subject to tax requirement be redrafted. 52 Issue: Australian exemption and offshore branches Submissions (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Section EX 22(1)(b)(i) denies the Australian exemption to CFCs which have benefited from a tax concession for income derived from business activities carried on outside Australia. This would deny the exemption in cases where the Australian CFC has foreign branch operations, holds an interest in a foreign hybrid vehicle, or receives non-portfolio dividends from overseas. For these reasons the exclusion should be omitted. If the exclusion is kept it should be modified so that it applies only to a CFC’s overseas operations. This would save compliance costs as it would mean that the Australian CFC will only need to take into account its offshore business income (that is, it could disregard Australian-sourced income) when performing the active business test. Alternatively, it should be modified so that “outside Australia” is replaced with “outside Australia and New Zealand”. This would mean that Australian CFCs which only had branches in New Zealand would still be able to access the Australian exemption. This is appropriate as New Zealand taxes the income of a New Zealand branch. Comment This exclusion to the Australian exemption duplicates the conditions that must be met for the existing grey-list exemption to apply. The existing conditions have not been a reported source of difficulty for companies. The changes proposed by PricewaterhouseCoopers would allow income from activities carried out by an Australian business through a branch operation or hybrid vehicle (such as a limited liability company in the United States) that is located outside Australia to qualify for the exemption. This would effectively extend the Australian exemption to apply to income earned in other countries. It is only appropriate to exempt this income if it is active. Otherwise it would be possible for businesses to structure all of their passive income through branches of an Australian CFC to avoid attribution of this income. Australian CFCs with active offshore branches will be able to access the active income exemption and active business test and so there is no good case for granting them the Australian exemption. The existing grey list exemption applies to Australian CFCs which receive exempt foreign non-portfolio dividends. On this basis, CFCs which receive foreign non- portfolio dividends still should be able to qualify for the Australian exemption. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 53 Issue: Australian exemption drafting issue Submission (24A – New Zealand Law Society, 26 – Fonterra, 35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 53 – Ernst & Young, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 68 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Section EX 22(1)(a)(iii) needs redrafting as it is not in plain language style. It should be reworded as: not treated as being resident in a country other than Australia under an agreement between the government of Australia and the government of another country or territory that would be a double tax agreement if between the government of New Zealand and the government of the other country or territory; and Comment The reason for the current drafting (“treated... under no agreement”) was to ensure that CFCs with a link to a third country were still eligible for the exemption in situations where Australia did not have a double tax agreement with that third country. Nevertheless, officials agree that the suggested change is easier to read and should provide much the same outcome. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Scope of Commissioner’s determination for active insurance CFCs Submissions (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 73 – Seniors Money International) Insurance CFCs can apply for a Commissioner’s determination process that, if satisfied, would deem them to be a non-attributing (active) CFC. The determination process should be extended to cover financial institutions other than insurers, as like insurers, these companies cannot access the active income exemption as their core business income is passive. One requirement for the determination to be granted is that the insurance CFC had to exist before 1 October 2008. This requirement should be deleted as it would discourage insurance companies from expanding offshore by setting up a new CFC. The requirement is arbitrary in that it would disadvantage companies that establish new CFCs relative to companies which already own or that acquire an existing insurance CFC. If the requirement is retained, a grey-list exemption should be maintained for financial service CFCs. 54 Comment Financial CFCs are a special case because the types of income they generate from their core business activities (interest, premiums and investment income) are the same sorts of income that can be used to shift profits out of the New Zealand tax base (passive income). As a result of consultation, several offshore insurance businesses were identified that would face an adverse tax result if the conduit exemption were removed before an active income exemption was introduced for financial CFCs. It was not considered feasible to retain the grey list and conduit for just these entities. Similarly it would not be prudent to try to design special rules that modify the active income exemption rules to accommodate financial CFCs until after the rules were finalised for ordinary CFCs. The Commissioner’s determination is intended to provide limited, transitional relief to these existing insurance CFCs. Extending the Commissioner’s determination to other financial institutions would provide little additional benefit (given the lack of existing financial CFCs) but would require much more analysis and consultation. For example, we would need to develop a definition of a financial institution, which could be complex and would require consultation as part of an issues paper. In many respects it would duplicate the work required to develop a more robust exemption, namely adapting the definition of “passive income” for financial CFCs. The requirement that the insurance business must exist before 1 October 2008 is an additional safeguard to prevent taxpayers from structuring the exemption as a way to reduce their New Zealand tax liabilities. This safeguard is appropriate given that the measure would allow a CFC to have unlimited passive income. The purpose of the measure is only to provide transitional relief for existing insurance CFCs which would otherwise be required to attribute all of their income due to the repeal of the conduit and grey-list exemptions. It is not intended to facilitate offshore expansion by other financial businesses. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Clarification of how the Commissioner’s determination will work in practice Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Further guidance should be provided on how the Commissioner will exercise his discretion in determining if a CFC qualifies for the active income exemption. This guidance could be provided through a Tax Information Bulletin. 55 Comment Officials plan to prepare and release a Tax Information Bulletin clarifying how the Commissioner will apply the determination process for insurers. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Allowing the Commissioner’s determination for active insurance CFCs to be applied on a country-consolidated basis Submission (Deloitte – raised in correspondence with officials) As currently drafted, if an insurance company has more than one CFC in a jurisdiction, each of these CFCs must individually satisfy the Commissioner’s determination for insurance CFCs. Insurance companies should be able to apply for the determination on a country-consolidated basis. Comment This would be consistent with allowing taxpayers to consolidate their CFCs within the same country for the purposes of the active business test. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Excluding reinsurance from the Commissioner’s determination for active insurance CFCs Submission (Matter raised by officials) Reinsurance income should not count towards the requirement that the CFC generates all or nearly all of its income from premiums covering risks in its country of residence and from investment assets used to back the insurance. Comment Reinsurance is a contractual agreement that enables an insurer to offload its business risk. Reinsurance can be used to transfer risk and to alter the incidence of tax between jurisdictions or within jurisdictions, particularly where a captive insurer (related party) is involved. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 56 ATTRIBUTABLE INCOME Clauses 119 and 408 Overview The definition of “passive income” (referred to in the legislation as the “attributable CFC amount”) is central to the new CFC rules. The definition is applicable, in the first instance, in the active business test to decide whether a CFC is active or passive. If a CFC fails the active business test, then its passive income must be attributed to the New Zealand shareholders. The broad categories of passive income are as follows: • dividends; • interests; • royalties; • rents; • other passive income (income from offshore insurance businesses, life insurance policies, personal services and the disposal of revenue account property); • certain income related to telecommunications services; and • base company services income. Within these categories, however, exceptions apply when the income is associated with an active business and there is limited risk to the New Zealand tax base. Submissions were received on each of the categories of passive income. Issue: Passive dividends and treating a CFC as though it were a New Zealand resident Submissions (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 53 – Ernst & Young) The interaction between section EX 21(2) – which treats a CFC as though it were a New Zealand resident for the purposes of the Act – and sections EX 20B(3)(a) and (b) – which treat certain dividends as a component of passive CFC income – should be clarified. Specifically, section EX 20B(3)(a) appears unnecessary as these dividends will already be taxed under section CW 9 (which makes certain dividends received by a New Zealand company subject to income tax). 57 Section EX 20B(3)(b) – which treats as passive income any unimputed dividends paid by a company resident in New Zealand – should be amended so as to exclude dividends paid by CFCs. Comment Section EX 21(2) applies the Act as if a CFC were a New Zealand resident for the purposes specified in subsection (2). This does not mean that a CFC is actually a company resident in New Zealand, or that a CFC’s attributable income is the same as the income of a New Zealand company. Section EX 20B(3)(a) is necessary as dividends have to be a component of the attributable CFC amount in order to be attributed. Section EX 20B(3)(b) does not need to be amended as a CFC is by definition a company that is not resident in New Zealand. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: New Zealand dividends paid to a wholly owned CFC Submission (68 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Dividends paid by a New Zealand company to a CFC should be exempt if the CFC and the New Zealand company belong to the same wholly owned group (even if the dividend is unimputed). This would be consistent with the exemption for dividends paid within a wholly owned group of companies that are resident in New Zealand. Comment Dividends paid within a wholly owned group of New Zealand companies are currently exempt (even if unimputed). Otherwise two commonly owned companies would have to merge to make the payment free from tax. It is not appropriate to extend this treatment to wholly owned New Zealand CFCs as this would allow for structures whereby untaxed company profits could be distributed as unimputed dividends offshore (or routed back to New Zealand) with no tax impost. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 58 Issue: Defining “attributable CFC amount” (section EX 20B) Submission (62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) The definition of passive income (“attributable CFC amount”) set out in section EX 20B should not rely on the definition of “financial arrangement”. Comment The submission notes that the financial arrangement rules are designed to spread income and expenditure over the lifetime of an arrangement, rather than to distinguish between income of an active or passive nature. It further notes that certain passive assets (such as equity derivates) will not be treated as giving rise to passive income, whereas certain active assets are financial arrangements and therefore require specific exclusion. Interest income is one of the most common forms of passive income. The financial arrangement rules govern the taxation of income from debt (or equivalent) instruments. Accordingly, it is helpful to refer to those rules when defining “attributable CFC amount” in section EX 20B. We consider this approach, with specific exclusions, is as transparent and as easily understood as the alternative of relying on newly introduced concepts. The scope of the financial arrangement rules is broad and would generally encompass derivative instruments. Consequently, we have taken these rules as the starting point and then excluded certain arrangements when there is a policy rationale for doing so. The definition of “attributable CFC amount” is something that officials intend to monitor as the new rules are implemented. Modifications may be made over time. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Heading before section EX 20B(4) Submissions (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The heading before section EX 20B(4) should be amended – from “arrangement income” to “financial arrangement income” or “passive interest income”. 59 Comment Consideration will be give to whether there is any scope for simplifying or amending terminology used as part of a general review of the drafting of the international tax provisions in this bill. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Treatment of short-term sale and purchase agreements Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) A short-term sale and purchase agreement which the CFC has elected to treat as a financial arrangement under section EW 8 should not be dealt with along with other non-derivative financial arrangements under section EX 20B(4)(a) for the purposes of defining the attributed CFC amount. Comment The submission argues that short-term sale and purchase agreements should not be treated as passive income because such arrangements are closely linked to the trading activities of the business. While we can see that this argument has some merit, on balance, officials are inclined in the short term to stick with the current approach of treating such arrangements consistently with other financial arrangements. However, the definition of “arrangement income” is something that officials intend to monitor as the new rules are implemented, and modifications are likely over time. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Derivatives entered into in ordinary course of business Submission (68/68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) It is unclear what derivates are entered into in the ordinary course of business (section EX 20B(3)(b)(ii)). 60 Comment Income from derivates entered into in the ordinary course of business is not subject to attribution. The term “ordinary course of business” is not defined. However, its meaning has been discussed in an earlier commentary concerning the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards for taxation purposes, Tax Information Bulletin (Vol. 20, No. 3, April 2008). This provides some useful guidance. As that commentary noted: Facts and circumstances of a taxpayer’s business would determine whether a financial arrangement has been entered into in the ordinary course of the taxpayer’s business. For example, a taxpayer who borrows in a foreign currency, say in US dollars, to fund its subsidiaries in the US would most likely be considered to have entered into the loan as part of its ordinary course of business. A taxpayer who enters into a derivative contract to hedge a particular business risk would also be considered as having entered into the derivative contract in the ordinary course of its business. For example, an energy company may enter into contracts for differences to fix the price of electricity. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Derivatives hedging passive income Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The drafting of section EX 20B(3)(b)(iii) should be reconsidered. Comment Section EX 20B(3)(b)(iii) provides that income under a financial arrangement that is a derivative instrument forms part of the attributable CFC amount if it hedges “passive” income (that is, income that would form part of the attributable CFC amount under subsection (3) or subsection (4)(a)). The concern raised in the submission is that it is not clear what transactions this provision is intended to cover. Section EX 20B(3)(b)(iii) refers to the relevant accounting standard, New Zealand Equivalent to International Accounting Standard 39: Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. (Note that the reference needs to be amended from IFRS 39 to IAS 39.) The accounting standard notes that hedging relationships are of three types: • fair value hedge: a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment, or an identified portion of such an asset, liability or firm commitment, that is attributable to a particular risk and could affect profit or loss; 61 • cash flow hedge: a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that (i) is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability (such as all or some future interest payments on variable rate debt) or a highly probable forecast transaction and (ii) could affect profit or loss; and • hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation as defined in NZ IAS 21. A hedging relationship may exist under this standard even if hedge accounting does not apply. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but that section EX 20B (3)(b)(iii) be amended to refer to IAS 39 (rather than IFRS 39). Issue: Exception for non-derivative arrangement income from an associated non-attributing active CFC Submission (30 – Staples Rodway) The exception (from the attributable CFC amount) for non-derivative financial arrangement income between associated active CFCs should be extended to all associated active CFCs, regardless of whether they are resident in the same jurisdiction. Comment The bill ensures that the attribution rules do not interfere with holding company structures within a jurisdiction. Interest, royalty and rental income paid by associated non-attributing active CFCs resident in the same jurisdictions as the CFC receiving the payment is not attributable. This rule recognises that firms may prefer to concentrate ownership of intellectual property or capital in a holding company. Extending the exemption to transactions between CFCs in different jurisdictions would provide opportunities for firms to trap profits in low-tax jurisdictions, with risk to the domestic tax base. We note that firms may use intra-group financing arrangements, and that these may involve CFCs in different jurisdictions. Elsewhere in this report we have recommended that the rules about the treatment of interest expenditure in the calculation of net attributable CFC income or loss be amended, to allow adjustments for on-lending to associated CFCs, including CFCs in different jurisdictions. This will ensure that, to the extent funds are on-lent by a CFC to an associated CFC, the on-lending CFC will not face any restriction of its own interest deductions. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 62 Issue: Cash basis person’s rules Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The rules in section EX 20B should take into account clauses 109 to 114 of the bill, which introduce companies and trusts to the cash basis person’s rules in the financial arrangement rules. Comment The financial arrangement rules generally require that a party to an arrangement must recognise income and expenditure over its term using one of several spreading methods prescribed in the legislation. In this way, the rules prevent deferral of income or advancement of expenditure. On maturity or disposal of an arrangement, a base price adjustment is required. This identifies any income or expenditure that has not already been accounted for on accrual. A cash basis person is not required to apply a spreading method to their financial arrangements. They are still required to undertake a base price adjustment. To qualify for cash basis treatment, either a person must have income and expenditure under all financial arrangements of not more than $100,000, or the value of their financial arrangements must not exceed $1 million. In addition, the difference between accrual and cash treatment for the person must not exceed $40,000. Previously, only natural persons could normally qualify for the cash basis. Section 9 of the Taxation (Business Tax Measures) Act 2009, which replaces section 109 of the bill, amended section EW 54 so that trusts and companies could also qualify. A number of consequential amendments were also made. As a result of these changes, it is possible that a CFC could now qualify for cash basis treatment. This does not require any change to the provision made in section EX 20B about arrangement income to be included in the attributable CFC amount. The cash basis is intended to reduce compliance costs for taxpayers with limited financial arrangements by exempting them from the requirement to spread income and expenditure. It is not intended to remove income under financial arrangements from the tax base altogether. The Act clearly states, at section EX 55(2), that a cash basis person is not excused from the requirement to calculate a base price adjustment. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 63 Issue: Royalties from property owned by a New Zealand resident Submissions (22 – Les Mills International, 32 – KPMG, 65 – The Whyte Group) Royalties derived by an upper tier CFC from a lower tier CFC should qualify as “removed passive income” if the lower tier CFC derived the royalty income from an unrelated third party. Comment We agree that a royalty payment received by an upper tier CFC from a lower tier CFC should be treated as active income, as long as the royalty payment was derived from a non-related third party. There may be valid commercial reasons for one CFC to be the main CFC that returns the third party royalty payments back to the New Zealand resident company. The same treatment should also be extended to licence fee payments that do not fall within the definition of “royalty”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (67 – Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) In section EX 20B(5)(d)(i), it is unclear what is meant by the expression “owned by a New Zealand resident who is not treated as a non-resident under a double tax agreement”. The residence rules in a treaty should exist solely for the purposes of applying the terms of the treaty. Comment There are situations in which a taxpayer may be a resident of New Zealand under domestic tax law but treated as a non-resident under a double tax agreement. In those situations, New Zealand relinquishes to the other country its residence taxing right on royalty income derived by the taxpayer. The rationale behind the exclusion for certain royalties provided by section EX 20B(5)(d) is that the income is eventually being taxed in New Zealand. This would not be the case when a person qualified for relief as a non-resident under a double tax agreement. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 64 Issue: Widening the scope of the exemption by extending it to any member of the group in a jurisdiction Submission (32 – KPMG) The exclusions for royalties derived by CFCs should be relaxed so that the exemption from attribution extends to any members of the group (referred to as the “test group” for the 5 percent test) in the jurisdiction that earns royalties from intellectual property if any one of the CFCs in the group created, developed or added substantial value to intellectual property. Comment The concern with intellectual property is that it is inherently mobile and profits are easily shifted from a home jurisdiction or from a high-tax jurisdiction to a low-tax jurisdiction through the payment of deductible royalties. In New Zealand, this base maintenance concern is magnified by the absence of a general capital gains tax which would apply to gains on sale of intellectual property out of New Zealand. The international norm is to treat royalties from related and unrelated parties as passive income. The main exception is where there are genuine commercial reasons for the CFC to own the intellectual property, such as when the CFC has created, developed, or substantially enhanced the property. The United States also requires the CFC to have a pattern of activity with regard to the creation or enhancement of intellectual property. The proposals in the bill generally follow this international norm. In fact the bill goes further by exempting all royalties where the CFC created or substantially enhanced the property, regardless of whether the royalty comes from a related party in another jurisdiction. (The United States and Australia both limit their exception to royalties from unrelated parties.) Accordingly, the substance of the approach in the bill is that, provided the development of the intellectual property has a real connection with the jurisdiction through the CFC and has no prior connection to New Zealand, the royalty will not be attributable income. The submission seeks further relaxation of the test that requires proof of a connection with the jurisdiction by permitting the exemption to apply to any member of the group in the jurisdiction provided one member of the group created the intellectual property. Our concern is that, as a practical matter, if intellectual property is allowed to be detached from the originating CFC and shifted to other members of the group, the test will become unenforceable over time. We are also mindful of the fact that both Australia and the United States require the intellectual property to be owned by the CFC that produced, developed or enhanced the property before the exemption applies. We would not rule out recommending further relaxation of the rules once taxpayers and officials alike gain more experience with how the rules operate. However, we consider a cautious approach is appropriate at this stage. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 65 Issue: Pattern of activity and substantial value requirements for the exemption of royalties from attribution Submissions (65 – The Whyte Group, 67 – Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 68 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The requirement of a “pattern of activity” may penalise some CFCs that may not have the resources to undertake a “pattern of activity involving creating, developing or adding value to property that produces royalties”. Comment The bill follows the United States’ approach of requiring the CFC that creates/enhances intellectual property to demonstrate a pattern of activity in this regard. We recognise that the requirement to have a “pattern of activity” imposes an additional requirement that must be satisfied. The purpose of having this additional requirement is to ensure there is a genuine commercial rationale for the intellectual property having been developed by a CFC in that particular jurisdiction. This will buttress the requirement that the CFC must have created or enhanced the intellectual property in order to claim the exemption for the royalty. One submission suggested that we should take the Australian approach. The Australian rule does not have a “pattern of activity” requirement although it does require that the royalties are derived in the course of a business carried on by the CFC. On balance, we considered the United States approach was more certain in terms of the base protection policy objective we sought to achieve. That is, given the mobility of intellectual property, the “pattern of activity” requirement will ensure the intellectual property is located in the jurisdiction for legitimate commercial reasons. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Submission (34 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 68 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Further clarity should be provided as to the meaning of the terms “pattern of activity” and “substantial value” in proposed EX 20B(5). Comment The terms “pattern of activity” and “substantial value” are not defined in the bill. It is intended that these terms should take their ordinary meaning. This requirement is designed to ensure there is a genuine connection between the intellectual property and its location. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 66 Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) There is a mismatch between what the commentary to the bill states and what is actually in the draft legislation in regards to the criteria of “regularly engaged” and “pattern of activity” for some of the royalty exclusions under proposed section EX 20B(5). Comment The policy intent behind the draft legislation is to allow the exclusions under proposed section EX 20B(5) only if those CFCs that have a pattern of creating, developing or adding substantial value to property. The explanatory note in the bill used the term “regularly engaged” as a means of describing what was intended by the rule. The central idea is that the CFC should have a history of creating, developing or adding substantial value to property. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) It is unclear what is meant by the terms “created or developed” in the context of proposed sections EX 20B(5)(a), EX 20B(5)(a)(iii), EX 20B(5)(b) and EX 20B(5)(b)(iii). In particular, it is unclear whether the words are used in ejusdem generis or are they intended to import different things. If in the words are to be used in ejusdem generic then one expression is appropriate to convey the meaning. Comment These terms may overlap is some cases, but the terms “created” and “developed” do not have the same coverage, and to eliminate one or the other may narrow the scope of the section. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 67 Issue: Intellectual property linked to New Zealand Submission (65 – The Whyte Group) The submission is concerned about the requirement that royalties will be exempted from attribution only if the intellectual property producing the income has no prior link to New Zealand. Specifically, there are concerns as to the practicality of the definitional approach regarding property “linked to New Zealand”, especially with enforcing compliance. Furthermore, there is concern as to the indefinite link that is established between the property and New Zealand by the current draft definition. One submission suggested that there should be a time limit on the length of time intellectual property can be linked to New Zealand. Comment As a general comment, the new CFC rules are primarily concerned with protecting the New Zealand tax base. As in other countries, there is an emphasis in the rules on the requirement that the CFC have a role in creating, developing and enhancing the intellectual property. However, our rules go one step further in requiring that the intellectual property have no prior link to New Zealand. This requirement is needed because, unlike other jurisdictions, New Zealand has no general capital gains tax which would apply to transfers of intellectual property from New Zealand to a CFC. Our concern is that intellectual property could be created in New Zealand and then moved offshore once royalties are being generated. The bill takes a definitional approach in the “linked to New Zealand” concept in order to provide some guidance as to what it intended to be covered by this requirement. The definition is deliberately comprehensive, to cover any connection including when the property has been owned by a New Zealand resident or a New Zealand business, created or enhanced in New Zealand, or gave rise to a deduction against the New Zealand tax base in the acquisition or creation of the property. The submission is concerned that determining the existence of a link will be practically difficult, especially if intellectual property is subsequently used for the creation of other intellectual property in the CFC. Determining whether any of the criteria in the definition are met is largely a factual inquiry. Accordingly, determining whether the criteria have been triggered in a given situation will depend very much on the facts and circumstances of the situation. We do not agree with introducing a time limit for the linkage to New Zealand, after which the linkage would cease. Obviously, some intellectual property can have an enduring life. Furthermore, it would be hard to determine a period of time that would be suitable for all types of intellectual property. The submission suggests a “nil tax value” approach, but we do not think this is appropriate in a context of protecting the New Zealand tax base. 68 With time, as taxpayers and officials gain experience in applying the test, it will be possible to develop a greater appreciation of any compliance or administrative difficulties. The government will then be in a better position to address shortcomings in the rules with the benefit of this experience. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (65 – The Whyte Group) Taxpayers should have the option to elect to pay tax at the time of the transfer of property based on the property’s deemed market value – as an alternative to on-going attribution of royalties. In other words, if the taxpayer elected to pay the exit tax on the transfer of this property, the royalty from the property would no longer be attributable income of the CFC. Comment As mentioned in the submission, the officials’ issues paper, released in October 2007, addressed the question of a compulsory exit tax on transfers of intellectual property out of New Zealand. The option was rejected, primarily because it was thought undesirable to introduce a capital gains tax on an ad hoc basis for an isolated case as a result of the international tax reforms. Moreover, there were concerns about the substantial difficulties with valuation and determining the cost basis for intellectual property. These concerns hold – even for an elective regime. Indeed, we would be concerned about taxpayers self-selecting into the rule that gives the best tax result. Finally, we note that, implementing an elective exit tax option would require further policy analysis and design work and would not be possible in the timeframe of this bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 69 Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) In proposed section EX 20B(5) there should be an exclusion from the “property not linked to New Zealand” criteria for patents transferred to a CFC from New Zealand since these are taxed at the time of the transfer CFC. Comment The submission makes the comment that the sale of a patent is taxed in certain situations and that once it has been taxed, the intellectual property should be able to leave the New Zealand tax base. Examples of this are when the patent is held as revenue account property and is subsequently sold or the sale of a patent if the patent application with a complete specification is made after 21 June 2005. Officials agree that, on the face of it, there should be fewer policy concerns for intellectual property moving out of New Zealand if tax has been paid on its disposal. However, we consider this issue requires further consideration as part of phase 2 of the international tax reform. Recommendation That the submission be declined, and the issue considered as part of phase 2 of the international tax review. Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Proposed section EX 20B(9) defines property linked to New Zealand. However, the commentary is clear that the policy is intellectual property that had a prior link to New Zealand. If the tense is the past tense then that should be reflected in the principal sections in which the term is relevant. Comment In policy terms, the premise for taxing the royalty is because of a link to New Zealand in the creation of the underlying intellectual property. For the purposes of these proposed rules, the royalty continues to have a link to New Zealand. Officials do not think there is a need to change the proposed legislation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 70 Submission (65 – The Whyte Group) Royalties derived by CFCs from related parties located in the same jurisdiction should be exempt from attribution – even when the property is linked to New Zealand. The same exclusion should apply to royalties derived by CFCs from related parties located in another jurisdiction. Comment As mentioned above, the bill already goes further than the legislation of comparable jurisdictions in extending the active income exemption to royalties received by a CFC from a related party. However, for the reasons previously mentioned, we consider the requirement that the property has no connection to New Zealand is necessary to protect the New Zealand tax base. The same concerns arise regardless of whether the CFC receives the royalty from a related party (inside or outside the jurisdiction of a CFC) or a third party. While there may be good commercial reasons for some companies to move their intellectual property offshore, the risk to the New Zealand tax base is too great to remove the “property linked to New Zealand” requirement from the related parties active royalty exclusion. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The exclusion from the passive treatment of royalties in proposed section EX 20B(5) should reflect the fact that some types of intellectual property are location-specific. Patents for example, derive their legal existence from the jurisdiction in which the patent is registered. Comment Royalty income derived from intellectual property over which a patent is registered can already be excluded from passive income treatment under one of the four royalty exclusions in proposed section EX 20B(5). Officials do not think there should be a separate exclusion for the situation where the CFC has registered its patent over the intellectual property in its home jurisdiction. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 71 Issue: Definition of “royalty” Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The definition of “royalties” for the purposes of the passive income rules in proposed sections EX 20B(3)(d) and EX 20B(5) should exclude “assistance” given in circumstances when such “assistance” would constitute a royalty under section CC 9(2)(h) and the “royalty” to which it relates is itself excluded under proposed section EX 20B(5). Comment It is agreed that the current definition of “royalty” under section CC 9(2)(h) will capture payments for “assistance”. However, officials do not agree that payments for these types of service should be carved out from the general definition of “royalty”. In particular, it would be very difficult to determine which portion of the royalty income is for “assistance”. If the rest of the royalty income is passive, then taxpayers would have a natural incentive to over-allocate the receipt to the assistance portion of the payment. (Assistance is generally included in the meaning of “royalties” in double tax agreements specifically to address this concern.) Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Miscellaneous royalties drafting issues Submission (34 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The words “if such royalties were attributable CFC amounts” is confusing and should be removed from the proposed section EX 20B(5)(b)(i). In particular, the phrase is unnecessary as the CFC paying the royalty will not be attributing the amount but rather it will be an expense for that CFC. Comment There is an issue around the circularity of the active business test. For example, there can be situations where the status of the associated CFC cannot be determined as it needs to apply the same exclusions. Provisions were placed into each of the exclusions (royalties, rent and interest) so that when a CFC is trying to determine the status of an associated CFC in the same jurisdiction, it would do so without applying any of the exclusions to the associated CFC – that is, it will regard any royalties, rents or interest the associated CFC receives as passive income. 72 It is agreed that the phrase is confusing and unnecessary as such royalty payments will never be attributable amounts for the CFC that is paying the royalty under section EX 20B(5)(b)(i). Unless the wording relates to the CFC that is receiving the royalty payment, the requirement of “if such royalties were attributable CFC amounts” is irrelevant and more importantly, it does not make sense. Furthermore, the issue of circularity does not arise with this particular exclusion, the reason being that a CFC is able to exclude royalty payments it receives from a related CFC, regardless of whether the related CFC is active or passive. This is not the same for the other related party exclusions – rent, royalty and interest payments. A CFC’s ability to exclude one of those payments is dependent on the payor CFC being active. On that basis, it would appear that the words “if such royalties were attributable amounts” are unnecessary. Officials agree that the words “if such royalties were attributable CFC amounts” should be removed from the proposed section EX 20B(5)(b)(i). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (65 – The Whyte Group) The drafting of the royalty exclusions in section EX 20B(5) can be tightened to provide for the same exemptions in fewer subsections. The combined effect of subsections (a), (b) and (c) is effectively to exclude all royalty income derived by a CFC from property not linked to New Zealand where the CFC has added substantial value. Comment Different criteria apply to the different exemptions provided by subsections (a), (b) and (c) as set out in the proposed legislation. For example, there is an additional requirement of an arm’s length approach in subsection (b) which provides for an exemption for related party active royalties. To simplify the drafting of the exclusions as suggested in the submission would extend the exclusions beyond the policy intent. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 73 Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The commentary states that there are four types of royalty exceptions, one of which is the same jurisdiction active royalty exclusion. However, it is difficult to determine which subsection relates to the same jurisdiction active royalty exception. In particular, it does not appear that any of the four exceptions in proposed section EX 20B(5) contain a reference to royalties needing to be being paid within the same jurisdiction. Furthermore, even if the drafting of the section is accurate, it is not intuitive. Comment The same jurisdiction active royalty exclusion is contained in proposed section EX 20B(5)(c) of the draft legislation. The requirement for the royalty to be paid by a related party within the same jurisdiction is set out by the requirement of the royalty being paid “by a person who would be an associated non-attributing active CFC”. An associated non-attributing active CFC is defined in proposed section YA 1 to be a related CFC that is subject to the laws of the same country or territory as the other CFC. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Rent Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Proposed section EX 20B(6)(a) excludes rents from passive income when the rent is sourced in the country in which the CFC is subject to tax by reason of being resident in the country, or through domicile or incorporation, for example. It also includes circumstances when the owners of the CFC are liable to pay tax on the income derived by the CFC so long as 80 percent of the CFC’s income is derived within that jurisdiction. However, the bill commentary states that “rent from third parties will be treated as active income if it is derived from a lease of real or personal property in the same jurisdiction as the CFC”. The “liable to tax” test is not the same test as “derived from the same jurisdiction” test. Comment The intention is that this exclusion should apply to rent from property that is located in the jurisdiction of which the CFC is a resident. The core test for the residence of the CFC operates by reference to liability to tax (paragraph (i) of subsection (6)(a)). The “liable to tax” and “same jurisdiction” tests are therefore complementary. 74 Paragraph (ii) of subsection (6)(a) was intended to deal with hybrid entities that are fiscally transparent (and therefore not liable to tax) in the foreign jurisdiction. As discussed elsewhere in this report, officials no longer consider that the rules should try to cater for hybrid entity CFCs and it is therefore recommended that this paragraph be removed from the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. The removal of paragraph (ii), along with similar provisions, is covered by a separate recommendation. Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 68 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) In terms of the proposed section EX 20B(6) rents will not be passive income if they arise from property that is not land if the rent relates to property used in the same jurisdiction as the CFC. One submission suggests that cross-border rental income (excluding land and buildings) should not be included as passive income. There is a concern with the level of compliance cost for CFCs that are in one operating group having to keep track of the rental payments made within the operating group. Another submission questions how this exclusion will apply to personal property such as ships and aircraft and related property. Comment The exclusion under the proposed section EX 20B(6) applies only to the extent that the personal property is used in the same jurisdiction as the CFC. The policy intent behind the exclusion is that there should be a nexus between the jurisdiction in which the CFC is located and the source of income. The aim is to limit opportunities to shift rental income from New Zealand with consequential base maintenance risks. In the case of aircraft and ships, there simply is no nexus between the property and the jurisdiction in which the CFC is located. Accordingly, the exclusion from passive income will not apply. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 75 Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Proposed section EX 20B(6)(f) excludes rents from attributable CFC income when the rent is a royalty. There is a question is to application and effectiveness of the exclusion. Comment The definition of “rent” is wider than that of “royalty” and can cover the same things. The policy intent is that if an item of income falls within the definition of both rent and royalty, the royalty provisions, not the rent provisions, should apply to determine whether the income is attributable. It is for this reason that a royalty has been excluded from the rent provisions. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The reference to “licences” and “bailment” in proposed section EX 20B(3)(e) should be removed. Comment The reason for the inclusion of licences and bailment in the definition of rent is to mirror the definition of “lease” under section YA 1. However, it is not advisable to rely solely on the definition of lease as the current drafting is clearer in what constitutes a rent for the purposes of the proposed CFC rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 76 Issue: Licence fees Submissions (30 – Staples Rodway, 65 – The Whyte Group, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Licence fees received from intangible property should not be treated as a “rent” under proposed section EX 20B(3)(e), but rather such payments should receive the same treatment as royalty income and, as such, licence fee payment should fall within the scope of the royalty provisions. Comment The proposed definition of “rent” in the bill mirrors the current definition of “lease” in other parts of the Income Tax Act. This is to ensure that there is consistency across the Income Tax Act. However, the policy intent was to carve out licence fees received from intangible property from the “rent” provisions and have the “royalty” provisions apply to such payments. To ensure the policy intent of the proposed legislation is carried out, the proposed legislation should be amended to clarify the treatment of licence fees received from intangible property by explicitly treating such payments in the same way as royalty payments. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Submission (65 – The Whyte Group) Third party licence fee income derived by a CFC should be deemed active and exempt from attribution, regardless of whether it is derived in the same jurisdiction as the CFC or another jurisdiction. Comment As noted above, it is agreed that licence fees received from intangible property and royalty income should receive the same treatment. As such, the same exclusions applicable to royalty payments should be extended to licence fees also. While we agree that third party licence fee income derived by a CFC should be deemed active and exempt from attribution, it is important to stress that the same criteria applicable to the proposed royalty exemptions should also be applied to licence fee payments that are not royalties. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and that certain licence fee payments be treated as active and exempt from attribution provided those payments satisfy all the requirements set out in the royalty exclusions. 77 Issue: Insurance income – change in revenue account property Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Section EX 20B(3)(f)(ii) – regarding income from a change in value of revenue account property used in an insurance business – should be removed. This is because a change in the value of revenue account property would not be income under any other part of New Zealand tax law and that in any case, income from the sale of property that is likely to generate passive income is covered elsewhere in sections EX 20B(3)(i) and (j). Comment Officials agree that section EX 20(3)(f)(ii) is not necessary as the income which it is intended to capture would be covered elsewhere in the passive income definition. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Income from a life insurance policy that is not FIF income Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Section EX 20B(3)(g) – income from a life insurance policy which is not included in the calculation of FIF income or loss – appears unnecessary as any life insurance policy taken out by a CFC should already be taxed under the FIF rules. Comment Section EX 20B(3)(g) would apply if the CFC took out life insurance with a New Zealand company. Payouts on these policies are treated as passive income as otherwise they could be used to make New Zealand income free from tax. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 78 Issue: Key person insurance Submission (Matter raised by officials) While income under a life insurance policy should be included in the passive income of a CFC, there should be an exception for “key person” insurance. Comment Income under a life insurance policy is included in passive income of a CFC because it can be used as a substitute for interest. For instance, income from insurance bonds is income under a life insurance policy even though the bonds may have only a very small insurance component. However, CFCs may have “key person” insurance, which insures the CFC against the death or incapacity of key personnel, typically senior managers. Taking out such policies would be a normal part of an active business. Where this insurance is term life insurance over personnel of the CFC, income under the policy should not be counted as passive income. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Income from personal service Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The “working person” in the proposed section EX 20B(3)(h) should not include a person who is not resident in New Zealand in the income year. Comment The policy intent behind the personal services rule is to eliminate the situation where a New Zealand resident uses a CFC to avoid tax on income from personal effort. As such, it would be sensible for the rule to apply to a “working person” who is resident in New Zealand in at any time in the income year. New Zealand does not tax a non- resident’s foreign-sourced income. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 79 Issue: Revenue account property Submission (68 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) There is confusion as to whether the amount of gain is based on the cost of the property converted at the foreign exchange rates at the date of acquisition or whether it is the gain in the foreign currency converted into New Zealand currency at the date of sale. The submission considers that taxpayers should be given the option to calculate gain in foreign currency and convert it into New Zealand dollars in accordance with the current rules that apply in section EX 21. Comment Officials agree that taxpayers should be given the option to calculate the gain in the foreign currency and convert it into New Zealand dollars in accordance with the current rules that apply in section EX 21. The bill provides that section EX 21 applies for various purposes, including determining an attributable CFC amount. The rules about currency conversion at section EX 21(4) would therefore already apply for most purposes. The bill currently provides that, for calculations under section EX 21D (the tax-based active business test), the CFC’s functional currency must be used (section EX 21(3B)(b) and (8B)). Officials consider that this requirement can be dropped and that the usual rules in section EX 21(4) can also apply for the purposes of section EX 21D. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Proposed section EX 20B(3)(j) should reflect the policy as set out in the commentary to the bill. Comment The policy intent of section EX 20B(3)(j) is to treat income derived from the disposal of revenue account property held by a CFC that is not used in an offshore active business as passive income. The submission states that the current drafting of the section does not deliver this policy intent; in particular, as currently drafted, the section will apply to all disposal of revenue account property, even if the property is used in an offshore active business. 80 Section EX 20B(3)(j) currently refers to revenue account property that is “capable of giving rise to income of the CFC referred to in another paragraph of this section”. Officials agree that this could potentially be given a very wide interpretation. The submission suggests that the provision be amended so that it only applies to property that is actually employed in deriving passive income. This seems sensible. Recommendation That section EX 20B(3)(j) be amended to refer to revenue account property employed in, or for the purpose of, deriving income of the CFC referred to in a another paragraph of the subsection. Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The word “alienation” in proposed sections EX 20B(3)(j) and EX 20B(7) should be replaced with “disposal”. Comment Officials agree that New Zealand domestic law prefers the term “disposal” over “alienation”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (Matter raised by officials) Income from the disposal of share options held on revenue account should be included within the attributable CFC amount. Comment Share options (along with shares) are excepted financial arrangements (sections EW 4(3) and EW 5(13)) specifically excluded under subpart EW. This means that they do not give rise to an attributed CFC amount under section EX 20B(4). Income from the disposal of shares held on revenue account will be subject to attribution by virtue of section EX 20B(3)(i), but there is currently no equivalent provision for share options. Trading in intangibles is inherently mobile and, as such, is an activity that ought to be treated as giving rise to attributable income. In view of this, we consider that income from trading in share options should be treated as an attributable CFC amount. Recommendation That section EX 20B(3) be amended so that income from the disposal of share options held on revenue account is treated as an attributable CFC amount. 81 Issue: Certain income related to telecommunications services Submission (66 – Telecom) All income from a telecommunications service relating to the use of international submarine cables should be treated as active if the income interest in the CFC is not greater than 50 percent. Comment As a general principle, the active income exemption aims to put CFCs on the same tax footing as competitors in their own jurisdiction, if the CFC is carrying on an active business there. For example, a CFC in an overseas country that operates retail outlets in that country will face the same liability for tax as its competitors. There are limits to this principle, however. Certain types of income – referred to collectively in the new rules as passive income – are not tied to a particular jurisdiction and can be moved to a low-tax jurisdiction to minimise tax. If this income is not taxed, there is a real danger that New Zealand-sourced income will be shifted overseas and that the tax base will be undermined. Income from international submarine cables used in telecommunications is one such type of income. Because large parts of these cables are not included in any jurisdiction and, in the absence of specific tax rules, income from their use will be taxable only in the country in which the assets are owned. This can be chosen to be a low-tax or nil-tax jurisdiction. The submission states that even if income from a telecommunications cable is passive income, it should not be passive income unless the income interest of the New Zealand taxpayer in the CFC exceeds 50 percent. Unless the interest exceeds 50 percent, according to the submission, the New Zealand taxpayer has no control over the location of the CFC. For the purposes of the definition of controlled foreign company (CFC) in the Income Tax Act 2007, it is sufficient for a New Zealand resident to hold a control interest of 40 percent or more in the foreign company, as long as no non-resident also holds an interest of 40 percent or more. Officials do not see any justification for departing from this long-standing rule. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 82 Submission (68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Section EX 20B(3)(m) is unnecessary and, if retained, subparagraphs (i), (iii) and (iv) should be removed. Comment Section EX 20B(3)(m) includes, as passive income, income from a telecommunications service that is physically performed in New Zealand, except when the service is between the CFC’s jurisdiction and New Zealand and is not performed by staff or equipment of the CFC located in New Zealand. Telecommunications services are not passive income under the normal “base company income” rule in section EX 20B(3)(k), which catches income from services physically performed in New Zealand. Telecommunications was specifically removed from that rule because of the technical difficulty of determining where a telecommunications service is performed. Section EX 20B(3)(m) clarifies that income from the provision of telecommunications services between the jurisdiction of the CFC and New Zealand is active income of the CFC. However, section EX 20B(3)(m) contains limitations to ensure that the rule is not used to shift domestically sourced income abroad. (See the submission on “mobile roamers” below for an example of what might happen.) The submission correctly makes the point that income that the limitations seek to catch will often be caught anyway because there will be a substantial place of business in New Zealand. This will not always be the case. If the income is caught, there will be a tax credit, to be used against attributed passive income, to prevent double taxation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (66 – Telecom) CFC income from telecommunications services provided between two sites in New Zealand (such as where a “mobile roamer” of a CFC travels to New Zealand and makes a call to a person in New Zealand) should not be passive income. Comment CFC income from telecommunications between the jurisdiction of the CFC and New Zealand is not passive income if certain requirements are met. This exemption does not extend to telecommunications entirely within New Zealand. 83 A CFC is not often expected to encounter the situation of telecommunications entirely within New Zealand. However, the submission provides the specific example of “global roamers”. For example, a CFC in Australia might provide a global roaming service to its Australian customers. If those customers then travel to New Zealand and use that global roaming service to makes calls here, the calls will generate CFC passive income. The primary reason for carving some telecommunications services out of the definition of passive income is that it is difficult to identify where a telecommunications service is performed (it is always performed in at least two countries if there is cross-border communication). In the case of calls carried out entirely within New Zealand, there is no such difficulty. Furthermore, if the exemption were extended to telecommunications within New Zealand, there would be a danger that existing New Zealand telecommunications providers would incorporate CFCs in low-tax jurisdictions and provide – for example – mobile phone services to New Zealanders through those CFCs. It is not the aim of the reforms to allow income to be shifted in this way. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (66 – Telecom) CFC income from telecommunications between the jurisdiction of a CFC and New Zealand should not be passive if the CFC is an associate of a network operator. Comment CFC income from telecommunications between the jurisdiction of the CFC and New Zealand is not passive income if certain requirements are met. One of those requirements is that the CFC, or a person who has an income interest in the CFC of 50 percent or more, is a network operator under the Telecommunications (Interception Capability) Act 2004. In Telecom’s case, the network operator in the corporate group is not a CFC and does not own any CFCs. However, CFCs within the group and the network operator have a common parent. Telecom’s submission is that the rules should be widened to bring in such a structure, so that CFC income will not be passive. Telecom’s submission is that it should be sufficient for the CFC and the network operator to be associated persons. The purpose of the network operator requirement is to increase the likelihood that the business activity that is being relieved from tax is genuine telecommunications. Officials agree that sister companies within a group should be able to satisfy the requirement if a parent and subsidiary can. Officials therefore recommend that the requirement be altered so that the exemption applies where the CFC is a network operator, or where a company has a 50 percent or greater income interest in both the network operator and the CFC. 84 Officials do not recommend altering the rule to include any “associate” or “associated person” because this would potentially bring in entities outside a corporate group. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part, and that the requirement for the CFC to be a network operator or to be majority-owned by a network operator be altered so that the network operator and the CFC merely need a common controlling parent. Submission (66 – Telecom) CFC income from telecommunications between the jurisdiction of a CFC and New Zealand should not be passive merely because the service is performed using equipment or staff of the CFC based in New Zealand. Comment CFC income from telecommunications between the jurisdiction of the CFC and New Zealand is not passive income if certain requirements are met. One of those requirements is that the service is not performed using equipment that is physically located in New Zealand and in the possession of the CFC or another CFC. Another of the requirements is that the service is not performed using staff located in New Zealand and employed or contracted by the CFC or another CFC. Telecom submits that income from such a service would probably be taxable in New Zealand under normal principles if the CFC had substantial equipment or staff here, and should not be taxed under the CFC rules. If tax is imposed under the CFC rules, the CFC receives a credit for any tax paid on the same income in New Zealand. (See section LK 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.) Telecom recognises this in its submission. This prevents double taxation. It is not an uncommon occurrence for CFCs to pay some tax in New Zealand and to receive a credit for that tax when calculating attributable CFC income. The reason for the rule is that there may be situations in which a CFC’s income from equipment and staff based in New Zealand is not taxable in New Zealand under a double tax agreement. It then must be taxed under the CFC rules if double non- taxation is to be prevented. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 85 Issue: Base company rules – services partly performed in New Zealand Submissions (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 68 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) When a service is partly performed in New Zealand, tax should be imposed under section EX 20B(3)(k) only on the income that relates to that part of the service. (PricewaterhouseCoopers, Corporate Taxpayers Group) Section EX 20B(3)(k) should be amended to ensure that a service must be physically performed in New Zealand, or that incidental services are not captured. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment Section EX 20B(3)(k) provides that income derived by a CFC from a service performed wholly or partly in New Zealand (other than a telecommunications service) is included in the attributable CFC amount. This rule protects the domestic tax base from inappropriate off-shoring of New Zealand-sourced income by routing a service through a CFC. The reference in this provision to a service being partly performed in New Zealand ensures that the provision applies to all services performed here, even if they are also partly performed somewhere else. We agree that, when a service is only partly performed in New Zealand, it would be appropriate to allow the income derived to be apportioned on a reasonable basis for the purposes of determining the attributable CFC amount. This should also help to address concerns around incidental services. Section EX 20B(3)(k) is already expressly limited to services physically performed in New Zealand. Recommendation That section EX 20B(3)(k) be amended to make clear that apportionment is permitted. Issue: Base company rules – income with a New Zealand source Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 68 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Section EX 20B(3)(k) should be restricted to circumstances in which income has not been subject to New Zealand tax – recognising that, except when relief is available under a double tax agreement, income from services performed in New Zealand will normally be taxed here anyway on a source basis. 86 Comment The possibility that income derived by a CFC will be taxed directly, as well as under the CFC rules, arises for any New Zealand-sourced income. Rents, royalties and other payments sourced and taxed in New Zealand may also be within the scope of section EX 20B. In each case, double taxation is relieved through the provision of credits under subpart LK. When a CFC pays New Zealand tax on an amount of income, a credit is available to offset the shareholder’s tax liability. If the shareholder’s liability exceeds the tax paid by the CFC – as may be the case for non- corporate shareholders with a marginal rate higher than the company rate – it is appropriate that the shareholder remains liable for the balance. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Base company rules – interaction with the active business test Submission (32 – KPMG) Section EX 21E(8) should be reconsidered as it disadvantages global companies that utilise the services of their CFCs to fill skill gaps in New Zealand. Comment Section EX 21E(8) tests whether a CFC is a non-attributing active CFC. Paragraph (d) states that the income from services performed in New Zealand should be treated as “added passive” income for these purposes. Such income is included in the attributed CFC amount under section EX 20B(3)(k). It is therefore appropriate that it should also be taken into account under section EX 21E. There is already a minimum threshold under section EX 21E because any CFC with less than 5 percent passive income will be exempt from attribution on all their income. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 87 Issue: Holding company exemptions and liability to tax in the foreign country Submission (Matter raised by officials) The “holding company” exemptions should be available only to CFCs that are liable to tax in the same jurisdiction. Comment An active CFC can pay royalties, interest and rent to an associated CFC such as a holding company, without the associated CFC having to recognise any passive income, as long as the CFC and the associated CFC are in the same jurisdiction (see sections EX 20B(5)(c), (6)(c) and (8)(a)). The CFC and the associated CFC are considered to be in the same jurisdiction if the associated CFC is: “Subject with the CFC to the laws of the same country or territory under which, for each company,— (i) the company is liable to income tax on its income because of its domicile, residence, place of incorporation, or centre of management \[and/or\] (ii) persons holding income interests in the company are liable for the income tax on its income and the country or territory is the source of 80% or more of that income” (see definition of “associated non-attributing active CFC” in section YA 1). We consider that the second limb of the residence test in the definition (“persons holding income interests...”) should be removed. If it remains, income of an active business may not be taxed in any jurisdiction, which provides strong incentives for New Zealand taxpayers to move investments and business activities abroad. This is not the intent of the international tax reform; there is an expectation that CFCs will face the normal tax rate in their jurisdiction. Example CFC A and CFC B are both residents of Country A. Country A considers CFC A to be a company and CFC B to be a non-entity for tax purposes. Country A considers that any payments to CFC B are in fact made directly to CFC B’s shareholders in New Zealand. CFC A is an active business and earns income of $100 million. CFC A pays deductible interest and royalties of $100 million to CFC B, reducing A’s taxable income under the rules in Country A to nil. CFC B is not liable to tax in Country A (Country A may attempt to impose non-resident withholding taxes on payments to CFC B, but usually at a substantially lower rate than the company tax rate). Rules as printed in the bill: Under New Zealand tax rules, CFC A is considered to have no passive income because it is an active business. CFC B has no passive income because of the “holding company” exemptions. There is little or no tax in Country A or in New Zealand on the income of the CFCs. 88 Proposed rules: As with the current rules, there will be little or no tax imposed by Country A, and CFC A will be treated in New Zealand as having no passive income. However, CFC B will be treated as having $100 million of passive income. Tax will be imposed on this amount, unless CFC B has sufficient active income (approximately $2 billion in this case) to qualify as an active business. Similar changes are recommended to the rules relating to the active business test, to prevent consolidation of CFCs that are not liable to tax in the same country (in the same way as with the “holding company” exemptions, consolidation leads to inter- CFC payments not being included as passive income of the recipient). The second limb of the residence test in the definition comes from the test for residence of CFCs that was introduced in 2006 (this test was unintentionally omitted from the 2007 Income Tax Act). The test was introduced to extend the “grey list” exemption from ordinary companies to so-called hybrid entities – entities that New Zealand sees as companies but which are not liable to tax in the foreign jurisdiction because that jurisdiction sees them as “flow-through” for tax purposes. For example, an Australian unit trust is not liable to tax in Australia as long as it distributes all its income to unit-holders, but New Zealand sees the unit trust as a company. The 2006 extension was an appropriate measure for hybrid CFCs that earned business income (other than interest, rent, dividends and royalties) through a fixed place of business, because the foreign jurisdiction would impose tax on New Zealand shareholders of the CFC at the normal foreign tax rate. In the context of grey list countries, this meant tax paid abroad would be broadly comparable to tax paid in New Zealand. The extension was not so logical for CFC earning passive income, because the foreign jurisdiction had only limited rights to tax the New Zealand shareholders on the income, usually by imposing a non-resident withholding tax at a lower rate than the corporate tax rate. However it was not appropriate to draw a distinction between the two sorts of income in that context. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Rent exemption and liability to tax in the foreign country Submission (Matter raised by officials) That the exemption for rent from property in the CFC’s jurisdiction be available only to CFCs that are liable to tax in the same jurisdiction. 89 Comment Section EX 20B(6)(a) and (b) remove, from passive income, rent received by a CFC from land or property in a country under the laws of which: (i) the company is liable to income tax on its income because of its domicile, residence, place of incorporation, or centre of management \[and/or\] (ii) persons holding income interests in the company are liable for the income tax on its income and the country or territory is the source of 80% or more of that income”. We consider that the second limb of the residence test in the definition (“persons holding income interests...”) should be removed. The previous submission on the “holding company” exemptions provides more explanation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 90 NET ATTRIBUTABLE CFC INCOME OR LOSS Clauses 119, 121 and 122 Overview The rules for calculating net attributable CFC income or loss are set out in new sections EX 20C and EX 20D, and section EX 21: • Section EX 20C provides that net attributable CFC income or loss is to be calculated using a prescribed formula and lays down the main rules concerning the deductibility of expenditure. • Section EX 20D makes special provision regarding the deductibility of interest expenditure for excessively debt-funded CFCs. • Section EX 21 applies the Act (subject to certain modifications) for certain specified purposes, which include the calculation of net attributable CFC income or loss, as though a CFC were a New Zealand resident. Non-interest expenditure will be deductible in calculating net attributable CFC income or loss to the extent it is incurred for the purposes of deriving an attributable CFC amount and not incurred for the purposes of deriving a non-attributable amount. This is consistent with the nexus test that applies to non-interest expenditure in the domestic context. For most resident companies, there is no nexus test for interest expenditure. Allowing a CFC to deduct all interest would mean debt could be used to shelter attributable income. Deductions for interest expenditure incurred by a CFC will therefore be based on the proportion of a CFC’s assets that are used to derive an attributable CFC amount. To prevent offshore debt being concentrated in CFCs with mainly attributable assets, thereby sheltering attributable income, special rules apply to CFCs that are excessively debt funded. A CFC will be treated as excessively debt funded if its debt- to-asset ratio is more than 75 percent and its relative debt-to-asset ratio is more than 110 percent. In this case, the CFC’s interest deductions will be based on the overall asset mix of all the interest holder’s CFCs. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 91 Issue: Mechanics of the calculation provision Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Paragraphs (a)(ii) and (b)(ii) of section EX 20C(1) could give anomalous results. The section should be redrafted to exclude these provisions. Comment Section EX 20C(1) makes provision for the amount of a CFC’s net attributable CFC income or loss. Paragraph (a)(ii) provides that the amount of net attributable CFC income is zero if paragraph (a)(i) does not apply. (Paragraph (a)(i) applies if the amount calculated under subsection (2) and section EX 21 is more than zero.) Similarly, paragraph (b)(ii) provides that the amount of net attributable CFC loss is zero if paragraph (b)(i) does not apply. (Paragraph (b)(i) applies if the amount calculated under subsection (2) and section EX 21 is less than zero.) The concern raised in the submission is that a CFC with net income could nevertheless argue that its net attributable CFC income was zero under section EX 20C(1) by virtue of paragraph (b)(ii) because paragraph (b)(i) did not apply. Consideration will be given to whether there is scope for simplifying the drafting of section EX 20C, along with other provisions of the bill. As a technical matter, however, the concern raised in the submission is unfounded. Paragraphs (a) and (b) deal with income and losses separately. For a CFC with net income, paragraph (b)(ii) would indeed apply, but its effect would simply be to set the amount of the CFC’s net loss at zero. The amount of the CFC’s net income would still be determined in accordance with paragraph (a). Recommendation That the submission be declined. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Issue: Cross-references in the calculation provision Submission (67 –New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The calculation rule in section EX 20C(1) should refer to “attributable CFC amount”, or to section EX 20B, rather than to section EX 21. Comment Section EX 20C(1) refers to the formula in subsection (2) as well as to section EX 21. The formula in subsection (2) refers back to the attributable CFC amount determined under section EX 20B. The submission notes that section EX 20B itself refers to the rules in section EX 21 and questions whether it is necessary also to refer to those rules in section EX 20C(1). 92 The provisions of the Act that are applied by virtue of section EX 21 for the purposes of section EX 20B may be different from those that are relevant for the purposes of section EX 20C. For example, rules about deductibility are not generally relevant for the purposes of section EX 20B but are relevant to section EX 20C(7). Recommendation That the submission be declined. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Issue: Interaction between sections EX 20C and EX 21 Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Deductions may be available both under section EX 20C and section EX 21 and the two sets of rules should therefore be rationalised. Comment Section EX 21(1) makes it clear that the section only applies for the specific purposes of calculating a CFC’s attributable CFC amount (section EX 20B) and net attributable CFC income or loss (section EX 20C). Section EX 20C in turn provides that net attributable CFC income or loss is to be calculated using the formula in subsection (2). The rules in section EX 21 are relevant for the purposes of applying that formula. The formula, together with the other provisions of sections EX 20C and EX 20D, sets out when and to what extent deductions are available. A deduction that is not authorised by section EX 20C cannot independently be brought into the calculation of net attributable CFC income or loss by section EX 21. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Non-interest expenditure Submission (32 – KPMG, 68/68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Section EX 20C(7)(a) should simply require that expenditure is deductible to the extent it is incurred for the purposes of deriving an attributable CFC amount (without the additional requirement that it not be incurred for the purposes of deriving a non- attributable amount). 93 Comment Section EX 20C(7)(a) provides that expenditure not relating to a financial arrangement is deductible to the extent it is: (i) incurred for the purposes of deriving an attributable CFC amount; and (ii) not incurred for the purposes of deriving an amount that is not an attributable CFC amount; and (iii) a deduction of the CFC. The submission concerns paragraphs (i) and (ii). Those paragraphs follow the model laid down in existing law for deductions generally. Specifically, section DA 1(1) provides that a person is allowed a deduction for expenditure incurred in deriving assessable or excluded income. At the same time, section DA 2(3) provides that a person is denied a deduction for expenditure incurred in deriving exempt income. If an item of expenditure relates to both assessable/excluded income and exempt income, the effect of subpart DA is to require apportionment of that expenditure. Likewise, when expenditure incurred by a CFC relates to both attributable and non- attributable amounts, the effect of paragraphs (i) and (ii) of section EX 20C(7)(a) together is to require apportionment. Recommendation That the submission be declined. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Issue: Interest expenditure – general approach Submission (68/68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The rules about interest expenditure incurred by CFCs should allow taxpayers to trace borrowed funds to determine deductibility. Comment Under the bill, the extent to which interest expenditure incurred by a CFC is to be taken into account in determining net attributable CFC income or loss depends on the proportion of the CFC’s total assets that are used to derive an attributable CFC amount. Limiting deductions in this way is intended to prevent debt being used to shelter attributable income. Effective taxation of this income is fundamental to protecting the tax base. 94 Allowing taxpayers to trace borrowed funds to determine interest deductibility would expose the tax base to an unacceptable level of risk. Tracing would involve identifying how debt had been applied and allowing a deduction for interest if the funds were used to derive attributable income. Although superficially attractive, tracing ignores the fact that money is fungible, and equity and debt readily substitutable. It therefore has little economic significance and can produce arbitrary results. Tracing would provide significant planning opportunities for firms, which would be able to match debt (and deductible interest payments) to attributable income streams, sheltering such income. Recommendation That the submission be declined. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Issue: Interest expenditure – basis of apportionment Submission (68/68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The rules about interest expenditure incurred by CFCs should base apportionment on income rather than underlying asset values. Comment Using asset values, rather than income, as the basis for apportionment is preferred because it reduces the bias of varying rates of return from different asset classes. In short, it better reflects how capital is actually employed in the business. Asset-based apportionment should generally benefit the taxpayer, compared with an income-based approach, because returns on passive assets tend to be lower than those on active business assets. Recommendation That the submission be declined. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Issue: Interest expenditure – on-lending Submission (68/68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The rules about interest expenditure incurred by CFCs should include an on-lending concession. 95 Comment The submission argues that the rules about interest expenditure incurred by CFCs will create an additional tax liability when a CFC borrows to finance on-lending. Depending on the circumstances, interest earned by the CFC from the onward loan may be fully attributable, whereas only part of the interest it pays on the funds borrowed to finance the loan may be deductible. If the CFC is on-lending to a third party, the bill achieves the desired result. Borrowing to fund debt investment and thereby derive attributable income is no different in principle from borrowing to fund any other passive investment. In any event, because money is fungible, matching particular debts to particular assets (including onward loans) is arbitrary and may not reflect the underlying economic reality. There is a better case for modifying the rules as they apply to intra-group financing arrangements. New Zealand multi-nationals may operate financing subsidiaries which obtain debt finance on behalf of the group and then on-lend to operating subsidiaries. The rules in the bill potentially interfere with these arrangements by creating a tax liability that is essentially artificial if the counter-factual is direct borrowing by the operating subsidiary. This could be resolved by allowing a full deduction for interest paid by a CFC when funds are on-lent to associated CFCs. This would not involve tracing of borrowed funds. Rather, there would be an arithmetical adjustment based on the value of qualifying loans made by a CFC as a proportion of its own borrowing. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in relation to on-lending to associated CFCs. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Issue: Interest expenditure – excessively debt funded CFCs Submissions (24A – New Zealand Law Society, 35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 68/68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 73 – Deloitte for Seniors Money International) The rules about interest expenditure incurred by CFCs should not make special provision for CFCs that are excessively debt funded. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The provision for excessively debt funded CFCs is structurally flawed because it does not reduce interest deductions by reference to the amount of excess debt. (New Zealand Law Society, PricewaterhouseCoopers, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) 96 The provision for excessively debt funded CFCs should include an on-lending concession. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte for Seniors Money International) Comment The provision made for excessively debt funded CFCs is an integrity measure which supports the standard rules about interest expenditure incurred by CFCs. In the absence of this provision and subject to commercial constraints, offshore group debt could be concentrated in CFCs with a high proportion of attributable assets. Equity funding could be concentrated in active CFCs with mainly non-attributable assets. Such structures could prevent the effective taxation of attributable income. The existing bill provision is flawed and needs to be corrected. The policy intention is that, when a CFC is excessively debt funded, its interest deductions should be capped at the amount that would be allowed if apportionment was done by reference to the assets of all CFCs of the interest holder. Thus, if a CFC with mainly attributable assets is excessively debt funded, interest deductions will be limited by reference to the offshore asset mix of the group as a whole. This is different from the approach taken under the thin capitalisation rules, where adjustments reflect the amount by which debt exceeds the relevant threshold. The thin capitalisation approach is not appropriate for the purposes of section EX 20D. If an excessively debt funded CFC held more non-attributable assets than the group average, there would be no loss of revenue to New Zealand and it would be inappropriate to further restrict interest deductions. When a CFC is performing group treasury functions, it may have a debt-asset ratio and a relative debt-asset ratio that routinely exceeds the prescribed thresholds. If the group as a whole is carrying on an active business, its offshore assets may be predominantly attributable assets. In that case, the application of a cap under section EX 20D would significantly restrict interest deductions for the CFC. In view of this, it seems appropriate to allow an adjustment for on-lending by a CFC when calculating its debt-asset ratio and relative debt-asset ratio. The adjustment should be limited to on-lending to associated CFCs, to limit firms’ ability to use debt to shelter attributable income. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part, so that the provision for excessively debt funded CFCs be retained, but amended in line with the policy intention and tempered by an on-lending concession. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Issue: Interest expenditure – active financing entities Submission (73 – Deloitte, for Seniors Money International) The rules about interest expenditure incurred by CFCs should not apply to active financing entities. 97 Comment The case for extending the active income exemption to financial institutions (among others) will be considered as part of the second stage of the international tax reforms. Interest allocation and interest apportionment rules for financial institutions will be considered as part of that work. Officials do not recommend exempting offshore financial institutions from the interest expenditure rules in the meantime. Dealing appropriately with financial institutions raises difficult policy and technical issues. There are potentially significant implications for the tax base if the rules are not properly designed. Although finance companies will tend to have debt-to-asset ratios in excess of the threshold (75 percent) prescribed in section EX 20D(2)(a), two safeguards should help to mitigate the impact of the rules in the short-term. First, a CFC will only be treated as excessively debt funded if it also has a relative debt-to-asset ratio of more than 110 percent. This means that a CFC will only be treated as excessively debt funded if it geared out of line with the group as a whole. Secondly, even if a CFC is treated as excessively debt funded, its interest deductions will only be capped if it has a proportion of attributable assets that is higher than the group average. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but the matter considered as part of the second stage of the international tax reforms. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Issue: Interest expenditure – testing dates Submission (68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The rules about interest expenditure should include flexible testing dates and allow taxpayers to undertake calculations at different times, consistent with the thin capitalisation rules. Comment As the submission points out, clarification is needed about when and how asset valuation under section EX 20C is to be carried out. The thin capitalisation rules, which allow daily, monthly or annual measurement of group debt and group assets provide a useful model. An equivalent outcome is already substantially achieved under section EX 20D through the application of sections FE 8 to FE 11, although some minor technical corrections are required. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 98 Issue: Interest expenditure – accounting standards Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) It is not appropriate to require the use of generally accepted accounting practices for measuring assets and debts of CFCs for the purposes of section EX 20D. Comment CFCs are already effectively subject to New Zealand tax law as if they were resident companies by virtue of section EX 21. This includes certain requirements to comply with generally accepted accounting practices. It is appropriate that, when measuring assets and debts for the purposes of calculating net attributable CFC income or loss, New Zealand accounting standards should apply. A similar approach is taken in section EX 20C. Recommendation That the submission be declined. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Issue: Interest expenditure – fixed-rate foreign equity and deductible foreign equity Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 68/68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Dividends on fixed-rate shares and dividends that are deductible in a foreign jurisdiction should not be subject to the rules about interest expenditure incurred by CFCs, but should rather be treated as fully deductible for the purposes of calculating net attributable CFC income or loss. Comment While foreign dividends will generally be exempt under the new rules, dividends on fixed-rate shares and deductible dividends will remain taxable when paid by a CFC to a New Zealand-resident company or another CFC. In the absence of the branch equivalent tax account rules (which will be repealed after a transitional period), taxing these dividends gives rise to the possibility of economic double taxation: foreign income derived through a CFC may be taxed on accrual as it is earned, and then taxed again if paid out as a taxable dividend. 99 This double taxation will be relieved by allowing deductions for the payment of such taxable dividends when calculating net attributable CFC income or loss. The potential for double taxation only arises to the extent that a dividend paid by a CFC represents a distribution of attributable income (which is taxed on accrual) rather than non- attributable income (which is not). It is therefore appropriate to limit deductions for such dividends in the same way as for interest. Elsewhere in this report, it is recommended that the bill be amended so that dividends on fixed-rate shares and deductible dividends are no longer treated as interest. Rather, they will be treated as taxable dividends in the hands of New Zealand-resident shareholders or CFCs. As part of that change, express provision will be made to ensure that deductions for these dividends remain subject to the same limits as deductions for interest. Recommendation That the submission be declined. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Issue: Interest expenditure – cross-reference to subpart FE Submission (62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) In section EX 20D(8), the reference to section FE 31 should instead be a reference to section FE 31B. Comment The cross-references to subpart FE in section EX 20D(8) need to be updated to take account of changes introduced by clauses 172 to 174 of the bill. They key provision to refer to is new section FE 31B, which makes provision for the worldwide group for an excess debt outbound company. Sections FE 31C and FE 32 are also relevant. Section FE 31 as amended deals with worldwide groups for corporate excess debt entities that are not excess debt outbound companies and is therefore no longer relevant for these purposes. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 100 Issue: Interest expenditure – miscellaneous drafting issues Submissions (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Section EX 20D(1) would make more sense if it applied for the purposes of section EX 20C(6). The existing cross-reference to section EX 20C(3) does not read intuitively and means that people have to refer to two separate subsections. The heading to and first line of section EX 20D(15) should refer to “excessively debt funded” entities. The reference to section EX 20C(6) in section EX 20D(15) should be a reference to section EX 20C(6)(b). Comment Section EX 20D needs to be generally amended to give effect to the policy intent. In making those changes, consideration will also be given to these detailed drafting suggestions. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Issue: Section EX 21 – income from another CFC Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) An amount of passive income as defined in section EX 20B should not be attributable if the income is also attributable income of another CFC. Comment Under existing law (section EX 21(16) and (17)), dividends between CFCs are not taken into account in determining branch equivalent income. This submission argues that the same principle should apply to items of attributable income derived by one CFC from another CFC if a person has an income interest of 10 percent or greater in both CFCs. Under the bill, dividends will only form part of a CFC’s attributable CFC amount in certain limited circumstances. Other types of income derived by a CFC from another CFC may form part of the attributable CFC amount. This is necessary, in particular, to prevent profits being shifted to exploit low tax regimes. It also reflects the fact that payments such as interest and royalties will generally be deductible to the CFC making the payment. 101 Recommendation That the submission be declined. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Issue: Section EX 21 – treatment of subvention payments Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The provisions of section EX 21 should be examined to make sure that the approach in section EX 20C(1)(a)(i) and (b)(i) is valid. Comment Section EX 20C(1) provides that net attributable CFC income or loss is calculated using the formula in subsection (2) and the rules in section EX 21. The submission notes that the rules in section EX 21 may not always be mere calculation rules, and suggests that they be re-examined to ensure their application continues to be appropriate once the active income exemption takes effect. The submission questions, in particular, the treatment of subvention payments under section EX 21(24). Section EX 21(24) modifies the application of the Act in relation to subvention payments for the purposes of calculating branch equivalent income. The provision is aimed at subvention payments made under foreign law. The issue raised in the submission is that, under the new CFC rules, a subvention payment could be made from a profit-making CFC subject to attribution in return for losses from a loss- making active CFC. In that case, attributable income would be offset by deductions under section EX 21(24), but there would be no corresponding increase in the attributable income of the active CFC (because it is not subject to attribution). This could give rise to tax planning opportunities, with losses from an active business transferred by way of a subvention payment to shelter the attributable income of an associated CFC. We are not aware of other provisions of section EX 21 requiring further amendment. Recommendation That the submission be noted, and that section EX 21(24)(b) be amended so that a deduction is not available to a CFC making a subvention payment to a non-attributing active CFC. 102 INTEREST ALLOCATION RULES Overview The interest allocation rules are a key part of the international tax reform package. They are designed to counter a major potential risk to the tax base following the introduction of the new active exemption. The exemption could create an incentive for firms to fund their CFCs from New Zealand to maximise their interest deductions against New Zealand income. This would potentially erode the New Zealand tax base. The interest allocation rules will address this risk. They have been designed with a view to the commercial realities faced by companies, particularly small and medium- sized companies. The rules do not eliminate the risk to the New Zealand tax base from over-allocation of interest costs to New Zealand, but they do guard against the possibility of extreme abuse. Other countries, including Australia, that have an active income exemption, have similar interest allocation rules. Issue: Outbound interest allocation rules should not be introduced Submissions (21 – NZ Oil and Gas, 32 – KPMG, 35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 59 – Fletcher Building, 62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Applying interest allocation rules to New Zealand firms with interests in CFCs will significantly reduce the benefit of the new international tax rules. Companies that currently have significant CFC investments covered by the grey list exemption will be particularly affected. The rules will also impose significant compliance costs. Interest allocation rules are not required because there is currently no evidence to indicate that New Zealand companies are allocating excessive amounts of debt to their New Zealand operations, and any potential mischief would be addressed by New Zealand‘s transfer pricing rules. From a practical point of view, the proposed rules will inhibit expansion abroad. When businesses start up in foreign jurisdictions, the initial funding will often come in the form of equity from the New Zealand parent – either because the host jurisdiction has minimum equity requirements or because the subsidiary cannot obtain funds from banks in the host jurisdiction. The New Zealand parent may well have to borrow in New Zealand to fund its equity investment and the interest allocation rules may prevent this borrowing from being deductible. 103 Comment The introduction of an active income exemption for CFCs is a radical change to New Zealand’s tax rules. It fundamentally changes the incentives governing the location of CFC interest expenses. Under an active income exemption, CFC income may be taxed at much lower tax rates in the CFC’s jurisdiction. Deducting interest expenses incurred in generating income that is subject to a low rate of foreign tax against New Zealand’s higher taxed income effectively subsidises offshore investment. This could create an incentive for some New Zealand companies with outbound investment to over-allocate their global interest costs against their New Zealand-sourced income, in effect eroding the New Zealand tax base. The outbound interest allocation rules proposed in the bill are simply intended to provide a minimum defence against the erosion of the New Zealand tax base in the context of an active income exemption. Generous safe harbours and minimum thresholds contained in the bill mean that these rules should apply infrequently. Under the proposed rules interest deductions would only be denied when the New Zealand company’s debt-to-asset ratio exceeded 75 percent – which would represent a very high level of gearing for most businesses – or 110 percent of the worldwide group’s debt-to-asset ratio. Even then, only debt in excess of these thresholds would be subject to interest denial. Moreover, firms with more than 90 percent of their assets in New Zealand would be exempt from applying the rules. Officials are also recommending raising the threshold for interest deductions below which the rules do not apply from $250,000 to $1 million. This will further limit the application of the rules. More details on this relaxation are provided later in this report. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Outbound interest allocation rules should not apply to New Zealand companies that are owned and controlled by New Zealand residents Submissions (21 – NZ Oil and Gas, 32 – KPMG, 40 – Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, 59 – Fletcher Building, 66 – Telecom, 68 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 73 – Seniors Money International, 78 – Seaworks) The proposed interest allocation provisions do not take into account that the imputation rules provide an incentive for New Zealand-owned companies to pay tax in New Zealand. The imputation rules mean that New Zealand-owned firms have no incentive to allocate excessive debt to New Zealand. If interest allocation rules for outbound investment are to be introduced, they should only apply to those entities that currently are within the scope of the thin capitalisation rules – that is, non-residents and New Zealand companies owned by non-residents. 104 Comment It is important that the interest allocation rules apply to New Zealand-owned companies as well as to foreign-owned firms. Imputation does provide some limited protection for the New Zealand tax base. However, exempt active income will only be taxed to New Zealand shareholders if and when it is repatriated to the New Zealand parent and if and when the parent company subsequently distributes the income to the shareholder. New Zealand will suffer a tax loss if the repatriation of the income and its distribution to New Zealand shareholders is delayed. The New Zealand shareholder may also never be taxed on CFC income if, for instance, the sale of the shares in the CFC takes place before repatriation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application of interest allocation rules to smaller entities Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The outbound interest allocation rules should not apply to entities that meet two of the following criteria: • turnover of less than $10m; • assets of less than $20m; • fewer than 50 staff. Submission (38 – New Zealand Council of Trade Unions) Although the interest allocation rules might place a disproportionate compliance burden on SMEs, the rules should not contain any distinction between firms based on their size. Comment There is no reason in principle to completely exclude SMEs from the interest allocation rules. If the rules did not apply to SMEs, it would be possible for smaller enterprises to load excessive amounts of debt into their New Zealand operations. Although the loss to the tax base in each individual case might be limited, the cumulative effect could well be significant. 105 However, it is true that smaller firms can sometimes find it more difficult than larger firms to borrow in overseas jurisdictions and can encounter greater difficulties in pushing debt down into their CFCs. The compliance requirements of the interest allocation rules could also in some cases be more burdensome for smaller firms than for larger groups. The interest allocation provisions currently in the bill contain certain features that are intended to mitigate any potential impact on SMEs, particularly the minimum threshold of $250,000 for interest deductions below which the rules do not apply. Officials have considered whether any further provision should be made for SMEs in the rules. After consultation with firms and professional advisers, officials recommend that the minimum threshold of $250,000 should be increased to $1 million. Officials also recommend that the impact of the interest allocation rules should be mitigated for firms that breach the 75 percent debt percentage safe harbour and have interest deductions of between $1 million and $2 million. The formula by which this would be achieved would ensure that the amount of relief available was gradually reduced, so that a firm with just over $1 million of interest deduction that breached the 75 percent safe harbour would get almost full relief, while a firm with nearly $2 million worth of deductions would get virtually no relief. Where a firm had deductions of more than $2 million, this recommended concession would have no effect. Gradually withdrawing the concession for firms with deductions of more than $1 million avoids the possible cliff-edge effect of a pure “de minimis” threshold. This concession is based on interest deductions rather than company size, so at first sight it might appear not to be focused on SMEs. However, the concession will only be of practical benefit to SMEs. Any large company with interest deductions of under $2 million would be well within the 75 percent debt percentage safe harbour, so this concession would not provide any additional benefit for such companies. It should be emphasised that there is no significant evidence that the interest allocation rules as currently drafted would have a major impact on SMEs at the moment. So the recommended extensions of the concessions do not address immediate concerns. They are instead designed to mitigate any potential impact on SMEs as they expand overseas in future years. Recommendation That the submissions be declined, but that the current minimum threshold below which the interest allocation rules do not apply be raised from $250,000 to $1 million, and some relief be available for firms with interest deductions of between $1 million and $2 million. 106 Issue: Interest allocation rules should not apply to individuals resident in New Zealand Submission (68B – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The interest allocation rules should not apply to individuals. Comment There is no reason to differentiate between individuals and companies that own CFCs. Specifically, there is no reason to allow individuals with interests in CFCs to deduct excessive amounts of debt against income from their New Zealand operations. In practice, the rules will usually apply to companies with interests in CFCs because, as a commercial reality, multi-national operations are usually organised through corporate structures. But the rules should apply to New Zealand-resident individuals and trustees of trusts settled by New Zealand residents. Otherwise arrangements could be put in place to circumvent the rules by adjusting the ownership structure of companies. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: There should be a transitional period during which the new rules do not apply to existing financing arrangements Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 66 – Telecom) There should be a grandparenting period to allow taxpayers to undertake a review of their current financing arrangements. Reviewing current financing arrangements and, if necessary, seeking alternative sources of finance can be time-consuming. The grandparenting could therefore take the form of an additional safe harbour equal to the debt existing on 1 December 2007 and apply for five years from that date. Comment Transitional arrangements of this sort tend to be complex from a legislative perspective. The effect of the interest allocation rules on financing arrangements that are already in place is not expected to be widespread. This is because safe harbours are relatively generous. Officials have also recommended further changes to minimum thresholds which should mitigate any potential impact on the existing financial arrangements of small and medium-sized firms. On balance, there appears no practical need for grandparenting arrangements. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 107 Issue: The proposed expansion of a natural person’s New Zealand group for the purposes of the inbound interest allocation rules should not proceed Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) New section FE 3 (inbound) expands the non-resident natural person’s New Zealand group to include all associated persons who are resident in New Zealand, or who are not resident but are trading through a permanent establishment, or who derive other income from New Zealand. It is not clear why the existing rules for inbound thin capitalisation have been changed. This extension is not appropriate as the debt of the associated person of a natural person should not be brought into account for the purposes of the interest allocation rules. Comment Under the current rules a non-resident natural person’s New Zealand group comprises only that person. This can produce anomalous results when compared with the current treatment of non-resident companies. Currently, for interest allocation purposes, where a non-resident company owns a New Zealand company the New Zealand group consists of the non-resident company, the New Zealand company and any foreign subsidiaries owned by the New Zealand company. However, under the current rules, if a non-resident individual owns a New Zealand company which in turns owns foreign subsidiaries, the New Zealand company and its subsidiaries do not form part of the individual’s group. This is anomalous and could open up opportunities for arbitrage. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The 75 percent safe harbour should be raised to 80 percent or 85 percent for companies that are mainly New Zealand-owned Submission (32 – KPMG) The 75 percent safe harbour should be increased to reflect the difficulties faced by New Zealand-owned companies in obtaining overseas financing for expansion abroad. Comment The 75 percent safe harbour is already generous. It represents a level of gearing significantly higher than would be found in most firms. In the early phase of the international tax review the possibility of a lower threshold was raised. However, the government decided not to pursue a lower threshold because of the commercial 108 difficulties firms might face in borrowing offshore. But increasing the level of the safe harbour would defeat the purpose of the interest allocation rules by allowing firms to allocate excessive amounts of debt against the New Zealand tax base. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The 75 percent safe harbour should be increased for financial institutions Submission (73 – Deloitte, for Seniors Money International) The 75 percent safe harbour is not appropriate for financial institutions as these will often have very high levels of gearing. Comment The on-lending concession in the interest allocation rules should help financial institutions. The concession recognises that it can often be cheaper or more practical for New Zealand multi-nationals to raise debt in New Zealand to fund their offshore operations. New Zealand companies can then shift the debt costs offshore through intra-group loans. Under the on-lending concession, where loans are provided by a New Zealand company to its CFCs on arm’s-length terms, the total debt and total assets in the group debt percentage ratio are both reduced by the on-lent amount. This adjustment removes the on-lent amount from the safe harbour calculation. The concession should be of particular benefit to financial institutions given their high levels of gearing and their potential need to provide funding to offshore subsidiaries. Another feature of the rules that mitigates any potential effect on financial institutions is the second safe harbour that complements the 75 percent debt percentage threshold. This second safe harbour ensures that the interest allocation rules do not apply provided the debt percentage of the New Zealand group does not exceed 110 percent of the worldwide group’s debt percentage. Provided the business model (including gearing) used by the New Zealand part of a business is in line with the world-wide group, the interest allocation rules should not have an impact. Given these features, there is no justification for increasing the safe harbour for these entities. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 109 Issue: The safe harbour for SMEs should be based on the formula used for the interest allocation rules in the conduit rules, rather than fixed at 75 percent Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The interest allocation rules as they apply to SMEs should be based on the interest allocation rules in the conduit provisions. Under these rules there is no interest allocation restriction provided that the overall level of funding of the New Zealand assets does not exceed that of the consolidated group (including non-grey list CFC debts and assets). Alternatively, the 75 percent should be an initial safe harbour, with taxpayers being allowed to undertake a full consolidation with CFCs if that gives a higher base percentage than 75 percent. Comment These suggestions would effectively relax the interest allocation rules in some cases by allowing CFC assets to count in the measurement of a base percentage threshold. The 75 percent safe harbour is already very generous, and relaxing the rules in this way would undermine the basic purpose of the rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The exclusion of interests in CFC from the calculation of total group assets should not apply when that CFC income is passive Submission (26 – Fonterra, 35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 53 – Ernst & Young, 66 – Telecom, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) New section FE 16(1B) excludes CFC investments from the calculation of total group assets. However, CFCs that fail the active business test will continue to attribute their passive income to their New Zealand shareholders and those shareholders will pay tax on that income. Since the income will be taxable, New Zealand firms should not be denied an interest deduction for money borrowed to fund the passive CFC. Only active CFC interests should be excluded from the definition of assets. Passive CFC investments should be included, perhaps with an adjustment to reflect any attribution of passive income which has foreign tax credits that would reduce New Zealand tax payable. 110 Comment In practice, many CFCs will produce both exempt active and passive income. Establishing apportionment rules to differentiate between interest costs that related to active CFC income and those that related to passive CFC income would introduce significant complexity. The rules would also need to account for foreign tax credits that would be provided to offset the New Zealand tax liabilities on passive income, the calculation of which should, in theory, include an appropriate share of the interest costs. Given that the interest allocation rules are simply intended as a minimum backstop to protect the New Zealand tax base, designing complex rules to address the issues in this area is not appropriate. It is worth noting that Australia does not provide special rules for entities with outbound passive investments. Interest costs incurred by Australian entities with CFCs with passive investments are subject to their interest allocation rules, while the passive income is also taxed on accrual. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Internally generated goodwill should be included in total group assets under section FE 16(1) Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Internally generated goodwill is a genuine business asset. Companies can borrow against this goodwill but, since the goodwill is not recognised in their asset base for interest allocation purposes, they may be denied a deduction for interest on the funds borrowed. Comment The rules for measuring a group’s asset base need to be robust and take account of generally accepted accounting practice. Following the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, internally generated goodwill is no longer recognised for accounting purposes. This reduces total reported assets. There is no reason for the interest allocation asset measurement rules to depart from generally accepted accounting practice. It is very difficult to establish an independent value for internally generated goodwill. Including it in the group’s assets could artificially inflate the New Zealand asset base, thus undermining the interest allocation rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 111 Issue: It should be possible to use the market value for all assets, rather than the value in financial statements, when measuring assets Submission (68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) As the provisions are currently drafted, a group would only be able to value trading stock at market value. All other assets would have to be valued on other bases – for example, according to the financial statements, or at net current value. The impact of the interest allocation rules could be mitigated, especially for SMEs, by allowing groups to use market valuations for all assets Comment It is important to have robust rules for the measurement of a group’s asset base. Without these, the interest allocation rules will not work effectively. The market value of trading stock is relatively easy to establish. However, the market value of other assets is far less easy to establish, and robust rules based on generally accepted accounting practice are required. Otherwise there would be a risk that closely held companies could attribute an artificially high value to some of their assets. This would inflate the value of their New Zealand asset base and thus defeat the purpose of the interest allocation rules. However, the rules do contain a number of design features that should mitigate any potential impact on SMEs. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Fixed-rate shares should be excluded from the scope of the interest allocation rules Submission (24A – New Zealand Law Society, 35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 68 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Payments for fixed-rate shares should not be added to interest deductions and fixed- rate shares should not be counted as part of group debt for the purpose of the interest allocation rules. By treating fixed-rate shares as debt, the proposed rules potentially penalise taxpayers by treating as notional income an amount of supposed interest (that is, the dividend on a fixed-rate share) for which no deduction can be claimed. Fixed- rate shares should be treated as equity, and payments in relation to the shares should be treated as dividends, for all tax purposes. The arbitrary reclassification of fixed- rate shares as debt for the purposes of the interest allocation rules is inequitable and unjustifiable. 112 Comment Fixed-rate shares issued to New Zealand taxpayers should be treated as debt for the purposes of the interest allocation rules. The after-tax financing costs of these shares are the same as debt financing (since imputation credits can be attached to these shares) and they have commercial characteristics that are substitutable with debt. If fixed-rate shares were not treated as debt, taxpayers could circumvent the proposed interest allocation rules by issuing fixed-rate shares instead of commercial debt to New Zealand taxpayers. This would undermine the protection for the tax base provided by the 75 percent debt-to-asset ratio. There are various examples in New Zealand and overseas of taxpayers using fixed- rate shares as debt substitutes to gain after-tax financing advantages. Since the interest allocation rules are designed as a basic backstop to protect the tax base, the effect of including fixed-rate shares within the scope of the rules should be minimal for companies financing themselves on normal commercial terms. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Grandparenting rules should be introduced for financing arrangements involving fixed-rate shares and redeemable preference shares Submission (24A – New Zealand Law Society, 35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Grandparenting rules should be included for taxpayers that currently have financing structures involving the issue of fixed-rate shares or redeemable preference shares. Taxpayers with these structures in place may be adversely affected by the interest allocation rules. It may be possible for these taxpayers to re-finance in order to remain below the safe-harbour thresholds, but this process will take time. A grandparenting period of say, five years for these financing arrangements would be appropriate and would be in line with the policy adopted for the purposes of the banking thin capitalisation rules when they were enacted. Comment Grandparenting arrangements can sometimes be justified when changes in tax law have a significant effect on commercial arrangements that taxpayers have previously put in place. However, the interest allocation rules are simply a basic backstop to protect the New Zealand tax base in the future. They are not intended to be a complex set of rules catering for every situation, because the majority of taxpayers should not be affected by the rules. In this context, complicated grandparenting arrangements for fixed-rate and preference shares are not appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 113 Issue: The interest allocation rules need to address the treatment of foreign exchange losses Submission (68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The interest allocation rules need to take account of foreign exchange losses where foreign exchange gains may also arise with respect to a debt instrument in a different income year. Foreign exchange losses are treated as an interest expense, and where a firm breaches the 75 percent safe harbour, the deductibility of interest expenses will be restricted. However, foreign exchange gains will always be taxable on debt instruments. This lack of symmetry should be addressed, especially as it will generally be the New Zealand headquarters that bears a group’s foreign currency risk. Comment The interest allocation rules for outbound investment are intended to provide basic protection for the New Zealand tax base in the future. They are not intended to be a sophisticated set of detailed rules catering for every eventuality and, wherever possible, they build on the existing apportionment rules for thin capitalisation. Thus, in their treatment of foreign exchange gains and losses, they reflect the current treatment in the thin capitalisation rules. In practice, the outbound interest allocation rules would only affect the deductibility of foreign exchange losses when companies were already highly geared. However, it would be normal for companies with significant amounts of debt denominated in foreign currency to have hedging arrangements in place which should largely offset any exchange loss. In this context, when it is unlikely that there will be major problems for firms engaged in normal commercial transactions, the development of special rules to cater for the treatment of foreign currency gains and losses would add unnecessary complexity to the interest allocation rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The treatment of deductible foreign equity under section FE 16(1b) is anomalous Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Under the legislation as currently drafted, fixed-rate foreign equity held by a New Zealand group in its CFCs that is eligible for the on-lending concession can be included in the measurement of the New Zealand group’s assets. However, deductible foreign equity will not be eligible for the on-lending concession and will 114 therefore not be eligible for inclusion as part of the New Zealand group’s assets. This is an anomalous and inequitable outcome, as dividends from a CFC’s fixed-rate shares and a CFC’s deductible foreign dividends will both be subject to New Zealand tax when received by the New Zealand group. Comment The bill classifies fixed-rate foreign equity as a financial arrangement and deductible foreign equity distributions as interest. In response to submissions opposing these classifications, officials recommend that both fixed-rate foreign dividends and deductible foreign dividends be treated as non-exempt (that is, taxable) dividends. This treatment will mean that fixed-rate foreign equity is not a financial arrangement and therefore it will not be eligible for the on-lending concession. This is appropriate, as without the financial arrangement spreading rule, a fixed-rate dividend could be used to defer tax. This means that fixed-rate foreign equity and deductible foreign equity will be treated consistently. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Calculation of debt percentages Submission (Matter raised by officials) Officials have discussed the matter of calculating debt percentages with professional advisers. It is clear from these discussions that there is a strong case for catering for the situation where a New Zealand group puts more equity into its CFCs than exists in the New Zealand group. Comment Where a New Zealand group puts more equity into its CFCs than exists in the New Zealand group, the New Zealand group assets may be reduced to zero (because of the effect of new section FE 16(1B)). The debt percentage of the New Zealand group would then be impossible to calculate, as the debt percentage is found by dividing the amount of total group debt by the amount of total group assets. Although in practice it would be very unlikely that a New Zealand group would fund its CFCs with more equity than the group itself possesses, the draft legislation should be amended to ensure that the interest allocation rules do work effectively in these situations. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 115 Issue: Associated persons and interest allocation rules Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) It is not clear how an associated person’s debts and assets should be measured in working out the consolidated debts and assets of a natural person or trustee for the purposes of new section FE 14(2) and (3). This should be clarified. Comment The general aim of the associated persons provisions is to counter non-arm’s length transactions that could undermine the intent of the tax legislation. For the purposes of the interest allocation rules as they apply to natural persons or trustees, it is necessary to include associated persons in the definition of the New Zealand group in section FE 3. If the group simply consisted of a natural person or a trustee, then individuals or trustees could get around the interest allocation rules by using close associates to take on excessive amounts of debt in New Zealand, while CFC income was exempt. In many cases a natural person or trustee should have little or no difficulty in measuring the debts and assets of an associated person such as a company they wholly own. However officials will monitor this area and, if practical problems do arise, we will consider providing guidance. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: References in sections FE 6(3)(ab) and FE 15(1)(b) to fixed-rate foreign equity should be replaced with a reference to fixed-rate shares Submission (24A – New Zealand Law Society, 35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) References in these sections to fixed-rate foreign equity are not effective. This is because a New Zealand company is by definition not a foreign company, so cannot issue fixed-rate foreign equity as defined in the bill. The sections should instead refer to fixed-rate shares. Comment Officials agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 116 Issue: Drafting of new subparagraph FE 1(1)(a)(i) Submission (53 – Ernst & Young) The words “(an outbound entity)” in proposed new subparagraph FE 1(1) (a) (i) should be placed after “CFC” so that it qualifies the whole of the phrase “a New Zealand resident with an income interest in a CFC” rather than just “a New Zealand resident”. The present wording could suggest that the thin capitalisation rules apply to any New Zealand resident controlling any other New Zealand resident. Comment In context, the words “(an outbound entity)” do not seem misleading. The suggested alternative, of placing the words “(an outbound entity)” immediately after “CFC”, could itself lead readers of the legislation to construe the CFC as the “outbound entity”. On balance, it seems preferable to retain the existing word order. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Paragraphs FE 3(1)(c) and (2)(c) should be relocated to section FE 5 Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Paragraphs FE 3(1)(c) and (2)(c) provide that, in the calculation of the total assets of a natural person, the person’s private and domestic assets should be ignored. This subsection would be better placed in the amended section FE 5(1). This is because the person’s total assets are not referred to in section FE 3 but are referred to in section FE 5. Comment Officials agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 117 Issue: The outbound interest allocation rules should apply only when the income interest in a CFC is greater than 10 percent Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The proposed rules on interest allocation should apply only when a New Zealand resident has an income interest of 10 percent or greater in a CFC. This is not achieved by the current draft provisions. Comment Officials consider this outcome is achieved by clause 408(65) which makes the necessary changes to the definition of “income interest” in section YA 1. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Clarity of drafting in new section FE 4 Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The terms “excess debt outbound entity” and “excess debt entity” are confusing and may lead to confusion in applying the rules. These terms imply that the relevant companies have too much debt, rather than that they are companies that are required to comply with the interest allocation rules. Even if the terms are retained, the drafting of section FE 4 could be made more consistent. The amendment made by clause 157 for outbound companies refers to the specific relevant paragraphs of section FE 2, while the FE 4 references covering inbound entities refer generally to FE 2 rather than to the specific relevant paragraphs. Section FE 4 should be amended to refer the definitions of the existing terms, such as excess debt entity, to the specific paragraphs of section FE 2 as the new outbound rules do. Comment “Excess debt entity” is the term used in the current legislation for interest apportionment on thin capitalisation and has not caused confusion amongst companies or advisers to date. The term “excess debt outbound entity” builds on the existing definition of “excess debt entity” and should be readily understood in context by those who need to apply the new rules. 118 It is necessary to specify the relevant paragraphs of section FE 4 in defining an “excess debt outbound company” because the definition rests on whether certain specific paragraphs do or do not apply. The definition of “excess debt entity” does not require this distinction. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Reference to “value” in new section FE 16 (1B) Submission (68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Section FE 16(1B) provides that the value of any CFC investment should be excluded in calculating total group assets. It should be made clear that the reference to value is a reference to the value of these assets as determined under section FE 16(1). Comment Section FE 16(1B) follows immediately after section FE 16(1) and qualifies the application of that section. Given this context, it seems superfluous to emphasise the bases on which the value of the CFC investment should be arrived at. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Apportionment under paragraph FE 16(1B)(b) Submission (68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) It is not clear how the apportionment of equity value in paragraph FE 16(lB)(b) is intended to work. Further detail is required. Comment Officials do not see any major difficulty with this apportionment. Taxpayers with interests in CFCs should be able to work out the extent to which a CFC derives income covered by paragraph FE 16(1B)(b), and then apply the relevant proportion to their CFC investments. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 119 Issue: Omission of “group” in new wording of section FE 18(4) Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The word “group” should be inserted after “worldwide” in the proposed rewording of section FE 18(4). Comment Officials agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Identification of New Zealand parent Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The provision in new section FE 26(2)(c) that identifies the New Zealand parent as the excess debt outbound company where no New Zealand-resident company has a 50 percent or greater interest in the company should be moved elsewhere. It does not sit sensibly in section FE 26. In addition, the interaction of sections FE 26(2)(c) and FE 26(4B) is confusing. Comment Section FE 26(2) sets out the circumstances in which an excess debt entity should be treated as the New Zealand parent. Section FE 26(2)(c) refers to circumstances in which no single company resident in New Zealand has an ownership interest in the entity of 50 percent or more. There does not seem to be any obvious confusion in this structure. The proposed wording of sections FE 26(2) and FE 26 (4) seems to work in a sensible fashion. Section FE 26(2)(c) refers to the situation in which no single company resident in New Zealand has an ownership interest in the entity of 50 percent or more; section FE 26(4B) refers to a situation where a New Zealand-resident company has an ownership interest of 50 percent or more in the entity. The demarcation here seems clear. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 120 Issue: Identification of members of the New Zealand group Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) In the list of definitions at the end of section FE 28, a definition of “control” is included in the list but this is repealed in clause 408. This should be removed. This will also eliminate the need for paragraph 2. Comment Officials agree that “control” should be omitted from the list of defined terms at the end of section FE 28. However paragraphs (2) and (3) of that section are required to set out the rules that should apply to excess debt entities that are not identified under section FE 27 as being under the control of the New Zealand parent. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part. Issue: Definition of “worldwide group” Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) In section FE 31B(2), a worldwide GAAP group is defined as “all non-residents who are required to be included with the company in the consolidated financial statement under GAAP”. Under NZ IAS 27 it is conceivable that a company may not have to consolidate its financial statements even when it has an attributing income interest in a CFC – for example, if the parent is itself a wholly owned or partially owned subsidiary or if the parent’s debt and equity instruments are not traded in a public market. Comment The conditions set out in IAS 27 under which consolidation is not required are fairly stringent. It is therefore difficult to envisage a situation when the ultimate New Zealand parent or another member of the company’s New Zealand group would not be required to produce consolidated financial statements that would include any subsidiaries that owned CFCs and those CFC interests themselves. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 121 Issue: Drafting of section FE 31B(2) Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) In section FE 31B(2), “statement” should read “statements”. Comment Officials agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 122 FOREIGN DIVIDEND EXEMPTION Clauses 5, 6, 13, 16, 32, 53, 54, 55, 98, 122, 126, 184, 189, 190, 192, 199, 200, 254, 277, 286–288, 290–295, 299–304, 306, 330, 332, 340, 342–348, 352, 353, 370, 373– 376, 391, 392, 396, 398, 408, 409, 433, 434, 452, 468, 469, 483, 486, 487, 489, 496, 497, 500, 501, 505–507, 512, 514 and 515 Issue: Taxation of fixed-rate foreign equity and deductible foreign equity Submissions (24A – New Zealand Law Society, 35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 67– New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 68 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The taxation of dividends paid in respect of fixed-rate foreign equity and deductible foreign equity should be reconsidered. These dividends should be exempt (as per ordinary foreign dividends) as it is not clear that they pose a risk to the tax base and taxing these distributions could disadvantage New Zealand firms relative to investors based in other countries who are not taxed on such distributions. Alternatively, if the above submission is not accepted, fixed-rate dividends should only be taxed when they are deductible in the foreign jurisdiction. Comment The bill exempts foreign dividends received by a company or CFC except for dividends that are deductible in the foreign jurisdiction and dividends from fixed-rate shares. These two exceptions are consistent with the approach in the existing international tax rules where these dividends do not qualify for underlying foreign tax credits. An exemption for deductible dividends would pose significant risks to the domestic tax base. This is because a deductible dividend would reduce or eliminate tax imposed in the offshore jurisdiction, resulting in an effective exemption there and in New Zealand. This could create an incentive to shift New Zealand activity offshore. For example, consider a situation where a New Zealand company can earn $100 of active income in New Zealand, or in a CFC which faces foreign tax of 30% (the same as in New Zealand), but which is allowed a deduction for its dividends. The company would earn $70 after tax from performing the activities in New Zealand. However, by moving the activities into the CFC and paying a deductible dividend back to the New Zealand company, the company could earn an after-tax return of $100, (depending on the rate of foreign withholding taxes) if New Zealand did not tax the dividend. 123 It is also appropriate to tax fixed-rate dividends, even if there is no deduction for the dividend payer. Otherwise, in certain circumstances, a fixed-rate share could be used in place of a loan in order to gain a tax advantage. Again, this is a form of tax arbitrage which gives rise to base maintenance concerns. This arbitrage opportunity would most likely arise when the tax rate in the foreign jurisdiction is lower than the New Zealand tax rate. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Taxation of fixed-rate foreign equity Submission (24A – New Zealand Law Society) Fixed-rate foreign dividends should be exempt if the holder of foreign fixed-rate equity holds a voting interest of at least 10 percent. The rationale for this is that a holder of at least 10 percent of the voting rights in a CFC is an equity investor, and so is not acting as an “in substance” lender. Comment The risks associated with exempting fixed-rate foreign dividends are no lower if a company has a 10 percent interest in the foreign company. If anything, there is more risk from a closely held CFC using a fixed-rate share in place of debt in order to gain a tax advantage. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Reclassification of fixed-rate foreign equity as a financial arrangement Submissions (24A – New Zealand Law Society, 32 – KPMG, 35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 60 – ASB, 62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 68 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Fixed-rate foreign equity should not be reclassified as a financial arrangement debt. A change to the debt/equity boundary is outside the scope of the international tax review and should be considered as part of a broader review. The financial arrangement rules could be difficult to apply to fixed-rate shares as companies would have to spread future income and take into account foreign exchange fluctuations. 124 If fixed-rate foreign equity is treated as a financial arrangement, then: • the measure should not apply to existing instruments; • the measure should not apply to imputed dividends paid by an Australian CFC; and • foreign exchange gains and losses should be disregarded. To prevent the possibility of double taxation, deductible dividends and fixed-rate dividends should be exempt when a taxpayer is attributing income from both a payer CFC and payee CFC. Comment The bill reclassifies fixed-rate foreign equity as a financial arrangement and deductible foreign equity distributions as interest. Officials received many submissions opposing this approach. Arguments against it included: • The change is not minimal – it goes further than simply replacing the foreign dividend payment (FDP) and branch equivalent tax accounts (BETA) mechanisms. A change to the debt/equity boundary is outside the scope of the international tax review and should be considered as part of a broader review. • The changes increase compliance costs and may jeopardise existing commercial arrangements. These concerns, as well as the more specific issues raised in the above submissions, would be eliminated by treating fixed-rate foreign dividends and deductible foreign dividends as non-exempt dividends. Recommendation That the submissions be declined, but that fixed-rate foreign dividends and deductible foreign dividends be treated as non-exempt dividends. To mitigate any double taxation, a deduction should be allowed for a CFC paying these dividends in cases where they would be taxable (that is, paid to a New Zealand company or another CFC). 125 Issue: Reclassification of fixed-rate foreign equity – technical issues Submissions (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Some drafting and technical issues need to be addressed if the bill goes ahead with reclassifying fixed-rate foreign equity financial arrangements and deductible foreign equity distributions as interest. Specifically: • A provision is required to determine the opening value of fixed-rate foreign equity. • Fixed-rate foreign equity is reclassified as a financial arrangement in section EW 5(13), while dividends paid on fixed-rate foreign equity are treated as interest in section CD 36(B). This could cause these dividends to be counted as passive income twice. • In section CD 36B(1), the words “the company of a company resident in New Zealand” should be replaced with “the company held by a company resident in New Zealand”. • Section CD 36(B) should be reworded so that it includes distributions in respect of an interest held by a CFC. Comment Officials now recommend that fixed-rate and deductible foreign dividends be treated as a non-exempt dividend. This would negate the need for these technical changes. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Note that these issues will automatically be resolved if fixed-rate and deductible foreign dividends are treated as non-exempt dividends as in the above recommendation. Issue: Definition of “deductible foreign equity” Submission (24A – New Zealand Law Society) Paragraph (b) of the definition of “deductible foreign equity” is too broad and is likely to be unworkable in practice. This paragraph makes an otherwise exempt dividend taxable if it is sourced directly or indirectly from an amount that is paid to the foreign company by another company if the foreign company is not liable for income tax on the amount and the other company is able to claim a deduction for the amount. The purpose of this “look-through” rule is to ensure that a second foreign company cannot be interposed into the middle of a transaction to convert a deductible dividend into an ordinary dividend. 126 There are some circumstances where the application of this rule would be inconsistent with the intent of the active income exemption. For example, the amount from which the dividend is paid could have been a fee for goods or services that the foreign company has provided. In this case, the ordinary dividend could be sourced out of active income (as opposed to a deductible dividend). Paragraph (b) should be qualified by a requirement that the amount must be paid in respect of a financial arrangement or a share. Comment The definition for “deductible foreign equity” duplicates wording currently used in the underlying foreign tax credit rules, which are being replaced by the dividend exemption. Other changes in the bill ensure that deductible dividends are taxed when received by a CFC – this reduces (but does not eliminate) the need for the “look-through” rule referred to above. The submission identifies some examples where the current rule would lead to inappropriate results. Clarifying the definition in the way the submission suggests would carve out such transactions without creating significant additional risk to the New Zealand tax base. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and that paragraph (b) of the definition of deductible foreign equity be qualified by a requirement that the amount must be paid in respect of a financial arrangement or a share. Issue: Definition of “fixed-rate foreign equity” Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Paragraph (d) of the definition of “fixed-rate foreign equity” is too broad/unclear. Comment It is necessary to tax dividends paid in respect of fixed-rate foreign equity otherwise these could be used in place of a loan to gain a tax advantage. Paragraph (d) is consistent with this rationale and ensures that fixed-rate foreign equity includes any dividends that are “equivalent to the payment of interest for money lent”. This definition must be broad because dividends are excluded from the financial arrangement rules. This means that a dividend that was a substitute for an interest payment would be exempt unless it was captured by the fixed-rate foreign equity definition. 127 The definition of “fixed-rate foreign equity” duplicates wording that is currently used in the underlying foreign tax credit rules, which are being replaced by the dividend exemption. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Dividends from grey list FIFs Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Section CW 9, which is modified to make dividends from non-attributing portfolio FIFs subject to income tax, should apply to interests of greater than 10 percent also. Comment It is appropriate that the dividend exemption apply to greater than 10 percent interests in FIFs as this is consistent with maintaining the grey list exemption for non-portfolio FIFs until the active income exemption is extended to them. At the moment a dividend that a company receives from a greater than 10 percent interest in a grey list FIF is covered by a deemed underlying foreign tax credit. This is equivalent to a dividend exemption. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Drafting matters Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Section CD 53(3) removes the reference to section CW 11. However, section CW 11 is not repealed. Comment The submission is correct; the reference to section CW 11 should not be removed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 128 Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The reference to “FDP credit” in section CD 53(2) should be removed. Comment Under the proposed reform, no new FDP credits will be generated. However, companies will still be able to attach FDP credits to their dividends so the reference to “FDP credit” in section CD 53(2) should remain in place. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 129 TRANSITIONAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL MATTERS Clauses 30, 60, 147, 176–178, 193, 195, 220, 251, 253, 269, 273, 308–322, 350, 354–367, 408 and 488 Overview This chapter discusses submissions on transitional and consequential matters arising from exemptions for offshore active income and foreign dividends introduced by the bill. The submissions fall into three categories: • Those dealing with the transitional rules for attributed CFC net losses and foreign tax credits. The effect of these rules is that attributed CFC net losses and foreign tax credits accrued under the current rules can be carried forward into the new system, but will continue to be reduced by reference to total CFC net income (including non-attributable income). • Those dealing with the repeal of various memorandum accounts, namely conduit tax relief (CTR) accounts, branch equivalent tax accounts (BETAs), and foreign dividend payment (FDP) accounts. The bill effectively suspends these accounts. CTR companies will be able to continue to attach CTR credits to any dividends they distribute to their non-resident shareholders for a period of two years. Existing BETA debit balances can also be carried forward and used for a two-year transitional period. Existing FDP credit balances can be carried forward and used for a five-year transitional period. • Miscellaneous consequential matters. Issue: Transitional loss carry-forward and tax credit rules – general approach Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Losses and foreign tax credits accrued under the existing rules should remain available without restriction under the new rules. Comment Allowing unrestricted relief for historical losses would be problematic. As a basic principle, there should be a nexus between expenditure and taxable income for an amount to be allowed as a deduction and for a net loss to arise. Once offshore active income is effectively exempt, no such nexus will exist for expenditure (and therefore net losses) incurred to derive this income. Looked at another way, full relief from New Zealand tax will already have been given on the income to which these active net losses relate. There is no reason to provide further relief against other income, which would simply erode the tax base and prevent the effective taxation of attributable income. 130 Similar concerns arise in relation to foreign tax credits. Allowing historical credits to be applied without restriction would be inconsistent with the general principle that credits under subpart LK are available for foreign tax paid on income that is also taxable in New Zealand, up to the amount of the New Zealand tax liability on that income. The purpose of these credits is to prevent double taxation, not to allow attributable income to be sheltered from New Zealand tax. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Transitional loss carry-forward and tax credit rules Submissions (26 – Fonterra, 30 – Staples Rodway, 35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 53 – Ernst & Young, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 68/68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The transitional rules for historical losses and credits should be redrafted and/or simplified. (Staples Rodway, PricewaterhouseCoopers, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Corporate Taxpayers Group) A simpler mechanism should be introduced to determine the availability of historical losses and/or credits. Approaches suggested are: • allowing taxpayers to use figures from a one- or two-year period to fix the value of their historical losses/credits for later years; • allowing taxpayers to use accounting results or local jurisdiction tax results as a proxy for branch equivalent income; • allowing taxpayers to opt for a fixed conversion ratio, to be specified in the legislation; • allowing taxpayers to convert historical losses/credits based on the attributable income percentage used for the purposes of the active business test. (Fonterra, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) To reduce compliance costs, taxpayers should be given the option of either cancelling their historical losses/credits or transferring them to a separate memorandum account for a limited period. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The calculation should be made on a pro rata basis (in other words, the requirement to set historical losses/credits against non-attributable income first should be dropped). (PricewaterhouseCoopers, Corporate Taxpayers Group) Section LK 5B(2)(a) is not very clear in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) regarding the description of non-attributed CFC liability. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) 131 Comment Transitional rules restricting the value of historical losses and historical foreign tax credits are appropriate and necessary. Submissions on the bill generally accept the policy underpinning the proposed rules. However, a number of practical concerns have been raised. Among those who have made submissions on the rules, there is a degree of consensus that they are difficult to understand and will impose on-going compliance costs on the limited number of firms to which they apply. As a result, officials propose a revised approach to historical losses and foreign tax credits. Some degree of complexity is unavoidable, but the modified approach should make the rules easier to apply, and significantly reduce on-going compliance costs. The new approach can be summarised as follows: • Historical losses and credits will be available for carry-forward in the usual way, but kept separate from losses incurred and credits accrued under the new rules. • Attributable income as a proportion of branch equivalent income for the year will be calculated for the wholly owned group of which the interest holder is a member. The calculation will be carried out separately for each relevant jurisdiction. The net income figure (exclusive of tax expenses) from financial accounts can be used as a proxy for branch equivalent income for these purposes. • This fraction will be applied to determine the effective value of historical losses and credits as they are used. Put simply, if a person has attributable income of $100 and branch equivalent income of $150 in a year, historical losses and credits will be used up at the rate of $1.50 for every $1 of taxable income or tax offset for that year. • To reduce complexity, there will be no special rule for the year in which historical losses or credits run out. In other words, there will be no requirement for historical losses and credits to be used first against non-attributable income or notional tax on such income. (This is concessionary.) • To ensure that historical losses and credits do not remain indefinitely, there will be a requirement for a minimum amount of historical losses and/or credits for a jurisdiction to be “used” each year. (Otherwise, taxpayers with CFCs that generally satisfy the active business test and therefore have no attributable income might never “use up” their transitional losses/credits.) • To reduce on-going compliance costs, taxpayers can elect to convert all historical losses and credits into new losses and credits using figures from the two preceding years. Elections will be made on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis and will apply to all New Zealand companies in the same wholly owned group. A single election will cover both losses and credits. Elections will be irrevocable. 132 • There are two important limitations on the right to make an election: – The earliest year for which an election can be made is two years after the rules for non-portfolio FIFs are reformed. This is because the measure of attributable income will change at the point the FIF rules are reformed, affecting the appropriate conversion rate. – An election will only be permitted for a jurisdiction if the taxpayer (or the wholly owned group of which the taxpayer is a member) actually has branch equivalent income from that jurisdiction in each of the two preceding years. This is because, if a taxpayer (or wholly owned group) does not have at least one CFC or branch equivalent FIF in the jurisdiction in each of those two years, or if the taxpayer’s (or group’s) overall position is a branch equivalent loss from the jurisdiction, the appropriate correct conversion rate will generally be unclear. • At any time, a taxpayer can elect not to carry forward historical losses and credits from a particular jurisdiction. Again, elections will be made on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis and will be irrevocable. A single election will cover both losses and credits. Recommendation That the transitional rules for historical losses and historical credits be amended as described. Issue: Transitional loss carry-forward and tax credit rules – technical and drafting matters Submissions (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The heading to section IQ 2(1B) should read “attributed CFC net losses from 2009–10 or later income years”. (PricewaterhouseCoopers, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The transitional rules for losses in section IQ 2(1C)(a)(ii) should refer to branch equivalent income from a particular jurisdiction. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The transition rules for credits incorrectly focus on amounts for a particular CFC and should instead operate on a per-jurisdiction basis (as for losses). (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The loss and credit transitional rules should make clear that the relevant figure is branch equivalent income adjusted by the taxpayer’s income interest. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) 133 Comment Officials agree that the heading to section IQ 2(1B) needs to be corrected. We also agree that the rules (losses and credits) should apply on a per-jurisdiction basis and that a person’s branch equivalent income for the purposes of these rules should be determined by reference to their income interest in relevant CFCs. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Transitional loss carry-forward and tax credit rules – interaction with existing law Submission (68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The interaction of section IQ 2(1C)(b) with the existing CFC carry-forward rules is unclear as a result of the application of the ring-fencing rules in section IA 2(5) and (7). Clarification is required about how the residual loss to carry forward is determined. Comment The submission relates to an issue with the existing rules in the Income Tax Act 2007. Specifically, the concern is that there is no provision allowing attributed CFC net losses to be carried forward to a later year. This issue has been raised previously with, and considered by, the Rewrite Advisory Panel. The Panel’s view was that there had not been an unintended legislative change in respect of section IQ 1 and subpart IA on the introduction of the Income Tax Act 2007. Inland Revenue considers that the law as it stands allows attributed CFC net losses to be carried forward. However, as part of a general review of the loss provisions in Part I, officials may seek to improve the clarity of the rules. Any amendments would be a matter for a later bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 134 Issue: Memorandum accounts – CTR account balances Submission (66 – Telecom) Credit balances in a conduit tax relief (CTR) account should not be cancelled for companies with a mix of resident and non-resident shareholders. Comment Submissions on the December 2007 issues paper demonstrated that cancellation of the CTR account balances could in some cases increase taxes paid by non-resident shareholders on dividends paid out of conduit relieved income. This was not the policy intent. Accordingly, the bill maintains these CTR account balances. The government announced in July 2008 that it plans to legislate in a later bill to repeal any remaining CTR account balances at the beginning of the 2011–12 income year. For taxpayers who do not want to incur the compliance costs of maintaining their CTR account balances for another two years, there is an option for them to elect to stop being a CTR company. Recommendation That the submission be declined, and that it be noted that this submission is already accommodated by the bill. Issue: Memorandum accounts – election to stop being a CTR company Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 66 – Telecom) FDP credits should be able to be converted to imputation credits immediately after a company makes an election to stop being a CTR company. Comment At present, CTR companies cannot convert FDP credits into imputation credits as the conduit mechanism is designed to ensure that FDP credits are only distributed to residents, while CTR credits are only distributed to non-residents. These streaming rules are no longer required given the repeal of further conduit tax relief. Current legislation allows a company to elect to stop being a CTR company, but the election does not take effect until the following tax year. If the election took effect from the following day, it would save compliance costs of maintaining CTR accounts until the end of the year, and would allow these companies to immediately convert FDP credits into imputation credits. 135 Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and that section OD 4 be amended so that a company stops being a CTR company the day after an election is made (rather than the year after, as under existing legislation). Issue: Memorandum accounts – transitional period for BETAs Submission (68/68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The two-year transitional period for BETA debits should be increased to five years. Comment The two-year period that was announced for BETA debits is considered adequate as the purpose of BETA debits is to relieve double tax in situations where a dividend has been received in advance of the income being attributed. It would be highly unusual if there was more than a two-year gap between a dividend being paid and income being recognised. Debits remaining after two years would be more likely to be sheltering new attributable income than relieving double taxation. Recommendation That the submission be declined, and that it be noted that the final repeal of BETA debits will be legislated for in a later tax bill. Issue: Memorandum accounts – transitional rules for BETAs Submissions (35D – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 66 – Telecom, 68/68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) There should be no special rule for BETA debits during the transitional period as this will increase compliance costs. Companies should be able to apply BETA debit balances under the existing rules. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) There are various technical concerns with the transitional rule for BETA debits: • The rules should provide that BETA debits do not need to be used against income from grey list countries. • Transitional rules should continue to give priority to usage against attributable income. • Group usage of BETA debits should not be made mandatory. 136 • The rules should make it clear that it is branch equivalent income adjusted by the income interest percentage. • The rules should make it clear that foreign tax paid can be applied as a credit against CFC income. (PricewaterhouseCoopers, Telecom, Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment BETA debits relieve tax on attributable income when a dividend has already been taxed. This prevents double taxation. The bill currently provides for an apportionment rule to allow pre-reform BETA debits to be carried forward and applied against total CFC income (as opposed to only attributable income). This rule is similar to the transitional rules for losses and credits. On reflection, the existing BETA legislation appears to provide the right result without the need for a transitional rule. The use of BETA debits is already limited to the amount of attributed CFC income (less deductions and foreign tax credits) in a given year by section OE 7(3B). The government has also announced plans to legislate in two years time to clear remaining BETA debit balances. Removing the transitional rule for BETA debits will resolve the detailed technical concerns raised in submissions. Recommendation That the transitional rules for BETA debits be removed from the bill. Issue: Memorandum accounts – application of changes Submission (53 – Ernst & Young) The CTR and BETA changes in clauses 308 to 322 should apply by reference to tax years rather than income years. Comment Officials agree that “tax years” is the correct concept as these memorandum accounts operate on a tax-year basis. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and that references to “income years” in clauses 308 to 322 be replaced with references to “tax years”. 137 Issue: Memorandum accounts – post-transitional rules Submission (68/68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Rules governing the treatment of CTR credits, BETA debits, and FDP credits at the end of the relevant transitional period should be announced now to provide certainty. Comment The government announced in July 2008 that it plans to introduce legislation to repeal remaining CTR account and BETA debit balances at the beginning of the 2011–12 income year. At the same time, it also announced that any outstanding FDP credits would be converted into imputation credits at the beginning of the 2014–15 income year. The legislation was not included in this bill because of the complexity of having various modifications with different application dates applying to the same provisions. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Miscellaneous – attributed repatriations rules Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The attributed repatriation rules are no longer needed once the foreign dividend exemption is introduced, and should therefore be repealed. Comment The attributed repatriation rules are intended to ensure that taxpayers cannot avoid tax on CFC dividends by purchasing New Zealand property and giving this to shareholders instead of paying a dividend. Officials agree that these complex rules are no longer needed as the incentive to use an attributed repatriation to repatriate CFC income is greatly diminished now that most foreign dividends received by companies will be exempt. Although tax is still imposed on some dividends (for example, dividends paid on fixed-rate shares and deductible dividends), it is unlikely that an attributed repatriation could be used as an effective substitute for these dividends. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 138 Issue: Miscellaneous – requirements for being a qualifying company Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The rule in clause 195 should be added to the list of requirements for being a qualifying company in section HA 6(2). Comment Officials agree that it would be better to list all the requirements for being a qualifying company in one place. Clause 195 prevents qualifying companies from holding CFCs and non-portfolio FIFs. This is a necessary consequence of the foreign dividend exemption as otherwise qualifying companies could be used to repatriate CFC and FIF income to non-company shareholders free from New Zealand tax. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 139 REPEAL OF THE GREY LIST EXEMPTION Clauses 17, 25, 26, 66, 67, 80, 118, 122, 125, 138, 175, 255 and 408 Issue: The grey list exemption should be retained Submissions (30 – Staples Rodway, 32 – KPMG, 35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 40 – Fisher and Paykel Healthcare, 54 – Business New Zealand, 59 – Fletcher Building, 66 – Telecom, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 68 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The grey list exemption should be retained. The main reason cited in submissions for retaining the grey list was that it saves compliance costs as it means that CFCs located in one of eight countries would not have to apply the CFC rules or calculate their income for New Zealand tax purposes. Other reasons given include: • The original rationale of grey list countries having comparable tax systems remains valid with an active/passive rule. • If the grey list is removed it is unlikely that any New Zealand tax will be paid on investments in grey list countries (as a result of foreign tax credits). • Most of New Zealand’s major trading partners, including Australia, have an active income exemption and a listed country exemption. • The grey list has existed since 1988 yet there has been no major tax base risk identified. • Any perceived risks from the grey list are outweighed by the compliance cost savings. Risks could be dealt with by carve-outs which specifically target perceived risk. The grey list should be expanded. (Fletcher Building) Comment Compared with the active business test which applies equally to all jurisdictions, a grey list is arbitrary and distortionary. It creates a preference to invest into traditional, high tax jurisdictions when market growth and investment opportunities are increasingly outside of the grey list. This distortion on investment decisions was one reason why the grey list was removed for portfolio investors when the fair dividend rules were introduced in 2007. The grey list made sense as a pragmatic mechanism for reducing compliance costs on investments in eight countries when all income of CFCs was otherwise taxed on accrual. It does not make sense under the new rules where an active income exemption and low compliance cost active business test will apply to investments in all jurisdictions. 140 The grey list exemption is based on an assumption of comparable taxation in listed jurisdictions. Although this assumption generally holds for active business income, it cannot be relied upon for passive income. Grey list countries have exemptions and concessionary rules for investment income to implement their domestic policy frameworks. This was the case with UK investment trusts and the Open Ended Investment Companies where gains were exempted from tax on the basis that the UK unit holders would be taxed on their investments. However, New Zealand unit holders also benefited from the entity-level exemption under the FIF grey list exemption. The removal of the grey list following the enactment of the FDR rules addressed this concern. Technical differences between different countries’ treatment of particular instruments create opportunities whereby passive income is not taxed in the other jurisdiction. For example, fixed-rate shares are sometimes classified as debt in some grey list countries such as the United States. This means that a CFC can get a deduction on the payment of a fixed-rate dividend and so would pay no foreign tax on the underlying income. Yet New Zealand would not give a deduction in equivalent circumstances. Similarly, technical differences also occur in relation to different countries’ treatment of entities. Sometimes income (particularly foreign income) flows through grey list entities without any entity-level taxation. This was the case with Australian unit trusts. It is also the case with US limited liability companies (LLCs). In the latter case, it was clarified that US LLCs would only qualify for grey list treatment if more than 80 percent of income was actually sourced in the US. These examples illustrate the fact that entities in grey list countries do not necessarily face the full rate of tax in the jurisdiction. In these cases, a grey list exemption would allow taxpayers to allocate passive income to a grey list CFC in order to reduce their total tax liability. This creates a risk to the New Zealand tax base. Some submissions have suggested that these risks could be managed through the use of carve-outs or anti-avoidance rules. However, this would require on-going maintenance of the tax systems of listed countries. Although it is possible to monitor tax rates and major reforms, it is much more difficult to identify the arbitrage opportunities that can arise from technical and systemic differences between how particular instruments or entities are treated across different countries. Even when arbitrage is identified, it can be difficult to target. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 141 Issue: The grey list exemption should be retained for SMEs Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The grey list should be retained for entities which are under a certain size. Comment Restricting the grey list to SMEs would not address the fundamental risk that arises from exempting passive income that may not face the full rate of foreign tax in the grey list country. We recognise that small or medium-sized entities are less likely to have the existing technical expertise to apply the CFC rules or the active business test. In view of this concern, the bill includes an exemption from attribution for CFCs in Australia. This would address much of the SME problem, because most SMEs expand first to Australia. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The grey list exemption should continue to apply for a transitional period Submission (54 – Business New Zealand, 68 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) If the grey list is abolished, there should be a transitional period of two or three years. This would provide businesses with time to adjust to the change. Comment The active business test should generally ensure that active businesses are not subject to attribution. Within this context, retaining the grey list for two or three years would primarily benefit CFCs with significant amounts of passive income. This would constitute a risk to the domestic tax base. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 142 Issue: Exemptions based on effective or headline tax rates Submission (32 – KPMG, 68 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) If the grey list is abolished, consideration should be given to exemptions that are based on a foreign country’s effective or headline tax rates on passive income. Comment An exemption based on headline rates would pose the same problems as the grey list. Technical differences between countries’ treatment of particular instruments or entities can create opportunities whereby passive income does not face the full rate of tax in the foreign jurisdiction. An exemption based on effective tax rates would presumably be no different from the existing practice of providing tax credits for foreign tax paid, as companies would still need to calculate what the effective foreign tax rate was on their passive income in that country. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Repeal of grey list – drafting error Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Clause 425 incorrectly amends schedule 24 to refer to section DZ 1. It should read “section DZ 11” as this would be consistent with schedule 24 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 143 REPEAL OF CONDUIT TAX RELIEF Clauses 175 and 255 Issue: The conduit tax relief rules should be retained Submissions (32 – KPMG, 66 – Telecom, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 68 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The conduit tax relief rules should be retained. The policy rationale for conduit – that New Zealand should not tax non-residents on their foreign-sourced income – remains valid with the introduction of an active income exemption. Removing the conduit rules will discourage foreign investment into/through New Zealand. The introduction of interest allocation rules for banks and outbound investment reduces any risk to the tax base from providing conduit tax relief. Comment The conduit rules remove income tax on income that a New Zealand company receives from its CFCs when the New Zealand company is owned by non-residents. Conduit income is still subject to non-resident withholding tax when distributed by the New Zealand company to its non-resident shareholders. A major reason for introducing conduit rules was to allow a New Zealand-based subsidiary to act as the regional headquarters for subsidiaries in other jurisdictions without adverse tax consequences. This provides economic benefits to New Zealand by creating and retaining management expertise and valuable head-office functions in New Zealand. The conduit rules will become unnecessary for active income, since the conduit exemption is, in effect, being replaced by the active income and foreign dividend exemptions. This means that if conduit rules were maintained they would only apply to companies which earn passive CFC income. Compared with active CFCs, which are used to expand a company’s core business, a conduit exemption for passive investments is unlikely to create the economic benefits associated with regional headquarters that are described above. Retaining conduit rules for passive income would expose the tax base to significant risk. This is because New Zealand-sourced income can be converted into passive CFC income. 144 Finally, interest allocation rules simply impose an upper limit on the level of New Zealand debt that can be used to fund a CFC – they do not eliminate the risks to the tax base from relieving passive income. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Retaining the conduit rules and the grey list for finance CFCs Submissions (60 – ASB, 68 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The conduit rules and grey list should be retained for banking and finance businesses in preference to the development of an active exemption for them, or at least until an appropriate active exemption can be developed and implemented for banking and finance businesses. Comment The grey list exemption and conduit tax relief need to be repealed at the same time for all entities otherwise these exemptions could be used to shelter passive income. As a result of consultation, several offshore insurance businesses were identified that would face adverse tax results if the conduit exemption were removed before an active income exemption was introduced for financial CFCs. A commissioner’s determination process is being provided to allow these CFCs to qualify as non- attributing CFCs (that is, active businesses). This provides a limited relief measure until special rules are developed to extend the active income exemption to insurance and finance businesses. Retaining the grey list or conduit exemptions for financial institutions would provide little additional benefit (given the lack of existing financial CFCs) but would impose a risk on the tax base. This is because New Zealand-sourced income can be converted into passive CFC income. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 145 Issue: NRWT relief should be introduced for conduit investments Submission (32 – KPMG, 35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 59 – Fletcher Building, 60 – ASB, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 68 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) There should be no non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on dividends paid to non- residents if the income is sourced from CFCs. In other words, conduit relief of NRWT should be introduced. This would ensure that New Zealand remains competitive with Australia, which operates such a scheme. Comment Officials are exploring the feasibility of this measure as part of the second phase of the international tax review. The policy merits of providing an exemption would need to be weighed against the fiscal cost and possible base maintenance concerns, including the level of protection provided by the new CFC rules and its accompanying interest allocation rules. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Conduit anti-avoidance rule Submissions (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 36 – Russell McVeagh, 60 – ASB, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 68 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The conduit anti-avoidance rule in section GZ 2: • should be redrafted as it appears to apply more broadly than the policy intention (which was described in the December 2007 issues paper); • should only apply when there is a dominant purpose of obtaining a conduit tax relief benefit; • should only apply to new conduit deals (after 4 December 2007), not to transactions under existing structures; • should be limited to arrangements that produce a benefit from the repeal of the conduit rules (as opposed to arrangements that produce any benefit under a taxation law); • should apply no earlier than 4 December 2007, as this was the date that the issues paper that announced the policy change was released; 146 • should only apply to arrangements (as opposed to transactions) that became legally binding after 1 January 2008. The reason for the deferral would be to ensure it does not capture taxpayers who were already committed to a transaction at the time of the policy announcement. The risk that an arrangement could be put in place in the 27 days between the announcement and the 1 January 2008 is minimal. Comment Proposed section GZ 2 provides a specific anti-avoidance rule to deny conduit tax relief and impose income tax when a conduit arrangement has a purpose of inappropriately providing a tax benefit to a New Zealand resident. The purpose of conduit tax relief is to relieve tax on non-residents to the extent that they are earning CFC income through a New Zealand “conduit company”. Under the existing rules, any undistributed conduit income is clawed back in situations where the conduit company becomes substantially New Zealand owned (a 34 percentage point or greater increase in resident shareholding) or migrates offshore. Otherwise New Zealand shareholders could receive tax benefits which they are not entitled to. The bill removes the claw-back rules. The anti-avoidance rule is primarily intended to be a deterrent against the use of structures in the interim period which would exploit the removal of the claw-back rules. It is unlikely to be used in practice. As such, it is appropriate to have a reasonably broad rule which applies from the time the policy for repealing conduit was first announced in the December 2007 issues paper. We are reviewing the drafting of the section in light of submissions to ensure it is appropriately targeted. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Submission (24A – New Zealand Law Society) In section GZ 2, it should be clarified that the reference to a “New Zealand resident” is a reference to a New Zealand resident as defined for the purposes of the CTR rules. Comment The definition of “New Zealand resident” used in the CTR rules is the same as the definition used elsewhere in the Act and so does not need to be clarified. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 147 MISCELLANEOUS SUBMISSIONS Clauses 25, 119–124 and 147 Issue: Structure and drafting of the legislation Submissions (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Further consideration should be given to the structure of the new CFC rules. In addition, the legislation should include a section outlining the various rules and the structure of the provisions. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Terms such as “attributable CFC amount”, “net attributable CFC income or loss”, and “non-attributing active CFC” used in the bill should be replaced with plain English terms like “passive amount”, “net passive income or loss”, and “active CFC”. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment The international tax provisions of the bill are being reviewed to see whether there is scope to reduce complexity and improve the clarity of the legislation. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Section CQ 2 – drafting Submissions (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The word “and” should not follow section CQ 2(1)(g). New paragraphs (fb) and (g) in section CQ 2(1) should be re-labelled as paragraphs (g) and (j) \[sic\] to avoid the use of two letters as a section or paragraph reference. Comment Officials agree that the word “and” is not needed as nothing follows paragraph (g). We agree that there is some merit in changing the paragraph references, particularly given that new paragraph (g) is not an exact substitute for existing paragraph (g). Re- labelling the new provisions as paragraph (h) and paragraph (i) will make clear that existing paragraph (g) has been repealed. 148 Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, and that the new paragraphs replacing existing paragraph (g) of section CQ 2(1) are renamed paragraph (h) and paragraph (i), and that the word “and” after what will then be paragraph (i) be omitted. Issue: Repeal of section EZ 31 Submission (68/68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The exemption for certain listed CFCs in section EZ 31 should be retained and relaxed rather than repealed. Comment Section EZ 31 provides an exemption from the requirement to attribute income from CFCs or FIFs in other jurisdictions held by a grey list CFC if the CFC is a listed company and is constrained from providing the information necessary to calculate branch equivalent income or loss. The exemption was inserted to cater for an exceptional circumstance where a New Zealand-owned CFC and a grey list was a listed entity. That situation no longer exists. The exemption was set to expire in the 2011 income year. Recommendation That the submission be declined. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Issue: Ring-fencing of CFC losses by jurisdiction Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Ring-fencing of CFC losses by jurisdiction should be abandoned on the move to an active income exemption. Comment The move to an active income exemption does not affect the case for the jurisdictional ring-fencing of CFC losses. 149 The ring-fencing of CFC losses was introduced on the recommendation of the Valabh Committee in 1988. 8 The Committee noted that the allowance of a credit for foreign tax paid by a CFC means that a CFC profit is not equivalent to a domestic profit in terms of its consequences for tax revenue. It follows that CFC losses should be treated differently from domestic losses, and their offset against domestic income restricted. It was also argued that unrestricted loss offset may give rise to base maintenance problems if New Zealand residents were able to acquire losses in foreign companies. The fact that credits are allowed for foreign tax paid by CFCs argues for ring-fencing on a jurisdictional basis, since a difference in New Zealand revenue consequences may arise between CFC profits earned in different jurisdictions, depending on the local rate of tax. The Committee also noted that jurisdictional ring-fencing is needed to prevent the income of CFCs in tax havens, which could include income diverted from New Zealand, being sheltered by losses incurred elsewhere. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Use of FIF losses against CFC income Submission (26 – Fonterra) It should be clarified that jurisdictional ring-fencing of FIF net losses is by reference to branch equivalent FIF income and attributed CFC income. Comment Like CFC losses, losses from branch equivalent FIFs are ring-fenced on a jurisdictional basis. As a matter of policy, these losses should be ring-fenced by reference to branch equivalent FIF income and attributed CFC income from the jurisdiction in question. That was the position under the Income Tax Act 2004. The submission notes that the Income Tax Act 2007 appears to have changed the treatment of branch equivalent FIF losses carried forward to a subsequent year. Such losses now appear to be ring-fenced by reference to all FIF income from a particular jurisdiction, but not by reference to attributed CFC income. This is an unintended change which needs to be corrected to restore the position under the Income Tax Act 2004. Officials note that the matter has not previously been referred to the Rewrite Advisory Panel for its consideration. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and the problem corrected, with an application date from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. 8 International tax reform: Full imputation part 2: Report of the Consultative Committee (July 1988), chapter 4.6. 150 Issue: Tax credits on attributed CFC income Submission (30 – Staples Rodway) Tax credits are currently provided for foreign tax paid on attributed CFC income. The position needs to be clarified now that only passive income will be attributed. An apportionment methodology should be provided for taxpayers to work out what proportion of their foreign tax relates to passive income. Comment Under the existing rules a person has a tax credit equal to the amount of foreign income tax paid in relation to attributed CFC income. With the introduction of an active income exemption only passive income will be attributed. This means that foreign tax paid on active income will not count towards foreign tax credits. Rather than prescribe a specific methodology for apportioning foreign tax paid, it is sensible to leave it to businesses to apply the existing rule appropriately. Businesses are already doing this for foreign taxes on items such as capital gains which are not taxed in New Zealand. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Streaming of imputation credits Submission (59 – Fletcher Building, 68/68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Limited streaming of imputation credits to New Zealand-resident shareholders should be allowed. Comment This issue is outside the scope of the bill and is being considered within the context of the imputation review. The discussion document, Streaming and refundability of imputation credits, was released in August 2008. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 151 Foreign investment fund remedial amendments 152 153 EFFECT OF PREVIOUS YEAR’S QUICK SALE GAINS ON OPENING VALUES Submission (20 – BDO Spicers) The opening values in section EX 45B(10) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section EX 56(9) of the Income Tax Act 2007 should not include the effect of the previous year’s quick sale gains. Comment Officials agree. The references to “FIF income” in the opening value formulas in section EX 45B of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section EX 56 of the Income Tax Act 2007 should not include “quick sale gains”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 154 AUSTRALIAN-RESIDENT LISTED COMPANY EXEMPTION Submission (29 – Russell McVeagh) The exemption for Australian-resident companies listed on the Australian Stock Exchange should include companies that have had shares transferred under a court- approved reorganisation. Comment The bill amends the exemption for shares in Australian-resident companies listed on the Australian Stock Exchange which are the subject of court-approved reorganisations. The requirement that shares in the company be included in an approved Australian Stock Exchange index will be expanded to include situations where the shares are included in an approved index at the beginning of the final month of the preceding income year, if the shares are cancelled in the first month of an income year under a court-approved arrangement. Officials agree that this amendment should be extended to shares that have been transferred under a court- approved arrangement. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 155 DEEMED DISPOSAL AND RE-ACQUISITION WHEN FIF BECOMES NEW ZEALAND-RESIDENT Submission (32 – KPMG) There should be a deemed disposal and re-acquisition rule (at market value) to deal with situations where a foreign investment fund becomes New Zealand-resident. Comment Officials agree. There is currently a provision – section EX 66 – that deals with the situation when a New Zealand-resident entity becomes a non-resident, resulting in New Zealand investors in that entity holding an attributing interest in a FIF. This provision treats the investor as having disposed of and reacquired the interest at market value. A similar provision is necessary to deal with the situation when a non- resident entity (a FIF) becomes a New Zealand resident. New Zealand investors in that entity should be treated as having disposed of and reacquired their interest in that entity at market value. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 156 APPLICATION OF QUICK SALE ADJUSTMENT TO FDR CALCULATIONS FOR UNIT VALUERS Submission (33 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc) Proposed section EX 53(8) should be amended to reinstate: • the 1-day exclusion; and • that the period that is used to determine whether quick sale adjustments are required is limited to the valuation period, not the income year. Comment Officials agree. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 157 MANAGEMENT FEE REBATE RECEIVED FROM AN OFFSHORE FUND WHICH IS SUBJECT TO FAIR DIVIDEND RATE (FDR) METHOD Submission (33 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 32 – KPMG) Management fee rebates received from the offshore manager in relation to the FIF interest should not be taxable. Section EX 59(2) of the Act should be extended to include income derived from and in relation to the FIF interest held. (Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc) Management fee rebates received in relation to an interest that is an offshore unit trust should not be separately taxable. (KPMG) Comment Given that the management fee would be a deductible expense to the New Zealand managed fund investor, officials consider that any rebate of the fee should be included as income. Officials consider that section EX 59 should be amended to ensure that the provision does not remove from income any rebate of the fee when the FDR or cost FIF calculation methods are used. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Section EX 59 should be amended to ensure that the provision does not remove from income any rebate of the fee where the FDR or cost FIF calculation methods are used. 158 TAXPAYER SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO CHANGE METHOD IN FIRST YEAR Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Taxpayers should be allowed a one-off opportunity to change to the new FDR or cost methods from the first income year beginning after 1 April 2007. Comment Officials consider that section EX 50(8) of the Income Tax Act 2004 allowed people who were using the comparative value method for their FIF interests before 1 April 2007 to switch to the FDR method for these interests from 1 April 2007. For people using other FIF calculation methods – such as the accounting profits method – before 1 April 2007, officials consider that it is appropriate for the general requirement of using one method consistently for an interest continues to apply. If it is not practicable to continue to use a particular FIF method the current rules provide sufficient flexibility to allow another method to be used. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 159 COMPARATIVE VALUE LOSS RESTRICTION Submission (Matter raised by officials) The comparative value (CV) loss restriction rule in section EX 51(7) and (8) should apply to foreign superannuation and life interests. Comment Given the ability to use FDR for foreign superannuation and life interests, the loss restriction in the CV method should apply to such interests. Otherwise investors would be able to claim a loss under the CV method but limit any gain to 5 percent under FDR. This amendment should apply from the start of the 2009–10 income year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 160 APPLICATION DATE OF FDR DETERMINATIONS Submission (31 – NZ Funds) Portfolio investment entities that return their income on a quarterly basis should be allowed to apply a determination retrospectively from the start of the quarter or the income year in which the determination is given. Comment Officials agree with the submission as it is consistent with the policy intent of the FIF rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 161 CRITERIA FOR USING FDR METHOD – HEDGING REQUIREMENT Submission (Matter raised by officials) The hedging requirement in section EX 46(10)(c) should be clarified so that it includes situations when the hedge is held by the New Zealand investor. Comment The FDR method cannot be used for certain types of investments that are broadly the same as New Zealand dollar-denominated debt investments. One of these exclusions is contained in section EX 46 (10)(c), which currently provides that the FDR method cannot be used for an interest in a non-resident entity that holds directly or indirectly assets of which 80 percent or more by value consist of financial arrangements that are denominated in New Zealand dollars or are hedged back to New Zealand currency with that hedging being at least 80 percent effective. It should be clarified that the instrument which hedges the investment to New Zealand currency can be held by the New Zealand investor as well as a non-resident entity. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 162 MINOR DRAFTING ISSUES Submissions (32 – KPMG) A number of minor remedial amendments should be made to the FIF rules. Comment Officials recommend that the minor remedial amendments identified by the submission should be taken into account in amending the FIF rules as part of this bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 163 International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) provisions 164 165 OVERVIEW The bill contains remedial amendments to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) financial arrangement legislation included in the Taxation (Business Taxation and Remedial Matters) Act 2007. The original legislation primarily affects the spreading of income and expenditure on financial arrangements and other minor matters. The remedial amendments in the current bill relate to financial arrangements and should help to clarify and remove uncertainty. It is not intended that these changes represent a fundamental shift in policy from the original legislation. However, a more formal review is intended, and will be conducted under the generic tax policy process. All but two of the proposed amendments to the legislation in this report will commence and apply from the original commencement and application dates of the IFRS legislation. The two exceptions will both be prospective. Officials consider that it is necessary to make the changes retrospectively either to confirm acceptable interpretations where the existing provisions are unclear or to correct fundamental issues where the policy intention has always been clear. Officials consider that only a very small number of taxpayers will need to refile past returns. In these cases penalties and use-of-money interest will not be applied. Officials consider that the retrospective nature of the relevant amendments will not result in different treatment of taxpayers in similar fact situations. Issue: Reconsider the existing/proposed rules, ground-up rewrite Submission (32 and 32A – KPMG) The existing and proposed rules do not work and a fresh regime is a matter of urgency. Officials should be directed to consult urgently on this matter. Comment The submission does not provide any rationale for the statement that the existing and proposed rules do not work and that a fresh regime is a matter of urgency. No other submission goes this far in respect of the rules. Officials are aware that certain aspects of the rules as drafted do not work well and propose further amendments. These are dealt with below. As stated earlier, a more formal review is planned, and will be conducted under the generic tax policy process. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 166 Issue: IFRS operating leases which are finance leases/financial arrangements for tax Submission (32 – KPMG) The proposed amendments do not address operating leases for IFRS and are not finance leases for tax purposes but are financial arrangements. Comment The submission is valid for at least one known lease. The problem can be remedied by changing the application of the proposed amendment to cover all operating leases for IFRS which are financial arrangements for tax purposes, which includes finance leases. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Finance leases and mandatory use of yield to maturity Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) All finance leases should be included in the mandatory use of the yield to maturity (YTM) provision (as amended to deal with foreign currency amounts). Comment The submission has some validity as the rules for calculating the loan values of finance leases for tax purposes are different from those applying for IFRS accounting. This is a compliance matter that will be considered in the wider review. Another recommendation in this report (“(Pre-IFRS) taxpayer choice of spreading method (including YTM)”) is that the YTM method is made available for New Zealand currency denominated non-derivative financial arrangements. This method could then be used for finance leases. The existing rules regarding the cost of the asset and the associated “loan” under the finance lease will continue to apply in the meantime, with YTM being applied to the cash flows based on the initial loan. For non-New Zealand currency denominated finance leases Determination G9C will apply, giving a YTM result. The use of YTM will be available from the 2009–10 income year. 167 Recommendation That the submission be noted as being addressed by the recommendation mentioned above. Issue: Interest-free loans and loans that are below market value/variations in financial arrangements such as finance company workouts Submissions (32 – KPMG, 35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 53 – Ernst & Young, 67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) A yield to maturity or alternative method should be available for interest-free loans or loans that are below market value. In many cases the latter situation would include loans to finance companies in workout situations. (KPMG) The legislation should provide yield to maturity as an option for IFRS taxpayers where there is a variation in terms of a financial arrangement. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The legislation should be amended to allow taxpayers who have adopted NZ IFRS for financial reporting purposes to elect to use the yield to maturity method or materially similar alternatives for income tax purposes for finance company workouts. (Ernst & Young) The interaction of the IFRS accounting standards with the financial arrangement (tax) rules is causing some anomalous results. Accordingly, amending tax legislation may be required at short notice to address these concerns. The submission then refers to the restructuring of debt in distressed finance companies as an example. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment The issue regarding financial arrangements which are at lower than market value for various reasons and which result in a one-off present-value type adjustment in the IFRS accounting results has validity as often, the only tax option is to use the IFRS accounting result with often inappropriate results. In these situations, it is proposed that the yield to maturity approach be allowed for tax purposes from the 2009–10 income year (see recommendation under heading (“(Pre-IFRS) taxpayer choice of spreading method (including YTM)”). Officials note that nil/low interest loans in the nature of equity from related parties may be treated under IFRS accounting on a present-value basis in some circumstances and amounts dealt with in equity reserves. The proposed treatment above may need to be distinguished for any related-party low/nil interest loans which otherwise may come within its ambit. 168 This second matter will be included in the wider review mentioned earlier. The problem of distressed finance company workouts and the like will be dealt with in a separate process announced by the Ministers of Finance and Revenue in their press release of 15 December 2008. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Anti-arbitrage provisions in the legislation Submission (32 – KPMG, 35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The proposed amendments to the anti-arbitrage provisions in the legislation do not achieve the intended effect. Comment All three submissions have highlighted that the proposed changes to the anti-arbitrage provisions do not achieve the intended effect. Officials were already aware of the issue. The anti-arbitrage provisions should allow the use of the determination alternatives, expected value method or the modified fair value method for a financial arrangement if: • the financial arrangement is not a hedge of, or is being hedged by, another financial arrangement under IFRS accounting; or • a financial arrangement is a hedge of, or is being hedged by, another financial arrangement under IFRS accounting and the other financial arrangement has not been accounted for using the fair value method or a method that accounts for gains and losses related to the hedge. It is considered that the proposed changes will achieve the intended policy intent. Recommendation The submission be accepted. 169 Issue: Transitional provisions and early adopters of the IFRS accounting methods Submissions (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 68A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The proposed transitional adjustments measures in the bill in respect of IFRS early adopters changing from the IFRS fair value method should be amended to allow taxpayers the option to choose another IFRS method, provided the other requirements of the proposed measures are met. The submission is based on a technical concern that provisions in the current rules will counteract the policy intention regarding the proposed changes in the bill. Where an early adopter qualifies under the proposed measures, they should be permitted to apply the spreading adjustment method included in the original legislation. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The provisions do not necessarily put early adopters in the same position as late adopters. This is because the original IFRS financial arrangements legislation was finalised after early adopters had made their decisions and there is probably a cost of changing elections. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment The first submission has merit and it should be made clear that taxpayers who adopted the IFRS fair value method in the 2005–06 income year and who otherwise meet the requirements to change from that method to another IFRS financial reporting method under the proposal in the bill will automatically qualify to do so. This overrides any technical argument that such a change may be prevented as it causes an advancement, deferral, or reduction of an income tax liability. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountant’s second submission is the same as the Corporate Taxpayers Group submission which is discussed in the next paragraph. The Corporate Taxpayers Group submission is correct in its analysis of the position and the bill reflects the preferred policy position recognising that taxpayers are being given a choice to switch methods and that the resulting base price adjustment may go either way. However, it is understood that the situation has been satisfactorily dealt with under the existing legislation. Should this not be the case the matter can be further considered. The proposed review will allow taxpayers to further consider their methods of returning income and expenditure from financial arrangements. Recommendation That the first submission on transitional matters be accepted. That the submissions on early adopters of IFRS method be noted. 170 Issue: Change of spreading method transitional adjustments on entry to new tax rules Submission (53 – Ernst & Young) The extent to which transitional adjustments must be brought into account for income tax purposes if taxpayers who have adopted NZ IFRS for financial reporting purposes remain required to adopt an IFRS financial reporting method should be restricted. Comment The submission does not say to what extent transitional adjustments should be restricted, but does suggest that capitalised interest is a problem. This is dealt with immediately below under the heading “Interest capitalised to the balance sheet by IFRS financial reporting”. The 2007 legislation included the requirement for a change of spreading method adjustment when a taxpayer transitions to the IFRS tax rules. The application of the 2007 legislation has not been modified by any of the proposals in the bill. The change of spreading method on entry to the new tax rules is more appropriate than deferring any adjustment until the base price adjustment is calculated on maturity/disposal. There has been no change to the original policy on this matter. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Interest capitalised to the balance sheet by IFRS financial reporting Submission (33 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 53 – Ernst & Young) The original 2007 legislation has cast doubt on the longstanding ability to deduct on an incurred basis, interest and other borrowing costs capitalised to the balance sheet under IFRS accounting. Instead, the legislation may mean it has to be deducted subsequently when it passes through the profit and loss account as depreciation, or as part of a base price adjustment. Comment The policy regarding capitalised interest and other borrowing costs has for some time been that it is deductible as incurred for tax purposes. However, enactment of the 2007 tax legislation for IFRS has created doubt on this matter. There was no intention to change the longstanding policy as a result of the enactment of the 2007 IFRS- 171 related legislation. It will be necessary to retain the original policy outcome on a retrospective basis. Further work in this area is being considered in the context of the more formal review to consider whether further simplification is achievable. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Pre-IFRS GAAP financial reporting method Submission (53 – Ernst & Young) Taxpayers’ ability to use the pre-IFRS GAAP financial reporting method where they have not adopted NZ IFRS for financial reporting purposes should be reinstated. Comment The 2007 legislation repealed the section allowing the use of pre-IFRS GAAP financial reporting methods as a method available for tax. For taxpayers who have adopted IFRS financial reporting the repeal is understandable as the new IFRS tax rules specifically include methods based on IFRS financial reporting. However, the scope of the repeal was wider than intended. While this is not a matter contained in the current bill, the problem should be addressed urgently and on a retrospective basis. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: (Pre-IFRS) taxpayer choice of spreading method (including YTM) Submission (53 – Ernst & Young) (The pre-IFRS) choice of spreading method should be reinstated, regardless of whether taxpayers have adopted NZ IFRS for tax purposes. 172 Comment The submission infers that the previously legislated yield to maturity (YTM) method has been removed for IFRS taxpayers and should be reinstated as a choice available to taxpayers. The 2007 legislation removed YTM for IFRS taxpayers as it was considered that other methods provided in the new IFRS tax rules gave taxpayers appropriate choices for tax which were in some cases very similar to YTM. Officials are considering via a wider review whether significant changes should be made to the IFRS-based spreading rules for financial arrangements in the long term. This could include widening the choices available to taxpayers as suggested in the submission. However, officials are aware of certain limited situations involving New Zealand currency denominated non-derivative financial arrangements where the use of a YTM method would enable taxpayers to remove for tax purposes volatility created by IFRS financial reporting which may not otherwise be able to be mitigated. It is proposed that the use of Determination G3 (the yield to maturity determination) be permitted in these circumstances, pending the wider review. A choice will be provided to switch to the YTM method in the 2009–10 income year with a change of spreading method adjustment to apply. Recommendation That the submission be noted, and the use of the yield to maturity method by IFRS taxpayers be permitted for New Zealand currency non-derivative financial arrangements from the 2009–10 income year pending the wider review. Issue: General submission – methods, choices and volatility Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The financial arrangement rules should continue to allow taxpayers to follow accounting for tax purposes (with or without an adjustment for reserves). However, to address volatility, taxpayers should have two or three other choices, preferably including YTM, expected value and modified fair value. The rules need to include a consistency provision to prevent taxpayers from “cherry picking” tax methods, but this should be one single, universal test. Comment The current legislation allows taxpayers to follow accounting for tax purposes as the default method. They can choose three alternative methods, provided the financial arrangement/s meet the criteria for those alternatives. There are some situations where the choice of alternative methods is clouded because of the required treatments of IFRS accounting. These difficulties were not anticipated at the time the original 173 legislation was drafted, and it is proposed to deal with those situations as part of the wider review. Pending this review, officials consider the present scheme of the legislation should remain intact. In respect of consistency, we consider that the present scheme of the legislation and tests are appropriate, but that they should also be further considered in the wider review. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: IFRS financial reporting method – wording clarification Submissions (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Section EW 15D(1) does not specify whether the allocation of an amount for tax must be the amount shown in a taxpayer’s financial statements or whether an allocation can be done applying an accounting methodology available under IFRS but not used by the taxpayer. Further, it does not refer to the profit and loss account or balance sheet in the financial statements. The amount allocated for tax purposes should be based on the amount in a taxpayer’s profit and loss account in its financial statements. Comment The policy intent is that the taxpayer must have applied the allocation method in its financial statements to be able to use it for tax purposes. It is not intended that a taxpayer can use any allocation method which IFRS accounting may generally permit without actually using it for its own financial statements. It should be noted that the policy is based on considerations such as simplicity, ease of compliance and that the financial statements are audited. The second submission point being made is understood by officials and will be addressed in the wider review of the legislation. Officials note that some amounts intended as able to be allocated for tax sit in some equity reserves and not within the profit and loss account. The present legislation allows for this. Recommendation That the first submission be accepted. That the second submission be noted. 174 Issue: Impaired credit adjustments for financial arrangements accounted for under the (IFRS financial reporting) fair value method – dealers Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Dealers in financial arrangements should be excluded from the impaired credit adjustment. Comment Taxpayers using the IFRS financial reporting method are required to identify, and adjust for credit, impairments to financial arrangements accounted for at fair value. PricewaterhouseCoopers views this as a change in policy. Previously, dealers could use the mark to market value method with no adjustment for credit impairments. Use of the market value method was restricted to dealers. The purpose of restricting the use of the market value method in this way was to protect against inappropriate bad debt deductions. We agree with PricewaterhouseCoopers that this was an unintended change in policy for dealers. This correction should be retrospective to the income year in which a taxpayer first adopted the new IFRS tax rules which could be the 2005–06 income year for some taxpayers. Despite this possibility, it is not anticipated that any returns will need to be refiled. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Impaired credit adjustments for financial arrangements accounted for under the (IFRS financial reporting) fair value method – decline in credit quality Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The definition of “impaired credit adjustment” should be redrafted to align it with existing definitions in the financial arrangement rules. Alternatively, further clarification should be provided to assist taxpayers determine what constitutes a “decline in credit quality of the financial arrangement” for a financial arrangement accounted for under the (IFRS financial reporting) fair value method. 175 Comment The submission considers that the present drafting is too vague and that it would be preferable to have wording consistent with other existing sections of the financial arrangement rules. Officials consider that the present drafting reflects the terminology used in IFRS and is appropriate in these circumstances. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Errors in the accounts Submissions (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Adjustments for accounting errors (for those following the IFRS financial reporting method) should be restricted to material errors. Material adjustments should be brought to tax when the adjustment is made in the accounts, and no use-of-money interest or shortfall penalties should apply. Alternatively, confirmation should be provided on how errors should be dealt with. Comment There are no provisions in the bill related to this submission. The current legislation also does not directly deal with the issues raised but it is considered that the legislation inherently covers them in the various methods available to taxpayers for financial arrangements. It is to be noted that the pre-IFRS rules for financial arrangements did not specifically deal with these issues either. Other areas of the 2007 Act that align tax and accounting require adjustment for immaterial errors. However, given the complexity of the financial arrangement provisions, and the operation of the base price adjustment as a “wash-up”, there is good reason not to require adjustment for errors, other than as they are corrected in the IFRS GAAP financial statements, either in profit and loss or the balance sheet (equity). It should be noted that the base price adjustment will operate to include all relevant amounts when a financial arrangement matures or is disposed of. Recommendation That the submissions be noted and included in the wider review to follow. 176 Issue: Mandatory use of yield to maturity for some arrangements Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Two choices should be available for taxpayers facing income and expenditure for foreign hybrids, finance leases and agreements for sale and purchase of property. The two methods are expected value (which is arguably a yield to maturity-type approach already permitted by the rules), which has compliance costs, and a mark to spot approach, which leads to uncertainty but is easier to calculate. Comment The issue is that the draft amendments do not provide a clear spreading mechanism for taxpayers with foreign denominated arrangements that fall within section EW 15I. The proposed amendments to this section are directed at finance leases and not related to foreign denominated arrangements at all. However, officials are aware of concerns regarding foreign denominated arrangements that fall within the section but that the position should be subject to a wide consultation process before any changes are made. The underlying premise of the section is a yield to maturity approach. This should continue to underpin any modification to the section, but the matter will be considered in the wider review. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Electricity contracts for differences – expected value approach Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Use of the expected value method for electricity contracts for differences requires clarification, given the lack of prevailing market forward rates for electricity. Each company should be able to self-assess their expectation of the forward price, based on internal models. Comment This issue is outside the scope of the bill. 177 Officials are aware of issues surrounding contracts for differences (CFDs) generally, and note that the original legislation specifically addressed concerns at that time regarding CFDs and potential volatility in the financial statements and for tax purposes. The legislation was framed so that CFDs could be taxed on the historical cash payments basis so that volatility could be removed from tax returns. At this time it is clear that a cash payments method is acceptable for tax under the expected value methodology. However, it is considered that any further changes to the treatment of contracts for differences are included in the wider review, as consultation is necessary. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Amendments to legislation – application to filed returns Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Taxpayers that have filed their returns based on the black letter law of the current legislation should have the choice between continuing to adopt the current law or refiling. Consideration should also be given to whether appropriate adjustments (catch-up adjustments) can be made in the next income tax return. Comment Officials appreciate that taxpayers are filing tax returns which may be affected by the proposed amendments before they are enacted. Taxpayers who have relied on the black letter law of the current legislation will be required to refile. Numbers are not expected to be large. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 178 Issue: Taxation of financial arrangements held by functional currency entities Submissions (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) There should be a rule requiring non-New Zealand dollar functional currency companies that use IFRS to use New Zealand dollars, regardless of which of the four methods specified in section EW 15C(1) is adopted. The legislation should provide guidance on the method to be followed for converting functional currency financial arrangements into New Zealand dollars. Comment The first submission is valid as a taxpayer may apply any one of the four IFRS methods available to financial arrangements denominated in a functional currency other than New Zealand dollars and we recommend that the bill be so amended. The second submission is considered not to be an IFRS-only matter and is part of a wider issuer relating to foreign currencies to all taxpayers. It is not proposed to address the matter in the current bill, and it will be noted for a future work programme. Recommendation That the first submission be accepted. That the second submission be noted. Issue: Modified fair value method Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The modified fair value method should only apply to gains and losses on foreign denominated or derivative movements recognised through equity. If this change were made, there should be no need to include an anti-arbitrage requirement in section EW 15E. Comment The submission is also related to the anti-arbitrage submissions above under the heading “Anti-arbitrage provisions in the legislation”. It is considered that the recommendation for that submission should address the concern here. 179 The concern can be further considered in the wider review if it is still relevant. Recommendation That the submission be noted, and the concern considered in the wider review if necessary. Issue: Methodology for calculating taxable income on swaps – Determination G9A Submission (60 – CBA NZ Group) Taxpayers should be allowed to use Determination G9A and the proposed amendments to prohibit its use should be deleted. If it is considered that the use of Determination G9A should be prohibited, the application of proposed clause 101(4) of the bill should be delayed until the commencement of the 2009–10 income year, and clause 565(4) should be deleted altogether. Comment Denial of the use of Determination G9A as one of the determinations available to be used under the 2007 IFRS legislation was a policy decision at that time. Direct use of the determination was denied in that legislation. It was overlooked that Determination G27 included use of Determination G9A in some circumstances, and the proposed amendments eliminate that use via Determination G27 to ensure consistency with the original policy. Officials consider that the original policy is still valid – to reduce volatility caused by use of spot exchange rates unless the taxpayer is using the IFRS financial reporting method which accounts for volatility. We also consider that the other methods available in the legislation allow taxpayers sufficient choice to reduce volatility for tax purposes in hedge situations. Officials agree that the application dates as proposed are not equitable and that affected taxpayers should be given the choice of applying them from the next income year. As proposed, they are retrospective to the 2006 tax year if an early adopter IFRS taxpayer chose to use the new IFRS tax rules from 2006. Officials also note that Determination G29 allows the use of Determination G9A in some situations, and for IFRS taxpayers this is also inappropriate in terms of the original policy. This alternative will also be removed for IFRS taxpayers as with Determination G27. 180 Recommendation That the submission in respect of allowing use of Determination G9A be noted and included in the wider review. That the application date of the proposal in the bill is changed to the income year following the enactment of the bill. Issue: Volatility in some bond group investment funds taxable income Submission (61 – Trustee Corporations Association) The legislation should return to the pre-IFRS position where bond funds had a choice of different accrual income-spreading methods. This could be achieved by removing the restriction in sections EW 15F and EW 15G whereby the expected value and modified fair value methods are only available if “the person is not in the business of dealing in financial arrangements”. Alternatively, a greater number of the old determinations could be made available for use under section EW 15H. Comment It appears that certain group investment funds may be precluded from removing volatility on financial arrangements from tax returns where it would be otherwise appropriate. The proposed change above regarding the limited use of Determination G3 for New Zealand currency non-derivative financial arrangements should address this issue. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Consistency and a group of companies’ elections to use some methods Submission (Matter raised by officials) This matter is not included in the bill, but officials consider that the 2007 legislation should be clarified for two of the methods available to IFRS taxpayers. Those methods are “expected value” and “modified fair value”. 181 Comment The legislation for the two methods includes a consistency requirement which reads like an election requirement. The legislation should be amended to ensure that it is both an election condition and a consistency requirement. This is a clarification only of the drafting. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Drafting matters Submission (Matters raised by officials) In section EW 31(7), the definition of “consideration” was changed by the 2007 IFRS legislation in respect of “non-integral fees” for IFRS financial reporting. The change was made for non-integral fees paid by a taxpayer but it should also have been made for non-integral fees paid to a taxpayer. This should be remedied. Clauses 108 and 568 insert a new subsection (13) in sections EW 29 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and Income Tax Act 2004. For clarification, it is considered necessary to add the words “under section EW 15D” for the Income Tax Act 2007 and “under section EW 15C” for the Income Tax Act 2004 in the proposed subsection after the words, “who changes from the fair value method” where they appear. Recommendation That the clauses be amended as set out above. Issue: Consistency of methods by groups of companies Submission (Matter raised by officials) The consistency requirement for group companies in respect of the expected value and modified fair value methods should also be amended so that it applies only to intra-group transactions – that is, transactions between members of the same tax group. It is proposed that those transactions be returned for tax, based on the IFRS GAAP financial reporting method used for the ultimate parent consolidation purpose, even if non-resident. 182 Comment The consistency rules for use of the above two methods will not apply to member group transactions with third parties when the transactions are entered into in the usual course of the taxpayer’s business, and the usual business of the taxpayer is clearly distinguishable form other members of the group. However, consistent treatment will be required where any of those transactions are back-to-back or otherwise intended to circumvent the policy intent. This change will need to be retrospective to the income year a taxpayer first adopted the original IFRS tax rules and it may be necessary for a small number of returns to be refiled. The changes outlined in the previous two issues may also need to be extended to some determinations which specifically include group consistency requirements for IFRS taxpayers. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and the consistency rules for the two methods be amended as set out above. 183 Partnerships 184 185 OVERVIEW The Taxation (Limited Partnerships) Act 2008 came into force on 1 April 2008. It updates the income tax rules relating to general partnerships, as well as providing for flow-through income tax treatment for the new “limited partnership” vehicle created by the Limited Partnerships Act 2008. The rules for general partnerships apply from the 2008–09 tax year. Two submissions on the partnership rules raised various technical aspects of the partnership legislation, particularly for primary sector partnerships. While the submissions relate to matters not in the bill, officials agree with some of them and have made recommendations accordingly. A significant change is to amend the partnership rules from the 2008–09 income year to ensure that death of one of the spouses in a husband and wife partnership where the other spouse inherits does not give rise to immediate tax consequences. All other changes should apply from the 2009–10 income year. 186 FLOW-THROUGH PROVISIONS Issue: Flow-through of activity, status, intention or purpose Submission (62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) Section HG 2(1)(a) should be amended or repealed. It is too broadly drafted, as it would treat, for example, a limited partner in a land development partnership as a land developer even in circumstances where the partner was not associated with the partnership. Further, the section is unnecessary as it is simply a statutory codification of the current common law position. Comment The Taxation (Limited Partnerships) Act 2008 was enacted, in part, to codify the current existing law and practice. Section HG 2(1)(a) reflects this by codifying the existing position. Officials do not consider that the wording would have the effect of tainting the partner’s other business activities in the way that the submission suggests. This is because section HG 2(1) applies to the partner “in their capacity of partner in the partnership” and therefore only affects the partner’s income tax liabilities and obligations in their partner capacity. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Anti-streaming rule Submission (62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watt) Section HG 2(2) should be replaced with a general purpose-based provision that prevents streaming of income when to do so would have a tax avoidance purpose or effect. Comment This rule ensures that different types of income cannot be streamed to take advantage of the different tax circumstances of the partners. In the absence of anti-streaming rules, certain types of income that is effectively non-taxable in the hands of the recipient (such as capital gains or income from PIEs) can be disproportionately allocated to partners on higher marginal tax rates, and taxable income can be allocated 187 taxpayers on lower marginal tax rates or who are exempt from paying tax – such as a charity – to reduce the amount of tax that would normally be payable. The following example illustrates the issue. Example Two partners each own 50 percent of a business. Partner A is on a marginal tax rate of 39%, and Partner B is a taxpayer who is exempt from paying tax. The business earns $100 of taxable income and $100 of capital gains (non-taxable income). 1. If the profit is distributed proportionately, Partner A will have $50 of taxable income and $50 of capital gains income. Partner A’s tax liability will be: Taxable income: $50 x 39% = $19.50 Capital gains (non-taxable income): $50 x 0 = $0 Partner B’s tax liability will be: Taxable income: $50 x 0% = $0 Capital gains (non-taxable income): $50 x 0 = $0 Total tax payable is $19.50 2. If the partners were allowed to stream the profits to take advantage of their different circumstances, they could ensure that the exempt income is disproportionately allocated to the partner on the higher marginal rate. For example, if all the taxable income is streamed to Partner B (the exempt partner), and all the capital gains are streamed to Partner A (the partner on a 39% marginal rate): Partner A’s tax liability will be: Taxable income: $0 x 39% = $0 Capital gains (non-taxable income): $100 x 0 = $0 Partner B’s tax liability will be: Taxable income: $100 x 0% = $0 Capital gains (non-taxable income): $0 x 0 = $0 No tax is paid in this instance. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 188 Issue: Anti-streaming rule should not apply for husband-wife partnerships Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Section HG 2(2) should be amended to exclude husband and wife partnerships or partnerships where the partners have a relationship that is in the nature of marriage from the ambit of the anti-streaming rule. Comment As noted previously, the purpose of the rules is to ensure that tax is not reduced by disproportionately allocating taxable income to a taxpayer on lower marginal tax rates, and allocating non-taxable income to partners on higher marginal tax rates. There seems no reason why this analysis should change for husband and wife partnerships. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Variable profit-sharing clauses Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) There needs to be clarification around variable profit sharing clauses, especially in relation to section HG 2 (1)(c) and the definition of “partnership share” in section YA 1. Comment Some partnerships contain a “variable profit sharing clause”. This allows one partner’s proportionate entitlement to income from the partnership to be different to his or her share in the partnership’s assets. For example, it is common in a professional services firm such as an accounting or law firm for each partner’s rights to the profit from the partnership to fluctuate from year to year based on their individual performance, but for each partner’s share of the partnership assets remains the same. For example, 10 partners in a firm each have a share of 10 percent in the assets of the firm. However, the partnership agreement may provide that their right to income from the partnership is partly dependent on their performance during that year. Therefore, a partner who performs particularly well may be allocated 12 percent of the partnership’s profits from that year and a partner who performs less well may be allocated 8 percent of the profits. 189 Officials consider that the current legislation allows a partner’s share in the income to be different from the partner’s share in the assets for tax purposes. This is because the definition of “partnership share” in section YA 1 refers to the “relevant share that a partner has in the rights and obligations and other property...in a partnership”. We note that section HG 2(2) does not prevent this outcome. Rather, section HG 2(2) is concerned about streaming. Officials will include the explanation above in a future Tax Information Bulletin. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Measuring partner capacity Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The time that partner capacity in the partnership is measured under section HG 2 needs to be clarified. Comment Officials consider that the partnership capacity should be flexible in its application, and therefore consider that it should not be rigidly defined. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Deductions for exiting and entering partners Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Section HG 2(3) should clarify that the exiting partner can claim a deduction for expenditure incurred up to the exit date and that the entering partner would be able to claim a tax deduction for the full income year. 190 Comment This section clarifies that a partner may be allowed to deduct expenditure incurred by a partnership before he became a member. It does not mean than an earlier partner cannot deduct anything. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 191 DISSOLUTION Issue: Death of a spouse Submission (Matter raised by officials) The rules that apply on the cessation of a partnership should not apply to a two-person partnership where the partners are married, in a civil union or in a de facto relationship, and one partner dies. Comment The partnership is treated as being dissolved in these circumstances. Where the surviving partner inherits the deceased partner’s partnership interests there is a tax base rollover. However the partnership cessation rule deems the surviving partner to have disposed of and reacquired his or her partnership interests at market value for tax purposes. This result is inappropriate and should be undone in these circumstances. We recommend that this applies from the commencement of the 2008–09 income year, which was the date that the codification of the partnership rules applied from. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Relationship property settlements Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) An exemption should be provided in section HG 4 for relationship property settlements such as divorce, similar to the provisions that deal with the consequences for when a husband or wife dies and the surviving spouse inherits the deceased partner’s interests. Comment As noted above, officials recommend that the partnership rules should be amended from the 2008–09 income year to ensure that death of one of the spouses in a husband and wife partnership does not give rise to immediate tax consequences where the surviving partner inherits from the deceased. A similar issue arises for relationship property settlements, and officials agree that the proposal should extend to these situations. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 192 DISPOSAL OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS Issue: Disposal at market value Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Section HG 4(2) and (3) should be amended to remove the need to have all partnership disposals treated as being at market value. Comment Officials consider that this rule can be clarified so that while its original object is met, the apparent overreach can be removed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Threshold at which partners must account for tax is too low Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The $50,000 minimum threshold in section HG 5(1) should be increased to $100,000. Comment The $50,000 minimum threshold in section HG 5(1) was chosen as an appropriate balance to minimise compliance costs. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 193 Issue: Thresholds at which partners must account for tax Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) If the $50,000 minimum threshold in section HG 5(1) is not increased to $100,000, then capital assets not subject to income tax should be exempt by amending the formula in section HG 5(1). If capital assets not subject to income tax are not exempt, a partnership should be allowed to revalue its capital assets before the admission of a new partner. This will effectively take non-taxable capital assets out of the formula in section HG 5(1) without the fear of being challenged as tax avoidance. If capital assets not subject to income tax are not exempt, the definition of “gross tax value” in section HG 5(2)(c) should be amended by treating non-taxable assets at their market value. Comment Officials agree that the definition of “gross tax value” in section HG 5(2)(c) should be amended by including assets whose sale or disposal does not have taxation consequences at their market value. Further, the treatment of assets, such as forestry, that have no carrying value for the purposes of this Act should be clarified. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarification of section HG 5 Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The rules around application of the $50,000 exemption in section HG 5 and its relationship with the exemptions in sections HG 6 to HG 10 should be clarified. Comment Officials agree with the submission and consider that this can be done by amending section HG 3. We agree that it should be clarified in section HG 3 that where HG 5 applies, then sections HG 6 to HG 10 cannot apply. We also note that section HG 3 should be further amended to clarify subpart HG overall. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 194 TRADING STOCK Issue: Trading stock definition Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) “Trading stock” should be defined in section HG 6. Comment Trading stock is defined in section YA 1 as per section EB 2. This definition appropriately excludes revenue account property that is land and forestry and consumables. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Clarification Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The reference to “quantum of turnover” in section HG 6(1) should be clarified so that it is clear when the quantum is measured. Comment This should be measured for the immediately preceding partnership income year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 195 DEPRECIABLE PROPERTY Issue: Depreciable intangible property Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Depreciable intangible property should be included as depreciable property for relief under section HG 7. Comment Officials consider that including depreciable intangible property as depreciable property for relief under section HG 7 could result in significant revenue risk. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 196 LIVESTOCK Issue: Technical issues related to livestock Submissions (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) A number of technical issues were raised in relation to the livestock provisions. These are: • Section HG 10 should be amended to apply to non-specified livestock. • Section HG 10 (1) should be amended to allow other valuation methods other than national standard cost. • The policy decision regarding having section HG 10 apply only to entering partners should be reviewed. • It should be confirmed whether or not high-priced livestock were intended to be included within section HG 10. • The policy rationale for a five-year spreading option under sections CB 27B and DO 11B should be reviewed. • The rules around valuation methods for partners as separate from the partnership should be clarified. • Sections CB 27B and DO 11B should be amended to include a mechanism for the exiting partner to disclose their net revenue gain or loss to the entering partner. This could be through the partnership being required to maintain the livestock schedule and advising all partners (exiting, entering and existing). • The tax effect of not accepting the rollover under section HG 10 should be clarified. • Section HG 10 should be incorporated into sections CB 27B and DO 11B. • If section HG 10 is not incorporated into sections CB 27B and DO 11B, signposts should be inserted from section HG 10 to sections CB 27B and DO11B. Comment Officials agree that the livestock rules should be amended so that: • There should be a new section HG 10 which states that: – An incoming partner may elect to spread any difference between the price they paid for specified livestock that the partnership has valued at cost at the end of the immediately preceding income year where the partnership has breeding livestock. – The details for this spread are contained in section E (see suggested new section below). 197 • There should be a new section in Part E which provides that: – Where an incoming partner has elected to spread the difference between the price they paid for the specified livestock and the partnership’s cost base carrying value of that livestock, then the spread shall be calculated as follows: - At the end of the income year that the incoming partner acquired the livestock: ° The partnership shall perform its specified livestock cost calculations as if the partnership had not changed. ° To the extend the partnership is using a cost basis, the incoming partner shall also calculate their value of specified livestock based on the price they paid. ° At the end of the next x years, the incoming partner may amortise on a straight line basis the difference between their calculation of the cost of livestock and their share of the partnership calculation. ° NB: x is 4 where the partnership change occurred before 2 July; x is 5 where the partnership change occurred on or after 2 July. ° This only applies when the partnership continues to value the relevant specified livestock at cost. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part, subject to officials’ comments. 198 RESTRUCTURING PARTNERSHIPS TO COMPANIES Issue: Partnership structure Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) A partnership (and sole trader or trust) should be permitted to restructure its affairs to take advantage of the reduction in the company tax rate without penalty (that is, it should not be viewed as tax avoidance). Comment Avoidance is determined on the facts of the case. Therefore, whether the restructure of a partnership into company form is avoidance will depend on the actual circumstances of the restructuring. Officials do not consider that introducing such a provision in legislation is appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Rollover relief Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Statutory rollover relief should be provided to allow partnerships to restructure into companies without the tax consequences that would normally arise. Comment The general policy concern with providing rollover relief is that it would set a precedent for business restructuring to be treated in this way in the future. Changes to entity-specific tax rules occur every so often and there appears little justification to provide rollover relief in this situation and not others. Further, rollover relief has the potential to be fiscally expensive. The corporatisation of a business is often part of the business’s life cycle and generally the private sector is able to plan for this. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 199 OHER ISSUES Issue: Non-resident partner’s partnership income Submission (62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) Inland Revenue should publish some guidance or commentary to clarify that a non- resident partner deriving what would otherwise be treated as foreign-sourced income through a New Zealand partnership will not be brought within the New Zealand tax net merely because: • the partnership is a New Zealand limited partnership formed and registered in New Zealand; or • the general partner is a New Zealand tax resident or has a fixed establishment in New Zealand. Comment The policy intention of the limited partnership rules is to provide flow-through treatment and limited liability to limited partnerships. The changes were not intended to change the rules on whether non-resident limited partners are taxable on income attributable to a permanent establishment in New Zealand. Whether or not a non- resident has a permanent establishment in New Zealand will depend on the facts of individual cases. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Approved issuer levy Submission (62 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) It should be clarified that the approved issuer levy (AIL) rules should be available for loans made by a New Zealand limited partnership with both resident and non-resident partners. Comment Under section RF 12(1), where interest is derived jointly by a non-resident and a resident (for example, by a partnership with at least one resident partner), the non- resident’s share of interest is subject to withholding at the RWT rate (the non-resident can apply to Inland Revenue for a refund if a lower rate is available under a double tax agreement). AIL is not available to them. This is a longstanding rule. The policy behind the limited partnership rules is to treat limited partnerships the same as 200 partnerships as far as possible. Officials do not consider that there is any reason to treat limited partnerships differently to partnerships in respect of the AIL rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: New partnership Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Clarification is required on Inland Revenue processes, such as PAYE, when there has been a change to the members of the partnership. Comment This is a processing matter, not a legislative matter. Inland Revenue is currently working on this. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Income equalisation schemes Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Sections EH 3, EH 37 and EH 63 regarding income equalisation should be amended to widen the definition of “person” in those sections to include a partnership. Comment Section 29 of the Interpretation Act 1999 provides the rule that a reference to “person” in legislation includes an unincorporated body. Officials therefore consider that it is clear that the definition of “person” includes a partnership. This means that partnerships are included for the purposes of the main income equalisation scheme in section EH 3 (for farmers and fishers, but not foresters, because foresters cannot use the main income equalisation scheme if they are an unincorporated body), and for the purposes of the adverse event income equalisation scheme in section EH 37. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 201 MINOR DRAFTING ISSUES Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The reference to section HG 4 in section HG 4(4) should be replaced with section HG 5, as section HG 4 cannot override itself. Comment Officials agree. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The words “or all” should be omitted from section HG 5 (2)(b). Comment This submission has been referred to the drafter for consideration. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Submission (Matter raised by officials) All references to “small partnerships” in sections HG 5 to HG 9 should be deleted because sections HG 5 to HG 9 are elective under section HG 3(2). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 202 203 Miscellaneous remedial amendments 204 205 ACC PAYMENTS Submission 1 (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) An amendment should be made to the taxation of ACC loss of earnings payments received in relation to an accident occurring in an earlier income year. A person can be overtaxed on an ACC loss of earnings payment that is paid in relation to an accident occurring in an earlier income year. For example, a person has an accident in the 2008 income year and is unable to work. A dispute arises with the ACC regarding the right to loss of earnings. The dispute is not resolved and loss of earnings payment is not paid until after the person returns to work in the 2009 income year. In the 2009 income year the person has a higher amount of taxable income and is therefore subject to a higher tax rate. If the loss of earnings payment had been paid in the 2008 income year when the accident occurred the amount of tax payable on it would have been less. Submission 2 (67 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The ACC loss of earnings payment received in the circumstances described above should be eligible for a rebate or taxed at the marginal rate applying to the taxpayer in the income year the accident occurred. The situation described above is inequitable. Similar to the redundancy situation, the issue is one of timing. The incident giving rise to the loss of earnings payment occurred in an earlier income year; however, due to a delay in payment (the delay being out of the control of the taxpayer) the income is derived in a later income year. Comment Current tax law requires that ACC arrears payments be taxed in the year of receipt. Lump sum payments may range from just a few days or weeks to periods exceeding 20 years. With the former, although the payment may straddle two tax years, the amount that relates to the first tax year may have no or little impact on the recipient’s marginal tax rate in the second tax year. On the other hand, arrears that relate to a number of earlier tax years may result in the majority of the payment being taxed at the top marginal tax rate. Officials will report to the Minister of Revenue later this year with proposals to address the issues raised in the submissions. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 206 FIFTY-THREE (53) WEEKLY INSTALMENTS OF WORKING FOR FAMILIES TAX CREDITS IN THE 2008–09 TAX YEAR Clause 19 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Remedial amendments are required to correct inequities in the write-off of certain Working for Families instalments. Comment The Taxation (Business Taxation and Remedial Matters) Act 2007 included amendments to provide an automatic write-off of a 53rd interim weekly instalment or a 27th interim fortnightly instalment of the family tax credits in the years in which those events occur, regardless of whether the instalments had been paid by Inland Revenue or by the Ministry of Social Development. The additional instalments arise in some years as a consequence of a year not dividing equally into 52 weeks or 26 fortnights. There were 53 weekly interim instalments in the 2008–09 tax year. However, in the process of translating the provisions from amendments to the Income Tax Act 2004 to amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007, some aspects were inadvertently omitted. The effect is that while the law currently allows the write-off of a 53rd weekly instalment paid by the Ministry of Social Development in the 2008–09 tax year, it does not allow the write-off of a 53rd weekly instalment paid by Inland Revenue. In addition, it was believed at the time of the earlier amendments that enhancements to Inland Revenue’s computer systems would ensure that families who received some instalments from the Ministry of Social Development and some instalments from Inland Revenue could not receive more than 52 weekly instalments. This has proved not to be the case and those taxpayers now need to be included in the scope of the provisions so that they are not required to refund an excess payment that arose in circumstances beyond their control. The problem of extra instalments will next occur in the 2011 tax year when there will be 27 interim fortnightly instalments paid. Officials will continue the development of an enduring solution that can be put into effect for that and future tax years. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and remedial amendments made to correct the deficiencies outlined above. 207 COMPANY TAX RATE CHANGE CONSEQUENTIALS Issue: Transitional imputation penalty Submission 1 (35C – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The rule concerning the transitional imputation credit account penalty should be repealed. Submission 2 (35C – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The penalty should be based on the amounts by which the dividends were imputed above the standard ratio of 30/70. Submission 3 (3 – Vector, 35C – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 60 – ASB Bank) The rule concerning the transitional imputation credit account penalty should be relaxed so it does not apply to the extent the dividend was paid out before the 30% tax rate applied (ASB and Vector); or before the later of 1 April 2008 or the commencement of the 2008–09 income year. Submission 4 (35C – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The rule concerning the transitional imputation credit account penalty should be amended so it does not apply to qualifying companies. Submission 5 (60 – ASB Bank) The rule concerning the transitional imputation credit account penalty should be relaxed so it does not apply where the dividend is wholly paid to non-residents as there is no tax issue here. Comment Companies are allowed to “over-impute” their dividends for a “transitional period” so that appropriate shareholder benefit can be taken from credits arising from tax paid at the old 33% company tax rate, rather than the new 30% tax rate. The “transitional period” begins at the same time as the 30% tax rate applies, the start of the company’s 2008–09 income year, and finishes on 31 March 2010. 208 The transitional imputation credit account penalty, which was part of the tax rate change package, is intended to ensure that during the transitional period company income taxed at 30% is not credited at 33%. Put another way, it ensures that excess “over-imputation” does not happen. This is meant to loosely match tax-paid income and tax credits available and protects the fiscal base. The methodology chosen was made as simple as possible to reduce compliance costs. Submission 1 We still believe that this rationale for the transitional penalty is appropriate and therefore we do not agree that it should be repealed. Officials understand it is having its intended effect of protecting the tax base. Submission 2 Officials acknowledge there may be an issue with the quantum of the penalty, but want to review this outside the tax bill. Submission 3 Officials agree with the submissions that point out that it should not apply where the dividend was paid out before the 30% tax rate applied. A number of companies pre- pay their tax so they can fully impute their dividends. It is quite possible that some companies in this position may have paid the dividends that now give rise to the penalty before the tax-rate change amendments were even announced. In this situation the rationale for the transitional penalty falls away. Thus we recommend that the transitional penalty rules be amended so that they only apply to dividends paid after a certain date. The question then is “what date should the new rule apply from?”. ASB and Vector recommend that it should apply to dividends paid out from when the 30% tax rate could first apply – the start of the “transitional period” (the start of the 2008–09 income year). Conceptually this submission is correct as this best meets the policy objective of (loosely) matching credits against income. PricewaterhouseCoopers recommends that it should apply from the later of 1 April 2008 or the start of a company’s 2008–09 income year, but provide little guidance as to why this is appropriate. In talking to those who have made submissions we have been made aware of several situations where over-imputed dividends have been paid out in the transitional period, but before the 2008 tax return has been filed. These dividends have been paid out based on the tax refund position shown in the 2008 financial statements, but this position has changed substantially after the dividend was paid, but before the tax return was prepared. We believe the penalty should also not apply in this situation as there was no intentional over-crediting. Accordingly, we recommend that the transitional penalty not apply where the dividends were paid out before the earlier of the date the company’s 2008 tax return was filed and the date this relief was announced, 25 March 2009. 209 Submission 4 Officials do not agree with the submission that the penalty should not apply to qualifying companies, as their imputation rules are much more prescribed. However, accepting the submission above that the penalty should not apply to dividends paid out before the 30% tax rate became effective addresses the major problem illustrated in the submission. That is, a refund relating to the 2007–08 or earlier income year being paid out in the 2008–09 or later income year where the dividend was paid out in the 2007–08 or earlier income year. Submission 5 Officials disagree with the analysis that suggests that where a dividend is wholly paid to non-residents there is no problem and the penalty should not apply. As discussed above, the penalty is designed to ensure that, to the extent reasonable, profits taxed at 30% can also be credited at 30% and there is no unnecessary build up of profits that have been taxed, but which cannot be covered by tax credits. The question of who the dividends are paid to does not affect this analysis. Recommendation That the submissions that the overreach the transitional penalty currently be accepted as indicated above. That the other submissions be declined. Issue: Attribution rule issues Submission (69 – Deloitte) To prevent an element of double taxation, companies that are subject to the attribution rule and who elect to use the qualifying company dividend mechanism should not receive an imputation credit gross-up. Comment Companies that are subject to the attribution rule (a rule that, in defined circumstances, attributes personal services income to the individuals who personally provided the services) are left with accounting income which is then taxable on distribution as a dividend. To minimise double taxation, the company is granted an imputation credit to reduce the taxation liability on the dividend. However, the submission points out that under the present rules, the dividend from a company that elected to use the relief provided by using the qualifying company dividend mechanism, would be exempt if it wasn’t credited, and that this outcome is appropriate from a policy perspective. 210 We agree with this remedial, but already have in place a process that will include it in the next tax bill. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: IFRS and R&D expense deductions Submission (35C – PricewaterhouseCoopers The compulsory use of International Financial reporting Standards (IFRS) to determine certain R&D deductions limits the ability of taxpayers who are not required to use IFRS to claim deductions. The reference to IFRS should be extended to deal with this. Comment The problem arises because of a late decision to limit the application of IFRS GAAP (generally accepted accounting practice) and extend the timeframe in which “old” GAAP (GAAP that preceded IFRS) can be used. Officials agree that there is a problem, but it is already being dealt with as part of the next tax bill. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 211 SCHEDULE 13 DEPRECIABLE LAND IMPROVEMENTS Clauses 423, 614, 620, and 622 Submission (35A – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Because pipes are a subset of “conduits” the word “pipes” is unnecessary and only conduits should be added to schedule 13. Alternatively, if the reference to pipes is retained in schedule 13, then “channels, aqueducts, canals and other conduits” should be added. Comment Adding “pipes and conduits” to schedule 13 provides certainty for taxpayers who have relied upon a Commissioner’s determination that includes various depreciation rates for different types of pipes. That is why the amendment is retrospective. Adding “pipes and conduits” was not intended to add canals, channels or aqueducts to the list of depreciable land improvements. We agree that “conduit” by itself is a very broad term. What is being added to schedule 13 is the term “pipes and conduits”. Legal interpretation suggests that in this context the term “conduit” is limited to only those kinds of items that are similar to a pipe – for example, ducts, and does not include all things that allow water to flow from one place to another. However, to remove any potential ambiguity, it is recommended that the term “and conduits” be deleted. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but the words “and conduits” be deleted. 212 CORRECTION OF CROSS-REFERENCE Submission (Matter raised by officials) A minor technical amendment is needed to correct a cross-reference in section RB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (Payment of terminal tax). The cross-reference should be to section RA 13 (Payment dates for terminal tax). Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and the cross-reference to section RA 3 replaced by a cross-reference to section RA 13 (Payment dates for terminal tax). 213 APPLICATION OF LATE PAYMENT NOTIFICATION TO PROVISIONAL TAX Submission (35 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Section 139B(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should clearly state that late payment notification should not apply to provisional tax. Comment The Taxation (Business Taxation and Remedial Matters) Act 2007 included a late payment penalty notification. Inland Revenue will now notify a taxpayer the first time their payment is late rather than imposing an immediate late payment penalty. If payment is not made by a certain date the penalty will be imposed. One of the submissions on the Taxation (Annual Rates, Business Taxation, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Matters) Bill noted that it was unclear how the taxpayer will be relieved by way of a notification from the late payment penalties for provisional tax payments as the penalty cannot be assessed until the final tax liability is calculated. Officials agreed with the submission and noted that the late payment notification should not apply to provisional tax and this would be clarified in the legislation. Under section 139B(1)(a), a late payment penalty is payable if the taxpayer does not pay by the due date an amount of tax calculated by the taxpayer or for which the taxpayer is assessed and the unpaid tax is provisional tax or a penalty relating to a failure to pay provisional tax. Section 139A(1)(b) and (c) then set out the notification period for other tax types and when the late payment penalty will be applied. Officials consider that section 139A(1)(a) already clearly states that the late payment notification should not apply to provisional tax. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 214 RESIDENT WITHHOLDING TAX ON FOREIGN DIVIDENDS Submission (71 – Deloitte) When a nominee receives a dividend on behalf of a New Zealand-resident investor from a foreign company and that investment is subject to the fair dividend rate (FDR) method of calculating taxable income, the nominee is not required to withhold resident withholding tax (RWT) on the dividend, as it is exempt from tax. Correspondingly, the nominee will be required to withhold RWT on a foreign dividend where the FDR method does not apply. Income is subject to the FDR method where an investor’s foreign investment fund (FIF) interests are above $50,000 at any time during the income year. The issue raised by the submission is that RWT may be deducted in error by a nominee. This may occur where a dividend is received by the nominee at a time when the investor is below the $50,000 threshold but the investor may later breach the threshold in the same income year, meaning that the FDR method will in fact apply to exempt the dividend from RWT. Deloitte states that the legislation requires amendment to ensure that an appropriate solution is in place where RWT is deducted from foreign dividends by nominees in such cases. Comment Officials consider that an appropriate solution is available under existing law, in the form of a credit for over-deducted RWT. The treatment of RWT deducted in excess is that it can be applied to the taxpayer’s income tax liability or, to the extent that there is no liability, refunded. While this approach is clear under section NF 7(5) of the Income Tax Act 2004, officials consider that the re-written version of this rule in the 2007 Act (section RM 8) should be clarified to ensure that the same result is achieved. The way to clarify the rule’s intended effect is through the ongoing Income Tax Act rewrite process. In the interim, the transitional rules under section ZA 3 of the 2007 Act should help to achieve the intended treatment. Under section ZA 3, the provisions of the 2007 Act are intended to have the same effect as the corresponding provisions of the 2004 Act. In practice, the application of any over-deducted RWT against a taxpayer’s income tax liability would be by way of the taxpayer recording a credit for the over-deducted RWT in the RWT credit box on their income tax return. Recommendation That the submission be noted.

Arrangement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Australia on Trans-Tasman Retirement Savings Portability 2 Context 1. The Government of New Zealand and the Government of Australia (the Governments): a. recognise the high degree of integration already achieved between the Australian and New Zealand labour, financial and goods and services markets since the commencement of the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement; b. acknowledge that the ability to transfer retirement savings across the Tasman would further enhance the development of a seamless trans-Tasman labour market; c. consider that the removal of further impediments to trans- Tasman labour movement will support ongoing work toward the goal of a Single Economic Market, to which the Governments are jointly committed; d. note the findings of the Trans-Tasman Retirement Savings Working Group that investigated options for improving the portability of savings between the Australian and New Zealand retirement saving schemes; and e. have reached the understandings outlined in this Arrangement. Purpose 2. This Arrangement is to give effect to the Governments’ shared intention to allow for the trans-Tasman portability of retirement savings. 3 Definitions 3. In this Arrangement: “source country” means: the country in which an individual’s retirement savings were first held. “host country” means: the country to which an individual’s retirement savings will be transferred. “provider” means: an entity that offers a KiwiSaver account or is an Australian complying superannuation fund. “self-managed superannuation fund” means: a self managed superannuation fund as defined in the Australian Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. “retirement savings” means: savings held in a KiwiSaver account or an Australian complying superannuation fund, including individual, employer and government contributions. Principles of Retirement Savings Portability 4. The trans-Tasman retirement savings portability scheme established by this Arrangement is based upon the following four principles: a. enhanced trans-Tasman retirement savings portability should complement a seamless trans-Tasman labour market; b. portability should allow retirement savings to be dealt with in a manner that generally meets standards for the treatment of retirement savings that are set by the host country; 4 c. portability should not lead to an unnecessary loss in the value of retirement savings; and d. compliance and administration costs associated with the scheme should, where possible, be minimised. Portability Working Arrangements 5. The Governments have mutually decided that retirement savings held in Australian complying superannuation funds or New Zealand KiwiSaver accounts may be transferred between Australia and New Zealand. In order to implement this understanding, the Governments consent to the arrangements outlined below. 6. For the avoidance of doubt, under this Arrangement, Australian- sourced retirement savings from an Australian untaxed source, or an Australian defined benefit scheme, cannot be transferred to a New Zealand KiwiSaver account. 7. The arrangements to enhance portability will be voluntary for providers as to whether they will accept transferred retirement savings. The arrangements will also be voluntary for individuals to transfer their retirement savings between Australia and New Zealand. 8. The transfer of retirement savings may take place once an individual has provided their source country provider with all the relevant details of the chosen host country provider. The Government of the source country may also require an individual to provide additional information (such as proof of address in the host country) to the source country Government or provider, before the retirement savings can be transferred to the host country. 5 9. Retirement savings may only be transferred to a provider in the host country that complies with conditions placed on the treatment of those savings by the source country, as outlined in this Arrangement. The Governments will provide for source country specific rules outlined in this Arrangement to be applied in the host country. 10. The transferred retirement savings must be separately identifiable within the account established in the host country. This separate identification will allow the source country specific rules specified in paragraph 13 to be applied to retirement savings that are transferred to the host country. That is, the transferring fund will inform the receiving fund of the total amount of retirement savings to be transferred, the amounts that were accumulated in Australia and amounts that were accumulated in New Zealand. 11. The Governments will exempt retirement savings transfers between the two countries from any entry or exit taxes and measures aimed at recouping Crown contributions to retirement savings. These include: a. in the case of New Zealand: i. an exemption from measures that seek to recover member tax credits from KiwiSaver savings; and ii. an exemption at the point of entry for Australian-sourced retirement savings from being treated as dividends for taxation purposes. b. in the case of Australia: 6 i. an exemption from the withholding tax levied on Australian-sourced retirement savings taken out of Australia by temporary residents. 12. New Zealand-sourced retirement savings will continue to be subject to the Australian non-concessional contribution cap arrangements at the initial point of entry. Australian-sourced retirement savings and any New Zealand-sourced retirement savings re-entering Australia will be exempted from the contribution caps upon re-entering the Australian superannuation system. The Australian Government will determine how Australian-sourced retirement savings repatriated to Australia are to be treated for taxation purposes. 13. Retirement savings transferred across the Tasman will be made subject to host country rules, with the following exceptions: a. Australian-sourced retirement savings held in a New Zealand KiwiSaver account may not be withdrawn to purchase a first home. b. Australian-sourced retirement savings held in a New Zealand KiwiSaver account may be accessed when an individual reaches age 60 and satisfies the definition of retirement at that age, as set out in the Australian Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations 1994. c. Australian-sourced retirement savings held in a New Zealand KiwiSaver account may not be transferred to a third country. d. New Zealand-sourced retirement savings may only be transferred to, and held by, Australian complying 7 superannuation funds that are regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. Furthermore, these retirement savings may not be transferred to, or held in, Australian self- managed superannuation funds. e. New Zealand-sourced retirement savings held in an Australian complying superannuation fund will not be able to be accessed under the retirement or attaining preservation age conditions of release, as defined in the Australian Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations 1994, until the age of retirement as defined in the New Zealand Superannuation and Retirement Income Act 2001. f. New Zealand-sourced retirement savings held in an Australian complying superannuation fund may not be transferred to a third country. 14. For the avoidance of doubt, this Arrangement applies only to retirement savings that are transferred from the source country to the host country. Once transferred, any earnings on these savings will be subject to the rules of the host country. In addition, any decrements to retirement savings balances would first be applied to host country retirement savings, before being applied to retirement savings transferred from the source country. Consultation 15. The Governments will use their best endeavours to resolve amicably any issues arising under this Arrangement and, as necessary, will consult to that end. 8 16. The Governments will, at the written request of either, promptly enter into consultations with a view to seeking an early, equitable and mutually satisfactory solution, if the Government which requested the consultation considers that: a. an understanding under this Arrangement is being or may be frustrated; or b. the achievement of any objective of this Arrangement is being or may be frustrated. Amendment 17. The Governments may amend this Arrangement by mutual decision through an exchange of diplomatic notes. Any such amendments will come into effect on the date specified in those notes. 18. The Governments have mutually decided that they will consult each other in writing on all significant amendments to their respective domestic retirement savings schemes that may affect the implementation of this Arrangement and/or the practical workings of retirement savings portability between Australia and New Zealand. Withdrawal, Termination 19. Either Government may withdraw from this Arrangement by giving written notice of that intent. In the event of a notice to withdraw, the Governments will work together to terminate this Arrangement as expeditiously as possible. Termination will take effect at the expiration of 12 months from the date of written notice or on the date specified by mutual arrangement through an exchange of diplomatic notes. General Review 20. The Governments will carry out a periodic general review of the operation of the Arrangement and its relevant legislation, to assess the effectiveness of the arrangements in fostering and enhancing workforce mobility between Australia and New Zealand, and whether any changes to the Arrangement or related legislation are required to improve the operation of the Arrangement. Effective Date 21. This Arrangement will come into effect on the first day of the second month following the month in which the two Governments have exchanged notes informing each other that their respective constitutional or legislative matters necessary to give effect to this Arrangement have been fulfilled.

Updated 12 August 2009 1 Q&A ON RETIREMENT SAVINGS PORTABILITY Why is retirement savings portability being implemented? The New Zealand and Australian labour, financial, and goods and services markets are highly integrated by international standards. Retirement savings portability is part of the Single Economic Market (SEM) work programme, which builds on our existing relationship and aims to reduce barriers that may impede the movement of people, trade and capital across the Tasman. The introduction of retirement savings portability will support and add to the degree of integration between the two countries by allowing New Zealanders and Australians to consolidate their financial affairs in their country of residence. When will the portability arrangements take effect? The Minister of Finance and the Australian Treasurer have signed a Memorandum of Understanding that formally records the intention of both countries to allow for retirement savings portability. To implement the arrangements, legislative changes are required in both countries, which we expect to be in place around mid-2010. What kind of transfers will be allowed under the portability arrangements? • Savings that are held in a New Zealand KiwiSaver scheme may be transferred to Australia. This means savings in all other funds (including complying funds) or other retirement funds cannot be transferred. • The arrangements will allow individuals to transfer all their savings held in a KiwiSaver fund, including member tax credits and the $1000 kickstart from the government. • The portability arrangements will be the only way of making a transfer of KiwiSaver funds to Australia. This means individuals will no longer be able to withdraw their savings as cash one year after permanently migrating to Australia. However, as noted above, you will be able to transfer the amount of member tax credits you have accumulated. The current KiwiSaver rules require you to return your member tax credits to the government if you withdraw your savings as cash. • KiwiSaver funds can only be transferred to Australian complying schemes regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA). This means you cannot transfer your savings to an Australian self-managed superannuation fund. For more information on which Australian schemes apply, go to http://www.apra.gov.au/Superannuation/ • Retirement savings transferred from Australia may only be transferred into KiwiSaver funds in New Zealand. This means Australian savings cannot be transferred into any other private retirement funds (including complying funds). If I move to Australia, can I leave my savings in KiwiSaver instead of transferring them? Yes. Transferring your savings to Australia when you emigrate is optional. However any contributions you make to your KiwiSaver account while living offshore will not be eligible for member tax credits. Updated 12 August 2009 2 If I transfer my savings to Australia, when will I be able to access them? You will be able to access your KiwiSaver funds at the age of entitlement to New Zealand superannuation. Currently this is at 65 years of age. Any earnings on these KiwiSaver funds as well as contributions made while in Australia will be subject to all Australian rules regarding access to funds. Which country’s rules will apply to savings transferred between the two countries? In general the rules of the host country regime will apply. However there are certain differences that will be applied to transferred savings in order to protect the integrity of the respective regimes. These differences apply only to the savings that are transferred, and not to any subsequent earnings on these transfers. The key differences are set out in the table below: New Zealand KiwiSaver funds transferred to Australia: Australian funds transferred to New Zealand: May not be accessed until the New Zealand age of retirement (65 years). May not be accessed until age 60 and the individual satisfies the Australian definition of retirement at that age. May not be transferred into Australian self managed superannuation funds. May not be used to assist with the purchase of a first home. May not be transferred to a third country. May not be transferred to a third country. If I transfer savings from Australia, can I use those funds to put towards buying a first home? As noted in the table above, funds transferred from Australia will not be able to be used to buy a first home. This is consistent with Australia’s policy regarding superannuation funds. In addition, any savings transferred from Australia will not count towards your eligibility for the deposit subsidy. For more information on the housing-related initiatives of KiwiSaver, go to http://www.hnzc.co.nz/hnzc/web/rent-buy-or-own/home-loans/kiwi-saver-home- ownership-features.htm How will these different rules be applied to transferred savings? Any savings transferred between the countries must be separately identified within an individual’s retirement savings account. Can I transfer my savings to Australia even if I don’t emigrate there? You can only transfer funds to Australia if you permanently emigrate. Before transferring your funds, your KiwiSaver scheme provider will require proof that you are residing in Australia. Can I transfer some savings to Australia and leave some in New Zealand? No. If you choose to transfer your savings to Australia when you emigrate, you must transfer them all. This avoids the proliferation of small and inactive accounts which are costly to administer. Updated 12 August 2009 3 If I transfer savings from Australia, can I withdraw these for reasons of significant financial hardship or serious illness? Yes, Australian savings transferred to New Zealand will be subject to New Zealand rules regarding hardship access. Likewise, New Zealand savings transferred to Australia will be subject to Australian rules regarding hardship access. Does my KiwiSaver provider have to accept my funds from Australia if requested? It is not compulsory for scheme providers to transfer or receive funds to or from Australia. However KiwiSaver members are able to transfer their savings to a KiwiSaver scheme that does offer this facility. Do I have to transfer my savings if I move to Australia or vice versa? No, the arrangements are voluntary. Will New Zealand tax any transfers from New Zealand to Australia or vice versa? No. Will Australia tax any transfers? Australia will not specifically tax the transfer of retirement savings to or from New Zealand. However at the initial point of entry into the Australian superannuation system, transfers of New Zealand savings will be subject to Australia’s rules regarding the taxation of retirement savings contributions greater than $150,000 per annum. This is known as the non-concessional contributions cap. Australian-sourced retirement savings, and any New Zealand-sourced retirement savings re-entering Australia, will be exempted from these rules upon re-entering the Australian superannuation system. For more information on this cap go to: http://www.ato.gov.au/superfunds/content.asp?doc=/content/00106372.htm&page=6& H6 Is there a difference in the rate of tax on earnings between Australia and New Zealand? Yes, Australia has a flat rate of 15% on earnings. From 1 April 2010 the New Zealand tax rate on superannuation earnings will range from 12.5% to 30%. It is also not straightforward to make a comparison between the two tax regimes because of other factors. For example Australia also taxes capital gains on equities whereas New Zealand does not tax capital gains on Australasian equities. There are also other advantages to transferring your retirement savings to your country of residence such as being able to consolidate you financial affairs and not pay multiple sets of fees.
Regulatory Impact Statement Executive summary Trans-Tasman portability of retirement savings The creation of retirement savings portability between Australia and New Zealand is expected to improve labour market mobility between the two countries and assist individuals to consolidate their financial affairs in their country of residence. The portability arrangements will apply to retirement savings held in the New Zealand KiwiSaver scheme and the Australian complying superannuation scheme. As these schemes have similar preservation requirements, the rules of the host country will generally be applied to any transferred savings. However there are several areas where the source country policies will continue to apply to these savings. On 16 July 2009, the Minister of Finance and the Australian Treasurer signed an Arrangement to record the intention of both governments to allow retirement savings portability. KiwiSaver: enrolment of under 18 year olds There is a lack of clarity about who can enrol children in Kiwi-Saver. The KiwiSaver Act does not prescribe who can contract with a scheme provider on behalf of a child under 18 years old. It is at the discretion of the provider whether or not an application is accepted. This has led to complaints and disputes from parents and guardians, as well as from children who have been enrolled without their consent. The preferred option is to create new rules governing the enrolment of children under 18, to provide clarity about who can enrol children in KiwiSaver. The proposed new rules provide that: • Children under 16 years old may be enrolled only by their legal guardian(s); they may not enrol themselves in KiwiSaver. • Children aged 16 to 17 with a legal guardian must co-sign with their guardian to enrol in KiwiSaver; they may not enrol themselves, nor can they be enrolled by their guardian without their consent. • Children aged 16 to 17 without a legal guardian may opt in to KiwiSaver by contracting directly with a scheme provider. This means that such children, who are married, in a civil union or living with a de facto partner, will not need a co- signed application to opt in to KiwiSaver. Distributions by co-operative companies Sections DV 11 and CD 34 of the Income Tax Act 2007 enable a resident co-operative company to deduct a distribution paid to a member if it is in proportion to the value of trading stock transactions between the member and the co-operative. This enables co- operatives to deduct distributions paid on supply-backed shares (that is, shares that members hold in proportion to their trading stock transactions with the co-operative). The proposed amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 would extend this treatment to enable certain co-operative companies to deduct for tax purposes a dividend paid on a non- transaction share held by a member. A non-transaction share is a share that gives a member the right to sell trading stock to the company but where the member has not exercised the 2 right. The amendment would apply only when the number of non-transaction shares held by any member does not exceed 20% of the number of supply-backed shares. A co-operative company electing to deduct distributions may also, by notifying the Registrar of Companies, be exempt from the 20 working day limitation in section 125(2) of the Companies Act 1993. The amendment would give the board of the co-operative greater flexibility to set a date for determining members’ entitlements to receive distributions (the “record date”). The record date may be any date within the financial year or other period to which the dividend relates. Cancellation of BETA debits from conduit-relieved dividends Prior to the recent international tax changes, conduit tax relief could be used to relieve tax on income earned in foreign subsidiaries, to the extent that the New Zealand parent company was owned by non-residents. The introduction of an active income exemption for controlled foreign companies, and an exemption for most foreign dividends received by companies, has made conduit tax relief largely redundant and so it has been repealed. To make the repeal of conduit tax relief effective, it is necessary to cancel those BETA debits that arose from conduit-relieved dividends. Cancellation will not lead to any double taxation as conduit-relieved dividends would not have been taxed in the first place. Other BETA debits will still be available for use during the two-year transitional period that was announced by Ministers in February 2008. Binding rulings Binding rulings are intended to provide taxpayers with certainty in entering into business transactions in which the interpretation of tax law is a key element. A binding ruling therefore sets out how Inland Revenue will apply tax laws to a particular arrangement. Taxpayers are not required to follow the ruling. If the taxpayer chooses to follow the ruling, Inland Revenue must apply the tax laws as set out in the ruling. New rules address two major issues that were the subject of an officials’ issues paper entitled The binding rulings system: legislative issues. In relation to questions of fact, the proposed amendments provide that the Commissioner cannot rule on the existence of facts but only on the application of tax laws based on the facts provided by the applicant. The legislation also sets out particular factual matters that cannot be ruled on—questions in relation to the taxpayer’s intention, the value of anything and what constitutes commercially acceptable practice. To remove any inference that the Commissioner is unable to rule on tax avoidance (which would defeat the main purpose of the suggested change) the exclusion for commercially acceptable practice is limited to where that term is used in the tax legislation. In relation to matters before the courts, the proposed amendments limit the Commissioner’s discretion to decline to rule on cases involving identical or substantially similar arrangements, facts or issues. Gift duty exemptions The Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 (EGDA) contains a number of exemptions from gift duty for certain types of gifts. In particular, section 73 contains exemptions for gifts made to charities and certain specifically named bodies. Over the past year, the Minister of Revenue and tax policy officials have received a number of requests for amendments to the EGDA to exempt certain gifts from gift duty. 3 The proposal therefore seeks to exempt the following gifts from gift duty: • transfers of assets by, and gifts made to, local or central government; • gifts made to donee organisations (organisations that are approved by Inland Revenue, which are listed at its website, or that are approved by Parliament and listed in Schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007); and • distributions of property made in accordance with a Court order under the Law Reform (Testamentary Promises) Act 1949 or the Family Protection Act 1955. Non-resident rig operators Non-residents operating offshore rigs or seismic vessels in New Zealand currently benefit from a temporary tax exemption on their profits. This exemption expires on 31 December 2009. It is proposed that this exemption be extended for a further 5 years, to 31 December 2014. Adequacy statement The principles of the Code of Good Regulatory Practice and the regulatory impact analysis requirements, including the consultation requirements, have been complied with in respect of each of the proposals described in this Regulatory Impact Statement. The Statement is considered to be adequate. The respective Regulatory Impact Statements were circulated with Cabinet papers for departmental consultation. Status quo and problem Trans-Tasman portability of retirement savings The treatment of retirement savings during an individual’s working life is an area where differences in domestic policy settings impact on the seamless nature of the trans-Tasman labour market. New Zealanders and Australians have an automatic right to move freely across the Tasman and are able to reside and work in either country. However, personal retirement savings accumulated in Australia cannot be transferred to New Zealand and cannot easily be accessed before retirement. The ability to transfer savings is one factor individuals may take into account when considering employment opportunities on either side of the Tasman. All else being equal, the inability to take retirement savings across the Tasman may act as a barrier to an individual taking up employment in the other country. The current inability of individuals to streamline and consolidate their personal retirement savings has led to some individuals paying multiple fees for the administration of their retirement savings accounts. This would apply to individuals who worked in Australia but have since relocated to New Zealand and established another retirement savings account. These costs undermine the effectiveness of policies aimed at improving retirement living standards. 4 The inability to consolidate accounts has also resulted in the proliferation of many small retirement savings accounts in Australia. The Australian Superannuation Minister has indicated that there is around A$13 billion in “lost” retirement savings accounts in Australia. Given the extent of labour movement between New Zealand and Australia, it is reasonable to expect that a sizeable amount of these funds could belong to individuals now living in New Zealand. The proliferation of these inactive accounts contributes to higher administrative costs, which potentially impact on the returns provided by private sector pension fund providers. The introduction of KiwiSaver, a work-based retirement savings scheme, in July 2007 has presented an opportunity to allow for retirement savings portability and assist trans-Tasman labour market mobility. KiwiSaver: enrolment of under 18 year olds The KiwiSaver Act does not prescribe who can contract with a scheme provider on behalf of a child. It is at the discretion of a provider whether or not an application is accepted. This has led to disputes between parents and guardians, complaints to Inland Revenue and scheme providers, as well as complaints from children who have been enrolled without their consent. Children and their parents are able to contest an enrolment on the grounds that the contract was non-binding. As the rapid growth in KiwiSaver membership begins to level off, a number of scheme providers are looking to increase their membership by encouraging the enrolment of under 18 year olds in KiwiSaver. As providers can decide whether to accept enrolments for under 18 year olds, there are instances where people other than parents or legal guardians have enrolled young people in KiwiSaver. People may enrol a child so the child can receive the $1,000 kick-start payment, without realising the full effects of the child’s enrolment into a scheme binding on them until they are 65. Distributions by co-operative companies Sections DV 11 and CD 34 of the Income Tax Act 2007 allow a resident co-operative company to deduct a distribution paid to a member if the distribution is in proportion to the sale and purchase of trading stock between the member and the co-operative. This enables co-operatives to deduct distributions on shares that members are required to hold to match the supply of trading stock to the co-operative (“supply-backed shares”). It is not always clear at the beginning of a trading season what the level of trading stock transactions for the season will be, so members may end the trading period holding shares in excess of those required to match supply. Such excess shares are referred to in this statement as “non-transaction” shares. Sections DV 11 and CD 34 do not apply to dividends paid on non-transaction shares, leaving the standard dividend provisions to apply. Having a different tax treatment for supply-backed and non-transaction shares does not conceptually make sense when these shares are of the same type in other respects. It would also create compliance costs for co- operatives, in particular when it is not clear at the time of payment of the dividend whether shares are supply-backed or non-transaction. 5 An amendment in relation to section 125 of the Companies Act 1993 is also desirable where distributions are payable on co-operative shares and the number of shares held by members varies periodically due to such things as the seasonal nature of transactions. Section 125 requires that shareholders’ entitlements to receive dividends shall be determined on a date set by the board (the “record date”) which must be a date within 20 working days of when the dividend is determined. If the timing for setting the dividend results in the record date being outside the period or season to which the dividend relates, members’ entitlements to receive dividends may not correspond with their capital contributions over the relevant period or season. This may act as a disincentive to members contributing capital to the co- operative company. Cancellation of BETA debits from conduit-relieved dividends Prior to the recent international tax changes in the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009, controlled foreign company (CFC) income was taxed twice: first when the income was earned by the CFC and attributed back to its New Zealand shareholders; and secondly when the CFC paid a dividend to those shareholders. Branch equivalent tax accounts (BETA) are the mechanism for relieving the double taxation that could otherwise occur from having these two layers of tax. As part of the international tax reforms, an exemption has been introduced for most types of foreign dividends received by companies. This removes the potential for double taxation, and makes it possible to phase out BETA accounts held by companies. In February 2008, the Ministers of Finance and Revenue announced that, after the international tax changes took effect, companies would be able to carry forward and use any existing BETA debit balances for a further two years. This transitional period was intended to prevent double taxation in the rare cases where dividends have been paid significantly in advance of attributed income arising. The existence of a small number of companies with very large BETA debit balances has recently become apparent. This is a particular issue for companies receiving conduit tax relief. In such cases, the excess BETA debits can potentially be used to offset tax on some other attributed foreign income, or even the attributed foreign income of other companies in the same group. Under the old international tax rules, this was not too concerning, since conduit tax relief could have been used to relieve attributed foreign income in any case. But under the new international tax rules conduit tax relief is repealed, so it provides an opportunity for some companies to effectively prolong conduit tax relief for a further two years. At the upper limit, between $300m to $400m of income tax could potentially be relieved in the two-year interval between the repeal of conduit tax relief and the proposed cancellation of BETA debits. Although this sounds large, it should be noted that, under the conduit tax relief rules, there was no limit to the amount of foreign income that these companies could potentially relieve. Binding rulings Section 91E(4)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 prohibits the Commissioner from ruling on questions of fact. An alternative interpretation was put forward that the Commissioner would be prohibited from making a private ruling on an arrangement when the description of how the law applies to the arrangement “expressly or implicitly requires particular facts to be found to exist before the description can be given”. If correct, this interpretation could mean that the Commissioner would not be able to rule on matters 6 concerning tax avoidance which could result in taxpayers being denied certainty in this important area. Such an interpretation may have implications for the validity of past rulings, as well as for the availability of future rulings, and create uncertainty and compliance costs for taxpayers in relation to current rulings applications. Under section 91E(3)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 the Commissioner “may decline to make a private ruling if the matter on which the ruling is sought is subject to an objection, challenge, or appeal, whether in relation to the applicant or to any other person”. An interpretation was put forward suggesting a broad application is possible. This could mean that taxpayers would be uncertain as to whether the Commissioner would issue a ruling in relation to any number of matters, again including tax avoidance. A broad discretion not to issue a ruling, as indicated by the alternative view of section 91E(3)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, does not fit well in a tax system based on self-assessment as taxpayers may be uncertain about how the Commissioner will exercise the discretion and may feel unable to confidently enter into legitimate business arrangements. Gift duty exemptions The way the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 (the EGDA) is currently structured means that gift duty has a wide ambit, as a gift is caught by the legislation unless it is specifically exempted. Consequently, Ministers and officials receive frequent requests for legislative change to exempt certain gifts. Transfers of assets by, and gifts made to, local and central government The requests for exemptions for transfers of assets by, and gifts made to, local and central government, fall into the following 4 categories: • Transfers of assets by local authorities—local authorities often transfer assets as part of local council restructurings, giving rise to gift duty implications. Restructuring transactions to deal with the actual or potential imposition of gift duty is resource intensive and inefficient for local authorities. • Gifts made to local authority trusts—the general characteristics of local authority trusts are that the sole trustee is a local authority, and trust funds are held for charitable (or public) purposes, benefiting all or a significant portion of the public within the territory of the local authority. Gifts made to such trusts may give rise to gift duty, because of the legal and evidentiary uncertainty of such trusts registering with the Charities Commission. • Gifts made to local or central government—a donor proposes to gift a number of parcels of land to both local and central government agencies, and wishes to ensure that such gifts are not subject to gift duty. • Gifts made to district health boards (DHBs)—DHBs are Crown entities owned by the Crown. For income tax purposes, Crown entities are treated as public authorities and are therefore exempt from income tax. However, gifts to DHBs may be liable for gift duty. A donor wished to gift a dialysis machine to a DHB but was concerned about the potential gift duty implications. 7 Gifts made to donee organisations Individuals, companies, and Māori authorities qualify for tax relief on gifts of money made for charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand, or for certain purposes overseas. However, the exemption from gift duty applies only to gifts that are made to organisations registered with the Charities Commission. Consequently, donors may be entitled to a tax benefit for their gifts to donee organisations but then subject to gift duty. This outcome has been criticised for being inconsistent. Distributions of property under Court order under Law Reform (Testamentary Promises) Act 1949 or Family Protection Act 1955 In 1993, estate duty was abolished for deaths occurring after 17 December 1992. Legislation effecting this abolition was passed under the Estate Duty Repeal Act 1999, which provided for the repeals of Parts 1, 2 and 3 of the EGDA. Under repealed section 7(2) of the EGDA, it was clear that the distribution of any property in accordance with a Court order under the Law Reform (Testamentary Promises) Act 1949 or the Family Protection Act 1955 was exempt from gift duty. Since the repeal of that section, the gift duty treatment of such distributions has become unclear. Non-resident rig operators A temporary 5-year exemption from tax on the profits of non-resident operators of offshore exploration rigs and seismic vessels was introduced in 2004. The exemption runs from 30 June 2004 to 31 December 2009. The exemption was introduced as part of a package of measures to encourage offshore exploration for gas. The tax exemption addressed problems caused by the way that New Zealand’s double taxation agreements impacted on non-resident rig operators and was intended to remove any tax biases impeding the acceleration of offshore exploration for gas. New Zealand firms are now drawing up their programmes of oil and gas exploration for 2010 and beyond and need certainty about the future tax treatment of rigs and seismic vessels. Objectives Trans-Tasman portability of retirement savings The objective of retirement savings portability is to improve labour mobility between Australia and New Zealand by allowing individuals to transfer their retirement savings to their country of residence. KiwiSaver: enrolment of under 18 year olds The objective is to provide legislative clarity about who can enrol a child under 18 years old into KiwiSaver. The KiwiSaver Act 2006 does not prescribe who can contract with a scheme provider on behalf of a child. It is at the discretion of the provider whether or not an application is accepted. This has led to complaints from parents and guardians, as well as from children who have been enrolled without their consent. The proposed amendments will create rules governing the enrolment of under 18 year olds in KiwiSaver, which will 8 reduce the incidence of complaints. If the proposed rules are not followed, Inland Revenue will be able to consider an enrolment invalid. Distributions by co-operative companies The objectives of the proposed amendments are to: • tax dividends paid by co-operative companies in a coherent and, relative to other co-operatives and companies, neutral way, while minimising compliance costs; • protect the interests of shareholders while minimising the compliance costs for the co-operative company. Cancellation of BETA debits from conduit-relieved dividends The proposed amendments aim to balance two objectives: • To make the repeal of conduit tax relief effective, by removing the opportunity for companies to use large BETA debit balances to effectively prolong conduit tax relief. • To allow BETA debits to continue to be used to prevent double taxation in cases where dividends have been paid (and taxed) significantly in advance of the underlying income being attributed (and taxed) under the CFC rules. Binding rulings The objective of the proposed amendments is to improve the binding rulings legislation and clarify key provisions to ensure that they apply in the manner that has been understood by Inland Revenue, taxpayers, and the tax profession since the binding rulings system was introduced. Certainty in relation to the outcome of tax laws is important for the unhindered progress of commerce and for the integrity of the tax system in a self-assessment environment. Gift duty exemptions The policy objective is to determine whether specific legislative exemptions from gift duty are justified for the requested gifts. In determining whether the exemptions are justified, the policy intention of gift duty (to protect against income tax avoidance, social assistance targeting, and defeating creditors) needs to be taken into account. Non-resident rig operators The objective is remove artificial biases to offshore oil and gas exploration, while ensuring the fiscal cost is acceptable and the integrity of the tax system is maintained. 9 Alternative options Trans-Tasman portability of retirement savings Status quo: The status quo would maintain the current restrictions on retirement savings portability. Under the status quo, an individual may transfer their KiwiSaver savings to Australia on permanent emigration, but Australian complying superannuation funds may not be transferred to New Zealand. As a result, the status quo is not preferred because it does not assist in improving labour mobility between New Zealand and Australia. Retirement savings portability with no policy differentials applied: Under this option, retirement savings could be transferred between the KiwiSaver and Australian complying superannuation schemes without restriction. The savings would be entirely subject to the rules and policies of the host country. This option is not preferred because it does not allow the Australian and New Zealand Governments to preserve the intent behind each country’s retirement savings policies. KiwiSaver: enrolment of under 18 year olds The main alternative to the preferred option is to allow any child under 18 years old to be signed up to KiwiSaver by their legal guardian, with or without the child’s consent. This option would also provide clarity for the rules by limiting who can enrol a child to the child’s legal guardians, and by ensuring that valid contracts entered into are binding on the child— that is, not subsequently contestable. However, this option does not recognise that as children grow older their intellectual capacity and maturity increases. Distributions by co-operative companies For the tax treatment of distributions, the three options are: • To retain the status quo, which would mean treating dividends paid on supply- backed and non-transacting shares differently, deductible and non-deductible respectively. • To treat dividends paid on both types of share as non-deductible. • To treat dividends paid on both types of share as deductible (preferred option). The first option is not preferred as that would mean dividends paid on the same class of shares would have different tax treatments in different circumstances (in some cases being deductible by the co-operative and having no imputation credits, and in other cases being non-deductible by the co-operative but carrying imputation credits). In principle, and to minimise compliance costs, all of the dividends should be treated in the same way. The second option is not preferred as this would mean making fundamental changes to the taxation of co-operative distributions without the time for full analysis and consultation. A full-scale review of the appropriate treatment of dividends paid by co-operatives should be undertaken before making such a change. An interim measure is required because a co- operative is contemplating paying dividends on non-transacting shares in the near future. 10 The options in relation to the record date for co-operative dividends are to: • provide that a special resolution of shareholders is required to set the record date; • extend the time limit for setting the record date relative to the date when the dividend is determined, from 20 to 90 working days; • provide that the board of a co-operative company may set a record date for determining shareholders’ entitlements to receive dividends that may be any date within the financial year or other period to which the dividend relates (preferred option). The first option is not preferred as the additional protection afforded by the requirement to obtain a special resolution is minimal. In addition, if the record date for dividends changes from time to time, it may be costly to require these changes to be approved by shareholders each time. The second option is not preferred as it is arbitrary and could enable the record date to be set outside the period to which the dividend relates. Cancellation of BETA debits from conduit-relieved dividends An alternative approach would be to extinguish all BETA debits from the date that the new international tax rules take effect (i.e. from a company’s first income year beginning after 1 July 2009). This would ensure that BETA debits could not be used to prolong conduit tax relief. However, to the extent that CFCs and branch equivalent FIFs not eligible for conduit relief had paid dividends under the old rules in advance of the underlying income being attributed under the new rules, this would lead to some double taxation. That would be problematic as a matter of principle, although few taxpayers are likely to be affected in practice. Another approach considered was to limit the use of BETA debits so that they could only be used to relieve attributed foreign income from the same country as that in which the dividend that originally generated the BETA debit was paid (jurisdictional ring-fencing). This approach would prevent BETA debits earned from an investment in a high-tax jurisdiction from sheltering the income of a new investment in a low-tax jurisdiction. BETA debits could still be used to relieve the double taxation that can occur when the same investment income is taxed as a dividend and then as attributed foreign income. However, jurisdictional ring-fencing was considered to be less effective at addressing the fiscal risk than the preferred option, and would have involved higher compliance costs. Binding rulings An alternative option in relation to ruling on questions of fact was to give the Commissioner a general discretion not to rule in relation to questions of fact. This was not preferred as it would still create uncertainty as to whether the Commissioner can rule on tax avoidance matters. In relation to ruling on matters that are before the courts, an alternative option would have been to base the exercise of the Commissioner’s discretion on factors such as the need for consistency in relation to specific common issues, integrity of the tax system and compliance and administrative cost reduction. This was not preferred as it would provide less certainty for taxpayers. 11 Gift duty exemptions An alternative option that was considered was to defer consideration of the current requests for exemptions from gift duty, and consider them as part of the wider review of gift duty that will be undertaken next year. This option was not pursued, however, as the review of gift duty may take some time and including these gifts as dutiable gifts currently serves as a deterrent for donors making such gifts. Non-resident rig operators A number of options for the tax treatment of non-resident rig operators have been considered, ranging from doing away with the exemption altogether, to making it permanent. The preferred option best meets the policy objectives. Preferred option Trans-Tasman portability of retirement savings Summary of preferred option The preferred option is to allow for retirement savings portability between Australia and New Zealand, with some limitations regarding the access to transferred funds. The portability arrangements will apply to retirement savings held in a New Zealand KiwiSaver scheme and an Australian complying superannuation scheme. There are several areas where the source country policies will continue to apply to transferred savings. These policy differences will be applied only to the savings initially transferred to either country. Any earnings on those savings in the host country will be subject to host country rules. To allow retirement savings to remain subject to some source country rules, transferred savings must be separately identifiable within an individual’s retirement savings account. The proposals to enhance portability will be voluntary for both retirement savings providers and members and there will be no enforced transfer of superannuation savings on emigration to either country. The following policy differences will be applied through the following portability arrangements. KiwiSaver funds transferred to Australia KiwiSaver savings that are transferred to Australia will not be able to be accessed until the New Zealand age of eligibility for retirement (currently 65 years of age). The benefit of this condition is that it will avoid creating an incentive to move, or retire in Australia to access KiwiSaver funds at the lower Australian age of retirement, which is currently set at 55-60 years of age. It also ensures that individuals are treated equitably in terms of accessing their KiwiSaver savings, regardless of whether they reside in New Zealand or Australia. KiwiSaver savings may be transferred only to Australian complying superannuation schemes that are regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA). This would exclude the transfer of KiwiSaver funds to Australian self-managed funds, which are 12 not currently regulated by APRA. Such a provision is required to extend the current KiwiSaver prohibition on self-managed funds in New Zealand. Transferred KiwiSaver funds will be subject to all other Australian rules governing the Australian Superannuation Guarantee scheme. For example, Australia does not permit withdrawals for home purchases or transfers of savings to another country (other than New Zealand). Australian savings transferred to New Zealand Australia-sourced savings may not be used to assist with the purchase of a first home in New Zealand. Australia-sourced savings held in New Zealand accounts will not be able to be transferred to any third country. This will preserve the current limitation on Australian residents taking their savings to other countries on permanent emigration. Australia-sourced savings may be accessed at age 60 if a member is retired. This will ensure that an individual is not disadvantaged by moving to New Zealand from Australia. All other New Zealand rules governing KiwiSaver will apply to retirement savings transferred to New Zealand, including hardship provisions. Taxation and other issues KiwiSaver member tax credits will not be recouped by New Zealand when funds are taken to Australia. Australia has also agreed not to apply any exit taxes to retirement savings taken out of Australia by non-residents before the age of retirement. To further protect the value of savings, both countries have also agreed to exempt any transfer of savings from being taxed as dividends. Under current taxation arrangements some Australian retirement savings may be taxed on entry into New Zealand as they could be treated as a unit trust investment. Cash withdrawals of KiwiSaver funds on emigration to Australia will no longer be permitted as a result of the portability arrangements. This will strengthen the primary policy intention of KiwiSaver—to encourage a long-term savings habit and asset accumulation by individuals who are not in a position to enjoy standards of living in retirement similar to those in pre-retirement. Impacts As far as possible, the portability arrangements will allow host country rules to be applied to transferred savings. The benefit of allowing host country rules to apply is that it reduces compliance costs for KiwiSaver providers who accept transferred funds as they are able to rely on their existing systems. Consultation with industry has identified that the requirement for providers to separately identify transferred retirement savings is likely to require some system changes by providers. As a result providers who choose to accept these funds will face some additional costs. However, without the separate identification of transferred savings, portability could not be implemented as New Zealand and Australia could not apply the policy differences necessary to preserve the intent behind their respective retirement savings policies. 13 To minimise these costs, generally only the initial capital value of the transferred savings must be separately identified. Earnings on these funds will be subject to the host country rules. Further consultation will be undertaken with industry to ensure that compliance costs are minimised as far as possible. The exemption from entry and exit taxes will ensure that an individual’s retirement savings are not eroded as a result of making the transfer. Given that Australian retirement savings cannot currently enter New Zealand, this exemption will be fiscally neutral. KiwiSaver: enrolment of under 18 year olds The preferred option is to provide for different rules depending on the age of the child: • Children under 16 years old may be enrolled only by their legal guardian(s); they may not enrol themselves in KiwiSaver. • Children aged 16 to 17 with a legal guardian must co-sign with their guardian to enrol in KiwiSaver; they may not enrol themselves, nor can they be enrolled by their guardian without their consent. • Children aged 16 to 17 without a legal guardian may opt in to KiwiSaver by contracting directly with a scheme provider. This means that such children, who are married, in a civil union or living with a de facto partner, will not need a co- signed application to opt in to KiwiSaver. This approach is consistent with the definition of “guardianship” in the Care of Children Act 2004, which recognises that as children grow older their intellectual capacity and maturity increases. Distributions by co-operative companies For tax, the preferred option is to extend the existing deductible distribution treatment to dividends paid on non-transacting shares provided these shares represent no more than 20% of supply-backed shares for any one member. This is warranted on the basis that, at a 20% level, there is still a close relationship between shareholding and trading stock transactions. It also minimises compliance costs. For determining shareholders’ entitlements to receive dividends, the preferred option for setting a record date is that it may be any date within the financial year or other period to which the dividend relates. This date should not be able to be set retrospectively. The option would enable the board of a co-operative company to reward members that contribute capital to the company throughout the relevant period. Cancellation of BETA debits from conduit-relieved dividends The preferred solution is to cancel only those BETA debits that arose from conduit-relieved dividends, and allow other BETA debits to be retained and used during the two-year transitional period previously announced by Ministers. This would be almost as effective as immediately extinguishing all the BETA debits, as conduit-relieved dividends have been the primary contributor to the build-up of large debit balances. At the same time, it avoids the potential for double taxation, as conduit-relieved dividends were not taxed in the first place. 14 Benefits and costs The main benefit of this option is that it would prevent a possible new specific fiscal risk— namely, the potential loss of revenue associated with a (limited) continuation of conduit tax relief for a further two years. The main drawback of the option is that it would increase compliance costs for some companies, by requiring them to look back and identify past dividends that had been conduit-relieved. Risks There is a risk that the corrective legislation will not be enacted before companies begin to use BETA debits to relieve attributed foreign income under the new international tax rules. This could mean that some relief would be clawed-back retrospectively, and companies would have further tax to pay. This risk is being managed by including the required changes in the first available tax bill. This bill should be enacted prior to companies attributing income under the new rules. Stock of regulation The preferred solution will require relatively minor changes to the Income Tax Act 2007— the insertion of provisions to cancel BETA debits from conduit-relieved dividends and prevent their use. Binding rulings In relation to questions of fact, the preferred option is that the primary rule be that the Commissioner cannot rule on the existence of facts but only on the application of tax laws based on the facts provided by the applicant. This would be accompanied by a list of certain factual matters that cannot be ruled on such as questions in relation to the taxpayer’s intention, the value of anything and what constitutes commercially acceptable practice. To remove any inference that the Commissioner is unable to rule on tax avoidance (which would defeat the main purpose of the suggested change) an exclusion for commercially acceptable practice would be limited to where that term is used in the tax legislation. In relation to matters before the courts, the preferred option is to limit the Commissioner’s discretion to decline a ruling to cases involving identical or substantially similar arrangements, facts or issues. Gift duty exemptions Exempting the requested gifts from gift duty is the preferred option. This is because granting the exemption for transfers of assets by, and gifts made to, local or central government would: • Encourage donors to give property (monetary and non-monetary) to local or central government. Currently, donors making such gifts are subject to gift duty. In essence, therefore, the Crown is the recipient of both the gift and the duty. 15 • Ensure consistency with other exemptions contained in the EGDA. For example, of the 12 named organisations listed in section 73 of the EGDA, three are Crown entities (New Zealand Antarctic Institute, Te Papa, and the Historic Places Trust). • Reduce compliance costs for donors wishing to make gifts to local or central government, as restructuring such gifts to ensure that they do not incur gift duty is currently resource intensive and inefficient. Granting the exemption for gifts made to donee organisations would align the gift duty treatment with the policy for encouraging greater giving to charitable and philanthropic causes. Given that the original policy intention of the EGDA was that distributions of property made in accordance with a court order under the Law Reform (Testamentary Promises) Act 1949 or the Family Protection Act 1955 be exempt from gift duty, granting the exemption will ensure that this intention is maintained. Revenue implications It is difficult to ascertain the cost of exempting transfers of assets by, and gifts made to, local or central government, because Inland Revenue does not have sufficient data. It is likely, however, that any cost would be insignificant, as gift duty currently acts as a deterrent in giving such gifts. This means that donors of such gifts would either not have given the gift, or restructured the transaction to avoid the imposition of gift duty. The revenue cost of exempting gifts made to donee organisations from gift duty is estimated at $0.5 million per annum. This costing relates to donee organisations that are not registered charities. Registered charities already have a gift duty exemption. The costing assumes that, of the total donee organisations listed with Inland Revenue, 5% are not registered charities. This cost is on the upper bound of the cost. Since distributions of property made in accordance with a court order under the Law Reform (Testamentary Promises) Act 1949 or the Family Protection Act 1955 have previously been treated as exempt from gift duty and the amendment is for clarification purposes, there would not be a revenue cost associated with this amendment. Compliance costs Approving the requests for exemptions from gift duty will result in compliance cost savings for taxpayers. The savings could be large for the exemption from gift duty for transfers of assets by local authorities. This is because local authorities currently restructure such transactions to avoid the imposition of gift duty, which is resource intensive and inefficient. Furthermore, because of the exemptions, donors of such gifts would no longer need to file gift duty statements with Inland Revenue. Administrative implications There could be small administrative savings for Inland Revenue, as a result of exempting the gifts from gift duty. 16 Non-resident rig operators The preferred option is to extend the temporary exemption by a further 5 years. This extension would run from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2014. Implementation and review It is standard practice for Inland Revenue to issue a Tax Information Bulletin following enactment of new legislation. The Bulletin sets out the details of the new law, including examples of practical effects. There are a number of ways in which taxpayers and practitioners provide feedback on the impact of new law. Specific implementation and review aspects of some of the major initiatives follow. Trans-Tasman portability of retirement savings On 16 July 2009, the Minister of Finance and the Australian Treasurer signed an Arrangement on retirement savings portability. Industry groups will have a further opportunity to provide input into the portability arrangements as the legislation is developed. The Arrangement notes that the Governments have agreed to carry out a periodic general review of the operation of the Arrangement and its relevant legislation, to assess the effectiveness of the arrangements in fostering and enhancing workforce mobility between Australia and New Zealand, and whether any changes to the Arrangement or related legislation are required to improve the operation or coverage of the Arrangement. KiwiSaver: enrolment of under 18 year olds Inland Revenue will develop a communications strategy to inform the public, scheme providers, employers, the media, and other interest parties of the changes to the KiwiSaver rules. Compliance with the new KiwiSaver rules governing the enrolment of under 18 year olds and the provision of annual reports via hyperlink will be monitored by the Government Actuary as part of the normal KiwiSaver regulatory process. Consultation Trans-Tasman portability of retirement savings The Treasury, the Ministry of Economic Development, Inland Revenue, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been involved in developing the retirement savings portability arrangements. The Australian Treasury has also been involved to represent the Australian government in the development of the arrangements. Officials met with the Investment Savings and Insurance Association (ISI) and the Association of Superannuation Funds (ASFONZ) to confirm that the high level details of portability were workable and to discuss some of the details of how a transfer would be made. 17 The representatives reacted positively to the proposal and were comfortable with the general process suggested. It was noted that a provider who chose to accept transferred funds would need to make some changes to their systems so that the funds could be separately identified and the policy differences applied. However, the voluntary nature of the portability arrangements meant that they could choose not to do this if they did not want to accept the funds. One group indicated a desire to extend the portability scheme to all retirement savings schemes, rather than just KiwiSaver funds. They also suggested that it would be desirable to allow KiwiSaver funds to be transferred to self-managed superannuation funds in Australia. Extending retirement savings portability, particularly to KiwiSaver complying funds, is something that could be considered in the future. However, at this stage, the only channel through which funds can be transferred is through an Australian complying superannuation scheme and a KiwiSaver scheme. Any extension of the portability arrangements would also require agreement from the Australian Government as they would want to be satisfied that the fund in question operated under similar rules to the Australian compulsory superannuation scheme. Allowing KiwiSaver funds to be transferred into self-managed superannuation funds is not being considered at this point because KiwiSaver funds are not able to enter these types of funds in New Zealand. The industry representatives also raised a number of points, including: • what monitoring will be done to ensure providers are complying with the policy differences applied to Australia-sourced savings in New Zealand; • ensuring that any subsequent transfers of Australia-sourced savings once in New Zealand are only made to KiwiSaver providers who offer the facility to accept these funds; and • whether New Zealand financial advisors who advise individuals on transferring their retirement savings to Australia, need to comply with Australian legislation governing the conduct of financial advisers. KiwiSaver: enrolment of under 18 year olds Inland Revenue, the Ministry of Economic Development, the Treasury, the Ministry of Social Development, and the Housing New Zealand Corporation were consulted on these proposals. KiwiSaver scheme providers and industry representatives support the need to provide clarity about the enrolment of under 18 year olds. Distributions by co-operative companies There has been no opportunity for general consultation with the private sector. There was consultation with several government departments—the Ministry of Economic Development, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. None of those consulted oppose the amendment. 18 Cancellation of BETA debits from conduit-relieved dividends The proposed change to the BETA transitional arrangements relates to two earlier policy decisions—to repeal conduit tax relief, and to introduce a foreign dividend exemption for companies. Those policy changes were consulted on as part of the international tax review, with a series of discussion documents and issues papers being published during 2006 and 2007. The Treasury has been consulted on this issue and agrees with the proposed change, described above as the preferred option. External consultation on this issue has not been carried out. This is not unusual for proposals intended to close specific loopholes in tax legislation that potentially allow for aggressive tax planning. Typically, the priority is to resolve the problem before alerting taxpayers. In addition, in this case, the problem was only recently identified and bill deadlines did not allow time for external consultation. It was important to introduce corrective legislation as soon as possible. Taxpayers will, of course, have an opportunity to make submissions on the proposed amendments during the select committee process. Binding rulings Eleven submissions were received on the issues paper entitled The binding rulings system: legislative issues, from • New Zealand Law Society • PricewaterhouseCoopers • Ernst & Young Limited • BellGully • Grant Thornton • Minter Ellison Rudd Watts • Corporate Taxpayers Group • New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants • Zespri International Limited • KPMG • KensingtonSwan Crown Law, Inland Revenue, and the Treasury have also been consulted. Inland Revenue and the Treasury agree with the recommendations. Gift duty exemptions The Treasury has been consulted on this proposal. Inland Revenue has also undertaken some consultation with the submitters who have made requests for exemptions from gift duty, particularly regarding the compliance cost impact of granting the exemption for transfers of assets by local authorities. Taxpayers will also have an opportunity to make submissions on the proposed amendments during the select committee process. Non-resident rig operators Ministry of Economic Development, Inland Revenue, and the Treasury have been consulted.
Page 1 15 October 2009 A special report from the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue New definitions of “associated persons” This special report provides early information on the new rules for associated persons which were part of the recently enacted Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009. It precedes coverage of the new legislation that will appear in a Tax Information Bulletin to be published later this year. The definitions of “associated persons” in the Income Tax Act 2007 have been reformed by strengthening and rationalising them. The definitions are mainly used in an anti-avoidance capacity to counter non-arm’s length transactions that could undermine the intent of the income tax legislation. The reforms address a number of weaknesses in the previous definitions that posed a risk to the tax base. These weaknesses have significant base maintenance implications in areas such as the taxation of land sales, dividends and fringe benefits. The main changes: • deal with the weaknesses in the previous definitions in relation to trusts. In particular, there are new tests focusing on a trust’s settlor (that is, the person who provides the trust property); • provide more robust rules aggregating the interests of associates to prevent the tests relating to companies being circumvented by the fragmentation of interests among close associates; and • implement a tripartite test associating two persons if they are each associated with the same third person, thereby making the associated persons tests as a whole more difficult to circumvent. The reforms narrow some current tests. For example, the ambit of the relatives test has been reduced from four to two degrees of blood relationship. The reforms rationalise the income tax definitions of associated persons and other income tax provisions that employ a similar concept, such as the definition of “related persons” in the dividend rules. This represents a major simplification and makes the associated persons concept in the Income Tax Act more coherent. The associated persons reforms are consistent with a key theme of the government’s tax policy work programme, which is ensuring that the income tax system is robust. Page 2 Background New Zealand tax law often subjects transactions between associated persons to special scrutiny because these transactions can pose a substantial risk to the tax base. Transactions between associated persons are more likely to lead to tax practices that undermine the intent of our tax laws because of the closeness of the relationships of the persons involved. The associated persons definitions are used extensively in the Income Tax Act 2007 to determine whether persons are associated for the purposes of operative provisions in the Act. These operative provisions are often of an anti-avoidance nature, and recognise that transactions between related parties are more likely to be non-arm’s length than transactions between independent parties, and that while associated persons are legally separate entities, they may not be economically independent. Because of their relationship to each other, associated persons can often be regarded as single economic entities because of their community of interests. This community of interests may justify these persons not being treated as independent entities for tax purposes. An important application of the associated persons definitions in the Income Tax Act is in the area of land sales. Parliament’s intent in 1973, when it enacted the current land sale tax rules, was that land dealers, developers and builders should generally be taxed on all gains on property sold within 10 years of acquisition, and they cannot claim to hold non-taxable investment portfolios. This legislative intent is clear from the parliamentary debate. Hon W E Rowling, Minister of Finance, who introduced the relevant legislation, said: “Profits and gains from real property will now be assessed when ... the property was acquired by a land dealer and either was held as part of his land dealing business and later sold – in which case the profits will be assessable irrespective of the period between acquisition and sale – or, if it was not held as part of his land dealing business but is sold within 10 years of acquisition, for example, claimed to be held as an investment but sold within this 10-year period.” It was therefore a deliberate decision by Parliament that gains on land sold by property developers within 10 years of acquisition should generally be taxed. The previous definitions of associated persons had a number of shortcomings. For example, the associated persons definition which applied for land sales contained loopholes which allowed land dealers, developers and builders to escape tax by operating through closely connected entities. The Income Tax Act previously had no coherent overall scheme for defining associated persons. For example, some definitions did not consider some obviously close relationships as being associated (for example, a trustee and a beneficiary). On the other hand, they treated some remote relationships as being so (for example, fourth-degree relatives). The multiplicity of definitions and other provisions employing a similar concept (such as the company control definition) created unnecessary complexity in the Act. Page 3 The new associated persons definitions address the previous shortcomings in the associated persons definitions in the Income Tax Act – first by addressing their weaknesses and, secondly, rationalising these and similar provisions in the Income Tax Act. Proposals to reform the definitions of associated persons were initially outlined in an officials’ issues paper, Reforming the definitions of associated persons, released in March 2007. The reforms have been the subject of extensive consultation and the new associated persons definitions incorporate various amendments that arose during the policy development process. This reform of the definitions of associated persons in the Income Tax Act, including the modifications arising from the consultation process, is the first comprehensive review since the inception of a definition of associated persons in the income tax legislation in 1968. Key features The reforms to the associated persons definitions in the Income Tax Act 2007 generally involve replacing the definitions with the objective of strengthening them. The other major part of the reforms involves rationalising these definitions and other income tax provisions which employ a similar concept. The changes aim to give effect to the policy intention of capturing non-arm’s length transactions, while not applying more widely than is necessary to protect the tax base. The tests of association in the new associated persons definition in subpart YB are as follows: • two companies; • a company and a person other than a company; • two relatives; • a person and a trustee for a relative; • a trustee and a beneficiary; • trustees with a common settlor; • a trustee and a settlor; • a settlor and a beneficiary; • a trustee and a person with the power of appointment or removal of the trustee; • a partnership and a partner; and • two persons who are each associated with the same third person (tripartite test). All 11 associated persons tests generally apply for the purposes of the Income Tax Act. The main exception is in the land provisions where modifications are made so the associated persons definitions cover situations under the effective control of property dealers, developers and builders, but do not apply to other situations. Page 4 The tests for determining whether two companies, or a company and a person other than a company, are associated persons include rules that aggregate the interests of associates. This prevents the company-related tests being circumvented by the fragmentation of interests among associated persons. The test for associating relatives is reduced from four degrees of blood relationship to two degrees only. This test is further limited to spouses and parents and their infant children for the purposes of the land provisions and compliance cost saving provisions relating to low turnover traders and adverse event livestock transfers. The weaknesses in the previous general associated persons definition in relation to trusts have been addressed by including tests associating a trustee and beneficiary, trustee and settlor, two trustees with common settlor, settlor and beneficiary and a trustee and a person with the power of appointment or removal of the trustee. A number of modifications apply to the trust-based tests to ensure that the associated persons definitions do not apply more widely than is necessary to protect the tax base. They include: • Not applying the beneficiary-based associated persons tests (the trustee- beneficiary and settlor-beneficiary tests), and the test associating a person and a trustee for a relative in the case of land sales. It is not necessary to apply these tests to catch the type of structures being used to circumvent the land sale tax rules; the structures causing concern can be caught by other associated persons tests – in particular, the settlor-based trust and tripartite tests. • Not treating charitable organisations as beneficiaries for the purposes of the trustee and beneficiary and settlor and beneficiary tests and excluding charitable trusts from the trustee and settlor test. • The definition of “settlor” that applies for the purposes of the associated persons tests will not include a person who provides services to a trust for less than market value. Persons who are married, in a civil union, or in a de facto relationship are treated as the same single person for the purpose of identifying a common settlor under the two trustees with a common settlor test in section YB 7. This treatment prevents the new associated persons definition being circumvented by the use of “mirror trusts”. The new associated persons definition introduces a tripartite test which associates two persons if they are each associated with the same third person, under different associated persons tests. The tripartite test acts as an important buttress to the other associated persons tests and makes the associated persons definition as a whole more difficult to circumvent. The reforms also rationalise the current income tax definition of associated persons and other income tax provisions that employ a similar concept, such as the definition of “related person” in the dividend rules. This represents a significant simplification and makes the associated persons concept in the Income Tax Act more coherent. Page 5 Application date The general application date for the reforms (excluding those applying for the land provisions) is the 2010–11 and later income years. For the purposes of the land provisions (as defined in section YA 1), except for the section which relates to disposal of land within 10 years of completing improvements (section CB 11), the reforms apply to land acquired on or after 6 October 2009, the date of enactment. Given that association is tested in the land provisions at the time of acquisition, this means that for land acquired before 6 October 2009 the former associated persons definitions are the relevant provisions in determining whether the sale of such land is taxable. For the purposes of section CB 11, the reforms apply to land on which improvements started on or after 6 October 2009. Therefore, in the case of the land provisions, the relevant application date is 6 October 2009 irrespective of a person’s balance date. Detailed analysis Subpart YB containing the associated persons definition rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 has been substantially replaced. New section YB 1(4) states the general rule that the various associated persons tests in subpart YB apply for the purposes of the whole Act unless a provision expressly states otherwise. The main situation where certain exceptions will apply in the new associated persons tests are the land provisions, which are defined in section YA 1. For example, a narrow range of relatives (namely, spouses, civil union partners, de facto partners, and infant children) applies in the new associated persons definitions for the purposes of the land provisions. New sections YB 1(5) to (8) contain cross-references to several special rules that modify the associated persons definitions for the purpose of specific provisions. These special rules are contained in sections DS 4 (Meaning of film reimbursement scheme), EB 13 (Low-turnover valuation), EX 4 (Limits to requirement to include associated person interests in the controlled foreign company rules), and LP 2 (Tax credits for supplementary dividends). These special rules have not been changed as part of this reform. Two companies test (section YB 2) Section YB 2 contains the test for associating two companies. Two companies will be associated if: • there is a group of persons whose total voting interests in each company are 50% or more – this is the primary test for associating two companies. The concept of voting interests is defined in subpart YC; Page 6 • a market value circumstance exists for either company and there is a group of persons whose total market value interests in each company are 50% or more. A “market value circumstance” is defined in section YA 1 and a “market value interest” is defined in subpart YC. Under the measurement of company ownership rules in subpart YC, a person’s interest in a company is generally measured by reference to the person’s voting interests in the company. If these voting interests in certain circumstances – coming within the definition of “market value circumstance” in section YA 1 – do not reflect accurately the person’s economic interest in a company then the person’s interests are also measured by reference to the person’s market value interests in the company; or • there is a group of persons who control both companies by any other means. Aggregation rule The test associating two companies contains a general aggregation rule which provides that in determining whether two companies are associated, a person is treated as holding anything held by persons associated with that person under sections YB 4 to YB 14 (section YB 2(4)). This rule applies for the purposes of the whole Act except the land provisions. The aggregation rule is designed to prevent the two companies test being circumvented by the fragmentation of interests among associated persons, resulting in the 50% interest threshold not being reached. The two companies test contains a separate rule which aggregates the interests of associates for the purposes of the land provisions (section YB 2(5). Under this rule, a person is treated as holding anything held by persons associated with them under the limited relatives definition in section YB 4 (namely, spouses, civil union partners, de facto partners and infant children) and under the tests in sections YB 7, YB 8, and YB 10 to YB 14. This modification ensures that for the purposes of the land provisions, the general relatives test and the beneficiary-related trust tests do not apply in the aggregation rule for the test associating two companies. When applying the rules aggregating the interest of associates, the rule is applied afresh to each person and it is irrelevant that a person does not directly hold any shares in a company before the application of the aggregation rule. Page 7 Example Application of general aggregation rule in two companies test Suzy Company A 100% Company B Suzy Co Trust 100% Power of appointment 100% Associated under the tripartite test in sYB 14 In this example the aggregation rule, in conjunction with the tripartite test, can be applied to treat Suzy as holding Trust’s shares in Company B. Specifically, Suzy is associated with Suzy Co under the company and person other than a company test in section YB 3, and Suzy Co (with power of appointment of the trustees of Trust) is associated with Trust under section YB 11. Therefore, Suzy and Trust are associated under the tripartite test, and the aggregation rule in section YB 2(4) treats Suzy as holding Trust’s shares in Company B. Taking into account the shares Suzy holds directly in Company A, Company A and Company B are associated under the two companies test in section YB 2. Page 8 Example Application of general aggregation rule in two companies test Jo John (Jo’s son) Company A 100% sYB 4 Company B John Co Trust 100% Beneficiary of trust 100% Associated under the tripartite test in sYB 14 In this example, the question is whether Company A and Company B are associated. First, in conjunction with the relatives test in section YB 4, the aggregation rule in section YB 2(4) is applied so that John is treated as holding anything held by his associates. In this case, John is treated as holding Jo’s shares in Company A through his association with Jo under the relatives test in section YB 4. Secondly, the aggregation rule, in conjunction with the tripartite test, can also be applied to treat John as holding Trust’s shares in Company B. This is because John is associated with Trust under the tripartite test in section YB 14. Specifically, John is associated with John Co under the company and person other than a company test in section YB 3, and John Co (as beneficiary of Trust) is associated with Trust under the trustee and beneficiary test in section YB 6. Therefore, John and the Trust are associated under the tripartite test, and the aggregation rule in section YB 2(4) treats John as holding Trust’s shares in Company B. As a result, because John is treated as holding all the shares in Company A and Company B under section YB 2(4), Company A and Company B are associated under section YB 2. It is irrelevant that John does not directly hold shares in Company A and Company B before the application of the aggregation rule in section YB 2(4). Page 9 Example Application of aggregation rule in two companies test in the context of the land provisions Company A (Developer) 100% Company B (sells land) H 100% W In this example, the husband owns 100% of the voting interests in Company A, which is a property developer, and his wife holds 100% of the voting interests in Company B, which sells some land within 10 years of acquisition. Without the aggregation rule in section YB 2(5), the two companies would not be associated despite their close community of interests. The application of the aggregation rule ensures that the two companies are associated under section YB 2, resulting in Company B being liable to tax on the sale of the land. Example Application of aggregation rule in two companies test in the context of the land provisions Settlor Trust ATrust B Company A (Developer) Company B (sells land) 100% 100% In this example, Trust A and Trust B are associated under the two trustees with common settlor test in section YB 7. Trust A owns 100% of the voting interests in Company A, which is a property developer, and Trust B owns 100% of the voting interests in Company B, which sells some land within 10 years of acquisition. The two companies are associated under the two companies test through the use of the aggregation rule contained in that test. Applying the aggregation rule to this example, Trust A is treated as holding anything held by persons associated with it. In this case, Trust A and Trust B are associated under the two trustees with common settlor test in section YB 7. Accordingly, taking into account Trust A’s direct shareholding in Company A, Trust A is treated as holding all the voting interests in Company A and Company B, meaning these two companies are associated. The aggregation rule can also be applied to treat the common settlor as holding all the voting interests in Company A and Company B because the settlor is associated with Trust A and Trust B under the trustee-settlor test in section YB 8. This also means the two companies are associated. A result of Company A and Company B being associated is that Company B is liable to tax on the sale of land. Without the aggregation rule, Company A and Company B would not be associated despite their close community of interests. Page 10 Other features The two companies test provides that the control by any other means limb in the test does not apply to a company that is a state enterprise, Crown Research Institute, Crown health enterprise or a company that is part of the same group of companies as one of these Crown-related entities (section YB 2(6)). It also provides that in the international tax rules (defined in section YA 1) two companies are not associated if one, but not both, is a non-resident (section YB 2(7)). Additionally, for the purposes of the land provisions, two companies are not associated persons if one is a portfolio investment entity (PIE) or an entity that qualifies for PIE status (section YB 2(8)). This exception ensures that a widely held managed fund is not adversely affected because of the personal land dealings of the directors of the fund. Company and person other than a company test (section YB 3) Section YB 3 contains the test for associating a company and a person other than a company. A company and a person other than a company are associated if: • the person has a voting interest in the company of 25% or more. The concept of voting interests is defined in subpart YC; or • a market value circumstance exists for the company and the person has a market value interest in the company of 25% or more. A “market value circumstance” is defined in section YA 1, and a “market value interest” is defined in subpart YC. Under the measurement of company ownership rules in subpart YC, a person’s interest in a company is generally measured by reference to the person’s voting interests in the company. If these voting interests in certain circumstances – coming within the definition of “market value circumstance” in section YA 1 – do not reflect accurately the person’s economic interest in a company then the person’s interests are also measured by reference to the person’s market value interests in the company. Aggregation rule The test associating a company and person other than a company test contains a general aggregation rule, which applies for the purposes of the whole Act except the land provisions (section YB 3(3)). Accordingly, for the purposes of determining whether a company and a person other than a company are associated, a person is treated as holding anything held by persons associated with the person under sections YB 4 to YB 14. This aggregation rule is designed to prevent the test associating a company and a person other than a company being circumvented by the fragmentation of interests among associated persons, resulting in the interest threshold of 25% not being reached. Page 11 The test associating a company and a person other than a company contains a separate rule which aggregates the interests of associates for the purposes of the land provisions (section YB 3(4)). Under this rule, a person is treated as holding anything held by persons associated with the person under the limited relatives definition in sections YB 4 (namely, spouses, civil union partners, de facto partners, and infant children) and under the tests in sections YB 7, YB 8, and YB 10 to YB 14. This modification ensures that for the purposes of the land provisions, the general relatives test and the beneficiary-related trust tests do not apply in the aggregation rule for the test associating a company and person other than a company. When applying the rule aggregating the interests of associates, the rule is applied afresh to each person being tested for association with a company and it is irrelevant that a person does not directly hold shares in a company before the application of the aggregation rule. The aggregation rules are an element of both of the company-based tests in sections YB 2 and YB 3. As noted above, the aggregation rules are designed to prevent these tests being circumvented by the fragmentation of interests among associated persons, resulting in the interest thresholds in these tests not being met. As such, the aggregation rules do not act as separate associated persons tests. Example Application of the general aggregation rule in the company and person other than a company test Sister B Family Company 10% Sister CSister A 10%10% Without an aggregation rule, neither Sister A, B nor C would be associated with Family Company under the company and person other than a company test because their respective interests do not meet the required 25% threshold. However, under the aggregation rule in section YB 3(3), each sister would be associated with the company. This is because for the purposes of determining whether Sister A is associated with Family Company under section YB 3(1), she is treated as holding her sisters’ 20% voting interests in the company (10% each from Sister B and Sister C). This 20%, when aggregated with her own 10% voting interest, means that Sister A is treated as holding a 30% interest and, therefore, is associated with the company. The aggregation rule applies afresh to each person – so similarly, Sister B and Sister C are each treated as holding the other two sisters’ aggregate 20% voting interests in the company. Therefore, when aggregated with the 10% interest they each own in the company, Sister B and Sister C are each associated with Family Company. Page 12 Example Application of the general aggregation rule in the company and person other than a company test Jo Family Trust No. 1 Family Trust No. 2 Jo’s spouseJo’s child settlessettles Family Co. 20%20% 20% 20%20% Jo settles Family Trusts No. 1 and No. 2 and arranges for each of them to hold 20% of the shares in Family Co. Jo also arranges for his spouse and child to hold 20% each in Family Co. Jo directly holds only 20%. Under the aggregation rule in section YB 3(3), Jo is treated as holding the shares in Family Co held by the family trusts and relatives because they are his associates. Accordingly, Jo is associated with Family Co. Without the rule aggregating the interests held by associated persons Jo would not be associated with Family Co despite the close community of interests. Example Application of aggregation rule in the company and person other than a company test in the context of the land provisions Settlor Trust 1Trust 2 Developer Co. Appointer 100% Relative The question in this case is whether the appointer of the trustee in Trust 2 is associated with Developer Co under the test in section YB 3 associating a company and a person other than a company. The appointer is associated with Developer Co under this test because of the application of the aggregation rule for land provisions in section YB 3(4) which treats a person as holding anything held by their associates. The appointer is associated with Trust 1 under the tripartite test in section YB 14. Specifically, the appointer is associated with Trust 2 under the test in section YB 11 associating a trustee and their appointer, and Trust 2 is associated with Trust 1 under the test in section YB 7 associating two trustees with a common settlor. Therefore, under the aggregation rule for land provisions in section YB 3(4) the appointer is treated as holding Trust 1’s shares in Developer Co. Accordingly, the appointer and Developer Co are associated under section YB 3. Note, however, that the relative of the appointer would not be associated with Developer Co. In particular, the tripartite test does not associate Trust 1 and the relative and therefore the relative is not treated as holding Trust 1’s shares in Developer Co. The aggregation rule is applied afresh to the relative, and not to the appointer, for the purposes of determining whether the relative is associated with Developer Co. Therefore, the fact that the appointer is treated under the aggregation rule as holding Trust 1’s shares when testing for association between the appointer and Developer Co is disregarded when testing for association between the relative and Developer Co. Page 13 Corporate trustees In section YB 3, “a person other than a company” includes a company acting in its capacity as a trustee of a trust (section YB 3(5)). This amendment is of a clarifying nature only and is consistent with long-standing policy (Tax Information Bulletin, Vol. 3, No. 7, April 1992 at page 23). The company look-through rules in subpart YC applying to voting and market value interests do not apply to a corporate trustee; therefore, the voting interests or market value interests held by a corporate trustee are not traced through to the shareholders of that corporate trustee. This treatment is a result of the separate capacity that a trustee (whether a company or natural person) has under the Income Tax Act 2007, and is recognised in the definition of “trustee” in section YA 1 which refers to a trustee “only in the capacity of trustee of the trust”. This separate trustee capacity feature of the income tax law has been maintained in the new associated persons definitions. Therefore the shareholders of a corporate trustee are not relevant when testing for association between that trustee and other persons. This is consistent with the general position under the Income Tax Act, which is that a company acting in its capacity as trustee is treated as a trustee rather than a company. This means that the relevant test for determining association between a corporate trustee and a company in which the corporate trustee is a shareholder is section YB 3. Relatives test (section YB 4) There are three limbs to the general relatives test in the new associated persons definitions: • The first limb associates two persons who are within two degrees of blood relationship (section YB 4(1)(a)). Previously the general relatives test extended to the fourth degree of blood relationship. This means that the blood relationships limb of the general relatives test extends to grandparents and siblings but not to nephews and nieces (third degree) and cousins (fourth degree) as the previous test did. • The second limb associates two persons who are married, in a civil union, or in a de facto relationship (section YB 4(1)(b)). • The third limb associates two persons if one person is within two degrees of blood relationship to the other person’s spouse, civil union partner or de facto partner (section YB 4(1)(c)). This limb associates persons with their in-laws and step-children. For the purposes of the relatives associated persons test, a child by adoption is treated as a natural child of the adoptive parents and not as a natural child of the birth parents (section YB 4(3)). Page 14 A new provision (section YB 4(4)) has been added to the test associating two relatives to ensure that a person is not associated with another person if the person cannot reasonably be expected to know that the other person exists or that they are within two degrees of blood relationship to the other person. This exclusion is designed to deal with a small minority of situations such as when siblings are separated at a very young age and do not know of each other’s existence. Narrower application of relatives test in certain cases (section YB 4(2)) The first and third limbs (section YB 4(1)(a) and (c)) of the general relatives test of association do not apply for the purposes of the land provisions (defined in section YA 1) or two compliance-cost saving provisions in the Income Tax Act – namely, the low turnover trader provision in section EB 13, and the provision relating to the adverse event livestock transfers in section EC 5. In these circumstances, persons are associated because of a blood relationship only if one is the infant child of the other. An “infant child” is defined in the Age of Majority Act 1970 as a person under 20 years of age. Example Application of narrow relatives test in section YB 4(2) Step-mother company ($3 million turnover) X 100% Adult Sam ($150,000 turnover) MotherFather Father’s new wife (Step-mother) X Under the trading stock provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007, there are special low-compliance cost rules which apply to a “low-turnover trader”. For a person to be a low-turnover trader, the turnover of that person’s business, when aggregated with the turnover of associated persons, must be no more than $3 million. In this example, because a narrow relatives test applies for the purposes of the low-turnover trader rules, Adult Sam and Step-mother company are not associated and therefore Sam is entitled to use the low-turnover trader rules for his business. In particular, because Adult Sam is not treated under the relatives test in section YB 4 as being associated with his step-mother, the aggregation rule in the test in section YB 3 associating a company and a person other than a company does not apply to treat Adult Sam as holding his step-mother’s shares in her company. If the ordinary relatives associated persons test had applied to the low-turnover trader rules Sam would be treated as being associated with Step- mother company under section YB 3 and therefore would not have been entitled to use the low- turnover trader rules. Page 15 Trustee for relative test (section YB 5) A person (first person) and a trustee of a trust under which a relative (as defined in section YB 4) of the first person has benefited or is eligible to benefit are associated persons under new section YB 5. For example, a husband and a trustee of a trust under which the husband’s wife is a beneficiary would be associated under this test. The trustee for relative test does not apply for the purposes of the land provisions. This is consistent with the land provision exclusions in the other beneficiary-related tests in section YB 6 (trustee and beneficiary) and YB 9 (settlor and beneficiary). Example Person and trustee for relative: exception for the purposes of the land provisions Trustee (Developer) WifeHusband Beneficiary of trust X Because the trustee for relative test does not apply for the purposes of the land provisions, the husband would not be associated with the trustee of the trust under which his wife is a beneficiary. Under the previous trustee for relative test in former section YB 12, the husband would have been associated with the trustee for the purposes of the land provisions. Additionally, as further discussed below, this test does not apply to lines trusts established under the Energy Companies Act 1992 (energy consumer trusts) or the unit trust administering bonus bonds (section YB 16). Trustee and beneficiary test (section YB 6) A trustee of a trust and a person who has benefited or is eligible to benefit under the trust are associated persons under new section YB 6. This provision does not apply for the purposes of the land provisions. Persons have benefited under a trust if they have received a distribution under the trust. Page 16 Inland Revenue’s long-standing policy on when a person is eligible to benefit under a trust will continue (Tax Information Bulletin, Vol. 7, No. 9, February 1996 at page 25). In particular, a person is “eligible to benefit” when the person is either: • named by the trustee as a potential beneficiary; or • designated as a member of a class of potential beneficiaries, for example, “the children of ...”. When trustees have a general power of appointment, persons not already appointed as beneficiaries under the power are not treated as being eligible to benefit. Therefore, a person who is eligible to benefit under a trust (as described above) does not need to have actually received a distribution (as defined in section HC 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007) under the trust to qualify as a beneficiary. An exception to the trustee and beneficiary test for certain employee trusts is contained in section YB 15. Additionally, as with section YB 5, this test does not apply to energy consumer trusts or the unit trust administering bonus bonds (section YB 16). The previous general definition of associated persons did not contain a trustee and beneficiary test. This constituted a significant omission in test coverage and transactions were often structured to take advantage of the loophole. Without a trustee and beneficiary test in the associated persons definitions, many of the operative rules in the Income Tax Act using the general associated persons definition could be readily circumvented by simply interposing a discretionary trust. Example TrustBeneficiary Company 100%benefit In this example, the company provides a benefit to a beneficiary of its trustee shareholder. The company provides the benefit because the trustee is its sole shareholder. Section CD 6(1)(a)(ii) in the dividend rules treats payments to associated persons of shareholders as dividends. However, without a trustee and beneficiary test, this simple arrangement would avoid the dividend rules. Under the new trustee and beneficiary test, because the company is providing a benefit to an associated person (Beneficiary) of a shareholder in the company (Trust), the company has made a dividend to the beneficiary under section CD 6(1)(a)(ii). Page 17 Example EmployerTrust Employee (Beneficiary) low interest loan distribution In this example, an employer provides a low interest loan to a trust under which an employee is a beneficiary. Under section CX 18, fringe benefit tax applies to fringe benefits provided to associated persons of employees. Without the trustee and beneficiary test in section YB 6, this simple arrangement avoids this rule. However, because of the new trustee and beneficiary test, the employer would be providing a fringe benefit (the low interest loan) to an associated person of the employee (the Trust) and would therefore be subject to fringe benefit tax. Two trustees with common settlor test (section YB 7) Under new section YB 7, a trustee of a trust and a trustee of another trust are associated persons if the same person is a settlor of both trusts. New section YB 10 provides that for the purposes of the new section YB 7, “settlor” has the meaning set out in section HC 27 of the Income Tax Act 2007, but does not include a person who provides services to a trust for less than market value. An exception to the two trustees with common settlor test for certain employee trusts is contained in section YB 15. Without a test associating two trustees with a common settlor many of the operative rules in the Income Tax Act which use the associated persons definition, such as the dividend rules, could be circumvented by structures such as the following example. Page 18 Example Megan Family Trust 1Family Trust 2 Family Co.Megan and Megan’s children 100%payment distribution to beneficiaries settlessettles YB 7 In this example, Megan settles Family Trust 1, a trust that owns all of the shares in Family Co. Megan also settles Family Trust 2 whose discretionary beneficiaries include Megan’s children and Megan herself. Family Co. makes a payment to Family Trust 2. Under the dividend rules in sections CD 3 to CD 6 of the Income Tax Act, any payment made by a company to an associated person of a shareholder of the company is treated as a dividend if that payment would have been a dividend if it had been made to the shareholder. In the absence of a two trustees with common settlor test, Family Co. has not made a payment to an associated person of its shareholder (Family Trust 1), in terms of section CD 6(1)(a)(ii). Therefore, the payment from Family Co. to Family Trust 2 would not be treated as a dividend. Under the new two trustees with common settlor test in section YB 7, Family Trust 1 and Family Trust 2 are associated persons as they have a common settlor (Megan). Therefore, the payment from Family Co. to Family Trust 2 (an associated person of Family Co’s shareholder, Family Trust 1) is treated as a dividend. For the purposes of the two trustees with a common settlor test in section YB 7, two persons who are married, in a civil union, or in a de facto relationship are treated as the same single person. This prevents the new associated persons definition being circumvented by the use of “mirror trusts”. This is illustrated in the following example. Page 19 Example Two trustees with common settlor: mirror trusts Spouse A Trust A Spouse B settles beneficiary Spouse B Trust B Spouse A settles beneficiary In this example spouse A settles a family trust (Trust A) for the benefit of spouse B and spouse B settles another family trust (Trust B) for the benefit of spouse A. Without the provision in the two trustees with common settlor test treating two persons who are married, in a civil union, or in a de facto relationship as the same single person, the trustees of Trust A and Trust B would not be associated despite the close community of interests. The trustees of Trust A and Trust B are associated under new section YB 7 because Spouse A and Spouse B are treated as the same single person and therefore the trustees of Trust A and Trust B have a common settlor. Trustee and settlor test (section YB 8) A trustee of a trust and a settlor of the trust are associated persons under new section YB 8. New section YB 10 provides that for the purposes of new section YB 8, “settlor” has the meaning set out in section HC 27, with the modification that a settlor does not include a person who provides services to a trust for less than market value. An exception to the trustee and settlor test for certain employee trusts is contained in section YB 15. As with the other trustee-related tests, the trustee and settlor test is an important element of the new associated persons definition. Without this test in the associated persons definitions, schemes could be developed to exploit such a loophole. This is illustrated by the following examples. Page 20 Example Ben Family Co.Family Trust Ben’s children 100% payment distribution to beneficiaries settles In this example, Family Co. makes a payment to Family Trust. Ben is the sole shareholder of Family Co and the settlor of Family Trust. Without a trustee and settlor test in the associated persons definition the payment from Family Co. to Family Trust is not caught as a dividend despite the close community of interests. This is because Family Trust would not be associated with Ben who is the sole shareholder of Family Co. Under the new trustee and settlor test in section YB 8, Ben and Family Trust are associated persons as Ben is the settlor of Family Trust. The payment from Family Co. to the Family Trust is accordingly treated as a dividend because Family Co. has made a payment to an associated person (Family Trust) of its shareholder (Ben) in terms of section CD 6(1)(a)(ii). Example loan Non-resident (beneficiary) NZ Trust (holding NZ property) interest settles In this example, a non-resident settles a New Zealand trust (with a New Zealand-incorporated company as trustee) which owns New Zealand land and buildings. This investment by the trustee is funded by a loan from the non-resident settlor. If the non-resident is not associated with the New Zealand trustee, then the interest paid on this loan qualifies for the approved issuer levy (AIL) of 2% instead of being subject to the higher non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) rate. The previous associated persons definition used in the AIL rules was generally deficient in relation to arrangements involving trusts. In this example in particular, without a trustee and settlor test of association, the interest would qualify for AIL treatment despite the in-substance association between the two parties. The new trustee and settlor test in section YB 8 would associate the non-resident with the New Zealand trustee. Accordingly, the interest derived by the non-resident from New Zealand would be subject to a higher rate of NRWT instead of AIL at 2%, which is the appropriate treatment. Page 21 Settlor and beneficiary test (section YB 9) A settlor of a trust and a person who has benefited or is eligible to benefit under the trust are associated persons under section YB 9. This test does not apply for the purposes of the land provisions (as defined in section YA 1). The settlor and beneficiary test is the third test of association (the others being the trustees with a common settlor and trustee and settlor tests) that is based on the settlor of a trust. This focus on the settlor is consistent with the settlor-based focus of the trust taxation rules. Given that there is a sufficient connection between a trustee and a beneficiary, as well as between a trustee and a settlor to justify treating them as associated persons, there is equally a sufficient connection between a settlor and a beneficiary to justify treating them as associated persons as well. An exception to the settlor and beneficiary test for certain employee trusts is also contained in section YB 15. Definition of settlor (section YB 10) As mentioned above, for the purposes of the settlor-based tests in sections YB 7 to YB 9, settlor has the meaning set out in section HC 27, with the modification that a settlor does not include a person who provides services to a trust for less than market value. This modification prevents a professional advisor who provides services to a trust at no charge being treated as a settlor of the trust. The term “settlor” has a wide meaning under the section HC 27 definition of that term. A settlor of a trust is defined to mean broadly a person who transfers value to a trust. The definition of settlor is further extended by the provisions of section HC 28, the most significant of which are: • When a company makes a settlement, any shareholder with an interest of 10% or more in that company is treated as a settlor in relation to that settlement as well as the company itself. • When a trustee of a trust (the first trust) settles another trust (the second trust), the settlor of the second trust is treated as including any person who is a settlor of the first trust. • When a person has any rights or powers in relation to a trustee or settlor of a trust which enables the person to require the trustee to treat the person (or any nominee) as a beneficiary of the trust, the person is treated as a settlor of that trust. The definition of “settlor” is used extensively in the Income Tax Act and its wide meaning is consistent with the settlor-based focus of the trust taxation rules in the Income Tax Act. Page 22 The definition of “settlor”, in conjunction with the nominee look-through rule in section YB 21, does not include professional advisers acting on behalf of clients and other persons such as friends and family members who simply allow their name to be listed as the settlor on a trust deed. The definition of “settlor” that is being used is essentially the same as that originally enacted in 1988 as part of a reform of the trust rules (with the exception that the provision of services at less than market value are excluded). The main focus of this definition is on persons who provide the trust property, and therefore does not include persons who merely allow their name to go on the trust deed as the named settlor. It is therefore the client of the professional adviser, or the person that the friend or family member is acting for, who is treated as the settlor under the settlor-based tests in sections YB 7 to YB 9. This position is consistent with Inland Revenue’s long-standing policy. Tax Information Bulletin of November 1989 on the trust rules at paragraph 6.93 states: “Often professional advisers or relatives will assist in establishing a trust by settling a nominal sum on trust on behalf of another person. In these circumstances it is not appropriate to expose the professional adviser or relative to a potential tax liability. The professional adviser or relative is not the real settlor of the trust but is in effect only an intermediary or facilitator. The real settlor is the person on whose behalf the professional adviser or relative acted in making the settlement. Thus, s.226(3) \[now section YB 21 of the Income Tax Act 2007\] treats the person for whom the nominee or the nominal settlor acted as the settlor rather than the nominee or nominal settlor.” Trustee and person with power of appointment or removal test (section YB 11) A trustee of a trust and person who has a power of appointment or removal of the trustee are associated persons under section YB 11. This test is intended to complement the test associating a trustee and settlor in section YB 8. In many cases, a settlor of a trust, as the author of the instrument creating and governing the administration of the trust, retains the power to appoint or remove trustees. However, this power could be reposed in a separate person. There is sufficient connection between a trustee of a trust and the person who has the power to appoint or remove the trustee to justify treating them as associated persons. The situations considered to be caught by the test in section YB 11 associating a trustee and a person with the power of appointment or removal of the trustee include: • a person who holds a power to appoint or remove trustees jointly with another person; and • a person who holds a power to appoint or remove trustees only with the consent of another person (often referred to as the “protector”). Page 23 However, the following situations are not considered to be caught by the test in section YB 11: • a person who holds a power to appoint or remove trustees only on the happening of certain events in the future (for example, the incapacity of another person) are not treated as currently holding a power of appointment or removal; and • a person (often referred to as the protector) who holds the power to veto the appointments or removal of a trustee (because they do not hold any positive power). The requirement in the tripartite test in section YB 14 that two persons must be associated with the same third person under different associated persons tests should obviate any concerns about whether otherwise unrelated trustees are associated under that test merely because a professional advisor acting in their capacity as such has been granted the power to appoint or remove trustees by their clients. An exception to the test associating a trustee and a person with a power of appointment or removal of the trustee for certain employee trusts is contained in section YB 15. Partnership and partner test (section YB 12) A partnership and a partner in the partnership are associated persons under section YB 12(1). The tripartite test in section YB 14 – which associates two persons if they are each associated with the same third person under different associated persons tests – will not apply to associate the partners themselves with each other. This is because partners in a partnership would be associated with the same third person (the partnership) under the same associated persons test, namely section YB 12. Example Partnership and partner Partner B Partnership sYB 12 Partner CPartner A sYB 12sYB 12 A, B and C are individuals who are partners in a partnership. Under the partnership and partner test in section YB 12, Partners A, B, and C are each associated with the partnership. However, they are not associated with each other under the tripartite test in section YB 14 through their association with the partnership. The partners may still be associated with each other under a different associated persons test. For example, if partners B and C were married they would be associated with each other under the relatives test in section YB 4. Page 24 The test associating a partnership and an associate of a partner in former section YB 17 has been subsumed by the new tripartite test in section YB 14, which associates two persons if they are each associated with the same third person under different associated persons tests. This means that an associate of a partner, such as a spouse of a partner, would still be associated with the partnership itself, as illustrated in the following example. Example Partnership and associate of a partner: association through tripartite test Partner B Partnership Partner CPartner A sYB 12 sYB 4 Spouse Tripartite test (sYB 14) In this example, the spouse of Partner C is associated with Partner C under the relatives test in section YB 4, and Partner C and Partnership are associated under the partnership and partner test in section YB 12. Therefore, applying the tripartite test, Spouse and Partnership are associated persons as they are each associated with the same third person (Partner C) under different associated persons tests. Limited partnerships There is a separate test for determining if a limited partnership and a limited partner are associated. A limited partnership (as defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007) and a limited partner are associated only if the limited partner has a partnership share of 25% or more in the limited partnership (section YB 12(2)). This treatment is appropriate because a limited partner cannot be involved in the management of the partnership (unlike in a general partnership). It should be noted that section YB 12(2) is limited to the limited partners and not the general partner in a limited partnership. A general partner in a limited partnership will be associated with the limited partnership under section YB 12(1). Section YB 12(3) and (4) contain aggregation rules for limited partnerships, similar to the aggregation rules in the company and person other than a company test in section YB 3 (the aggregation rule in section YB 12(3) applies for the purposes of the whole Act except the land provisions, and the more limited aggregation rule in section YB 12(4) applies for the purposes of the land provisions). This is appropriate given that a limited partner is more akin to a shareholder in a company and the interest threshold for associating a limited partner in a limited partnership – 25% – is the same as the threshold in section YB 3. Page 25 Example Aggregation rule for limited partnership Spouse B (limited partner 2) Limited Partnership All other limited partners Spouse A (limited partner 1) 12.5% sYB 4 12.5% In this example, in the absence of an aggregation rule, Spouse A and Spouse B would not be associated with Limited Partnership, as their respective shares in the partnership do not meet the required 25% threshold. However, applying the aggregation rule for limited partnerships in section YB 12(3), both Spouse A and Spouse B would be associated with Limited Partnership. This is because for the purposes of determining whether Spouse A is associated with Limited Partnership under section YB 12(2), Spouse A is treated as holding anything held by associates – in this case, Spouse A is associated with Spouse B under the relatives test in section YB 4. When Spouse A’s 12.5% share in Limited Partnership is aggregated with his associate’s (Spouse B) 12.5% share, the required 25% threshold is met and Spouse A is therefore associated with Limited Partnership under section YB 12(2). Once again, the aggregation rule is applied afresh to each person. As a result, the aggregation rule is also applied in this case to associate Spouse B with Limited Partnership. This is consistent with the application of the aggregation rule in the company-related tests. Tripartite test (section YB 14) The tripartite test in section YB 14 associates two persons if they are each associated with the same third person under different associated persons tests. The tripartite test acts as an important buttress to the other associated persons tests and makes the associated persons definition as a whole more difficult to circumvent. For the tripartite test to associate two persons, each of these persons must be associated with the same third person under different associated persons tests, not including the tripartite test itself. The requirement that the two persons cannot be associated with the same third person under the tripartite test itself is necessary to prevent the tripartite test operating in a reiterative manner. The requirement that the two persons have to be associated with the same third person under different associated persons tests ensures that the tripartite test does not apply more widely than is necessary to protect the tax base. The examples below illustrate the important role of the tripartite test in preventing the other associated persons tests being circumvented by arrangements involving the interposition of relatives, companies and trusts which are under the influence or control of the main protagonists. Page 26 Example Application of the tripartite test Employer Employee Beneficiary Co. Trust Low-interest loan 100% Tripartite test (sYB 14) sYB 6 sYB 3 In this example, the employer makes a low-interest loan to Trust which in turn makes a distribution to Beneficiary Co. which is wholly owned by an employee of the employer. The tripartite test in section YB 14 associates Trust with the employee because they are both associated with Beneficiary Co. In particular, Trust is associated with Beneficiary Co, under the trustee-beneficiary test in section YB 6 and the employee is associated with Beneficiary Co. under the test in section YB 3 associating a company and a person other than a company. As a result, because the employer has provided a fringe benefit (the low-interest loan) to an associate of an employee, the employer would have to account for FBT on the low-interest loan. Example Application of the tripartite test Suzie Trust ATrust B Family Co. 100%Tripartite test (sYB 14) settlessettles sYB 7 sYB 3 In the above example, Suzie settles two family trusts: Trust A and Trust B. Trust A in turn owns all the shares in Family Co. The issue is whether Family Co. is associated with Trust B. Without a tripartite test, Family Co. and Trust B would not be associated, despite the close community of interests between them. However, under the tripartite test in section YB 14, Family Co. and Trust B are associated. In particular, Family Co. is associated with Trust A under the company and person other than a company test in section YB 3, and Trust A is associated with Trust B under the two trustees with a common settlor test in section YB 7. Therefore, under the tripartite test, Family Co. and Trust B are associated persons. Page 27 Example Application of the tripartite test and the aggregation rule Developer Developer’s spouse Trust Family Co. Settles sYB 8 100% sYB 3 sYB 3 Tripartite test (sYB 14) sYB 4 In this example, Developer’s spouse settles Trust, which in turn owns all the shares in Family Co. The issue is whether Developer is associated with Family Co. under the test associating a company and a person other than a company in section YB 3. Developer would be associated with Family Co. under the company and person other than a company test because of the application of the aggregation rule in that test, in conjunction with the tripartite test. In particular, Developer would be treated for the purposes of the company and person other than a company test as holding all the shares held by Trust in Family Co. This is because Trust is associated with Developer under the tripartite test: Developer is associated with his spouse under the relatives test (section YB 4) and Developer’s spouse is associated with Trust under the trustee and settlor test (section YB 8), which means that Developer is associated with Trust under the tripartite test. Without the tripartite test in section YB 14 and the rule in the company and person other than a company test aggregating interests held by associated persons, Developer would not be associated with Family Co. even though there is a large community of interest between them. Different associated persons requirement The requirement in the tripartite test in section YB 14 that the two persons have to be associated with the same third person under different associated person tests is designed to prevent the tripartite test applying more widely than is necessary to protect the tax base. This requirement is illustrated by the following examples. Example X Company ACompany B 100% YZ Company C 50%50%50% In this example, individuals X, Y and Z, who are not associated with each other, own all the shares in Company A, Company B and Company C. Without the different associated persons tests requirement, Company A and Company C would be associated under the tripartite test in section YB 14, despite not having any common shareholders. However, because Company A and Company C are each associated with Company B under the same two companies test in section YB 2, they are not associated under the tripartite test. Page 28 Example Jim Company D 50% Jo 50% In this example, Jim and Jo, who are not separately associated with each other, each hold 50% of the voting interests in Company D and are therefore each associated with Company D under the test in section YB 3 associating a company and a person other than a company. Without the different associated persons tests requirement, Jim and Jo would be associated under the tripartite test. However, because Jim and Jo are each associated with Company D (the common third person) under the same test (section YB 3), they are not associated under the tripartite test in section YB 14. Exception for companies tests (section YB 14(2)) As well as not applying to associate two persons if they are each associated with the same third person under the same associated persons test, the tripartite test will not associate two persons if they are each associated with the same third person under the company-related tests in sections YB 2 and YB 3. Example Tripartite test: Companies tests exception Sid Company X Company Y Associated under sYB 3 25% Associated under sYB 2 50% In this example, Sid is associated with Company X under the company and person other than a company test in section YB 3, and Company X and Company Y are associated under the two companies test in section YB 2. Without the companies tests exception in section YB 14(2), the tripartite test would apply to associate Sid and Company Y (Company X being the common third person). This would be the case even though Sid only has a 12.5% interest in Company Y – the product of multiplying Sid’s 25% interest in Company X by Company X’s 50% interest in Company Y – which is below the 25% threshold in the associate a company and person other than a company test in section YB 3. The companies test exception in section YB 14(2) ensures that Sid is not associated with Company Y under the tripartite test. Page 29 Exceptions for certain trusts and charitable organisations (sections YB 16 and YB 8(2)) Energy consumer trusts and bonus bonds unit trust Under section YB 16(1), a lines trust established under the Energy Companies Act 1992, commonly referred to as an energy consumer trust, is excluded from the trustee for relative test (section YB 5) and the test associating trustees and beneficiaries (section YB 6). This is because such trusts are public in nature and are not intended to be subject to the associated persons tests. Excluding energy consumer trusts from the tests in sections YB 5 and YB 6, ensures that discounts to consumers from electricity lines companies owned by consumer trusts are not treated as dividends, as illustrated in the following example. Example Exception for energy consumer trusts Energy consumer trust Consumer beneficiaries Electricity Lines Company Developer beneficiary Discounts (via electricity retailers) Non-developer beneficiary sYB 3 100% sYB 6 The exception for energy consumer trusts also prevents consumer beneficiaries from being associated with one another. Even without this exception, the scope of the tripartite test is such that it would not apply to treat consumer beneficiaries as associated persons. Using the above example, this means that the developer beneficiary and the non-developer beneficiary will not be associated persons. This is because they are both associated with the same third person (Energy consumer trust) under the same associated persons test, namely the trustee and beneficiary test in section YB 6, which means that the tripartite test does not apply. Page 30 Additionally, section YB 16(1) also excludes the unit trust that administers bonus bonds from the associated persons tests in section YB 5 and YB 6 because of its public nature. This unit trust is excluded from the unit trust definition in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, and therefore is not treated as a company, which means that the trust-related associated persons tests could potentially apply to it. Charitable organisations Under section YB 16(2), “charitable organisations” (as defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007) are not treated as beneficiaries for the purposes of tests associating trustees and beneficiaries (section YB 6) and settlors and beneficiaries (section YB 9). Example Settlor 1 Charitable organisation beneficiary Trust 1 Settlor 2 Trust 2 Settlor 3 Trust 3 Without the exception for charitable organisations in section YB 16(2), the beneficiary-related tests could have unintended consequences. For example, if the beneficiary of several unrelated trusts is the same charity, the trustee and settlor of each such trust could end up being associated with the trustee and settlor of all such trusts without being aware of the fact. This exception therefore ensures that trustees and settlors of trusts in this situation are not treated as associated persons simply because the same charity is a beneficiary under their trust. Charitable trusts The trustee and settlor test in section YB 8 does not apply if the trust is a charitable trust. This exception – section YB 8(2) – prevents donors to a charitable trust being associated with each other. A charitable trust under the Income Tax Act 2007 is required to be registered as a charitable entity under the Charities Act 2005 and is therefore subject to any regulatory requirements of that Act. Such charities do not pose a risk to the tax base and therefore it is not necessary to include them in the trustee and settlor associated persons test. Page 31 Rationalising associated persons references in operative provisions A number of operative provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 previously contained modifications or additional wording in their associated persons references. These modifications were a result of different combinations of the associated persons tests in former subpart YB applying, in particular, the tests that applied for the purposes of the whole Act (excluding the 1973, 1988 and 1990 version provisions) or the 1988 version provisions (corresponding to the associated persons definitions in sections OD 7 and OD 8(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004). An example of such a provision was section EX 21(15). These modifications to the associated person references in the operative provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007 have been generally omitted because they have been effectively subsumed by the various reforms to the associated persons tests in new subpart YB. The wording of these operative provisions therefore has been significantly simplified because they will simply refer to persons being associated without more (for example, without various references to the 1973, 1988 or 1990 version provisions). As a result, the wording of the associated person references in the operative provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007 are now streamlined and easier to understand. For example, the wording of section GB 28(2) was: “A person is treated as being associated with another person if a person would be treated as being associated under the parts of subpart YB (associated persons and nominees) that apply for the purposes of the whole Act (excluding the 1973, 1988, and 1990 version provisions), or the 1988 version provisions, at the time the services are personally performed by the working person.” This wording has been replaced by: “A person is treated as being associated with another person if they are associated at the time the services are personally performed by the working person.” The definitions of the 1973, 1988 and 1990 version provisions and previous section YB 20 have been repealed because they are largely subsumed by the various reforms to the associated persons tests in subpart YB. These definitions equate to the lists of operative provisions to which the former specific associated persons definitions in sections OD 8(4), OD 8(3) and OD 8(1) of the Income Tax Act 2004 applied. However, because of the various modifications that apply in the associated persons tests in relation to the land transaction provisions, previously defined as the “1973 version provisions”, this definition has been re-enacted in section YA 1 and called “land provisions”. The new associated persons definition in the Income Tax Act 2007 also applies in the Tax Administration Act 1994 because of section 3(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Page 32 A number of the specific modifications or additional wording in the associated persons references in the operative provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 were incorrect. These references have been corrected applicable from the commencement of the Income Tax Act 2007 on 1 April 2008, even though these references themselves have been omitted as part of these reforms of the associated persons definitions. It is necessary to correct these references from the commencement of the Income Tax Act 2007 on 1 April 2008 because the current associated person reforms do not apply generally until the 2010–11 income year. Section CD 6(1)(a)(iii) repealed A transfer of value from a company to a person is a dividend if the cause of the transfer is a shareholding in the company as described in section CD 6 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section CD 6(1)(a)(iii) contained an extension which treated as a dividend any distribution made by a company to a trust under which a shareholder of the company, or spouse, civil union or de facto partner of the shareholder, was a beneficiary. This trust extension rule has been repealed because its function is performed by the new associated persons definition – in particular, the trustee- beneficiary test in new section YB 6. Section CD 22(9) amendment The definition of “fifteen percent interest reduction” in section CD 22(9), which relates to the share buy-back exclusion from the dividend definition, refers to “counted associate”, which is defined inter alia as “a trustee of a trust under which a spouse, civil union partner or de facto partner, or minor child of the shareholder is a beneficiary”. This wording has been amended so that it is consistent with other references in the associated persons definitions which describe discretionary beneficiaries. The provision now refers to a person who has benefited or is eligible to benefit under a trust (instead of referring to a beneficiary). Section DB 42(2) amendment Section DB 42(1) allows a taxpayer a deduction for any loss arising through misappropriation by an employee. Former section DB 42(2) stated that this deduction was not available if the taxpayer and the defalcating employee were associated in certain ways. The new associated persons definition is comprehensive enough to cover all the relationships described in former section DB 42(2). Therefore the specific associated persons tests in this provision have been replaced by a standard associated persons reference. New section DB 42(2) simply provides that the section does not apply when a person who misappropriates property is associated with the person who carries on the business. Page 33 Omitted tests Several associated persons tests contained in the previous subpart YB of the Income Tax Act 2007 have been omitted for simplification and rationalisation purposes. These omitted tests were: • The test associating two persons if they habitually act together (former section YB 18). • The test associating a person and a charity, friendly society, or non-profit body controlled by that person or a relative of that person (former section YB 19). • The tests associating two companies and a company and a person other than a company, which were based on income interests (former sections YB 3 and YB 7). These tests were redundant given the equivalent comprehensive tests based on voting interests. The existence of these tests can be explained historically by the fact that they were originally enacted in 1988 before the voting interest concept was enacted in 1992. • The test associating a partnership and an associate of a partner (former section YB 17). This test has been subsumed by the new tripartite test in section YB 14. Under the tripartite test two persons are associated if they are each associated with the same third person under different associated persons tests. This means that an associate of a partner, such as a spouse of a partner, would still be associated with the partnership under the tripartite test. Rationalisation of other income tax provisions A number of provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 embodying a related person concept, similar to that in the associated persons definitions, have been rationalised. It is desirable, from a simplification perspective, that similar concepts in the Act be addressed similarly. Replacing company control definition with associated persons definition Section YC 1 of the Income Tax Act, which defined when a company was treated as being under the control of any persons, has been repealed. Its function is now performed by the new associated persons definition. The definition of company control in section YC 1 and the definitions of associated persons in subpart YB are conceptually similar in that they define related parties for the purposes of operative provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007. The separate use of the section YC 1 company control definition rather than the associated persons definitions was probably a legacy of the company control definition being developed in the Income Tax Act before the associated persons definitions. The company control definition in the Act was first implemented in 1939, whereas the first associated persons definition in the Act was not enacted until 1968. Allowing section YC 1 to be subsumed by the new associated persons definition is a desirable simplification measure. Page 34 The provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 which previously employed the section YC 1 definition of company control, have been amended to use the new associated persons definition. They are: • section GC 5 (leases for inadequate rent); • section RF 11 (dividends paid to companies under control of non-residents); and • paragraph (a) of the definition of “holding company” in section YA 1. Replacing related person definition with associated person definition Former section CD 44(15) to (17) of the Income Tax Act 2007 contained a definition of “related person” which was used in section CD 44(11) and (12) to determine the amount of the capital gain exclusion from a dividend arising from the realisation of a capital asset in the course of a company’s liquidation. As part of the amendments to rationalise the Income Tax Act provisions which embody an associated persons concept, the function of the former related person definition in section CD 44 will be performed by the new associated person definition. Section CD 44(11) and (12) have been replaced by section CD 44(10A) and (10B) with associated persons references replacing related persons references. The new provisions apply for capital gain amounts derived or losses incurred after 31 March 2010, therefore ensuring that the changes have prospective application only. For capital gain amounts derived or capital loss amounts incurred between 1 April 1988 to 31 March 2010, the previous law which used the related person definition continues to apply. This law contained in former section CD 44(11), (12) and (15) to (17), is now contained in section CZ 9B of the Income Tax Act 2007. The references to related persons in the dividend definition in section YA 1 have also been replaced with references to associated persons. Definition of “relative” The definition of “relative” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 has been simplified so that it extends only to the second degree of blood relationship. Previously the definition also extended for the purposes of some provisions to the fourth degree of blood relationship. The new definition of relative includes a trustee of a trust under which a relative has benefited or is eligible to benefit – this continues the effect of paragraph (c)(v) of the old relative definition. Application of changes to other Acts A number of provisions in other Acts, which utilise the associated persons definitions in the Income Tax Act 2007, have been consequently amended as a result of these reforms. The provisions in these other Acts are: • Fisheries Act 1996, section 59(10)(c) and (d); • Misuse of Drugs Amendment Act 2005, section 31; Page 35 • Privacy Act 1993, section 6; • Radiocommunications Act 1989, sections 153(2) and 161(2); and • Smoke-free Environments Act 1990, section 2(1). A number of provisions in other Acts also utilised former section YC 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, which defined when a company was treated as being under the control of any persons. These references to section YC 1 have been replaced with references to the new associated persons definition in the Income Tax Act 2007. The provisions in these other Acts are: • Insolvency Act 2006, section 182(1); • Public Service Investment Society Management Act (No.2) 1979, section 2(2); • Trustee Companies Management Act 1975, section 2(2); and • Unit Trusts Act 1960, section 3(4).
Page 1 10 February 2009 A special report from the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue Business Tax Measures included the Taxation (Business Tax Measures) Bill The Taxation (Business Tax Measures) Bill gives effect to several changes that were part of a recently announced package of measures aimed at improving the business environment for small and medium enterprises – particularly in terms of easing the impact of taxes on businesses’ cash flows and reducing business tax compliance costs. The package also included reductions in the use of money interest (UOMI) rates for underpayments and overpayments of tax and the fringe benefit tax prescribed interest rate applying to low-interest, employment-related loans. These changes were the subject of Orders in Council signed on 2 February 2009. Detailed analysis Introduction of a new threshold of $10,000 below which all business-related legal expenditure is fully deductible (to apply from the 2009/2010 income year) (Clauses 4 and 22) The bill introduces new section DB 62 into the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) to simplify the rules for deducting legal expenditure. This change allows businesses an immediate tax deduction for business-related legal expenditure, up to $10,000 a year, without having to distinguish between revenue and capital. This will reduce tax compliance costs and tax liabilities. For example, if a business’s total bill for all legal fees in a given income year is $10,000, the entire amount will be deductible without requiring analysis of which amounts relate to non-deductible capital expenditure and deductible revenue expenditure. However, when a business’s total bill for all legal fees in a given income year is $20,000, normal tax rules will apply and capital and revenue amounts must be separately identified for the full $20,000. The bill also introduces a definition of “legal expenses” in section YA 1 of the ITA for this purpose. Page 2 Higher low-value trading stock threshold (to apply from the 2009/2010 income year) (Clause 5) The bill amends section EB 23 of the ITA to raise the threshold for low-value trading stock from $5,000 to $10,000 (based on the value of the trading stock). This change will reduce record-keeping for businesses and the amount of time that must be spent each year counting and valuing stock. This proposal was originally included in the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance and Remedial Matters) Bill (“the July 2008 tax bill”), introduced in July 2008 and currently before Parliament, but has been brought forward for inclusion in this bill, to apply from the 2009/2010 income year. Accounting for financial arrangements (to apply from the 2009/2010 income year) (Clauses 6 - 14) The bill amends sections EW 13, 17 and 25 of the ITA to: • allow non-individuals, subject to certain thresholds, to be able to return income tax in relation to financial arrangements on a cash accounting basis; and • allow more taxpayers to be able to use the straight-line basis for accounting for financial arrangements by increasing the existing threshold for this from $1.5 million to $1.85 million (based on the total level of financial arrangements). The bill also amends the definition of “cash-basis” person in sections EW 54, 56-58 and 60 of the ITA, and amends section EW 59 of the ITA to provide for associated persons. These proposals were included in the July 2008 tax bill but have been brought forward for inclusion in the present bill, to apply from the 2009/2010 income year. Higher Pay As You Earn (PAYE) once-a-month filing and payment threshold (to apply from 1 April 2009) (Clause 15) The bill amends section RD 22 of the ITA to raise the PAYE once a month filing and payment threshold from $100,000 to $500,000. Under current law, when prior year total PAYE deducted for all employees is $100,000 or more, the employer must pay it to Inland Revenue twice a month. Under the proposed change, when total PAYE deducted is less than $100,000, the employer must account for PAYE once a month. This change will significantly increase the number of businesses that can benefit from the increased cash flows that arise from paying PAYE only once a month. Employers that are above the current threshold but below the new threshold can still pay twice-monthly if that better suits their business needs. Page 3 The proposal to raise the threshold from $100,000 to $250,000 was included in the July 2008 tax bill but has been raised to $500,000 for inclusion in this bill, with application from 1 April 2009. Higher thresholds under which FBT is not required to be accounted for in respect of minor unclassified benefits provided to employees (to apply from 1 April 2009) (Clauses 16 and 17) The bill amends sections RD 45 and 46 of the ITA to raise the thresholds for exempting minor benefits from FBT from $15,000 per annum per employer and $200 per quarter per employee to $22,500 and $300 respectively. This change means that fewer employers will be required to return FBT in respect of minor unclassified benefits (such as flowers and chocolates) provided to employees. Extension for FBT annual filing (to apply from 1 April 2009) (Clause 18) The bill amends section RD 60 of the ITA to further broaden annual filing for FBT to include closely held businesses whose FBT liabilities are restricted to one or two vehicles used by owner-employees, regardless of their annual PAYE deductions. This amendment will ease cash flow and reduce compliance costs. This amendment was included in the July 2008 tax bill and has been brought forward for inclusion in this bill, to apply from 1 April 2009. Higher FBT annual filing threshold (to apply from 1 April 2009) (Clause 19) The bill amends section 61 of the ITA to raise the FBT annual filing threshold from $100,000 to $500,000. Under current law, when prior year total PAYE deducted for all employees is $100,000 or more, an employer providing fringe benefits to employees must account and pay for FBT to Inland Revenue quarterly. When total PAYE deducted is less than $100,000, the employer can pay and file annually instead. This change proposed in this bill will mean that fewer FBT returns and payments will need to be filed by small businesses, thereby easing cash flows and reducing compliance costs for eligible employers. The proposal to raise the threshold from $100,000 to $250,000 was included in the July 2008 tax bill. However, the government decided to increase the threshold to $500,000. The new proposal has been brought forward for inclusion in this bill, to apply from 1 April 2009. Page 4 Reduction in the provisional tax uplift rate (to apply from 1 April 2009 to provisional tax payments for the 2008/2009 and 2009/2010 income years payable after this date) (Clauses 20 and 21) The bill amends sections RZ 3 and RZ 5 of the ITA to reduce the standard method uplift for the calculation of provisional tax liability for the 2008/09 and 2009/10 income years. Provisional tax is based on payments of tax being made during the income year. One of the methods of calculating provisional tax is by basing it on taxpayers’ residual income tax (RIT) from prior years, specifically by assuming that it is either: • 105% of the previous year’s RIT; or • 110% of the next preceding year’s RIT (for taxpayers that have not yet furnished their previous year’s income tax return). The bill reduces the “uplift” rate to reflect that profits are likely to be reduced in the 2008/2009 and 2009/2010 income years. Accordingly, the 105% and 110% uplift will be temporarily reduced to 100% and 105% respectively for remaining provisional tax payments due in respect of the 2008/2009 and 2009/2010 income years. In addition, while 30% rate taxpayers 1 are currently allowed to use uplift ratios of 95% or 100% (as a result of relief provided following reduction of the company tax rate from 33% to 30%), changes in the bill will allow these entities to use new, lower, uplift ratios of 90% or 95% for the 2008/2009 and 2009/2010 income years. These changes will reduce the magnitude of taxpayers' provisional tax payments, providing them with greater cash flows over the next two years (as a result of lower provisional tax payments). The standard uplift rates of 105% and 110% will apply again in the 2010/2011 tax year. Higher provisional tax use of money interest (UOMI) safe harbour threshold (to apply from the 2009/2010 income year) (Clause 23) The bill amends section 120KE of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to allow more individual taxpayers to use the standard uplift method of calculating provisional tax rather than estimating, thus reducing compliance costs for those taxpayers and reducing their exposure to use-of-money interest. This proposal was included in the July 2008 tax bill and has been brought forward for inclusion in this bill to apply from the 2009/2010 income year. 1 Taxpayers on a 30% tax rate include companies, some portfolio investment entities and certain trusts. A portfolio investment entity includes certain managed funds and savings vehicles. Page 5 Higher Goods and Services Tax (GST) six-monthly return filing threshold (to apply from 1 April 2009) (Clause 25) The bill amends section 15 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (“the GST Act”) to increase the threshold below which GST returns can be made six-monthly from $250,000 to $500,000 of taxable supplies. Taxpayers with more than $500,000 of taxable supplies are required to make two monthly GST returns. Taxpayers with highly seasonal activities, as well as small businesses, may find this helpful. This proposal was included in the July 2008 tax bill and has been brought forward for inclusion in this bill to apply from 1 April 2009. Higher GST payments basis threshold (to apply from 1 April 2009) (Clause 26) The bill amends section 19A of the GST Act to raise the threshold below which GST may be accounted for on a payments basis from $1.3 million to $2 million of taxable supplies. This change will allow more taxpayers to account for GST on a payments basis and may assist cash flows as GST will generally only need to be accounted for on receipt of funds rather than on issue of an invoice. Using the GST payments basis will still be optional for taxpayers. It is estimated that by raising the GST payments basis threshold to $2 million, an extra 14,000 businesses will be able to access this method of accounting for GST. Higher GST registration threshold (to apply from 1 April 2009) (Clause 27) The bill amends section 51 of the GST Act to raise the GST registration threshold from $40,000 to $60,000 of taxable supplies. This change will mean that those under the threshold can opt out of the GST system, resulting in a reduction in their GST compliance costs and easing cash-management problems associated with making GST payments. The July 2008 tax bill proposed to raise the threshold from $40,000 to $50,000. The government decided to increase the threshold to $60,000. The threshold change was brought forward for inclusion in this bill to apply from 1 April 2009. Minor remedial matters (various application dates) (Clauses 29 to 32) The bill contains a number of minor remedial matters relating to changes made by the Taxation (Urgent Measures and Annual Rates) Act 2008. They amend sections RD 50, 52 and 53 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.
Page 1 13 October 2009 A special report from the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue New rules for taxing controlled foreign companies and foreign dividends The recently enacted Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009 introduces new rules for the taxation of foreign companies controlled by New Zealand residents and for foreign dividends received by New Zealand companies. The purpose of this report is to help affected businesses and their advisers understand the consequences of the changes. Background The new rules represent a fundamental change to how New Zealand taxes offshore income earned through controlled foreign companies. The old system of taxing that income as it is earned is replaced by one that exempts the active offshore income of these companies. Further important features of the changes are an exemption from tax for most foreign dividends paid to companies and measures to protect the tax base as a result of adopting an active income exemption. The purpose of these reforms is to bring New Zealand’s tax rules into line with the practice in other countries and help New Zealand-based business to compete more effectively in foreign markets by freeing them from a tax cost that similar companies in other countries do not face. The changes will improve the competitiveness of New Zealand’s tax system and encourage businesses with international operations to remain, establish and expand. Previously, New Zealand residents were taxed on their share of all income earned by controlled foreign companies (CFCs) as that income accrued but with two significant exemptions: • The “grey list” provided an exemption from accrual taxation for CFCs based in one of eight listed countries (Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Norway, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States). • Conduit tax relief provided an exemption from accrual taxation for a New Zealand company with an income interest in a CFC to the extent that the New Zealand company was owned by non-residents. New Zealand companies receiving foreign dividends were generally required to make a foreign dividend payment (FDP). Credits were available for foreign withholding taxes on the dividend, and also, for non-portfolio dividends, for foreign taxes on the underlying profits. A company receiving a non-portfolio dividend from a grey list country qualified for a deemed underlying foreign tax credit equal to its FDP liability on the dividend. Credits were also available under the branch equivalent tax account (BETA) mechanism to prevent double New Zealand taxation under the CFC and FDP rules. Page 2 Under the new rules, only certain types of income derived by CFCs will be attributed back to New Zealand shareholders. A “signposting” provision in section EX 18A shows how to find a person’s attributed CFC income or loss under the amended legislation. Figure 1 below summarises how the new CFC rules are applied and where in this report they are explained. Figure 1: using the new CFC rules START Income interest of 10% or more in a CFC? Australian? Active business? Calculate attributed CFC income or loss (total) Personal services income?

Calculate tax liability END: calculate tax to pay BETA debit balances available? Reduce tax liability if able Reduce tax liability if able Reduce net attributed income if able Y Y Y N N N Y EXEMPTIONS FROM ATTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT ATTRIBUTABLE INCOME & MECHANICS OF ATTRIBUTION TRANSITIONALS, CONSEQUENTIALS AND REPEALS Attributable income Attributable income is referred to in the Act as the attributable CFC amount (a gross concept defined in section EX 20B) and as net attributable CFC income or loss (a net amount determined under sections EX 20C to EX 20E). In very broad terms, attributable income comprises passive income such as rent, royalties, certain dividends and interest. Taxing this income on accrual protects the domestic tax base against New Zealand-sourced income being shifted offshore to avoid tax. In earlier policy documents, the terms “passive income” and “passive income definition” were used to describe the attributable CFC amount. Exemptions from attribution requirement Under the new rules, the grey list and conduit exemptions have been repealed. Two categories of CFC are now exempt from the requirement to attribute income: Page 3 • Non-attributing active CFCs (section EX 21B). If less than 5 percent of a CFC’s total income is attributable income, it is a non-attributing active CFC and neither its income nor its losses are attributable. This test may be undertaken either by applying the tax rules for measuring income (section EX 21D) or by reference to financial accounts, subject to certain adjustments (sections EX 21C and EX 21E). • Non-attributing Australian CFCs (section EX 22). Broadly, if a CFC is resident and subject to tax in Australia, it is a non-attributing Australian CFC and is exempt from attribution. Interest allocation rules The interest allocation rules in subpart FE are designed to prevent an excessive amount of debt from being allocated against the domestic tax base. Previously, these rules only applied to New Zealand entities controlled by non-residents. Now that much of the income derived by CFCs remains outside the New Zealand tax base, the rules have been extended so that they also apply to outbound entities – New Zealand residents with CFC interests, regardless of whether the entity is controlled by a non-resident. The rules place an upper limit on interest deductions that can be taken against domestic income. Subpart FE already contains safe harbours and these also apply to outbound entities: interest deductions are not restricted unless the New Zealand group debt percentage is more than 75 percent (and, for a company or a trustee, is also more than 110 percent of the worldwide group debt percentage). Additional safe harbours and reliefs have been introduced for outbound entities which have most of their assets in New Zealand or have only modest interest deductions. Treatment of foreign dividends The FDP rules in subpart RG have been repealed so that most foreign dividends received by New Zealand companies will now be wholly exempt. Foreign dividends that are tax-deductible for the foreign company and dividends on fixed-rate shares are subject to income tax (section CW 9(2)(b) and (c)). If the foreign company is a CFC and the fixed rate or deductible dividend is paid to another CFC or New Zealand company, these distributions will be deductible in the same way as interest when calculating net attributable CFC income or loss. This prevents economic double taxation of attributable CFC income subsequently repatriated as a taxable dividend. Dividends from non-attributing portfolio FIFs (that have less than 10 percent interest in a foreign company as described in sections EX 31, EX 32, EX 36, EX 37, EX 37B or EX 39) will also be subject to income tax. Application date The new rules apply for all income years beginning on or after 1 July 2009. Page 4 Example 1 Company A has a 30 April balance date. For its income year of 1 May 2009 to 30 April 2010 it will continue to apply the previous international tax rules. From its income year beginning 1 May 2010 it will apply the new international tax rules. Example 2 Company B has a 30 June balance date. From its income year beginning 1 July 2009 it will apply the new international tax rules. Example 3 Company C has a 30 November balance date. From its income year beginning 1 December 2009 it will apply the new international tax rules. Exemptions from attribution requirement Sections CQ 2, DN 2, EX 21B to EX 21E, EX 22 and EX 23 of the Income Tax Act 2007; section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Key features Active business exemption A person with an income interest of 10 percent or more in a CFC will not generally have to include attributed CFC income or loss in the person’s gross income if the CFC passes an active business test. This is expected to save most CFCs the work of calculating attributed income. A CFC will pass the active business test and be a non-attributing active CFC if it has attributable income that is less than 5 percent of its total income. Attributable and total income, for the purposes of the test, are measured using either financial accounting or tax measures of income. These measures are defined in the legislation. It is expected that most people will prefer to use accounting measures of income, because they will be more readily available or easier to calculate. Accounting measures may be used to calculate the ratio if they are taken from accounts that comply with international financial reporting standards (IFRS) and certain other conditions are met. Accounting measures of income based on pre-IFRS New Zealand financial reporting standards may also temporarily be used by some people, primarily small and medium-sized enterprises. For people who do not wish to or are unable to use accounting measures of income, tax measures of income may also be used to calculate the ratio of attributable income to total income. CFCs in the same country may be consolidated for the purposes of the calculation of the 5 percent ratio calculation, subject to certain conditions. A CFC will also be a non-attributing active CFC for a person with an income interest in the CFC, if the person has applied for and obtained a determination from Inland Revenue that the CFC is an active insurance business. Page 5 Australian exemption A person with an income interest of 10 percent or more in a CFC will not have to include attributed CFC income or loss in the person’s gross income if the CFC is resident and subject to income tax in Australia, and meets certain other conditions. A CFC that meets these conditions is a non-attributing Australian CFC. Personal services income There is an exception to the active business and Australian exemptions for CFCs. If a CFC derives certain personal services income or incurs a loss in deriving such income, such income or loss is always attributed, even if the CFC is a non-attributing active CFC or a non-attributing Australian CFC. Detailed analysis How to use the rules The goal is to work out whether a CFC qualifies for either the Australian or active business exemption. Go to section EX 22 to work out whether or not the Australian exemption applies to a CFC. If the Australian exemption does not apply, decide whether to use tax measures of income or accounting measures of income to check if the CFC qualifies for the active business exemption. Use of accounting measures of income If accounting measures of income are to be used, they can be used for a single CFC or for a test group of CFCs. If the measures are to be used for a test group, go to subsection EX 21E(2) to see which CFCs can be members of the test group. Go to section EX 21C to determine whether a suitable accounting standard is available for the CFC or the test group and, if there is, choose that as the applicable accounting standard. If no applicable accounting standard is available for the CFC or the test group, you will have to use tax measures of income. If an applicable accounting standard is available, calculate the formula in subsection EX 21E(5) using accounts that comply with that standard. The formula is the ratio of attributable income to total income. There are six components in the formula, which are further explained in subsections EX 21E(7) to (12). Rules in subsection EX 21E(4) govern how the calculation is to be done. Subsection EX 21E(3) explains, based on the result of the calculation, whether the CFC or the CFCs in the test group qualify for the active business exemption. If a CFC qualifies to use the active business exemption using accounting measures of income, there may still be some attributed CFC income or loss from the CFC under subsections CQ 2(2B) and DN 2(2). Page 6 If a CFC does not qualify to use the active business exemption using accounting measures of income, try again using tax measures of income. Use of tax measures of income If tax measures of income are to be used, they can be used for a single CFC or for a test group of CFCs. If the measures are to be used for a test group, go to subsection EX 21D(1) to see which CFCs can be members of the test group. Go to subsection EX 21D(4) and calculate the formula there. This formula is the ratio of attributable income to total income. There are four components in the formula, which are further explained in subsections EX 21D(6) to (9). Rules in subsection EX 21D(3) govern how the calculation is to be done. Subsection EX 21D(2) explains, based on the result of the calculation, whether the CFC or the CFCs in the test group qualify for the active business exemption. If a CFC qualifies to use the active business exemption using tax measures of income, there may still be some attributed CFC income or loss from the CFC under subsections CQ 2(2B) and DN 2(2). If a CFC does not qualify to use the active business exemption using tax measures of income, certain income (see section EX 20B) from the CFC will be attributable under sections CQ 2 or DN 2. Figure 2 illustrates the process described above. Page 7 Figure 2: How to use the rules Page 8 Sections CQ 2 and DN 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 New paragraphs CQ 2(1)(h), CQ 2(1)(i), DN 2(1)(h) and DN 2(1)(i) apply to a person who holds an income interest in a CFC. If the CFC is a non-attributing active CFC or a non-attributing Australian CFC, the interest-holder does not have attributed CFC income under subsection CQ 2(1) or attributed CFC loss under subsection DN 2(1). In other words, these paragraphs implement the active business and Australian exemptions. The terms “non-attributing active CFC” and “non-attributing Australian CFC” are further defined in sections EX 21B and EX 22 respectively. A holder of an interest in a non-attributing active CFC or a non-attributing Australian CFC may still have attributed CFC income under subsection CQ 2(2B), or attributed CFC loss under subsection DN 2(2). These subsections apply if the CFC derives income that is an amount of personal services income described by section EX 20B(3)(h). This income is always attributable. Paragraph CQ 2(1)(g) has been repealed because there is no longer an exemption from attribution of CFC income for CFCs resident in grey list countries. The active business exemption (sections EX 21B to EX 21E of the Income Tax Act 2007) Section EX 21B Section EX 21B defines a non-attributing active CFC as a CFC that: • meets the requirements of section EX 21D (has a ratio of attributable to total income, using tax measures of income, of less than 5 percent); or • is able to and chooses to apply section EX 21E, and meets the requirements of that section (has a ratio of attributable to total income, using accounting measures of income, of less than 5 percent); or • meets the requirements of a determination made by the Commissioner under section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (is a CFC with an active insurance business). A CFC may meet the requirements of sections EX 21D or 21E alone or as part of a test group. The income of the CFCs in a test group is consolidated for the purposes of calculating the ratio of attributable to total income, which can be advantageous for taxpayers. If the test group meets the requirements, all CFCs in the group are non-attributing active CFCs. There are additional requirements which must be met in order to use a test group. These are explained further in the analysis of sections EX 21C to 21E. A CFC is a non-attributing active CFC for an accounting period of the CFC. If a CFC does not meet the requirements to be a non-attributing active CFC in one accounting period, it will not be a non-attributing active CFC in that period, regardless of whether it has been one in the past or will be one in the future. “Accounting period” is defined in section YA 1. A CFC is a non-attributing active CFC for a person who holds an interest in that CFC. It is theoretically possible that one person with a 10 percent or greater interest in a CFC will be able to count that CFC as a non-attributing active CFC, but another person with a 10 percent or greater interest in the same CFC will not. This is expected to be rare in practice. Page 9 To meet the requirements of a determination made by the Commissioner under section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994 for a particular accounting period, the taxpayer must first have applied for and obtained the determination and it must not have expired or been revoked. Section 91AAQ regulates this process. Secondly, any requirements laid out in the determination must also be satisfied. A CFC that fails to obtain a determination or to meet the requirements of the determination may still be a non-attributing active CFC if it meets the requirements of sections EX 21D or EX 21E. Accounting standards that may be used (section EX 21C) Section EX 21C states the sets of accounting standards that may be used to calculate the ratio of a CFC’s attributable income to total income under section EX 21E, when a person holds an interest in that CFC. Certain conditions must be satisfied before any particular set of accounting standards can be used. This means the person may be unable to use any of the sets of accounting standards because the relevant conditions are not satisfied. A person may also choose not to use any of the sets of accounting standards, even if they are available. In either case, the ratio of a CFC’s attributable income to total income will be calculated under section EX 21D using tax measures of income. If section GB 15C, which relates to use of the test in section EX 21E to avoid tax applies, it is not possible to use any of the sets of accounting standards in section EX 21C and so section EX 21D must be used to calculate the ratio of attributable income to total income. (See the analysis of section GB 15C for further information.) If, under section EX 21C, a person is able use one or more sets of accounting standards to apply section EX 21E for a particular CFC or a particular test group of CFCs, only one set of accounting standards (called the applicable accounting standard) may be used for that purpose. Subsection EX 21C(2) allows the use of generally accepted accounting practice with IFRS for a particular CFC if accounts exist that include the accounts of that CFC, those accounts comply with generally accepted accounting practice with IFRS, and specified audit requirements are met. The accounts may be for the CFC alone or for a group of companies that includes the CFC. In the latter case, further work is likely to be required to separate amounts relating to the CFC when applying section EX 21E. The accounts may be held by the person who holds an interest in the CFC or by someone else. Under existing rules applying before enactment of section EX 21C, Inland Revenue can require that the accounts be produced to verify a tax position taken. (The comments in this paragraph apply equally to subsections EX 21C(4) and EX 21C(6)). The term “generally accepted accounting practice with IFRS” means generally accepted accounting practice, as defined in section 3 of the Financial Reporting Act 1993, but with a restriction. The restriction is that the New Zealand equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards must be used as the financial reporting standards referred to in that section. These New Zealand standards, referred to as “IFRS” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, have initially been issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, then approved, with modifications, by the New Zealand Accounting Standards Review Board. Some entities qualify to use a subset of these standards (the “framework for differential reporting for entities applying the New Zealand equivalents to the international financial standards reporting regime”). That subset is also acceptable for the purposes of section EX 21E. Page 10 The accounts must comply with generally accepted practice with IFRS. Often, absolute compliance is not practical but audited accounts will be treated as complying anyway. The analysis of subsection EX 21C(9) below provides further explanation. The audit requirements are specified in subsection EX 21C(8). Analysis of that subsection below provides more information. Subsection EX 21C(3) allows a person to use generally accepted accounting practice with IFRS for a test group of CFCs if accounts exist that include the accounts of the CFCs in the test group, the first-mentioned accounts comply with generally accepted accounting practice with IFRS, and specified audit requirements are met. The test group is defined under subsection EX 21E(2) as a group of CFCs a taxpayer has an interest in, that are resident in the same country and that meet certain other requirements. The complying accounts must include the accounts of all the CFCs in the test group. The complying accounts may also include the accounts of other entities, such as all the entities in a worldwide group. In that case, further work is likely to be required to separate amounts relating to the test group when applying section EX 21E. The accounts may be held by the person who holds an interest in the CFCs in the test group or by someone else. Under existing rules applying before the enactment of section EX 21C, Inland Revenue can require that the accounts be produced to verify a tax position taken. (Comments in this paragraph apply equally to subsections EX 21C(5) and EX 21C(7)). The term “generally accepted accounting practice with IFRS” has the same meaning as in subsection EX 21C(2). Subsection EX 21C(4) allows a taxpayer to use IFRSEs for a particular CFC if accounts exist that include the accounts of the CFC, the first-mentioned accounts comply with IFRSEs, and specified audit requirements are met. An “IFRSE” is defined in section YA 1 as “an International Financial Reporting Standard approved by the International Accounting Standards Board, as amended from time to time”. In other words, subsection EX 21C(4) allows the use of accounts that comply with international financial reporting standards. Those standards are either required to be used or may be used in over 100 countries. In contrast, subsection EX 21C(2) allows the use of New Zealand equivalents to international financial reporting standards. In most respects, international financial reporting standards and the New Zealand equivalents to those standards are identical. However, that may not always be the case. Subsection EX 21C(5) allows a taxpayer to use IFRSEs for a test group of CFCs if accounts exist that include the accounts of the CFCs in the test group, the first-mentioned accounts comply with IFRSEs, and specified audit requirements are met. The term “IFRSEs” has the same meaning as in subsection EX 21C(4). Subsection EX 21C(6) allows a person to use generally accepted accounting practice without IFRS for a particular CFC if specific requirements are met. Page 11 The term “generally accepted accounting practice without IFRS” means generally accepted accounting practice as defined in section 3 of the Financial Reporting Act 1993, but with the restriction that the financial reporting standards referred to in that section must not be New Zealand equivalents to international financial reporting standards. Pre-IFRS financial reporting standards (usually referred to as FRSs) will be used instead. Subsection EX 21C(6) exists because a large number of small and medium-sized entities are not yet required to comply with New Zealand equivalents to international financial reporting standards, pending completion of a review of financial reporting requirements by the government. The subsection is intended to be temporary. It may be replaced or repealed as the future of reporting requirements becomes clearer or as FRS become outdated. The subsection is not to be used when accounts that comply with IFRS are available; IFRS accounts are to be preferred in that case. The requirements that must be met to use generally accepted accounting practice without IFRS are that a company that is resident in New Zealand must: • hold accounts that include the accounts of the CFC, that comply with generally accepted accounting practice without IFRS, and that meet specified audit requirements; • not have revenue under either Financial Reporting Standard 34 or Financial Reporting Standard 35 (the intent is that insurance businesses will not be able to use generally accepted accounting practice without IFRS for the purpose of section EX 21E); • not be an issuer under section 4 of the Financial Reporting Act 1993 in the current accounting period and not have been an issuer in the preceding accounting period; • not be required by section 19 of the Financial Reporting Act 1993 to file its accounts with the Registrar of Companies; • not be a large company under section 19A(1)(b) of the Financial Reporting Act 1993; and • not have accounts (and not be a subsidiary of a company having accounts) that are prepared and audited under generally accepted accounting practice with IFRS (if such accounts are available, generally accepted accounting practice with IFRS should be used for the purposes of EX 21E). Most but not all of the requirements match those in Accounting Standards Review Board Release 9 (ASRB 9). ASRB 9 specifies the entities that are permitted to defer compliance with New Zealand equivalents to international financial reporting standards. In the event that ASRB 9 is withdrawn, amended or superseded, the requirements in the legislation will be unaffected. Subsection EX 21C(7) allows a taxpayer to use generally accepted accounting practice without IFRS for a test group of CFCs if certain requirements are met. The requirements are mostly the same as those in subsection EX 21C(6), except that the accounts must include the accounts of all the CFCs in the test group, rather than just the accounts of the CFC. It is acceptable for the accounts to include the accounts of other entities, in addition to the CFCs in the test group. In that case, additional work is likely to be required to identify and separate amounts relating to the test group. Subsection EX 21C(8) contains the two audit requirements that must be met in each of subsections EX 21C(2) to (7). Page 12 The first requirement in subsection (8) is that the accounts in question must be audited by a chartered accountant who is independent of the CFC and of the person who holds the accounts. In the case of a test group, the chartered accountant must be independent of all the CFCs in the test group. The use of the term “chartered accountant” is regulated by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand Act 1996, and requires membership of the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants (NZICA). Because the accounts of a CFC will commonly be audited in a country other than New Zealand, requiring membership of NZICA in all cases is impractical. For that reason, it is also acceptable for the auditor to be a person who is not a chartered accountant (as defined in New Zealand legislation), provided they meet a professional standard, in their country, that is equivalent to the professional standard a chartered accountant must meet in New Zealand. The second requirement in subsection (8) is that the auditor must have given an unqualified audit opinion or – in countries in which the term “unqualified audit opinion” is not used or has a different meaning – a type of audit opinion that is used in that country and is of a standard that is equivalent to an unqualified audit in New Zealand. Subsection EX 21C(9) sets out the circumstances in which accounts will be treated as complying with a particular set of accounting standards for the purposes of subsections EX 21C(2) to (7). The subsection is required because accounts will rarely comply completely with accounting standards at a detailed level, even though they comply in all material respects. The fact that there is non-compliance at a detailed level should not, in general, prevent the use of the accounts for the purposes of applying section EX 21E. The accounts will be treated as complying with the relevant standards if there is a statement in the accounts that they comply, the audit requirements of subsection EX 21C(8) are satisfied, and there is not evidence of wrong-doing or incompetence. In the case of wrong-doing or incompetence, Inland Revenue must have reasonable grounds to suspect fraudulent activity, preparation of the accounts with an intent to mislead, or incompetence of the auditor. “Fraudulent activity” is fraudulent activity by the person who holds the interest in the CFC, by the CFC itself, by a CFC in the CFC’s test group, or by the auditor. “Mislead” and “incompetence” are not further defined. Subsection EX 21C(9) does not affect in any way the requirements to keep records relating to CFCs, or the powers of Inland Revenue to require the production of records and other information relating to the CFC. If these records or information give Inland Revenue reasonable grounds to suspect fraud, an intent to mislead or incompetence, the accounts will not automatically be treated as complying with a particular set of accounting standards. The active business exemption using tax measures of income (section EX 21D) Section EX 21D sets out the rules for calculating the ratio of attributable income to total income when using tax measures of income. The ratio may be calculated either for a single CFC or, if certain requirements are met, for a test group of CFCs. If the ratio is not less than 0 and is less than 0.05, then in the case of a single CFC it will be a non-attributing active CFC, unless it is prevented from being one for some other reason (such as the application of section GB 15C). In the case of test groups, all the CFCs in the test group will be non-attributing active CFCs unless they are prevented from being non-attributing active CFCs for some other reason. Page 13 The ratio calculation, with only one exception, is based on amounts of income and no deductions for expenditure or losses incurred are included in the calculation. Subsection EX 21D(1) contains the requirements that must be met for the ratio to be calculated for a test group of CFCs. The first requirement is that all the companies must be resident in the same country. The test for residence in this case is that all of the companies are liable for income tax in the same country by reason of domicile, residence, place of incorporation, or centre of management. This is intended to exclude a CFC that is liable for tax in a country merely because of, for example, the presence of a permanent establishment in that country. The second requirement is that the person undertaking the calculation (the person with the interest in the CFC) holds an income interest of more than 50 percent in each of the CFCs in the test group. This is intended to prevent a CFC being a part of a test group for more than one interest holder. The third requirement is that all CFCs in the group must make the same choice of method and currency under subsection EX 21(4). They must either all make the choice to convert all transactions to New Zealand dollars at the applicable daily rate, or all make the choice to use the same reporting currency. If the reporting currency is used, subsections EX 21(5) and (6) must be observed in the normal way, and section EX 21(7) will apply to certain financial arrangements. The purpose of this provision is to limit the scope for manipulating the test by the deliberate choice of different reporting currencies for CFCs within the group. The fourth requirement is that the CFCs in the test group must be consolidated for the purposes of the test (and only for the purposes of the test). Consolidation requires the elimination of all balances, transactions, income and expenses between CFCs in the group, and the use of like tax treatments for like transactions. For example, it would not be appropriate for different CFCs in the test group to use different options for calculating financial arrangement income for the same type of financial arrangement. It is expected that elimination will be carried out in a way that is consistent with accepted accounting principles. It is not expected or intended that there will be rigid compliance with any particular set of financial accounting standards. The rules for consolidation in subpart FM of the Income Tax Act 2007 are not to be used for the consolidation of CFCs. Subsection EX 21D(2) designates a CFC (whether alone or as part of a test group) as a non- attributing active CFC if the ratio of attributable income to total income in subsection EX 21D(4) is less than 0.05 and, if zero, is not zero because of the application of paragraph EX 21D(3)(f). The ratio may be zero because attributable income is zero and there is some total income. In that case, the CFC is a non-attributing active CFC. If the ratio is zero for any other reason (paragraph EX 21D(3)(f) applies), the CFC is not a non-attributing active CFC. In that case, the formula has produced an unusual, and possibly unintended, result, so attribution is required. Subsection EX 21D(3) explains how to apply the formula in subsection EX 21D(4). Page 14 If the formula is being applied for a test group, the test group is effectively treated as a single consolidated entity (using the consolidation described in the analysis of subsection EX 21D(1) in this report). Consolidated amounts are used in the formula. Consistent with the single-notional- entity approach, special rules apply if it is necessary to determine whether the test group is associated with a person or in the same group of companies as a person, such as in parts of section EX 21B. The person is associated with the test group if the person is associated with a member of the test group but is not a member of the test group. The person is a member of the same group of companies as a test group if the person is in the same group of companies as a member of the test group, but is not a member of the test group (these rules apply only for the purposes of calculating the formula and do not affect, for example, the application of the loss offset rules in Part I). If either the numerator or denominator in the formula is negative, it is treated as being zero. The ratio calculation has been designed in such a way that a negative numerator or denominator should not be possible. If a negative result is produced, this is unintended and the result is set to zero. If the denominator in the ratio formula is zero, the ratio is set to zero and the CFC will not be a non-attributing active CFC. A nil denominator implies either an unintended result or no activity on the part of the CFC. Because of the possibility of an unintended result, attribution is required. If the CFC is inactive, the calculation of attributed income should be trivial. Subsection EX 21D(4) contains the formula for calculating the ratio of attributable income to total income. The numerator contains the calculation of attributable income, being the attributable CFC amount for the CFC (or test group notionally treated as a single CFC) under section EX 20B, less two optional adjustments specified in subsection EX 21D(7). The attributable CFC amount under section EX 20B is calculated using the rules in section EX 21. Those rules, broadly speaking, treat the CFC as resident in New Zealand for the purposes of the calculation. They also allow the use of a foreign currency for the bulk of the calculation, if certain conditions are met. The first adjustment, if the holder of the interest in the CFC chooses to apply it, is to remove certain amounts relating to personal services under paragraph EX 20B(3)(h). These amounts are always attributable, but the adjustment means a CFC may qualify for the active business exemption in relation to its other income. It is not possible to remove the amount if it would also come within another paragraph of subsections EX 20B(3) or (4). The removal of the amount is only for the purposes of applying the active business exemption. When attribution is required, as it will be under either of subsections CQ 2(1) or (2B), the amount is included. The second adjustment, which is again optional, is the subtraction of the cost of revenue account property if there would be an amount under paragraph EX 20B(3)(k) as a result of the disposal of the property. That paragraph includes the gross proceeds of the disposal as an attributable CFC amount. The effect of the adjustment is that only a net amount is included in attributable income. The adjustment is limited to the part of the cost of the property that would be allowed as a deduction for the period under section EX 20C, but also may not be more than the amount under paragraph (k). In this way, net losses on disposal are not possible. This is for partial consistency with the use of gross amounts in the ratio calculation. If any amounts would be required to be added back in relation to the deduction under subpart CH of the Income Tax 2007, they must also be added back in the formula. Page 15 The denominator in the formula contains the calculation of total income, being annual gross income for the accounting period less up to four adjustments. Annual gross income is calculated, broadly speaking, as if the CFC were a resident (the term “annual gross income” is defined in section BC 2). As with the calculation of the attributable CFC amount under section EX 20B, section EX 21 applies to the calculation. Income under subpart CQ of the Income Tax Act 2007 is not included in the measure of annual gross income because existing “look-through” rules treat CFC or FIF interests held by a first CFC as held directly by the interest-holder in the first CFC. This is to prevent double-counting of gross income. The first adjustment is only required if optional adjustments were made to the numerator in the formula. If amounts were subtracted from the numerator, they must also be subtracted from the denominator. The second adjustment is the removal of any expenditure or loss included in the calculation of the attributable CFC amount under section EX 20B. In practice, there should never be any such amounts, because section EX 20B includes only income; this adjustment is a purely protective measure, to be used in the event that section EX 20B does not operate as intended. The subtraction of personal services income or the cost of revenue account property from the numerator of the formula, under subsection EX 20D(7), is not expenditure or loss under section EX 20B, but is in any case removed in the first adjustment. The third adjustment is the removal of income derived by the CFC from a company, if the CFC and the company could be members of the same test group under subsection EX 20D(1). The purpose of this adjustment is to prevent the inflation of total income by transactions between associated entities. In determining whether the CFC and the company could be members of the test group, it is not relevant that the required consolidation has actually been undertaken or not. It is relevant that if a person were to undertake the required consolidation, the CFC and the company would be eligible to be members of the same test group. The fourth adjustment is the removal of income derived by the CFC from a supply to a company that could not be a member of a test group with the CFC, if the supply was made with the purpose of inflating the measure of total income (the analysis of section GB 15B in this report provides further information). The third and fourth adjustments have a similar purpose, with the following differences: • The third adjustment applies to income derived by a CFC from a company that could be part of a test group with the CFC, while the fourth adjustment applies when the company could not be part of a test group with the CFC. • The third adjustment does not require any purpose, while the fourth adjustment requires the purpose of increasing the measure of total income. The ratio in the formula in subsection EX 21D(4) will never be less than zero (subsection EX 20D(3) ensures this). The ratio may be zero if attributable income is zero, or because of the application of paragraph EX 21D(3)(f). Page 16 The active business exemption using accounting measures of income (section EX 21E) Section EX 21E contains the rules for calculating the ratio of attributable income to total income when using accounting measures of income. The availability of an applicable accounting standard under section EX 21C is a prerequisite for the use of section EX 21E. The ratio may be calculated either for a single CFC or, if certain requirements are met, for a test group of CFCs. If the measure of total income is more than zero and the measure of attributable income is not negative, and the ratio is less than 0.05, then the CFC (or every CFC in the test group) will be a non-attributing active CFC. This is subject to any limitations imposed by other provisions, such as section GB 15C. The calculation requires, firstly, a base calculation of attributable income, subsequently altered by some compulsory adjustments and some optional adjustments. Secondly, it requires a base calculation of total income, also subsequently altered by some compulsory adjustments and some optional adjustments. The altered measure of attributable income is finally divided by the altered measure of total income. Amounts used in the ratio calculation must comply with the applicable accounting standard, but will often be taken to comply in the absence of strict compliance at a detailed level (see the analysis of subsection EX 21E(13) in this report). It is accepted that the accounting standards may change over time. Any guidance provided in this report about the meaning of particular terms under accounting standards may be made obsolete by changes in the standards. The use of section EX 21E is purely optional (see subparagraph EX 21B(2)(b)(ii)). If a person chooses to apply the section but its requirements are not met for a CFC, subsection EX 21B(3) and section EX 21D must also be applied to the CFC (subject to other provisions such as section GB 15C). In other words, there is no automatic requirement to attribute CFC income or loss when the requirements of section EX 21E are not met; it will depend on whether it is a non- attributing CFC by some other means. Most amounts used in the ratio calculation are gross amounts, with no deductions for expenditure or losses incurred. However, and in contrast to the ratio calculation that uses tax measures of income (section EX 21D), some amounts relating to derivatives and non-derivative financial assets are included even if they are losses or expenditure. This is not “net” treatment in the sense of subtracting all expenditure incurred in earning a particular item of income. Rather, losses or expenditure on some derivatives or financial assets are netted off against income or gains on other items. This is done to reduce the cost of calculating the ratio, in recognition that ledger accounts and items on the face of financial statements will often be reported net, or net of derivative gains and losses. By allowing the use of net amounts in some cases, the legislation creates the possibility of negative measures of attributable income or total income. As is clear from the restrictions on the measures of attributable income (which must not be negative) and total income (which must be positive), a CFC with negative measures of income is not a non-attributing active CFC under section EX 21E. Subsection EX 21E(1) contains the requirement that an applicable accounting standard under section EX 21C be available to the person for undertaking the ratio calculation. Page 17 Subsection EX 21E(2) contains the requirements that must be met for the ratio to be calculated for a test group of CFCs. Section EX 21C imposes further requirements relating to the sets of accounting standards (the applicable accounting standard) that may be used by the test group. It is possible that the requirements of subsection EX 21E(2) will be met, but that no applicable accounting standard will be available for use under section EX 21C. In that case, the ratio may not be calculated for the test group under section EX 21E. The first requirement for using a test group is that all the CFCs in the group are required by the applicable accounting standard to be consolidated for the accounting period. Typically, this means all the CFCs will be under common control, but the accounting standard is the authoritative reference. If the applicable accounting standard does not require that a CFC is to be consolidated with all the other CFCs in the test group for the whole of the accounting period, the CFC is not to be included in the test group. It is acceptable for the CFC to be required to consolidate, under the applicable accounting standard, with entities outside the test group as well as those in the test group. If there are entities outside the test group, additional work is likely to be required to identify amounts pertaining to the test group. The second requirement for using a test group is that all the companies in the test group must be resident in the same country. This is the same requirement imposed on a test group under section EX 21D. The third requirement for using a test group is that the person applying the test (the person with an income interest in the CFC) holds an income interest of more than 50 percent in every company in the group. Again, this is the same requirement imposed on a test group under section EX 21D. The fourth requirement for using a test group is that all the CFCs must use the same functional currency. The calculations under section EX 21E will effectively be undertaken using the functional currency of a CFC (see the analysis of paragraph EX 21E(4)(g)), and the use of different functional currencies within a test group would therefore complicate that calculation. The final requirement for using a test group is that audited and consolidated financial statements, complying with the applicable accounting standard, must exist. These must contain the accounts of all the CFCs in the test group. As with the first requirement, it is acceptable for the consolidated financial statements to also include the accounts of companies not in the test group, but additional work is likely to be required in this case to isolate the amounts applicable to the test group. Subsection EX 21E(13) states that the financial statements (being accounts) will be taken to comply with the applicable accounting standard if they meet the requirements of section EX 21C in relation to that standard (see especially subsection EX 21C(9)). Subsection EX 21E(3) is the rule that makes a CFC a non-attributing active CFC if the CFC’s ratio of attributable income to total income is less than 0.05, its attributable income is not negative, and its total income is greater than zero. Subsection EX 21E(4) explains how the ratio calculation in subsection (5) is to be undertaken. Page 18 Amounts used in the calculation must be determined under the applicable accounting standard. Amounts will be taken to be determined under the applicable accounting standard if they are actually determined under that standard, or if the requirements in subsection EX 21E(13) are met. Some of the adjustments to base measures of attributable income and total income require the use of tax measures of income or expenditure. In those cases, it is clear that the amount will not be determined under the applicable accounting standard. Each item in the formula (there are six items) must be adjusted so that there is no double- counting of amounts. Double-counting could occur if, for example, an amount was both income from a financial asset under paragraph EX 21E(7)(f) and income from property used to back insurance assets under paragraph EX 21E(7)(h). Double-counting across items, rather than within an item in the formula should be automatically prevented by the structure of section EX 21E. Paragraph EX 21E(4)(g) requires that amounts are to be determined for a CFC using the functional currency of the CFC. The functional currency of a CFC is determined by the applicable accounting standard and cannot be freely chosen. The concept of “functional currency” is much more restrictive than the concept of “the currency of the CFC’s financial accounts” in subsection EX 21(4). Amounts may have to be translated from a currency that is not the functional currency of the CFC, such as when the CFC makes sales outside its own country. In that case, conversion to the functional currency must comply with the applicable accounting standard (with one exception). Translation under the applicable standard will frequently result in the recognition of an exchange rate gain or loss, and the gain or loss may need to be included in measures of attributable or total income. The one exception to the general rule is that exchange differences arising on a monetary item that forms part of a net investment of the CFC in a foreign operation are ignored. A monetary item that is part of a net investment in a foreign operation is an item for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future (see the definition in International Accounting Standard 21, for example). If the ratio in subsection EX 21E(5) is calculated for a test group, the test group is – broadly speaking – treated as a single CFC for the purposes of the calculation. Amounts for the test group must be consolidated under the applicable accounting standard. This requires elimination of transactions, balances, income and expenses between the group members. If consolidated financial accounts exist that include the accounts of companies in the test group and only those companies, it may be possible to use those accounts without alteration. If consolidated accounts include entities that are not members of the test group, a sub-consolidation will be required for the test group. Information from consolidation worksheets may be used for this purpose, providing it meets the requirements of subsection EX 21E(13). Because the test group is effectively treated as a single entity for the purposes of section EX 21E, there are special rules for determining when a person who is not a member of the test group is associated with the test group, or is a member of the same group of companies as the test group. The analysis of subsection EX 21D(3) in this report provides more information. Each item in the formula is to be adjusted to remove amounts attributable to minority interests. “Minority interest” is not further defined in the legislation. However, it is clear from the context that a minority interest is an interest in the CFC held by a person who is not the interest-holder calculating the ratio. Page 19 Removal of amounts attributable to minority interests is most relevant for test groups. For an individual CFC, removal of these amounts is expected to affect all amounts equally so that the ratio in the formula is unchanged. For a test group, removal of these amounts is necessary to prevent, for example, all the income of an active business that is only partly owned by a New Zealand resident from sheltering attributable income of a company that is wholly owned by that resident. Example: Removal of minority interest Gordon has a 70% income interest in CFC A and a 55% income interest in CFC B. CFC A is an investment company that buys, holds, and sells intellectual property, bonds and shares. It also has a sideline in rubber importing. CFC A does not develop any intellectual property itself. CFC A has intra-group transactions comprising $15,000 of sales of rubber to CFC B and $86,000 of interest income from a loan to CFC B. CFC B is a shoe manufacturer. Gordon initially wishes to consolidate the two CFCs for the purpose of the active business test using accounting measures of attributable income and total income. The accounts of the CFCs are shown below. $000sConsolidated To/from CFC B To/from 3rd partiesTotal To/from CFC A To/from 3rd partiesTotal Income Sales151328202542025420267 less cost of goods sold171715148111482614828 Gross profit1154285439 Other income Interest863514370351 Dividend9019010901 Royalties5745740574 Operating expenses Interest086291329992913 Loss on financial assets3333033 Rent5505 Other expenses0502050205020 Net profit before tax1885-2591-706 Attributable income (before removal of minority interests)0892 Total income (before removal of minority interests)2025421159 Ratio4.2% $000sConsolidated To/from CFC B To/from 3rd partiesTotal To/from CFC A To/from 3rd partiesTotal Income Sales11920111401114011149 less cost of goods sold12128814681548158 Gross profit829852991 Other income Interest602463060246 Dividend6316310631 Royalties4024020402 Operating expenses Interest047160216491602 Loss on financial assets2323023 Rent4404 Other expenses0276127612761 Net profit before tax1320-1425-121 Attributable income (after removal of minority interests)624 Total income (after removal of minority interests)11773 Ratio5.3% CFC ACFC B CFC ACFC B 30% minority interest removed45% minority interest removed Page 20 Attributable income comprises: • Interest • Royalties • Loss on financial asset (this is not a share) Total income comprises: • Sales income • Interest • Royalties • Loss on a financial asset \[Note that dividends are removed under EX 21E(9)(a) and EX 21E(12)(b)\] If the two CFCs were consolidated without consideration of minority interests (as in the top half of table) there would be attributable income of $892,000 and total income of $21,159,000, giving a ratio – using the formula in subsection EX 21E(5) – of 4.2%. However, minority interests must be removed line-by-line because, conceptually, Gordon has rights and obligations in respect of only 70% of all the income and expense items of CFC A, and 55% of all the expense income and expense items of CFC B. So, for example, Gordon counts only $437,000 × 70% = $305,900 of interest income from CFC A and eliminates $86,000 × 70% = $60,200 (being his share of the amount received from CFC B), giving consolidated interest income of $246,700 (as in the interest income line in the bottom half of the table). After removing minority interests in the consolidation there is attributable income of $624,400 and total income of $11,773,200, giving a ratio of 5.3%. If a test group is used, the CFCs in the test group are not non-attributing active CFCs. Gordon opts not to use a test group. CFC B, on its own, satisfies the test for being a non-attributing active CFC, since it has no attributable income. CFC A does not. A test group applies the same rules for exchange rate conversion as an individual CFC. Consolidated financial accounts are presented in a presentation currency, which may differ from the functional currency of any of the entities whose accounts are being consolidated. Because all the entities in a test group will have the same functional currency, conversion to a different presentation currency is unnecessary and the functional currency should be used. For the avoidance of doubt, the legislation requires that if a presentation currency is used to calculate amounts, translation of all amounts from the functional to the presentation currency must be undertaken using an average exchange rate for the year. The effect is that the amounts in presentation currency will be nothing more than a scaled-up or scaled-down version of the amounts in the functional currency. Subsection EX 21E(5) contains the formula for calculating the ratio of attributable income to total income using accounting measures of income. The intent, in defining the items used in the numerator in the formula, was to define a measure of attributable income that was a reasonable approximation to the tax measure of attributable income, while not requiring excessive adjustments to readily available accounting measures. Similar comments apply to the denominator. In cases in which net amounts are allowed to be used in the formula, the approximation will not be to tax measures of gross income, but to tax measures of net income or loss. Page 21 The numerator in the formula consists of a base measure of attributable income (reported passive). There are subsequent compulsory upward adjustments (added passive) and then optional downward adjustments (removed passive). Double-counting and double-elimination are prevented by requiring that amounts are included in added passive only to the extent they are not already included in reported passive. Amounts are included in removed passive only to the extent that they are already in added passive or reported passive. The denominator in the formula consists of a base measure of total income (reported revenue). There are subsequent optional upward adjustments (added revenue) and compulsory downward adjustments (removed revenue). As with the numerator, double-counting and double-elimination are prevented. Subsection EX 21E(7) defines the base measure of attributable income (reported passive). The measure includes dividend, royalty, rental and lease income, whether or not in the ordinary course of business, and all are measured on a gross basis. It is intended that these terms have the meanings they have under the applicable accounting standard, rather than their meanings in the Income Tax Act 2007. For example, if generally accepted accounting practice with IFRS or IFRSEs are used, International Accounting Standard 18 (Revenue) provides some guidance about the recognition of dividends and royalties when received in the ordinary course of business. International Accounting Standard 17 (Leases) provides some guidance about the recognition of interest, rents and other lease income under a lease. If the applicable standard provides no guidance, the meanings of dividend, royalty, rental and lease should be determined according to the general understanding of accountants who would apply the standard. It is important to note that the label given to a component of income in the accounts or on the face of financial statements does not determine the character of the amount. For example, if an amount would be a royalty under International Accounting Standard 18, but is included in “Other income” in the income statement because it is not in the ordinary course of business, it is still a royalty for the purposes of subsection EX 21E(7). Another component of reported passive income is interest income. This is measured on a gross basis (with no deduction for expenses). Interest income is recognised under generally accepted accounting practice with IFRS and IFRSEs under the Revenue Standard (International Accounting Standard 18), if the interest is received in the course of ordinary activities of the entity. That standard specifies that the effective interest method (set out in International Accounting Standard 39) is to be used to calculate the amount of interest (this is essentially a yield-to-maturity calculation). Interest income may also be recognised other than under the Revenue Standard, such as when not in the ordinary course of activities of the entity. Again, the effective interest method would normally be used. It is expected that similar principles would apply under generally accepted accounting practice without IFRS, although there is no relevant standard to spell this out. A further component of reported passive income relates to income or loss from a financial asset that is not a derivative. Page 22 The income or loss is included if it is a change in the reported fair value of the financial asset, a gain or loss on the derecognition of the asset or a foreign exchange gain or loss on the asset. Income or loss is to be included regardless of whether or not it appears in the income statement or elsewhere in the accounts. Losses will occur if the reported fair value declines, there is a loss on derecognition of the asset or there is a foreign exchange loss on the asset. Losses will not occur because expenditure, such as the cost of borrowing to purchase the asset, has been incurred in deriving income from the asset. Such expenditure is ignored for the purposes of the ratio calculation. Not all amounts of income that relate to financial assets are included under paragraph EX 21E(7)(f). For example, some interest income is recognised under paragraph EX 21E(7)(b) even though it flows from the holding of a financial asset. If an amount is included under paragraph (f) and another paragraph, subparagraph EX 21E(4)(a)(ii) allows an adjustment to prevent double-counting. Page 23 Example 1: income or loss from a financial asset (held-to-maturity) Sandy owns SPECo, a CFC with a functional currency of CUA.\* On 1 April 2011 SPECo purchases a bond newly issued by a foreign government, for CUB973,357. The bond has a term of 3 years, a face value of CUB1,000,000, and pays interest six-monthly at a rate of 6% per annum. The effective interest rate on the bond is 7% per annum. The CUA/CUB exchange rate is initially 1.00, but rises to 0.50 (CUA appreciates) on 31 March 2012. The bond is classified as a held-to-maturity investment under NZIAS 39, so is to be measured (subsequent to recognition) at amortised cost using the effective interest method. On 31 March 2012, following the usual payment of interest, the foreign government announces that it is facing a fiscal crisis and will be unable to service its debt as previously agreed. In future, it will pay no interest and will repay only 80% of the face value of bonds on maturity. On 31 March 2013, SPECo sells the bond for CUB700,000.

On sale of the bond, any amounts recorded directly in equity – which have already been counted as attributable income – are transferred to the income statement by including them in the loss on sale. However, it is not intended that the income or loss be counted again when this occurs. So although the loss on sale reported in the accounts is $23,404, the gain of $904 that is being transferred from equity is removed, giving a loss on sale to be recognised in the test of $24,308. This gives a total loss over the period of ownership of the bond, for the purposes of the test, of $578,357. Page 25 The definitions of “financial asset”, “derivative” and “derecognition” are contained in NZ IAS 39 (the New Zealand equivalent to International Accounting Standard 39), regardless of the applicable accounting standard being used in section EX 21E. In the case of “financial asset”, the definition is by reference to the definition in NZ IAS 32. The definitions from NZ IAS 39 are used only for the purposes of identifying which assets are non-derivative financial assets and when they are effectively disposed of, not for determining how these assets are measured. If, for example, generally accepted accounting practice without IFRS is being used as the applicable accounting standard, a person will use NZ IAS 39 to identify which assets of the CFC are financial assets. Having identified the assets, the person may use the values of those assets as determined under generally accepted accounting practice without IFRS. The use of the definitions from NZ IAS 39 is necessary because generally accepted accounting practice without IFRS does not rigorously define “financial asset” or “derivative”. Income or losses from shares that are not revenue account property are excluded from the ambit of paragraph EX 21E(7)(f). This is to obtain a better approximation to tax measures of income; the assumption is that gains or losses on these shares would not be income or loss if tax measures of income were used. The term “revenue account property” is defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax 2007 and is intended to have that meaning. Another component of reported passive is income or loss from a derivative instrument. “Derivative instrument” is to be given the definition in NZ IAS 39. As with the use of NZ IAS 39 definitions for the purposes of paragraph EX 21E(7)(f), the definition is used only to identify which items the CFC holds are derivative instruments. Subsequent measurement is undertaken using the applicable accounting standard, whatever that may be. Income or loss from a derivative may be recorded directly in the income statement in a set of accounts (profit and loss), or may be recorded directly as a component of equity and only later recognised in the income statement. It is only to be included in reported passive when it is recognised in the income statement. This is intended to prevent excessive volatility when cashflow hedges are used and the hedged cashflow has not yet occurred (assuming that hedge accounting can be used). Income or loss from a derivative instrument is included only if the instrument is held for dealing, not held in the ordinary course of business, or is hedging the accounting measure of attributable income or a transaction that would give rise to such attributable income. In general, derivative income or losses will not be in reported passive to the extent they are the result of hedges of active income (income that is not attributable). This recognises that CFCs with active business will use derivatives to limit risk. For example, derivatives may be used to remove the risk that the exchange rate will fluctuate when sales of goods are made in a foreign currency. The terms “ordinary course of business” and “dealing” are not further defined in the legislation. A “hedging relationship” must be one of a type defined in NZ IAS 39. Again, this applies only to identify when there is a hedging relationship, not to determine how to measure any income or loss from a derivative instrument that is in a hedging relationship. NZ IAS 39 defines three types of hedging relationship. The two that are expected to be most common in practice are: • a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability; Page 26 • a hedge of the exposure to variability in cashflows that could affect profit and loss and that is attributable to a particular risk associated with an asset or liability or to a highly probable transaction. It is not necessary for the hedging relationship to qualify for hedge accounting treatment (under generally accepted accounting practice with IFRS or IFRSEs, this requires proper designation of the hedge and that the hedge be highly effective). However, the effectiveness of the hedging relationship and the existence of documentation of a hedge may be relevant in determining whether a hedge really exists. If a purported hedging relationship is not effective or only partly effective, it is likely that income from the hedge will be attributable income anyway (it is either not held in the ordinary course of business or the business deals in derivatives). When the hedge is effective enough that a hedging relationship exists, but the hedge is still partly ineffective, the part of the gain or loss that reflects the ineffective portion of the hedge will normally be included in attributable income. This is because the legislation refers to “income or loss \[...\] from a hedging relationship \[with the accounting measure of attributable income\]”, and does not limit the income or loss to the amount attributable to the effective portion of the hedge. This is the case even though income or loss from the ineffective portion of the hedge may be presented in a different line item in the accounts. If a CFC uses a derivative to hedge both non-attributable and attributable income (or transactions that give rise to both non-attributable and attributable income), the hedge gain or loss is recognised only to the extent it relates to the hedging relationship with attributable income. This will require apportionment on a reasonable basis. Any income or loss attributable to the ineffective portion of a hedge will usually be included in the amount to be apportioned. Example: Derivative gain (foreign currency hedge) CFCA, which has a functional currency of Canadian dollars takes out a single contract for exchange rate cover. It covers $1,000,000 of US dollar sales and interest income over the following income year. CFCA subsequently receives US$700,000 of sales income and US$100,000 of interest income at the end of the year. The Canadian/US dollar exchange rate ends up higher than expected at the time the hedge was taken out. There is a gain on the foreign currency hedge of CA$333,333. This offsets sales and interest income that was CA$300,000 lower than expected because of the stronger exchange rate. The exchange rate cover contract is a derivative instrument. The instrument is in a hedging relationship (a cashflow hedge) with non-attributable income (sales). The instrument is also in a hedging relationship with attributable income (interest), and the income attributable to this hedging relationship should be included in reported passive. A reasonable apportionment of the hedge gain in this case would be CA$41,667, being US$100,000 ÷ (US$700,000 + US$100,000) × CA$333,333. The hedge is not completely effective, and $33,333 of the derivative gain is attributable to the ineffective portion of the hedge. In the foregoing apportionment, one-eighth of the ineffective portion is attributed to the hedging relationship with interest income. Page 27 The final amount included in reported passive is income or gains from a business of insurance. This includes premium income from insurance or re-insurance activities. It also includes income or gains from property used to back insurance assets, such as interest, dividends, rents or fair value changes flowing from assets held to satisfy future insurance claims. If generally accepted accounting practice with IFRS or IFRSEs are used, International Financial Reporting Standard 4 or its New Zealand equivalent are likely to apply to such income. There should be no income from a business of insurance if using generally accepted accounting practice without IFRS. CFCs are prevented from using that set of standards as the applicable accounting standard if they have insurance income under the relevant FRSs. Subsection EX 21E(8) defines the compulsory upward adjustments to the base measure of attributable income (added passive). There are four adjustments. The first adjustment is to add income from a life insurance policy that would be included in the attributable CFC amount under paragraph EX 20B(3)(g). This adjustment was included primarily because some life insurance products, even though excluded from the scope of the financial arrangement rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 and the financial instrument rules in NZ IAS 39, are close substitutes for interest-bearing investments. The amount to include is to be determined under tax concepts (see the analysis of section EX 20B in this report for more information). If an accounting measure of such income has already been included under subsection EX 21E(7) but the tax measure is higher, the difference must be added. The second adjustment is to add income from the disposal of revenue account property that would be included in the attributable CFC amount under paragraph EX 20B(3)(k). The adjustment does not apply to the disposal of a share, a financial arrangement or a life insurance policy, because other provisions are designed to capture gains in those cases. The adjustment also does not apply unless the property is used in a way giving rise to income or gains that increase the accounting measure of attributable income. The amount of the upward adjustment is the same as the amount that would be included under paragraph EX 20B(3)(k), except to the extent the amount is already included in reported passive. See also the analysis of paragraph EX 21E(9)(d), which may allow removal of the cost of the property. The remaining adjustments add income from services that would be part of the attributable CFC amount under paragraphs EX 20B(3)(l) to (n), which relate to income from services physically performed in New Zealand and certain income from the supply of telecommunications services. The amount of the upward adjustment is the same as the amount that would be included under the relevant paragraphs in subsection EX 20B(3), except to the extent the amount is already included in reported passive. Subsection EX 21E(9) defines the optional downward adjustments to the base measure of attributable income (added passive). There are four adjustments. If a person chooses not to apply the adjustments, there is no adjustment. The first adjustment is the removal of dividend income that would not be part of an attributable CFC amount under paragraphs EX 20B(3)(a) to (c). First, the amount that would not be part of the attributable CFC amount under those paragraphs is determined. That amount is then removed, but only to the extent that it was included in reported passive or added passive to begin with. Page 28 The second and third adjustments are the removal of royalty or rental income that would be attributable CFC amounts but are not, because they come within one or more of the exceptions in paragraphs EX 20B(5)(a) to (d) and EX 20B(7)(a) to (c). The amount to remove is the amount determined under those paragraphs, using tax measures of income. Removal is permitted only to the extent the amounts were already included in reported passive or added passive. The fourth adjustment is the removal of the cost of revenue account property that, on disposal, produced an attributable CFC amount under paragraph EX 20B(3)(k). Such an amount was included, on a gross basis, in added passive. The effect of subtracting the cost is that only the net profit from the sale is included in attributable income. In order to be removed, further requirements must be met. The first requirement is that the amount of cost subtracted would have been an allowable deduction of the CFC in the accounting period if the CFC were resident in New Zealand. The second requirement is that the amount subtracted may not exceed the gross proceeds of the sale already included in added passive or (less likely) reported passive. Any amounts that would have to be added back in relation to the deductions under subpart CH of the Income Tax Act 2007, if the CFC were a New Zealand resident, reduce the amount of cost that is subtracted. Subsection EX 21E(10) defines the base measure of total income (reported revenue) used in the ratio of attributable income to total income. The core item of reported revenue for most CFCs with active businesses will be “revenue”. If the applicable accounting standard is generally accepted accounting practice with IFRS or IFRSEs, the amount of revenue to recognise is dictated by International Accounting Standard 18 (IAS 18, Revenue). If the applicable accounting standard is generally accepted accounting practice without IFRS, the amount of revenue to include is the amount reported as operating revenue. It is expected that revenue, under any standard, will usually include income from interest, dividends and royalties. It might not include income from leases because most lease income is excluded from IAS 18; if there is lease income that is not included in revenue under IAS 18, this income is included separately under paragraph EX 21E(10)(b). Revenue is also expected to include most income from the supply of services, such as attributable CFC amounts under paragraphs EX 20B(3)(l) to (n). Another component of reported revenue is gains or losses on certain non-derivative financial assets. The description of this item is identical to the description in paragraph EX 21E(7)(f). The amount to be recognised may, however, be different from the amount under subsection (7), depending on whether some of the income is already included in revenue (there should be no double-counting). A further component of reported revenue is gains or losses on certain derivative instruments. The description of this component is very nearly the same as the description in paragraph EX 21E(7)(g). The only difference is that instead of the hedging relationship being with the accounting measure of attributable income or transactions that would give rise to such attributable income, the hedging relationship must be with the accounting measure of total income. In practice, this component of reported revenue should bring in nearly all hedges except those that relate to expenses or liabilities. Page 29 Example: Derivative gain (foreign currency hedge of income and expenses) CFCB, which has a functional currency of Canadian dollars, takes out a single contract for exchange rate cover. It covers US$100,000 of net costs over the following income year, being US dollar purchase costs less US dollar sales and interest income. The exchange rate cover contract is a derivative instrument. The instrument is in a hedging relationship (a cashflow hedge) with expenditure. More precisely, it is in a hedging relationship with the amount of expense that is forecast to exceed income. The amount of any hedge gain or loss is not included in reported revenue, because the hedging relationship is not with income. The final component of reported revenue is insurance income. The description of this component is the same as the description in section EX 21E(7)(h). This will often have the character of revenue, but income from insurance contracts that is dealt with in International Financial Reporting Standard 4 (and its New Zealand equivalent) is explicitly excluded from the revenue standard IAS 18 (and its New Zealand equivalent). Subsection EX 21E(11) defines the optional upward adjustments to the base measure of total income (added revenue). There are two adjustments. They add certain income from a life insurance policy or certain income from the disposal of revenue account property. These adjustments are described in the analysis of subsection EX 21E(8). The assumption behind these adjustments is that such amounts are more likely than others not to be included in revenue or operating revenue, because they will often not be in the ordinary course of business. Subsection EX 21E(12) defines the compulsory downward adjustments to the base measure of total income (removed revenue). There are seven adjustments. The first adjustment is the removal of the cost of revenue account property, if it was also removed from the measure of attributable income under paragraph EX 21E(9)(d). The second adjustment is the removal of the amount of a dividend, if it was also removed from the measure of attributable income under paragraph EX 21E(9)(a). Bearing in mind the desire to produce a reasonable approximation to the tax measure of total income, the basis for removal is that these dividends would not be gross income of a New Zealand-resident company. However, to reduce compliance costs, if the dividends are not removed from the measure of attributable income, they are not required to be removed from total income either. The third adjustment is the removal of personal services income that would be an attributable CFC amount under paragraph EX 20B(3)(h). This income is disregarded for the purposes of the ratio calculation, though will still be taxable under subsections CQ 2(2B) and DN 2 if the CFC qualifies for the active business exemption. In contrast, the personal services income was not explicitly removed from attributable income (the numerator in the formula), because it is unlikely to have been included in any of the categories of attributable income using accounting measures. The fourth adjustment is the removal of income or loss from a share that is not revenue account property. “Revenue account property” is defined in section YA 1. The income or loss may have been included in reported revenue (as operating revenue, for example, if generally accepted accounting practice without IFRS was the applicable accounting standard). This adjustment is for greater consistency with the tax measure of total income (gross income). Page 30 The fifth adjustment is the removal of income derived by the CFC from a second CFC, if the second CFC could be part of a test group with the first CFC. This is to prevent the inflation of total income by arrangements between associates. The sixth and seventh adjustments apply only when the applicable accounting standard is generally accepted accounting practice without IFRS. The inclusion of operating revenue, which is a very wide measure, in reported revenue makes these adjustments necessary; they are not thought to be required in relation to the much narrower measure of revenue as defined under IAS 18 or the New Zealand equivalent. The sixth adjustment removes income if it is income from a liability, such as a reduction of a provision. It is possible that such income would be included in operating revenue, although this would be rare. Income from a liability is not removed if it is income in the ordinary course of business from a sale or supply of services. This might be the case, for example, when a prepaid service is provided, with the income in that case corresponding to a reduction of an unearned income liability. The seventh adjustment removes income if it is income from an asset that is not a financial asset and not revenue account property. “Financial asset” is defined in NZ IAS 32, but that standard is used only to identify relevant assets, not to measure income relating to those assets. “Revenue account property” is defined in section YA 1. This adjustment prevents, for example, revaluations of real property from being included in the measure of total income. It could be possible, although unusual, for such amounts to be included in “operating revenue”. The adjustment is intended to provide a closer approximation to tax measures of income. Subsection EX 21E(13) sets out the conditions under which accounts are taken to meet the requirements of the applicable accounting standard. Strict compliance at a detailed level with the requirements of the standard will often not be practical, and an unqualified audit opinion will usually require compliance only in all material respects. Therefore, this subsection does not require strict compliance. The primary requirement in subsection EX 21E(13) is that the accounts meet the requirements of section EX 21C for the applicable accounting standard (see particularly section EX 21C(9)). This means, in simplified terms, the accounts must state they comply with the relevant standard, the accounts must have received an unqualified audit by an independent chartered accountant, and there must not be reasonable grounds to suspect fraud, intent to mislead or incompetence. If only information taken directly from published accounts were used in the test, this primary requirement could be sufficient. However, this will sometimes not be the case. For example, in producing consolidated accounts for a corporate group, each CFC might provide information in a relatively aggregated form (such as line items actually appearing in the financial statements). When more detailed information is required, this will not be taken from the accounts that have been audited but directly from the CFC’s internal accounting systems or from other similar sources. Page 31 This information will still be taken to comply with the relevant accounting standard, as long as: • it is information that is drawn from the compliant accounts (even though not appearing on the face of financial statements), or that was used to prepare the compliant accounts (such as detailed information from CFC accounts that has been aggregated before being provided for the preparation of the compliant accounts); and • the information is consistent with the compliant accounts; and • there is no evidence of fraud, intent to mislead or incompetence (see the analysis of subsection EX 21C(9) for further information). The word “consistent” is not further defined, so has its ordinary meaning. One implication of the consistency requirement is that information from the compliant accounts should be used if available, in preference to other information. As with subsection EX 21C(9), nothing in subsection EX 21C(13) affects requirements to keep records or information, or to make those available when required by Inland Revenue. The Australian exemption (sections EX 22 and 23 of the Income Tax Act 2007) Section EX 22 defines a non-attributing Australian CFC. A CFC qualifies to be a non-attributing Australian CFC if it is resident in Australia and is subject to income tax in Australia. “Resident in Australia” means resident in Australia according to the Income Tax Act 2007. See, for example, section YD 2. There is also a requirement that the CFC is treated as a resident of Australia under every tax treaty between Australia and another country. This requirement might not be satisfied if, for instance, the CFC was incorporated in Australia but was managed from another country. In that case, it would be common for a tax treaty to treat the CFC as resident in the other country and Australia would lose worldwide taxing rights over the CFC. For a CFC to be “subject to tax” requires one of two things. Firstly, the CFC can itself be subject to Australian income tax. Or secondly, the CFC can be part of a consolidated group for Australian tax purposes, if that consolidated group (through the “head company”) is itself subject to Australian income tax. It is not sufficient for a person with an income interest in the CFC to be subject to Australian tax on the CFC’s income. A CFC will not qualify to be a non-attributing Australian CFC if its liability for Australian income tax has been reduced by an exemption from or reduction of income tax for certain offshore business income. These restrictions also applied to prevent Australian CFCs qualifying for the grey list exemption when there was a grey list. If a non-attributing Australian CFC holds an interest in another CFC, the Australian exemption will not automatically apply to that other CFC. This is because the other CFC is effectively treated as held by the resident holders of interests in the first CFC, rather than by the first CFC (this is not a change of law; see existing sections EX 10 and EX 21(13)(c)). The eligibility of the other CFC for the exemption must be separately assessed. Page 32 If a non-attributing Australian CFC holds an interest in a FIF, the Australian exemption will not automatically apply to that other FIF. Again, this is because the FIF is effectively treated as being held by the resident holders of interests in the CFC, rather than by the CFC itself (see section EX 58). Section EX 23 previously applied to CFCs resident in grey list countries that received certain tax concessions and thereby did not qualify for the grey list exemption. This has been repealed along with the grey list exemption for CFCs. If an Australian-resident CFC is not a non-attributing Australian CFC because it has reduced its income in a way described in section EX 22(1)(b), it is treated in the same way as any other CFC. It may be a non-attributing active CFC, or there may be attributed CFC income or loss from the CFC. Anti-avoidance rules for the active business exemption (sections GB 15B and 15C) Two anti-avoidance rules may affect the application of the active business exemption (sections EX 21D and EX 21E). The presence of these rules is not intended to imply anything about the general anti-avoidance provision (section BG 1). They are included for clarity. They may apply alone or in addition to the general anti-avoidance provision. Section GB 15B Section GB 15B applies when a CFC makes a supply with the purpose of increasing the tax measure of its total income in section EX 21D. This is an anti-avoidance rule. Increasing total income lowers the ratio of attributable income to total income, and the rule makes it clear that supplies made for this purpose are to be ignored. It is expected that two CFCs who repeatedly sell goods back and forth between each other would come within the rule. Similarly, a sale which is put through an intermediate CFC with the purpose of increasing the intermediate CFC’s total income for the purposes of section EX 21D would be caught. However, the purpose of inflating total income must be the main purpose for section GB 15B to apply. It is accepted that there will commonly be sales between CFCs, such as between a regional supplier and country offices, that have no tax motivation. Section GB 15B does not apply if the CFC makes a supply to a person who could be a member of a test group with the CFC. Separate rules apply in that situation (see section EX 21D(9)(c)) to require the removal of the income from the measure of total income. Section GB 15C Section GB 15 applies when a person enters an arrangement having a purpose, that is more than incidental, of enabling a CFC to meet the requirements of section EX 21E (active business exemption based on accounting measures of income) when the CFC would not meet the requirements of section EX 21D (active business exemption based on tax measures of income) to be a non-attributing active CFC. Page 33 This is an anti-avoidance rule to prevent manipulation of the active business exemption when using accounting measures of income. Accounting measures of income may often be used to determine whether a CFC qualifies for the active business exemption (see section EX 21E). The use of accounting measures is allowed because it can reduce compliance costs for taxpayers. Some effort has been made to align accounting and tax measures of income (see the required adjustments in section EX 21E, for example). However, accounting measures of income will inevitably be different from tax measures. There is therefore a risk that some taxpayers will attempt to exploit the differences to benefit from the active business exemption when, under tax measures of income, it is clear they should not benefit. There are two conditions that must be satisfied before the section applies. The first is that a person, being any person at all, must have entered an arrangement with a purpose, that is more than incidental, of enabling a CFC to meet the requirements of section EX 21E. It is expected that it will be rare for a person who enters into a normal commercial transaction, not motivated by tax concerns, to satisfy this requirement. The purpose must be “more than incidental”. Here there is a parallel with the definition of “tax avoidance arrangement” in section YA 1 (“not merely incidental”). However, that definition refers to arrangements having a purpose “or effect” of tax avoidance, whereas section GB 15 refers only to a purpose. It is accepted that an arrangement will, from time to time, have the effect of enabling a CFC to meet the requirements of section EX 21E even when the CFC would not meet the requirements of section EX 21D. It is the purpose that matters. The second condition is that the CFC would not meet the requirements of section EX 21D. If, in the presence of the arrangement, the CFC would qualify for the active business exemption using tax measures of income, the anti-avoidance rule does not apply. In this case, there does not seem to be an exploitation of differences between the accounting and tax measures of income. The anti-avoidance rule has a wide application. While not limiting that general application in any way, two specific situations in which the rules are intended to apply are: • when financial arrangements between CFCs, or between a CFC and a New Zealand resident, are entered into with a purpose of generating accounting losses when there is no economic loss for the group; and • when artificial transactions such as repeated sales are used to inflate the measure of total income used in the ratio of attributable income to total income. There were originally separate rules for these two situations, but they were removed from the bill during the Parliamentary process because they were considered to be redundant. In relation to the first situation, the Finance and Expenditure Committee, in its report to Parliament on the bill, stated: “The amendment we propose is general and would capture, for example, situations where taxpayers use loans (or make financial arrangements) between related parties with different functional currencies to shelter passive income”. Page 34 The anti-avoidance rule has to cover such situations. When tax measures of income are used, all significant financial arrangements are measured in New Zealand dollars. However, translation of all financial arrangements to New Zealand dollars was thought to be inappropriate when using accounting concepts of income. This is because the use of accounting concepts is intended – as much as possible – to allow taxpayers to use pre-prepared financial accounting information. It is only the existence of the anti-avoidance rule that has allowed this approach to be enacted. Example: Financial arrangements CFCA, which has a functional currency of Australian dollars, lends US$1 million to CFCB, which has a functional currency of US dollars (for simplicity, the loan is made in such a way that no cash changes hands). The Australian dollar strengthens compared with the US dollar, resulting in a foreign exchange loss for CFCA because the loan is now worth less in its functional currency of Australian dollars. The attributable loss may be offset against other attributable income. CFCB has no corresponding income, because the loan is worth exactly the same in its functional currency of US dollars. There is no economic loss for the group, but net income has been reduced. The anti-avoidance rule may apply if the financial arrangement was entered into with a purpose of generating the attributable loss for CFCA so that CFCA could meet the requirements of section EX 21E. Example: Inflating the measure of total income CFCA sells factory automation equipment. CFCB, in another country, is a finance company for the group. CFCA sells its equipment to CFCB, which then sells it to a third party. This inflates CFCB’s total income and allows it to qualify for the active business exemption using accounting measures of income. Assume for the purposes of the example that if tax concepts of income were used, CFCB would not qualify for the active business exemption (for example, because section EX 21D(9)(d) requires the removal of the sales). The anti-avoidance rule may apply if the sales are made through CFCB for the non-incidental purpose of allowing CFCB to meet the requirements of section EX 21E. If section GB 15C applies, the CFC in question does not qualify for the active business exemption (as it is not a non-attributing active CFC) and its income or loss must be attributed. In addition, if the arrangement involves a financial arrangement between the CFC and an associated CFC, it is possible that the associated CFC also does not qualify for the active business exemption. This occurs if the arrangement produces a foreign exchange loss for the first CFC and allows it to reduce its accounting measure of attributable income. This rule is designed to include matching economic gains and losses on either side of a financial arrangement, rather than just the loss, but may apply more widely. Commissioner’s determination for active insurance CFCs Under section EX 21B(3), an insurance CFC will be a non-attributing active CFC if: • a person with an interest in the CFC has applied for and obtained a determination from Inland Revenue under section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994 that the CFC is an active insurance business; and • the CFC satisfies any requirements laid out in the determination. Page 35 The determination facility is an interim measure until further work is done to consider special rules for extending the active income exemption to accommodate financial institutions. The active income exemption and active business tests for CFCs do not currently accommodate “active” insurance CFCs as insurance premiums and many types of investment income are included in the attributable CFC amount in section EX 20B. For a determination to be granted, the insurance CFC must satisfy the criteria set out in section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Some criteria relate to the legal status and organisation of the insurance business and its New Zealand parent, while others relate to the activities through which the insurance business earns its income. Organisational criteria In the simplest case, the entity criteria in subsection 91 AAQ(2) will be met if the insurance CFC is controlled by a New Zealand insurance company and the CFC carried out an insurance business in its country of residence before 30 June 2009. Example: Organisational criteria The following structure would satisfy the organisational criteria in subsection 91 AAQ (2): The organisational criteria are designed to accommodate more complex structures that are economically equivalent to this basic structure. For example, a New Zealand owner can still qualify if it is in the same group of companies as a New Zealand company that is registered under the Insurance Ratings Act 1994. Similarly, a group of insurance or insurance-related CFCs can apply for the determination on a country-consolidated basis under section 91AAQ (3). Finally, a New Zealand-controlled offshore insurance branch operation that existed before 30 June 2009 and that was subsequently converted into an insurance CFC could qualify so long as the CFC was in the same group of companies as the previous branch business. Offshore NZ Controlling interest Insurance CFC (that had the insurance business before 30 June 2009) NZ Insurance Co (registered the under Insurance ratings Act 1994) Page 36 Activity criteria The activity criteria in subsection 91AAQ(4) will be met if the CFC’s insurance business is carried out with the main purpose of producing a commercial return on the CFC’s capital and it produces “all or nearly all” of its income from insurance premiums covering risks within the CFC’s jurisdiction or from investment income from assets that are commensurate with these risks. Income from the reinsurance of other companies’ insurance contracts does not count towards “income from insurance premiums”. The determination for insurance CFCs is intended as a temporary proxy measure for the active business exemptions that apply for other CFCs. This suggests that “all or nearly all” can be read to mean “at least 95 percent” of the CFC’s total income. However, the determination does not specify an exact threshold as it may be appropriate to take into account a CFC’s particular circumstances and historic benchmarks in some cases. Similarly, the interpretation of “commensurate” will require judgement as to the level of investment assets that would be reasonably required to cover the insurance risks based on the size and risk profile of the insurance business. Historical results and competitor benchmarks may be used to provide guidance on this point. Subsection 91AAQ(5) lists some factors that the Commissioner may take into account when considering if a CFC meets the activity criteria. These include the amount of deductions that the New Zealand owner takes to support the CFC compared with the amount of assessable income earned by the CFC. Attributable income Section EX 20B of the Income Tax Act 2007 Section EX 20B insets a definition of income that is attributable to a CFC (referred to in the legislation as the attributable CFC amount). This definition is central to the new CFC rules. The definition is applicable, in the first instance, in the active business test to decide whether a CFC is active or passive. If the CFC fails the active business test, it will have attributable income that must be attributed to the New Zealand shareholders. Key features Attributable income (section EX 20B of the Income Tax Act 2007) The definition of “attributable CFC amount” can be divided into broad categories. The types of income that come under the definition include interest, royalties and rents, being income that is highly mobile and not location-specific. However, exceptions apply when the income is associated with an active business and there is limited risk to the New Zealand tax base. The broad categories of attributable CFC amount are as follows: • certain types of dividend; • interest; Page 37 • royalties; • rents; • other attributable income (income from offshore insurance businesses, life insurance policies, personal services and the disposal of revenue account property); • certain income related to telecommunications services; and • base company services income. A number of exceptions are also provided for under section EX 20B. For example carve-outs are provided for certain royalty payments, certain rents and telecommunication services. If an item of income falls within the scope of any one of the exceptions, that item of income will be excluded from the definition of “attributable CFC amount” unless that item of income is caught in another paragraph of subsection EX 20B(3) or (4). Detailed analysis Certain types of dividend (subsections EX 20B(3)(a) to (c)) The dividends that are included in the attributable CFC amount match the foreign dividends that would be subject to income tax (not exempt under section CW 9) if received by a company resident in New Zealand. They also include unimputed dividends received from New Zealand companies. More specifically, the attributable dividends are: • dividends from a less than 10 percent interest in a FIF described in sections EX 31, EX 32, EX 36, EX 37, EX 37B or EX 39 (section EX 20B(3)(a)). These comprise shares in ASX- listed Australian companies, Australian unit trusts with adequate turnover or distributions, certain venture capital investments into New Zealand companies that have since migrated to a grey list country, and shares in Guinness Peat Group plc; • dividends from fixed-rate foreign equity (section EX 20B(3)(c)); • dividends from deductible foreign equity (section EX 20B(3)(c)); • dividends received by CFCs from New Zealand companies to the extent that they are unimputed (section EX 20B(3)(b)). If the CFC holds an attributing interest in a FIF that is calculated using the comparative value, deemed rate of return or fair dividend rate methods, any dividends from this FIF will not be included in the attributable CFC amount. This is because these FIF interests have no income other than FIF income under section EX 59(2). Fixed-rate foreign equity and deductible foreign equity are defined in section YA 1. Fixed-rate foreign equity includes foreign dividends that are a specific, fixed percentage of the amount paid for the equity (as well as variations on this) and any dividend that is regarded as equivalent to payment for money lent. Page 38 A deductible foreign equity distribution is a dividend where the foreign company paying the dividend (or another company owned by or on the same group as the foreign company which pays the dividend) is allowed a deduction for the payment of the dividend against foreign income tax. Subsection EX 20B(3)(b) deals with dividends paid by a New Zealand company to the CFC. A New Zealand dividend that is fully-imputed will not be included in the attributable CFC amount. A partly imputed dividend will only be attributed to the extent to which it is not imputed. Example A CFC receives $100 of dividends from a New Zealand company with $21 of imputation credits attached (that is, the dividend is half-imputed). $50 of this dividend will be treated as part of the attributable CFC amount. Note that although there is an exemption for dividends paid within a New Zealand wholly owned group (section CW 10), a dividend paid by a New Zealand company to a CFC that is in the same wholly owned group as the New Zealand company will still be attributable to the extent to which it is not imputed. Financial arrangement income and interest (subsections EX 20B(4) and EX 20B(12)) The definition of “attributable CFC amount” includes income from financial arrangements held by a CFC. Section EX 20B(4)(a) and (b) sets out the criteria when financial arrangement income is caught within the definition of “arrangement income”. Paragraph (a) includes a financial arrangement or short-term agreement for sale and purchase for which the CFC has made an election under section EW 8 (Election to treat certain excepted financial arrangements as financial arrangements) into the definition of “arrangement income”. However, income from a financial arrangement that is not a derivative instrument is not attributable if the financial arrangement is: • a loan provided by the CFC to an associated active CFC in the same jurisdiction (section EX 20B(12)(a)); or • an agreement for the sale or purchase of property or services or a hire purchase agreement that is entered in the ordinary course of a business by the CFC or for property or services produced or used in the CFC’s business (section EX 20B(12)(b)). Income from financial arrangements that are derivative instruments is attributable if the derivative instrument is held for the purposes of dealing in the derivative instrument, is not entered in the ordinary course of the CFC’s business or is a hedge instrument for attributable income or for a transaction that produces income that is attributable (section EX 20B(4)(b)). Under the financial arrangements rules, an instrument will give rise to either income or expenditure. If an arrangement gives rise to income, that income is included in a CFC’s attributable CFC amount, subject to the rules described above. Expenditure under a financial arrangement is dealt with separately, under the rules for calculating net attributable CFC income or loss in sections EX 20C to EX 20E. There is no “netting off” between financial arrangements. Thus, if a CFC holds one financial arrangement giving rise to income and another that gives rise Page 39 to, say, an equal amount of expenditure, income and expenditure from the two instruments cannot be directly offset against each other. Rather, income from the first arrangement must be included as appropriate under section EX 20B and expenditure under the second arrangement must brought in under sections EX 20C to EX 20E. Royalties (subsection EX 20B(5)) The general rule under the new international tax rules is that royalties (as defined in section CC 9 of the Income tax Act 2007) are included within the definition of “attributable CFC amount” unless they fall under one of four exceptions. The four exceptions ensure that when there are genuine commercial reasons for the intellectual property to be owned by a CFC, any royalties the CFC derives from that property will not be subject to attribution. The four exceptions are: 1. Third-party active royalties (subsection EX 20B(5)(a)) This refers to royalties received by a CFC from a third party where: • the CFC has created, developed, or added substantial value to the intellectual property; • the CFC is regularly engaged in the activity of creating, developing, or adding substantial value to the intellectual property; and • the property does not have a prior link to New Zealand. 2. Related-party active royalties (subsection EX 20B(b)) This refers to royalties received by a CFC from a related CFC where: • the CFC has created, developed, or added substantial value to the intellectual property; • the CFC is regularly engaged in the activity of creating, developing, or adding substantial value to the intellectual property; • the royalty is at an arm’s-length amount under transfer pricing rules; and • the property does not have a prior link to New Zealand. 3. Same jurisdiction active royalties (subsection EX 20B(5)(c)) This refers to royalties received by a CFC from a related CFC where: • the related CFC is within the same jurisdiction as the CFC; • the related CFC would pass the active business test; and • the property does not have a prior link to New Zealand. Page 40 4. Royalties from property owned by a New Zealand resident (subsection EX 20B(5)(d)) This refers to royalties received by a CFC from a third party where: • the intellectual property is owned by a New Zealand resident and is licensed to the CFC; and • it is licensed between the New Zealand owner and the CFC for an arm’s-length amount applying transfer pricing rules. Third-party active royalties (subsection EX 20B(5)(a)) Royalty payments received from a third party are not considered to be attributable if the CFC satisfies the criteria set out in section EX 20B(5)(a). The criteria are: • the CFC has created, developed, or added value to intellectual property; • the CFC is regularly engaged in the activity of creating, developing, or adding substantial value to the intellectual property; • the royalty is paid by a person who is not associated with the CFC; and • the intellectual property does not have a prior link to New Zealand. Example 1 CFC 1 operates a research facility in the United States. Its core business is to perform research on animal feed. In particular, it has been developing a special feed for sheep that would increase the quality of the wool the sheep produces. Through the research of its employees, CFC 1 discovered that a particular combination of grains results in a silkier texture to the wool produced by the sheep. It begins to license the formula to other companies that manufacture livestock feed. CFC 1 is not associated with any of the companies it receives royalties from. In this example, the royalties CFC 1 receives from the unrelated third party will be excluded from the definition of “attributable CFC amount” under the third-party active royalty exclusion. CFC 1 is regularly engaged in the creation and/or the development of intellectual property, the royalty is from intellectual property that is developed by CFC 1 and the property has no prior link to New Zealand. Example 2 Assume the same facts as above. CFC 1 is also engaged in buying ready-to-use formulas off its competitors and licenses them out to other companies also. In this case, the royalties received from the ready-to-use formulas will not be excluded from the definition of “attributable CFC amount”, because the royalties did not arise from intellectual property that CFC 1 had created, developed or added substantial value to. Related-party active royalty (subsection EX 20B(5)(b)) Royalty payments received from a related party are not considered to be attributable if the CFC meets the criteria set out in section EX 20B(5)(b): • the CFC has created, developed or added value to intellectual property; • the CFC is regularly engaged in that activity; Page 41 • the royalty is paid by a person who is not associated with the CFC; • the royalties are at an arm’s-length amount under transfer pricing rules; and • the intellectual property does not have a prior link to New Zealand. The criteria for this exclusion are the same as those in the third-party active royalty exclusion (section EX 20B(5)(a)), with the additional requirement that the royalty must be at an arm’s- length amount under transfer pricing rules (section EX 20B(5)(b)(iv)). Example CFC 1 is based in Ireland. CFC 1 has always been in the business of producing vegetarian products under the Veges Cool brand. It owns the intellectual property rights to the Veges Cool brand. In particular, Veges Cool is a well known brand of quality vegetarian sausages in Europe. CFC 1 was recently acquired by NZ Co. NZ Co has many other CFCs in Europe. To save costs, NZ Co decides it would be more efficient for its other CFCs in Europe to directly manufacture the Veges Cool sausages and distribute the product to the local market rather than manufacture Veges Cool brand sausages from Ireland and distribute them to the rest of Europe. To do this, CFC 2 in Belgium pays a royalty to CFC 1 for the use of the Veges Cool brand on the sausages it produces. The amount paid to CFC 1 is at an arm’s-length price. In this example, the royalty received by CFC 1 will be excluded from the definition of “attributable CFC amount”. CFC 1 is regularly engaged in creating, developing and adding substantial value to the Veges Cool brand, the brand has no prior link to New Zealand and the royalty is an arm’s-length amount. Same jurisdiction active royalties (subsection EX 20B(5)(c)) Royalty payments received from a related party are not attributable if it meets the criteria set out in section EX 20B(5)(c): • the related CFC is liable to tax in the same jurisdiction as the CFC; • the related CFC would pass the active business test; and • the property does not have a prior link to New Zealand. While this exclusion only applies to related parties, it is important to note that the requirements are different from the related-party active royalty exclusion under section EX 20B(5)(b). In particular, the CFC paying the royalty must pass the active business test, in the absence of applying this royalty exclusion (section EX 20B(5)(c)), the same jurisdiction rent exclusion (section EX 20B(7)(c)) and the same jurisdiction financial arrangement exclusion (section EX 20B(12)(a)). This issue of circularity will be discussed in more detail at the end of this section. Page 42 Example 1 CFC 1 is based in India. It holds a number of recipes for different condiments. None of the recipes it holds have a prior link to New Zealand. CFC 2, also based in India, licenses the recipe for ketchup off CFC 1 and manufactures it and distributes it for profit. CFC 3, also based in India, licenses the recipe for aioli from CFC 1 and manufactures it and distributes it for profit as well. Both CFC 2 and 3 are active CFCs, because both have less than 5 percent of attributable income, before the exclusions allowed under section EX 20B(5)(c), (7)(c) and (12)(a) are applied. CFC 1, 2 and 3 are all owned by the same New Zealand shareholder – NZ Co. All three CFCs are liable to tax in India. In this example, CFC 1 is merely a holding company. Any royalties it receives from CFC 2 and 3 will not be subject to attribution. Example 2 Assume the same facts as in example 1, except that CFC 1 pays interest to CFC 3 on a loan CFC 3 made to CFC 1. CFC 3 does not pass the active business test taking into account the interest it receives from CFC 1 for the loan. In this situation, the royalty CFC 1 receives from CFC 3 will not be excluded from attribution as CFC 3 is not an active CFC in the absence of the exclusion allowed under section EX 20B(12)(a). Regularly engaged in creating, developing or adding substantial value to intellectual property (subsection EX 20B(5)(a) and (b)) Central to the third-party active royalty and related-party active royalty exclusions is the requirement that the CFC be regularly engaged in creating, developing or adding substantial value to intellectual property. The requirement that the CFC be regularly engaged in creating and/or enhancing intellectual property is aimed at ensuring that there is a genuine commercial rationale for the intellectual property to have been developed by a CFC in that particular jurisdiction. The exclusions are not intended to apply to CFCs that create and/or enhance intellectual property on a one-off basis. Example 1 CFC 1 is a company based in the Netherlands. It has, for a number of years, owned research facilities in the Netherlands where it employs scientists, engineers and technicians who regularly perform experiments, tests and other technical activities that ultimately result in the creation or development of intellectual property that CFC 1 sells or licenses. CFC 1 often performs radical new research in fields where no current products are on the market. It will also often further develop intellectual property that it acquires from other companies. Through the research of its staff, CFC 1 develops a design for a new robotic milking machine and subsequently licenses the design to other companies. In this example, CFC 1 is a company that is regularly engaged in creating, developing, or adding substantial value to intellectual property. Example 2 CFC 1 is a new company that has been operating in the United Kingdom for just under a year. Since it was established, the company has undertaken further research on a technique to produce low-calorie ginger beer. CFC 1 acquired the initial technique from another company in the United Kingdom. The new technique developed by CFC 1 proves to be extremely successful as it enhances the initial technique by substantially improving the taste of the ginger beer. CFC 1 is now able to produce low-calorie ginger beer with the flavour of a full-calorie ginger beer. CFC 1 begins to license the technique to other companies. To date, CFC 1 has not created, produced or added substantial value to any other intellectual property. Page 43 In this example, while CFC 1 has only produced the single technique in making low-calorie ginger beer that retains the taste of full-calorie ginger beer, it is still considered to have been regularly engaged in creating, developing or adding substantial value to intellectual property. The fact that CFC 1 had been engaged in the research and development of this technique since the establishment of the company and continues to engage in research means it satisfies the regularly engaged requirement. CFC 1 added substantial value to the initial technique by improving the taste of the ginger beer. Although CFC 1 did not develop the initial technique, it improved it by substantially improving the taste of the ginger beer it produced. Example 3 CFC 1 has been operating in China for the last 10 years. Its operations have mainly been manufacturing rubber soles for shoes. It employs a team of engineers to look after the machinery in its factories. By chance, one of the engineers discovers a new method of producing rubber soles which are 10 times more durable than regular soles. CFC 1 patents this method and begins receiving royalties from other companies that use this new method of rubber sole production. In this example, CFC 1 has not satisfied the criteria that it is regularly engaged in the creation, development or adding substantial value to intellectual property. In particular, the creation or development of intellectual property is not part of the core day-to-day business of CFC 1. Property linked to New Zealand (subsection EX 20B(13), (14) and (15)) Of the four royalty exclusions, three of them require that the intellectual property generating the royalty income not be linked to New Zealand. The reason for this is that intellectual property is highly mobile and can be easily transferred and held offshore, royalties relating to intellectual property that has a link to New Zealand are therefore attributable. However, it is recognised that there may be legitimate commercial reasons for intellectual property to be held offshore, therefore there is a mechanism in the legislation to allow the intellectual property to break its link to New Zealand. Section EX 20B(14) sets out the situations when the intellectual property will create a link with New Zealand. It includes situations that are relatively straightforward. Subsection EX 20B(15) sets out the circumstances where the intellectual property’s link to New Zealand is broken. In particular, this is when the intellectual property is sold offshore to an unrelated third party that is not a New Zealand CFC. Note that the intellectual property can re-establish its link to New Zealand, if at any time, it meets any one of the situations set out in subsection (14). Example 1 CFC 1 owns the secret formula that allows normal meat cells to be grown into artificial meat suitable for consumption. Although CFC 1 is based in the Cayman Islands, it employs New Zealand scientists and engineers who perform all their research in Otago. As such, the development of the secret formula was all done in New Zealand by CFC 1’s New Zealand-based employees. In this example, the secret formula for growing artificial meat will have a link to New Zealand by virtue of having been created and developed in New Zealand. Example 2 The news of this artificial meat is very well received and generates much international interest. As a result, multiple offers to buy the secret formula are made to CFC 1. In the end, CFC 1 decides to sell the formula to a German company. The German company is not associated with CFC 1 in any way, and it is not a New Zealand CFC. At this point, the secret formula’s link to New Zealand has been broken as provided for in section EX 20B(15). If the secret formula is subsequently owned by a CFC, there will be no prior link to New Zealand. Page 44 Example 3 The German company does further testing and discovers that there is little consumer interest in the artificial meat. In particular, the taste of the meat does not guarantee commercial success. As a result, the German company decides to sell the formula to try and recuperate some of its losses. The German company eventually sells the formula to an Austrian company. The Austrian company discover there is a big market in New Zealand for the artificial meat as high-quality dog food. The Austrian company subsequently sets up a branch in New Zealand where it does further market testing of their product, with a view to selling the dog food in New Zealand first, then to the rest of the world. At this point, the secret formula will have re-established its link to New Zealand by virtue of the property being used for the purposes of business carried on in New Zealand by virtue of the property being further developed in New Zealand. If the formula is later sold again to a New Zealand CFC, the New Zealand CFC will not be able to access any of the four royalty exclusions. Royalties from property owned by a New Zealand resident (subsection EX 20B(5)(d)) Royalty payments received from a third party on property that is owned by a New Zealand resident are not attributable if the payments meet the criteria in section EX 20B(5)(d): • the intellectual property is owned by a New Zealand resident and licensed to the CFC; and • it is licensed between the New Zealand owner and the CFC for an arm’s-length amount applying transfer pricing rules. Note that if the property is owned by a New Zealand resident that is treated as non-resident under a double tax agreement, that person will not meet the residence requirement of this exclusion (section EX 20B(5)(d)(ii)). This exclusion also contemplates the situation where an upper-tier CFC may sublicense the property to a lower-tier CFC which then licenses it to a third party (section EX 20B(5)(d)(i)). Example 1 NZ Co owns the intellectual property rights on a special training programme for ballet dancers. Its programme is called “The Extreme Ballerina”. The programme was extremely popular in New Zealand and NZ Co decides to expand to the international market. To do this, NZ Co would license its programme to its CFCs. CFC 1 is based in the Netherlands. It pays NZ Co a royalty for the use of the programme, and it subsequently sublicenses it to dance studios in the Netherlands. The royalty CFC 1 pays to NZ Co is an arm’s-length amount. The dance studios that use “The Extreme Ballerina” are not associated with CFC 1. In this example, the royalties CFC 1 receives from the dance studios will be excluded from attribution. Example 2 Assume the same facts as in example 1. “The Extreme Ballerina” proves to be extremely successful in the Netherlands also. NZ Co now wants to expand into the Asian market. It sets up CFC 2 in Singapore, but decides to let CFC 2 sublicense “The Extreme Ballerina” from CFC 1 in the Netherlands. Like CFC 1, CFC 2 will license the programme to its local Singaporean dance studios. In this example, the royalty received by CFC 2 from the dance studios will be excluded from attribution, as will the royalty it pays to CFC 1. The royalty paid to CFC 1 will only be excluded if CFC 2 had received the royalty from a non-associated third party. In this example, the non-associated third party would be Singaporean dance studios. Page 45 Rents (subsections EX 20B(3)(e), EX 20B(6) and EX 20B(7)) The general rule is that rent earned by a CFC will be treated as attributable income. Section EX 20B(6) sets out the types of rental payment that are subject to attribution. The following rents are attributable: • a lease or sublease of land; • a lease or sublease of personal property; • a licence to use intangible property; and • a hire or bailment. However, it is recognised that rent is often associated with running an active business. For example, a CFC may be in the business of letting or it may hold property used by related CFCs for the purposes of running an active business and receive rental income from those CFCs. For that reason, subsections EX 20B(7)(a) and (b) exclude rent from third parties from attribution if it is derived from a lease of real or personal property in the same jurisdiction as the CFC. Furthermore, rent received by a CFC from a related CFC is not attributable when the related CFC would pass the active business test, as long as both CFCs are liable to tax in the same jurisdiction (section EX 20B(7)(c)). Example 1 CFC 1 operates a car rental business in Bermuda where it leases vehicles to tourists. CFC 1 is liable to pay income tax on the income it derived in Bermuda. In this example, the rental income CFC 1 derives from its car rental business will be excluded from attribution. Example 2 CFC 1 is a holding company for CFC 2 and CFC 3. All three CFCs are based in the Netherlands and are all liable to income tax there. CFC 2 and CFC 3 both hire equipment off CFC 1 for its operations. CFC 2 passes the active business test because less than 5 percent of its income is subject to attribution, before the exclusions allowed under section EX 20B(5)(c), (7)(c) and (12)(a) are applied. The rental payment received from CFC 2 will be excluded attribution for CFC 1 under subsection EX 20B(7)(c). CFC 3 does not pass the active business test, because more than 5 percent of its income is subject to attribution. For that reason, the rental income CFC 1 receives from CFC 3 will be subject to attribution. Section EX 20B(7)(d) (Payment under hire purchase agreements and finance leases) and payments that fall within the definition of “royalty” under section CC 9 of the Income Tax Act 2007 are not considered as rent under the definition of “attributable CFC amount”, but may be – and are likely to be in some cases – attributable under other provisions. For example, income from finance leases is attributable as arrangement income and payments that fall within the definition of “royalty” will be attributed under the royalty provision. Page 46 In the case of licence fees received for the use of intangible property, the royalty provisions will apply to these payments, as the royalty exclusions in subsection EX 20B(5) will apply (see subsection EX 20B(7)(g)). In short, the royalty exclusions are still applicable to rents from a licence to use intangible property, even though these payments fall outside the scope of the definition of “royalty”. Example CFC 1 is based in Hong Kong and is in the business of developing software. Once a programme has been developed and the relevant testing done, CFC 1 then licenses its programme to its clients. Its clients are able to use the programmes in an unaltered state without the ability to exploit the programme – for example, clients are not allowed to make and sell copies of the programme. This is a classic example of “shrink-wrap software”. Licence fees for the use of “shrink-wrap software” do not fall within the definition of “royalty” under section CC 9 of the Income Tax Act 2009. However, subsection EX 20B(7)(g) extends the royalty exclusions in subsection EX 20B(5) to payments under a licence to use intangible property which does not fall within the definition of “royalty” under section CC 9. Therefore CFC 1 will be able to exclude the licence payments from attribution if it meets the requirements of any one of the royalty exclusions (see subsection EX 20B(5)). In this example, it would appear that the third party active royalties exclusion (subsection EX 20B(5)(a)) will be the most relevant exclusion. Provided the licence payments meet all of the requirements of subsection EX 20B(5)(c), CFC 1 will be able to exclude those payments from attribution. Other attributable CFC amounts The definition of “attributable CFC amount” includes types of income other than dividends, interest, royalties and rents. These types of income relate to: • offshore insurance businesses; • life insurance policies; • personal services; and • the disposal of revenue account property. Income from offshore insurance business (subsection EX 20B(3)(f)) Section EX 20B(3)(f) generally treats the premium of an insurance contract or a reinsurance contract as attributable income. However, when this type of income forms the core part of a CFC’s insurance business, that CFC can apply for a Commissioner’s determination. A process has been established (see Determination of active insurance active business) to enable active insurance CFCs to be considered to have passed the active business test (and be treated as a non- attributing active CFC). This is a temporary measure until special rules are considered for extending the active income exemption to financial institutions. Page 47 Example CFC 1 is based in the Cayman Islands and only derives income from the premiums it receives from insurance contracts. In this example, the income derived from insurance contracts by CFC 1 will be attributable unless CFC 1 applies for a Commissioner’s determination and the Commissioner subsequently considers CFC 1 to have passed the active business test. In the absence of a Commissioner’s determination, the premiums received from the insurance contracts will be considered as attributable income. Income from life insurance policies (subsections EX 20B(3)(g) and EX 20B(8)) Income from life insurance policies is generally treated as attributable under section EX 20B(3)(g). Subsections EX 20B(8)(a) to (c) sets out the circumstances when the income from life insurance policies is considered an attributable CFC amount. Accordingly, income a CFC derives from holding a life insurance policy is treated as attributable income (subsections EX 20B(8)(a) and (b)). Additionally, income from a disposal of the life insurance policy is also attributable to the extent that these policies are on revenue account (section EX 20B(8)(c)). However, section EX 20B(8) provides that income from life insurance policies that are FIF interests is not subject to attribution under the CFC rules, as that income is already attributed under the FIF rules. Net gains from the disposal of such interests will continue to be attributable where the net gain is not taxable under the FIF rules. Income from personal services (subsections EX 20B(3)(h), EX 20B(9) and GB 27(3)(e)) Income from personal services is treated as attributable if it meets the criteria set out in subsection EX 20B(9). However, there is an important distinction between income from personal services and other forms of attributable income because this income will always be subject to attribution irrespective of whether the CFC passes the active business test. Another way to look at this is that a non-attributing active CFC will still be required to attribute any personal services income it receives even if it passes the active business test – because less than 5 percent of its total income is income that is subject to attribution. Furthermore, such income will be disregarded for the purposes of applying the active business test (see subsections EX 21(D)(7) and EX 21E(12)(c)). In many ways the criteria set out in subsection EX 20B(9) is an extension of the domestic attribution rule for income from personal services (see sections GB 27 to 29). The personal services income will be considered as attributable income if it meets all of the following criteria: • The “working person” is a New Zealand resident. • The personal services are not essential support for a product supplied by the CFC. • The individual and the CFC are associated persons under section YB 3 (Company and non- corporate 25 percent interest holder) or the individual is a relative of a person associated with the CFC under section YB 3 at the time the services are performed. Page 48 • At least 80 percent of the CFC’s gross income from personal services during the tax year relates to services personally performed by the individual (or a relative of the individual). • Substantial business assets are not a necessary part of the business structure that is used to derive the income from personal services. (That is, to derive the income, the CFC uses depreciable property that, at the end of the accounting period, has a total cost of more than either $75,000 or 25 percent or more of the CFC’s total assessable income from services performed in that period.) Note that section EX 20B(9)(b) provides that when the services personally performed by the individual are essential support for a product supplied by the associated entity, they are not subject to attribution. This is because the provision is not intended to apply to income earned from services that are provided in relation to the sale of goods by a CFC. Therefore income from personal services is not subject to attribution if the services are essential support for a product supplied by the CFC. Another important point to note about the personal services rule under the CFC rules is that if the personal services income is attributed under those rules, the domestic attribution rule will be “switched off” (subsection GB 27(3)(e)). This will ensure that the personal services income will only be attributed once to the “working person”. Example Joe is a graphic designer based in New Zealand. Joe’s wife Jill is the sole shareholder of Jill Co – a CFC in the Bahamas. Jill Co derives most of its income from the services Joe provides as a graphic designer, and some royalty income from several patents it holds. Joe is the only graphic designer employed by Jill Co. In this example, the income derived by Jill Co from Joe’s services as a graphic designer will be subject to attribution as the income satisfies the requirements of subsection EX 20B(9) – in particular, that Joe is a New Zealand resident, the personal services are not essential support for a product supplied by Jill Co, Joe and Jill Co are associated under section YB 3, all of Jill Co’s income from personal services is produced by Joe and substantial business assets are not a necessary part of the business structure that is used to derive the income from personal services. In short, the personal services income derived by Jill Co will be attributable to Joe and subject to New Zealand tax. However, this income will only be subject to attribution once, as the domestic personal services rule is effectively “switched off” if that income is subject to attribution under the CFC rules (see subsection GB 27(3)(e)). The personal services income derived by Jill Co will be ignored for the purposes of applying the active business test to Jill Co. In this example, the only other income derived by Jill Co is the royalties Jill Co receives from the patents it holds. Depending on whether the royalty income meets any of the exclusions under subsection EX 20B(5), that income may be exempt from attribution – in that Jill Co has less than 5 percent of attributable income, disregarding the personal services income that is already subject to attribution. Income from the sale of shares (subsections EX 20B(3)(i) and EX 20B(10)) Section EX 20B(3)(i) defines income from the sale of shares that are on revenue account as attributable CFC income while section EX 20B(10) sets out the exceptions to this. Revenue account gains are disregarded when a CFC sells an interest in a FIF whose income is calculated using either the comparative value, deemed rate of return, fair dividend rate or the cost method. This is consistent with the way in which these gains would be treated if held directly by a New Zealand company. Page 49 Income from the disposal of share options (subsection EX 20B(3)(j)) Section EX 20B(3)(j) provides that income from the disposal of share options held on revenue account is treated as attributable income. This is consistent with the treatment of income from the disposal of shares held on revenue account, as discussed above. Income from the disposal of revenue account property (subsection EX 20B(3)(k)) Gains from the disposal of revenue account property held by a CFC that is not used in an offshore active business will be treated as attributable income (section EX 20B(3)(k)). However, this rule does not apply to income from the disposal of revenue account property if the property is a share, financial arrangement or life insurance policy, as these items are dealt with specifically in other parts of the definition of attributable CFC amount. Base company income (subsection EX 20B(3)(l)) Under subsection EX 20B(3)(l), income derived by a CFC for a service that is wholly or partly performed in New Zealand is defined as attributable income of the CFC. International telecommunications services are excluded from the base company income rule. Income derived from telecommunication services are dealt with in another subsection. Example Parent Co is based in New Zealand and has a subsidiary in the Cayman Islands (CFC 1). CFC 1 derives its income from providing consulting services all over the world, but with a large proportion of the services provided to New Zealand residents. The majority of the services are therefore performed in New Zealand. Subsection EX 20B(3)(l) will treat the income CFC 1 derives from the consulting services that are performed in New Zealand as attributable income. However, any other income that is derived from the consulting service which is performed outside of New Zealand will not fall within the definition of attributable CFC amount. Income from telecommunications services (subsections EX 20B(3)(m) to (n) and EX 20B(11)) Certain income from telecommunications services is attributable income. Income from the use of a telecommunications asset outside any country (subsection EX 20B(3)(m)) Income derived from the use of a telecommunications asset that is wholly or partly located outside any country is attributable income. In the event that only part of the asset is located outside any country, apportionment will be required. This rule only applies if the asset is owned by the CFC or another CFC that is associated with the CFC. Page 50 Assets that are subject to this subsection include (but are not limited to) telecommunications cables, satellites, and associated plant, equipment and facilities. The rule does not apply to a cellphone handset or transmitting equipment located on board a ship or aircraft. The types of income that would be derived from the use of a telecommunications asset include (but are not limited to) income from the transmission of telecommunications data using the asset; the lease of the asset; and the licence or sale of rights – whether direct or indirect – to use the asset. Income when telecommunications services performed in New Zealand (subsections EX 20B(3)(n) and EX 20B(11)) Consistent with “base company income”, income as a result of providing a telecommunications service is generally taxable to the extent the service is physically performed in New Zealand (paragraph EX 20B(3)(n)). However, an exception is made when the service is the transmission, emission or reception of information between New Zealand and the CFC’s country of residence (subsection EX 20B(11)). In this instance, there is a decreased likelihood that the CFC has been established to escape New Zealand tax, because such a service typically must be partly performed in both locations. There also appears to be a greater-than-normal degree of practical difficulty in calculating the income attributable to services performed in New Zealand. The exception applies only if two requirements are met. The first requirement is that there be a close connection between the CFC and a network operator. The term “network operator” is defined in the Telecommunications (Interception Capability) Act 2004. A sufficiently close connection exists if: • the CFC is a network operator; or • a person who is a network operator holds a 50 percent or greater income interest in the CFC; or • a person who has a 50 percent or greater voting interest in a network operator also holds a 50 percent or greater income interest in the CFC. The second requirement is that the service is not performed using equipment or staff of the CFC, or of an associated CFC, that is physically located in New Zealand. The expectation is that the New Zealand owner of a telecommunications CFC would use its own equipment and staff at the New Zealand end of the connection, rather than the CFC’s. The second requirement reduces the incentive to substitute the CFC’s staff or equipment merely to escape the tax that the New Zealand owner would ordinarily pay on these New Zealand operations. The exception in subsection EX 20B(11) is only an exception to paragraph EX 20B(3)(n). For example, if paragraph EX 20B(3)(m) applies to an amount of income to which subsection EX 20B(11) also applies, the income is attributable. Page 51 Exclusions for rent, royalties and interest received from an associated CFC in the same jurisdiction (subsections EX 20B(5)(c), EX 20B(7)(c) and EX 20B(12)(a)) As noted in the sections above, certain rent, royalties and financial arrangement income from associated active CFCs in the same jurisdiction as the CFC is excluded from attribution (see subsections EX 20B(5)(c), (7)(c) and (12)(a)). There is a possibility that the status of the associated CFC cannot be determined, because the associated CFC itself needs to apply the same exclusions. Example CFC A and CFC B are 100 percent commonly owned and are both resident in the same jurisdiction. When it applies the active business test, CFC A has a numerator of $49,990 and a denominator of $1 million, but only if it can exclude royalties of $50,000 received from CFC B. CFC B has a numerator of $99,980 and a denominator of $2 million, but only if it can exclude interest of $100,000 received from CFC A. CFC A can only exclude the royalties if CFC B is active, and CFC B can only exclude the interest if CFC A is active, but neither CFC is active until it applies the exclusion. As a solution to this circularity problem, when a CFC (CFC A) determines the status of an associated CFC (CFC B), it will do so without applying any of the exclusions to CFC B. That is, for this purpose only, CFC B’s status is to be determined assuming that any rent, royalties or interest it receives from an associated CFC in the same jurisdiction is subject to attribution. Example Continuing from the example above, CFC A would determine that CFC B’s numerator was $199,980 and its denominator was $2,100,000, meaning that CFC B would not be active for this purpose. CFC A would then have to recognise the $50,000 of royalties as attributable income. Similarly, CFC B would be required to recognise the $100,000 of interest as attributable income. Mechanics of attribution Sections CQ 2, DN 2, EX 18A, EX 20C to EX 20E and EX 21 of the Income Tax Act 2007 There is a signposting provision in section EX 18A showing the scheme for finding a person’s attributed CFC income or loss under the new rules. Sections CQ 2 and DN 2 provide that a person has attributed CFC income or loss if the person has an income interest of 10 percent or more in a CFC that has net attributable CFC income or loss and is not a non-attributing active CFC or a non-attributing Australian CFC. Special rules apply to income from personal services. Page 52 The rules for calculating net attributable CFC income or loss for a CFC are set out in sections EX 20C to EX 20E and section EX 21 as follows: • Section EX 20C provides that net attributable CFC income or loss is to be calculated using a prescribed formula and lays down the main rules concerning deductibility of expenditure. • Sections EX 20D and EX 20E make provision regarding the deductibility of interest expenditure for excessively debt-funded CFCs. • Section EX 21 applies the Act (subject to certain modifications) for specified purposes as though a CFC were a New Zealand resident. Those specified purposes include the calculation of net attributable CFC income or loss. Key features Net attributable CFC income or loss is the income or loss of a CFC that is attributed to New Zealand residents with an income interest of 10 percent or more. Non-attributing active CFCs and non-attributing Australian CFCs are not subject to attribution other than for any income or loss derived from personal services. The starting point for calculating net attributable CFC income or loss for a CFC is to determine the attributable CFC amount in accordance with section EX 20B. This amount is then reduced to reflect expenditure incurred by the CFC, giving a net figure. As a general rule, deductions for expenditure incurred other than under a financial arrangement will be allowed if the expenditure is incurred by the CFC in deriving an attributable CFC amount. Different rules apply to expenditure incurred by a CFC under financial arrangements because of the difficulties associated with matching debt to particular income streams. Of expenditure (typically, interest) incurred under financial arrangements that provide funds to the CFC, only a fraction is deductible. The fraction is based on the value of the attributable assets of the CFC as a proportion of its total assets. If a CFC is excessively debt-funded, the fraction is calculated by reference to the assets of all the interest holder’s CFCs. The same rule applies to certain dividends that are deductible for the purposes of calculating net attributable CFC income or loss, namely distributions relating to fixed-rate foreign equity and deductible foreign equity distributions made by the CFC to New Zealand-resident companies or to other CFCs. The rules provide flexibility for intra-group financing arrangements, recognising that multinationals may operate financing subsidiaries to obtain debt finance on behalf of the group and then on-lend the funds to operating subsidiaries. An adjustment for on-lending may be made when calculating the net attributable CFC income or loss of a CFC. The effect of the adjustment is to allow a full deduction for expenditure incurred under financial arrangements that provide funds to the CFC and for any deductible dividends to the extent the funds are on-lent to associated CFCs. A similar adjustment may be made when determining whether a CFC is excessively debt-funded. Expenditure incurred under financial arrangements such as derivative instruments that do not provide funds to the CFC is either deductible or non-deductible according to whether any income derived from the arrangement would be included in the CFC’s attributable CFC amount. Page 53 Detailed analysis When attributed CFC income or loss arises Section CQ 2 sets out when a person has attributed CFC income from a foreign company. A number of criteria must be satisfied, including that the foreign company is a CFC with net attributable CFC income under section EX 20C (subsection (2)(f)(i)). Section DN 2 makes equivalent provision in relation to attributed CFC loss. In general, a person does not have attributed CFC income or loss from a CFC that is a non- attributing active CFC or a non-attributing Australian CFC (section CQ 2(1)(h) and (i) and section DN 2(h) and (i)). Income from personal services Sections CQ 2(2B) and DN 2(2) make special provision for income or loss derived by a CFC from personal services under section EX 20B(3)(h). This income is always subject to attribution: under sections CQ 2 and DN 2 if the CFC is a non-attributing active CFC or a non-attributing Australian CFC; otherwise, under section EX 20B(3)(h) and (9). In view of this, income from personal services may be disregarded for the purposes of determining whether a CFC is a non- attributing active CFC (section EX 21D(7)(a)). Where such income is attributed under the CFC rules, the equivalent attribution rule in subpart GB does not apply (section GB 27(3)(e)). Net attributable CFC income or loss Net attributable CFC income or loss is calculated under sections EX 20C to EX 20E and provides the basis for attribution to resident shareholders, much as branch equivalent income did previously. Net attributable CFC income or loss is the CFC’s attributable CFC amount, determined under section EX 20B, less the CFC’s allowable expenditure. The relevant formula is found in section EX 20C(2) and refers to two categories of allowable expenditure – limited funding costs and other deductions. Limited funding costs The item, limited funding costs, is an adjusted amount, based on a CFC’s funding costs as defined in section EX 20C(6)(a). Limited funding costs are not fully deductible under the formula in section EX 20C(2); deductions are restricted by applying the fraction found under section EX 20C(8). Funding costs comprise expenditure incurred under financial arrangements that provide funds to the CFC and distributions relating to fixed-rate foreign equity and deductible foreign equity distributions made by the CFC to New Zealand-resident companies or to other CFCs. Page 54 When determining limited funding costs from funding costs, an adjustment may be made under section EX 20C(5). The adjustment is based on the value of funds on-lent by the CFC to associated CFCs (group funding) as a proportion of the CFC’s own funding. Where funding costs exceed limited funding costs, the difference is allowed as other deductions (section EX 20D(9)(b)). The significance of this re-characterisation is that, under the formula in section EX 20C(2), other deductions are allowed in full rather than being restricted through the application of a fraction. The effect of this adjustment is that, if a CFC borrows and then on-lends funds to an associated CFC, it is allowed a full deduction for its own interest expenditure on those funds. Thus, if a quarter of a CFC’s funding is on-lent to associated CFCs, three-quarters of its funding costs will be included as limited funding costs subject to restriction, with the remainder being fully deductible. The adjustment is arithmetical and does not allow for borrowed funds to be matched to amounts on-lent. Other deductions The item, “other deductions”, is defined in section EX 20C(9). As noted earlier, other deductions are allowed in full rather than being restricted through the application of a fraction. Paragraph (a) of section EX 20C(9) deals with deductions not relating to financial arrangements and shares. This expenditure is deductible if it is (i) incurred for the purpose of deriving an attributable CFC amount and (ii) not incurred for the purpose of deriving an amount that is not an attributable CFC amount. If an item of expenditure relates to both attributable and non- attributable amounts, the combined effect of subparagraphs (i) and (ii) is to require apportionment of that expenditure. Paragraph (b) deals with any funding costs excluded from limited funding costs by virtue of the on-lending adjustment described earlier. Paragraph (c) deals with deductions relating to financial arrangements that do not provide funds to the CFC. Deductions are allowed only if they relate to an arrangement referred to in section EX 20B(4), namely one that would produce an attributable CFC amount if it produced a net gain rather than a net loss. Fraction Section EX 20C(8) defines the item “fraction” that is applied under the formula in section EX 20C(2) to restrict deductions for limited funding costs. Section EX 20C(10) to (12) and sections EX 20D and EX 20E are also relevant. Typically, the fraction is based on the proportion, by value, of the CFC’s assets that produce an attributable CFC amount (section EX 20C(10) and (11)). Thus, a CFC that uses one-third of its assets to earn attributable CFC amounts will be able to set one-third of its limited funding costs against those amounts when calculating its net attributable CFC income or loss. If an asset is used to derive both attributable and non-attributable amounts, its value will need to be apportioned. Asset values are adjusted to reflect any adjustment for on-lending under section EX 20C(5). Page 55 As a backstop against structures that concentrate debt in CFCs with mainly attributable assets in order to maximise allowable deductions, section EX 20C(8)(b) caps the fraction for a CFC that is excessively debt-funded at the amount calculated under section EX 20D. This cap is determined by reference to the assets of all the interest holder’s CFCs (section EX 20D(9) to (13)). A CFC is considered to be excessively debt-funded if it has a debt-asset ratio, determined under section EX 20D(4), of more than 0.75 and also has a relative debt-asset ratio, determined under section EX 20E, of more than 1.10. Detailed calculation rules Section EX 21 sets out detailed calculation rules which apply for the purposes specified in subsection (1) – calculating the attributable CFC amount under section EX 20B, calculating net attributable CFC income or loss under section EX 20C, and determining under section EX 21D whether a CFC is a non-attributing active CFC. Subsection (2) provides that, for those purposes, the rules in the Act are applied as if the CFC were always a New Zealand resident, subject to the modifications set out in the rest of the section. Interest allocation rules Subpart FE of the Income Tax Act 2007 Subpart FE has been amended to apply the interest allocation rules to New Zealand residents with interests in CFCs. These rules are designed to prevent excessive interest deductions being allocated against the New Zealand tax base. Key features Interest allocation rules have been extended to outbound entities: New Zealand residents with an income interest in a CFC. The existing safe harbours apply. Interest deductions are not restricted unless the New Zealand group debt percentage is more than 75 percent (and, for a company or a trustee, is also more than 110 percent of the worldwide group debt percentage). An outbound entity will not typically be required to apportion interest expenditure unless New Zealand group assets are less than 90 percent of the assets of the worldwide group and the total interest deductions of the New Zealand group are more than $250,000. In addition, an adjustment mechanism has been introduced for outbound entities with finance costs of less than $2 million. This eliminates apportionment for outbound entities with finance costs of up to $1 million and provides tapered relief for those with finance costs between $1 million and $2 million. Various changes have been made to the definitions of “debt” and “assets” in subpart FE. Fixed- rate foreign equity and fixed-rate shares held by New Zealand residents are now included when determining total group debt for the New Zealand group. Equity investments in CFCs are no longer included within the total group assets of the New Zealand group. The rules for measuring the debt of the worldwide group have been aligned with those for measuring the debt of the New Zealand group. Page 56 Detailed analysis Application of rules to outbound entities Previously, the interest allocation rules only applied to New Zealand taxpayers controlled by a single non-resident. Subpart FE has been amended so that the rules also apply to outbound entities – New Zealand-resident companies, individuals and trustees with an income interest in a CFC (sections FE 1(1)(a)(i) and FE 2(1)(e) to (f)). The safe harbours set out in section FE 5 apply to outbound entities as well as to entities controlled by non-residents. Thus, an outbound entity will not be subject to restriction of its interest deductions under subpart FE unless it has a New Zealand group debt percentage that is more than 75 percent (and, for a company or a trustee, is also more than 110 percent of the worldwide group debt percentage). Additional carve-outs apply to outbound entities by virtue of section FE 5(1B). There is an exemption from the requirement to apportion interest expenditure if: • the value of New Zealand group assets is 90 percent or more of the value of the assets of the worldwide group; or • total interest deductions of the New Zealand group are not more than $250,000 and the group does not include an entity with an income interest in a CFC that derives rent from land in the country or territory in which the CFC is resident. Apportionment of interest Section FE 6 contains the formula for apportioning interest for an excess debt entity. The effect of the formula, when it applies, is to produce an additional amount of income for the entity. As well as interest, the formula includes dividends paid in relation to fixed-rate foreign equity or fixed-rate shares (subsections (2) and (3)(ab)). An adjustment mechanism has been introduced for outbound entities with finance costs of less than $2 million (subsections (2) and (3)(ac)). The effect of the adjustment is to eliminate apportionment under this section for outbound entities with finance costs of up to $1 million. For outbound entities with finance costs of between $1 million and $2 million, tapered relief is available, gradually reducing as costs increase towards the $2 million cut-off point. Determination of New Zealand group For an outbound entity that is a company (an excess debt outbound company), the New Zealand group is determined by reference to the New Zealand parent (section FE 12(4)). The group comprises those companies for which control can be traced from the parent (section FE 28). The meaning of “control” for these purposes is determined under section FE 27. The New Zealand parent is identified under section FE 26 by tracing ownership interests up the chain of companies on a tier-by-tier basis until no New Zealand-resident company has an ownership interest of 50 percent or more in the last company in the chain (subsection (4B)). Page 57 For an outbound entity that is an individual or a trustee, the New Zealand group is determined under section FE 3. It includes all associated persons who are resident or have a fixed establishment in New Zealand or who derive New Zealand-sourced income that is not relieved under a double tax agreement. Excess debt outbound companies, and those within the New Zealand group of such companies, are not included. The associated persons rules prevent the use of non-arm’s-length arrangements to undermine the intent of the income tax legislation. In the context of the interest allocation rules, the application of these rules is intended to stop the use of close associates to bring excessive levels of debt within the New Zealand tax base, contrary to the policy intent. The rules governing when a person is associated with an individual or a trustee are set out in sections YB 1 to YB 16. Those provisions are discussed in detail elsewhere in this report. Section FE 29 provides that companies or groups owned by the same natural person or trustee are to form a single New Zealand group. Determination of worldwide group It may also be necessary to determine the worldwide group of a company or a trustee that is an outbound entity, for the purposes of calculating the worldwide group debt percentage. For a company, the worldwide group is determined under sections FE 31B and FE 32 and includes the company, its New Zealand group, and its worldwide GAAP group (being all non-residents required to be included with the company in consolidated financial statements under generally accepted accounting practice). For a trustee, the worldwide group is determined under section FE 3 and includes the trustee, the trustee’s New Zealand group, and all CFCs in which either the trustee or another member of the New Zealand group has an income interest. Measurement rules The general measurement rules set out in subpart FE apply to outbound entities for the purposes of calculating total group debt and total group assets of the New Zealand and worldwide groups. In particular, the New Zealand group debt percentage can be measured on various dates (section FE 8). Various bases for the valuation of total group assets may also be used (section FE 16), and the on-lending concession under section FE 13 applies to arm’s-length debt provided by an outbound entity to its CFCs. Various amendments have been made to the definitions of debt and assets in subpart FE. In particular: • Fixed-rate foreign equity and fixed-rate shares held by New Zealand residents are now included when determining total group debt for the New Zealand group under section FE 15. • Equity investments in CFCs are now excluded when determining total group assets for the New Zealand group under section FE 16. • The rules in section FE 18 for measuring the debt of the worldwide group have been aligned with those for measuring New Zealand group debt. Accordingly, non-interest bearing liabilities and liabilities that do not provide funds are no longer treated as debt for the worldwide group, even if they are included as debt under generally accepted accounting practice. Page 58 Foreign dividend exemption Sections CW 9 and HA 8B of the Income Tax Act 2007 Key features Section CW 9 provides that a dividend from a foreign company is treated as exempt income if derived by a company resident in New Zealand. However, there are several exceptions to this general rule, including: • dividends from a less than 10 percent interest in a FIF described in sections EX 31, EX 32, EX 36, EX 37, EX 37B or EX 39. These comprise shares in ASX-listed Australian companies, Australian unit trusts with adequate turnover or distributions, certain venture capital investments into New Zealand companies that have since migrated to a grey list country, and shares in Guinness Peat Group plc; • dividends from fixed-rate foreign equity; and • dividends from deductible foreign equity. The foreign dividend is subject to income tax in these instances. Foreign dividends that are received by non-companies (such as individuals or trustees of a trust) remain subject to income tax. However it should be noted that if a foreign dividend is received by a company that is acting in its capacity as a trustee of a trust, that foreign dividend will be subject to income tax. Qualifying companies are not be permitted to hold attributing interests in CFCs or non-portfolio FIFs. If a qualifying company holds such interests in any income year beginning on or after 1 July 2009, it will cease to be a qualifying company. Detailed analysis If a foreign company pays a dividend to a company that is resident in New Zealand that dividend will in most cases be treated as exempt income of the New Zealand company under section CW 9. Example A CFC (or FIF) pays an ordinary dividend to a New Zealand company. $85,000 Dividend Share CFC NZ Co Tax on dividend = $0 (Exempt under section CW 9) After-tax return = $85,000 Passive income $50,000 Active income $50,000 Net attributable CFC income = $50,000 NZ tax on CFC income =$15,000 Page 59 However, the foreign dividend exemption in section CW 9 only applies to companies. Other New Zealand taxpayers are taxable on their foreign dividends. Some types of foreign dividend are also excluded from the exemption and are described below. New Zealand taxpayers to which the foreign dividend exemption does not apply Foreign dividends that are received by a portfolio tax rate entity will be subject to income tax as subsection CW 9(3) excludes these companies from the exemption. Foreign dividends that are received by non-companies (such as individuals or trustees of a trust) are also subject to income tax. However, it should be noted that if a foreign dividend is received by a company that is acting in its capacity as a trustee of a trust, that foreign dividend will be subject to income tax. Branch equivalent tax accounts have been retained for non-companies (sections OE 17 to OE 22) to relieve any double taxation. Under new section HA 8B, qualifying companies are not permitted to hold CFC income interests or interests in a FIF that are a direct income interest of 10 percent or more. This ensures that qualifying companies cannot be used as intermediaries to distribute untaxed foreign income to New Zealand shareholders (as dividends from qualifying companies are exempt under section CW 15 to the extent to which they are not fully-imputed). If a qualifying company holds a CFC income interest or non-portfolio FIF interest in any income year beginning on or after 1 July 2009 it will immediately cease to be a qualifying company. Certain foreign dividends are subject to income tax Certain types of foreign dividends are explicitly excluded from the section CW 9 foreign dividend exemption. These are listed in subsection CW 9(2) and are as follows: • dividends from a less than 10 percent interest in a FIF described in sections EX 31, EX 32, EX 36, EX 37, EX 37B or EX 39. These comprise shares in ASX-listed Australian companies, Australian unit trusts with adequate turnover or distributions, certain venture capital investments into New Zealand companies that have since migrated to a grey list country, and shares in Guinness Peat Group plc; • dividends from fixed-rate foreign equity; and • dividends from deductible foreign equity. Income tax is payable on the foreign dividend in these cases. If a person holds an attributing interest in a FIF that is calculated using the comparative value, deemed rate of return or fair dividend rate methods, any dividends from this FIF will be exempt. This is because these FIF interests have no income other than FIF income under section EX 59(2). Fixed-rate foreign equity and deductible foreign equity are defined in section YA 1. Fixed-rate foreign equity includes foreign dividends that are a specific, fixed percentage of the amount paid for the equity (as well as variations on this) and any dividend that is regarded as equivalent to payment for money lent. Page 60 A deductible foreign equity distribution is a dividend where the foreign company paying the dividend (or a company in the same group or further up the chain as the foreign company) is allowed a deduction for the payment of the dividend against foreign income tax. To prevent double taxation on fixed-rate foreign equity and deductible foreign equity a deduction will be available under section EX 20C(2) to a CFC in determining its net attributed CFC income in cases where the CFC pays these dividends to a New Zealand company or another CFC. The deduction is apportioned to the extent to which the CFC has active assets to account for the fact that active CFC income is not attributed. More specifically the deduction is calculated according to the fraction found under section EX 20C(8). Example 1 A CFC pays a deductible dividend of $100,000 to a New Zealand company. Example 2 A CFC pays a fixed-rate dividend of $80,000 to a New Zealand company. $80,000 Dividend Share CFC Passive Asset $60,000 Active Asset $40,000 NZ Co Tax on dividend = $24,000 After-tax return = $56,000 Passive income $50,000 Active income $50,000 Foreign tax $20,000 Allowable deduction for dividend = $80,000(0.6) = $48,000 Net attributable CFC income = $50,000-$48,000 = $2,000 NZ tax on CFC income = 0.3($2,000) = $600 Foreign tax credit = $600 so 0 NZ tax paid on attributed income $100,000 Dividend Share CFC Passive Asset $60,000 Active Asset $40,000 NZ Co Tax on dividend = $30,000 After-tax return = $70,000 Passive income $50,000 Active income $50,000 Foreign tax = $0 (deductible dividend) Allowable deduction for dividend =$60,000 Net attributable income = $50,000-$60,000 = $10,000 loss carried forward Page 61 Example 3 A non-attributing portfolio FIF pays a dividend of $70,000 to a New Zealand company. Transitionals, consequentials and repeals Sections EX 22, GZ 2, IQ 2B, LK 5B, LQ 1 to LQ 4, RG, OC 4, OC 5, OC 6, OC 8, OC 9, OC 10, OC 30 to OC 34, OD 4 to OD 8, OD 11, OD 23, OE 12 to OE, 16B, OP 56, OP 61, OP 62 and OP 105 to OP 108B of the Income Tax Act 2007 Provision has been made to deal with various transitional and consequential matters arising from the new rules for CFC income and foreign dividends. The changes are discussed below. Key features CFC net losses and foreign tax credits Sections IQ 2B and LK 5B set out transitional rules to deal with attributed CFC net losses and foreign tax credits. In broad terms, the effect of these rules is that attributed CFC net losses and foreign tax credits accrued under the old rules can be carried forward into the new system, but will continue to be reduced by reference to total CFC net income (including non-attributable income). Repeal of foreign dividend payments Subpart RG has been repealed to remove the liability for resident companies to pay foreign dividend payments on dividends they receive from foreign companies. Sections OC 4, OC 5, and OC 30 to OC 34 have been amended to replace “further FDP” with “further income tax.” Sections OC 6, OC 8, OC 9, OC 10, OP 56, OP 61 and OP 62 have been repealed to prevent new FDP credits from being generated. $70,000 Dividend Share FIF subject to EX 31, EX 32, EX 36 EX 37, EX 37B or EX 39 NZ Co Tax on dividend = $21,000 After-tax return = $49,000 Income $100,000 Foreign tax =$30,000 Net attributable income = $0 Page 62 Branch equivalent tax accounts Sections OE 12 to OE 16 and OP 105 to OP 108 have been repealed to prevent branch equivalent tax accounts (BETA) debit balances from increasing under the new rules. Sections OE 16B and OP 108B provide a BETA debit to extinguish any existing BETA credit balances as BETA credits are no longer required to relieve FDP once FDP has been repealed. Repeal of the grey list exemption for CFCs The exemption for CFCs resident in eight grey list countries available under the previous rules has been replaced with an exemption for a CFC resident in Australia. This is achieved by a modification to section EX 22. Repeal of conduit tax relief Sections LQ 1 to LQ 4 have been repealed to prevent further conduit tax relief (CTR) arising. Section OD 4(3) has been amended so that a CTR company that elects to cease being a CTR company stops being a CTR company the day after the election is made (rather than at the beginning of the next tax year). Sections OD 5 and OD 8 have been repealed to prevent new conduit tax relief credits from arising from conduit tax relief on attributed income or dividends. Section OD 11 has been repealed as this square-up is obsolete now that FDP is no longer paid when a CTR credit is generated. Section OD 23 has been repealed to remove the tax liability that can arise from CTR debits. In other words, CTR credits will cease to be a contingent liability unless the anti-avoidance rule in section GZ 2 applies. Section GZ 2 claws back conduit tax relief from conduit arrangements that previously provided a tax benefit to New Zealand-resident shareholders (aside from the CTR company or a CTR holding company for that company). Detailed analysis Transitional loss carry-forward rules A net loss incurred by a CFC is attributed to holders of non-portfolio income interests under subpart DN. FIF losses are likewise attributed to interest holders under subpart DN. A person may set an attributed CFC loss or a FIF loss from a given jurisdiction against attributed CFC income or branch equivalent FIF income from the same jurisdiction. Any excess becomes an attributed CFC net loss or a FIF net loss, which may be carried forward and used against future profits. Losses attributed from CFCs and branch equivalent FIFs are ring-fenced by jurisdiction, which means that a loss which arose in a given jurisdiction may only be set against CFC income or branch equivalent FIF income from the same jurisdiction. Page 63 Transitional rules are needed to deal with attributed CFC net losses and FIF net losses carried forward from the previous rules. This is because the measure of attributable income against which those losses can be set is narrower than that which applied at the time the losses accrued. The value of these historical losses should therefore be restricted under the new rules. This is achieved through section IQ 2B. Subsection (1) provides that the amount of attributed CFC net loss or FIF net loss from a jurisdiction that a person has carried forward from the previous rules is the person’s available BE loss for that jurisdiction. Subsection (2) provides that each year, some or all of this available BE loss is converted into an equivalent CFC loss, which is effectively an ordinary attributed CFC net loss under the new rules. The amount of available BE loss converted each year is the converted BE loss. The amount of losses converted each year, and the rate of conversion, is determined under subsections (4) to (7). Separate calculations are required for each relevant jurisdiction. The rate of conversion depends on the relationship between a person’s jurisdictional attributed income and the person’s jurisdictional BE income. These terms are defined in subsection (9). The key difference is that jurisdictional attributed income only includes income from CFCs which is attributed under the new rules, whereas jurisdictional BE income includes the full branch equivalent income from CFCs that would have been attributable under the old rules. (Full branch equivalent FIF income is included under both terms.) Subsection (4) deals with the typical scenario, in which a person’s jurisdictional BE income is greater than jurisdictional attributed income. In that case, the converted BE loss is equal to the person’s jurisdictional BE income (or to the available BE loss if this is lower). The equivalent CFC loss is equal to the person’s jurisdictional attributed income (or the amount calculated under paragraph (b)(ii) if this is lower). What this means in practice is illustrated by the following example. Example In 2010–11, a person has jurisdictional attributed income of $75, jurisdictional BE income of $150 and an available BE loss for the jurisdiction of $210. The person must use $150 of the available BE loss to offset the jurisdictional attributed income of $75, giving $1 of historical loss an effective value in that year of 50 cents and leaving an available CFC loss of $60 to carry forward to 2011–12. In 2011–12, the same person has jurisdictional attributed income of $80 and jurisdictional BE income of $120. The person sets the remaining $60 of the available CFC loss against the jurisdictional attributed income, its effective value being $40 (determined under paragraph (b)(ii) according to the relationship between jurisdictional attributed income and jurisdictional BE income in that year). This leaves jurisdictional attributed income of $40 still subject to New Zealand tax. Page 64 Subsection (5) deals with the less common situation in which jurisdictional attributed income exceeds jurisdictional BE income. In that case, the equivalent CFC loss is equal to the converted BE loss (giving $1 of historical loss an effective value of $1). The available BE loss to be converted is the amount needed to offset the person’s jurisdictional attributed income for the year, assuming there are sufficient losses available. Subsections (6) and (7) make equivalent provision for interest holders who are members of wholly owned groups that include other resident members. For a member of a wholly owned group, the conversion of historical losses to an equivalent CFC loss is done by reference to the jurisdictional income ratio of the group. A person or a wholly owned group may elect, under subsection (8), to fix the jurisdictional income ratio using the average ratios over a two-year period, provided they had jurisdictional BE income in each of those years. A person may also elect, under subsection (3), not to carry forward historical losses from a given jurisdiction. To minimise compliance costs, subsection (10) allows a person or a wholly owned group to use the net profit or loss from financial accounts as a proxy for the branch equivalent income or loss of a CFC for the purposes of calculating their jurisdictional BE income. Transitional rules for foreign tax credits Subpart LK makes provision for tax credits relating to attributed CFC income. A person who has attributed CFC income for an income year is allowed a tax credit for income tax and foreign income tax paid in relation to that income by the person or by the CFC. Surplus credits may be carried forward or transferred within the same wholly owned group, subject in both cases to jurisdictional ring-fencing. The tax credit rules for CFCs in subpart LK are applied to branch equivalent FIFs by section EX 50(8) and (9). Equivalent transitional issues arise for subpart LK credits carried forward from under the previous rules as losses. These credits are therefore subject to similar restrictions, in this case under section LK 5B. Subsection (1) provides that the credit relating to a jurisdiction carried forward from under the previous rules is the available BE credit for that jurisdiction. Subsection (2) provides that each year, some or all of this available BE credit is converted into an equivalent tax credit, and is effectively treated as an ordinary credit under subpart LK. The amount of available BE credit converted each year is the converted BE credit. The credits converted each year, and the rate of conversion, is determined under subsections (4) to (7). The approach is the same as that taken for losses under section IQ 2B. An election to fix the jurisdictional income ratio using the average ratios over a two-year period under section IQ 2B(8) will also apply for the purposes of this section. As for losses, a person may elect not to carry forward historical credits from a given jurisdiction (subsection (3)). Likewise, there is the same scope for a person to use net profit or losses from accounts, instead of BE income or loss, when determining the jurisdictional BE income (subsection (10)). Page 65 Repeal of foreign dividend payments As a result of the exemption for most foreign dividends received by companies, foreign dividend payments (FDP) have been repealed and foreign dividend payment accounts will be gradually phased out. Subpart RG has been repealed to remove the liability for resident companies to pay foreign dividend payments on dividends that they receive from foreign companies. As a result, most foreign dividends received by companies will be wholly exempt, but in some cases, income tax will be payable (see the section on “foreign dividend exemption” for details and examples). If a company had an FDP debit at the end of the tax year (section OC 30) or when it migrates offshore (section OC 31) “further FDP” was payable under the previous rules. Under the new rules, this liability has been replaced with a liability to pay further income tax. Consistent with this change, section 140B of the Tax Administration Act has been amended so that imputation penalty tax is payable when further income tax is payable under section OC 30. Several sections in subpart OC that give rise to FDP credits have been repealed as these sections are redundant with the repeal of the FDP liability in section RG. The repealed provisions are: section OC 6, which provided an FDP credit for FDP being paid, sections OC 8 and OC 10, which provided FDP credits when FDP was payable as a result of a CTR debit or CTR debit balance, and section OC 9, which allowed companies to convert any imputation credits earned on attributable foreign income into FDP credits. The repeal of section OC 6 only applies to dividends received after the new international tax rules came into force. Example 1 NZ Co has a balance date of 30 June. It receives a foreign dividend on 20 June 2009 on which it is liable to pay FDP of $30. On 10 July 2009, NZ Co pays the $30 of FDP and has 30 FDP credits added to its FDP account balance. Example 2 NZ Co receives a second foreign dividend on 1 July 2009. This dividend is wholly exempt so no FDP is paid and no FDP credit arises. Companies will have five years to distribute their existing FDP credit balances to shareholders before any remaining balances are converted into imputation credits. This will be legislated for as part of a subsequent tax bill. Branch equivalent tax accounts The exemption for most foreign dividends received by companies means that branch equivalent tax accounts (BETA) for companies will be phased out. As income tax will continue to apply to foreign dividends received by non-companies, BETA accounts will be retained for non- companies. Companies with BETA debit balances will be able to continue to use these debits to relieve any double taxation on attributed income for a two-year period. Any remaining BETA debits will then be extinguished. This will be legislated for as part of a subsequent tax bill. Page 66 The transitional period for BETA debits is intended only to prevent double taxation in the rare cases in which dividends have been paid significantly in advance of attributed passive income arising. Example 1 Company C has a BETA credit balance of $200. At the beginning of its income year this balance is extinguished as BETA credits are no longer required with the repeal of FDP (BETA credits can only be used to relieve FDP). Example 2 Company D has a BETA debit balance of $30. From the beginning of its income year, no more BETA debits will be generated. The company has $100 of net attributed (passive) CFC income it can use its BETA debit balance to relieve the $30 of income tax that would otherwise be payable on this income. Repeal of the grey list exemption for CFCs Taxpayers with a greater than 10 percent interest in a CFC that is resident in a grey list country will have to calculate their attributable CFC amount from the CFC unless it qualifies as a non- attributing active CFC under section EX 21B or is a non-attributing Australian CFC under section EX 22B. The eight-country grey list for 10 percent or greater interests in FIFs in section EX 35 will be retained for the time being, while the possibility of extending the active income exemption to these entities is considered. Example 1 NZ Co has a CFC that is resident in the UK. From the beginning of its income year on 1 August 2009, it will be required to attribute passive income from the UK CFC unless that CFC qualifies as a non-attributing active CFC under section EX 21B. Example 2 NZ Co has a greater than 10 percent interest in a FIF that is resident in the UK. Because the section EX 35 grey list exemption still applies, NZ Co will not be required to attribute income from this FIF. Repeal of conduit tax relief Under the new rules, no further conduit tax relief will arise under the conduit mechanism. The conduit mechanism removes income tax on income that a New Zealand company receives from its CFC interests to the extent that the New Zealand company is owned by non-residents. Section OD 23 has been repealed to remove the tax liability that can arise from CTR debits. In other words, CTR credits will cease to be a contingent liability. An exception to this is if the anti-avoidance rule in section GZ 2 is found to apply. Page 67 Example CTR Co has a balance date of 31 July 2009. From 1 August it will no longer receive conduit tax relief on its CFC income and no new conduit credits will be added to its existing pool of $2 million CTR credits. On 1 December 2009, CTR Co is bought by a NZ-resident company, which results in a change of more than 34 percent in its resident shareholding status. This will cause $2 million of CTR debits to arise under section OD 16 (extinguishing the CTR credit balance). Under the previous rules, this break in shareholder continuity would have generated an FDP liability under section OD 23, but no liability arises under the new rules unless the anti-avoidance rule in section GZ 2 is found to apply. Section GZ 2 is intended to claw back conduit tax relief from arrangements that were entered into in anticipation of the repeal of section OD 23 that had the effect of reducing the tax liabilities of New Zealand shareholders. This reflects the fact that conduit tax relief was designed to relieve tax on non-residents investing through New Zealand into CFCs. Conduit tax relief was not intended to apply to income that was ultimately owned by New Zealand residents. Section GZ 2 applies to arrangements that generated conduit tax relief credits between 4 December 2008 (when an issues paper announcing this policy was released) and the date from which conduit tax relief was repealed. Section GZ 2 does not apply to conduit tax relief received by the conduit tax relief company itself, or by a CTR holding company for the CTR company. Example CTR Co has a balance date of 30 April. In the period from 4 December 2008 to 30 April 2010, CTR Co receives $1 million of conduit tax relief in respect of its CFC. On 1 May 2010, CTR Co passes $0.5 million of conduit-relieved income through to its non-resident shareholders. Section GZ 2 would not apply to this amount. On 1 June 2010, CTR Co ceases to be a conduit tax relief company and distributes the remaining $0.5 million of conduit-relieved income to a resident shareholder who is not a CTR holding company in the CTR Co. Section GZ 2 is likely to apply to this amount. CTR companies will be able to continue to attach CTR credits to any dividends they distribute to their non-resident shareholders, for a period of two years. This provides time for conduit-relieved income (represented by CTR credits) to be channelled to non-residents and any CFC income on which New Zealand tax has been paid (represented by FDP credits) to be channelled to New Zealand residents. Example CTR Co has 42 CTR credits and 42 FDP credits. It pays a dividend of $100 to a non-resident to which it attaches the 42 CTR credits and pays a dividend of $100 to a New Zealand resident to which it attaches the 42 FDP credits. This is in accordance with the original policy intent for how income would be distributed from CTR companies. Page 68 CTR companies that do not wish to distribute their foreign income in this way, can, under the new rules, elect to cease to be a CTR company under section OD 4 and have their CTR credits extinguished with no liability. Subsection OD 4(3) has been amended to make it so this election will take effect from the day after the election was made as this allows companies to convert FDP credits into imputation credits (under the previous rules, these companies would have had to wait until the next tax year before the election took effect). Example CTR Co has 30 CTR credits and 30 FDP credits. On 1 August 2009 it elects to cease being a CTR company. From 2 August 2009 it is no longer a CTR company so the 30 CTR credits are extinguished (with no FDP liability). The company can choose to convert the 30 FDP credits into 30 imputation credits. If the company pays a dividend it will have no CTR credits to distribute to non-residents so if FDP credits (or imputation credits) were attached to a dividend it would have to attach these in the same ratio to all of its dividends. Another option is for CTR companies to simply retain their CTR credits for the two-year transitional period, after which these credits will be extinguished with no tax liability. The legislation for this final repeal of CTR accounts will be introduced as part of a subsequent tax bill. Disclosure requirements for CFCS Consequential changes as a result of amendments to CFC rules Residents must disclose an income interest of 10 percent or more in a CFC. To disclose an interest after the revised CFC rules apply, the new electronic IR 458 form on Inland Revenue’s website (www.ird.govt.nz) must be used. To disclose an interest before the revised CFC rules apply, the IR 477 or IR 479 forms must be used. Residents with an income interest of 10 percent or more in a foreign company that is not a CFC are still required to disclose that interest using a FIF disclosure form, an IR 477 or an IR 479, as applicable. Residents with an income interest of less than 10 percent in a CFC may be required to disclose the interest in a FIF disclosure form. Further information about these existing disclosure requirements is contained in 2009 International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR20 (www.ird.govt.nz/technical-tax/determinations/other/other-int-tax-itr20.html ).
Page 1 14 October 2009 A special report from the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue GST changes relating to the Emissions Trading Scheme The Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009 made a number of changes to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 that deal with the GST consequences of allocating and trading in emissions units. This special report outlines those changes, some of which took effect from enactment. It is for the early information of affected taxpayers and their advisors. A more detailed account of the GST changes in the new Act, as well as several income tax changes relating to emissions units, will be published in a Tax Information Bulletin later in the year. Background The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Act 2008 introduced the Emissions Trading Scheme. That Act creates obligations for certain participants to surrender emissions units commensurate with the emissions associated with their activities. It also provides mechanisms for certain participants to receive emissions units for carbon capture and other removal activities and for others to be allocated emissions units by government. The Climate Change Act also amended the GST Act by inserting new paragraphs (s), (t), (u) and (v) into section 11A(1). Transactions in New Zealand units, Kyoto- compliant emissions units and “approved overseas units” were zero-rated. The supply of services in exchange for emissions units received from government under the Climate Change Act was also zero-rated. Key features (Sections 11A(1)(s) and 11A(1)(v)) Technical amendments have been made to reflect the original policy intention of the GST amendments made in the Climate Change Act, particularly in relation to emissions units which are transferred by the government under schemes outside the Climate Change Act. Amendments have also been made to extend zero-rating to certain emissions units which are not New Zealand units, Kyoto-compliant emissions units or approved overseas units. Page 2 Emissions units transferred under the Permanent Forest Sink Initiative The Permanent Forest Sink Initiative (PFSI) is a government scheme under which landowners can establish permanent forest sinks on land that was not forested on 31 December 1989, and receive emissions units reflecting the amount of carbon sequestered in their forests. For more information, see www.maf.govt.nz/forestry/pfsi . The zero-rating of the transfer of emissions units by the government under PFSI has been added to paragraph (s). This change has the consequential effect of zero-rating the supply of services made by the forester in exchange for the emissions units (whether it is an actual supply or a deemed supply under section 5(6D)). Application date This change took effect from, 6 October 2009. Other transfers of emissions units by government The changes above zero-rate the transfer of emissions units under PFSI, and transfers under the Climate Change Act are also zero-rated (along with, in both cases, contra- supplies made by recipients of these units). Section 11A(1)(v) is a provision intended to zero-rate transactions in emissions units in the private sector, and the sale of emissions units by the government. It is not intended to apply where the government transfers emissions units without payment. The section has been amended to make this clear. Accordingly, the transfer of emissions units by government under schemes such as Project to Reduce Emissions (PRE) and Negotiated Greenhouse Agreements (NGAs) revert to being standard- rated, although any subsequent transfers of such units will be zero-rated under paragraph (v). A table showing the GST position of different transactions at different times is set out at the end of this report. This change took effect from 6 October 2009. Zero-rating of other types of emissions units The provisions referred to above apply to transactions in New Zealand units, Kyoto- compliant units and approved overseas units. New provisions also zero-rate certain other emissions units which do not fall within this description – sometimes called “grey market” or “voluntary” units. Page 3 The new provisions apply to units which are: • issued by reference to the sequestration, or avoidance of emission, of human- induced greenhouse gases; and • verified to an internationally recognised standard. Examples of the type of units which will qualify for zero-rating under the new rules are Voluntary Carbon Standard units (www.v-c-s.org) and Gold Standard units (www.cdmgoldstandard.org ). Application date This change takes effect from 1 April 2010. Summary table The following table sets out all the different types of emissions units transactions, and their GST treatment, that are set out in legislation.

Page 1 13 October 2009 A special report from the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue Payroll giving – a new tax credit Legislation introducing a voluntary payroll-giving scheme has been enacted and will take effect from 7 January 2010. The scheme provides a tax credit for gifts of money that are deducted from an employee’s pay through his or her employer’s payroll. Employees receive an immediate reduction in tax by way of the tax credit each pay- period, eliminating the need to collect and keep receipts to claim the tax relief on gifts of money at the end of the year. To participate in the payroll-giving scheme the recipient organisation, such as a charity or school, must be a donee organisation. The legislation only provides for the tax administration of the scheme. It does not prescribe the nature of the arrangements or relationships between employers, employees and donee organisations, or how the schemes should be set up in the workplace. The scheme operates in addition to the current end-of-year donation tax credit claim system. Therefore, employees who do not or are unable to give through a payroll- giving scheme can still claim tax benefits on their donations through the existing end- of-year refund process. This report is intended to provide timely assistance to employers, employees, donee organisations and their advisors in understanding the tax mechanism for delivering tax credits for payroll donations. It also offers some guidance on how to set up a payroll- giving arrangement based on overseas experience and the current limited New Zealand experience using an after-tax payroll-giving scheme. Further detailed guidance on payroll giving will be available over the coming weeks on Inland Revenue’s website www.ird.govt.nz and in Inland Revenue’s publication Tax Information Bulletin. Background The government first raised the idea of introducing a voluntary payroll-giving scheme to New Zealand in the 2006 discussion document Tax incentives for giving to charities and other non-profit organisations. This was followed by a further discussion document in November 2007, Payroll giving: providing a real-time benefit for charitable giving, which discussed several options for implementing payroll giving in New Zealand. Submissions made in response to these documents indicated a wide level of public support for introducing a payroll-giving scheme, in particular – for making giving to charitable and philanthropic causes easier. Page 2 Other countries, such as Australia and the United Kingdom have introduced payroll giving and their experiences suggested that payroll giving is a simple, convenient and effective way of supporting charitable giving. These countries have also found that payroll giving enables businesses to connect with their communities in ways that achieve tangible and mutual benefits for everyone involved. In particular, payroll giving offers donee organisations the benefit of stable funding that is free of fundraising costs – that is, donee organisations receive donations as a lump sum from each employer and this reduces their costs as donee organisations only process one donation from each employer. Another benefit is that donee organisations are not required to issue receipts to the donors. The non-prescriptive nature of New Zealand’s new payroll-giving scheme is intended to provide flexibility to allow relevant parties to work together to establish schemes that work best for them and to manage the associated costs. A key policy outcome of the payroll-giving scheme is that it has the potential to establish genuine partnerships between businesses and the community, while supporting employees’ community activities. The Finance and Expenditure Committee recommended a number of changes to the payroll giving provisions to better reflect policy intentions and to improve the overall equity of the scheme. The Committee also asked for clarification on a number of matters relating to payroll giving. These issues are covered in this report. Key features The rules for the new payroll-giving scheme are largely contained in new sections LD 4 to LD 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and in new section 24Q of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Unless otherwise indicated, section references are to the Income Tax Act 2007. The key features of the scheme are: • Participation in payroll giving is voluntary for employers and employees. • Payroll giving is available only to employees whose employers file their employer monthly schedules and PAYE deduction forms electronically, using Inland Revenue’s ir-File service, and who choose to offer payroll giving in their workplace. • Employees who choose to make payroll donations will receive a tax credit on the amount of those donations each payday. The tax credit is calculated on a set rate of 33⅓ percent of the donation made. The tax credit is offset against the PAYE amount calculated on the employee’s gross pay, thereby reducing the amount of PAYE payable for that period. The maximum tax credit permitted is limited to the tax portion of the PAYE deduction on the employee’s pay each pay period. • Payroll donations must be made to a donee organisation. A donee organisation is a society, institution, association, organisation, trust or fund as described in section LD 3(2) or an organisation listed in schedule 32. Page 3 • Employees are responsible for ensuring that the chosen recipient is in fact a donee organisation and for supplying to the employer relevant details that will enable the transfer of the payroll donations to the donee organisations. A full list of donee organisations can be found at www.ird.govt.nz/donee- organisations. • Employers are responsible for ensuring that payroll donations are transferred to the chosen donee organisations within a specified period. They are also required to disclose certain information and keep adequate records to enable Inland Revenue to determine that payroll donations have in fact been transferred. • Employees who donate through payroll giving are not eligible for the end-of- year donation refund on their payroll donations. Application date The rules of the payroll-giving scheme take effect on 7 January 2010. Detailed analysis Establishing payroll-giving schemes in the workplace In New Zealand, a small number of employers have already established payroll-giving relationships with their employees and individual donee organisations. Under these schemes, donations are made from the after-tax pay of the employee. As long as they keep records, employees can claim the tax benefit of these donations at the end of the year through the current donation tax credit process, like any other charitable donation. The new payroll-giving scheme replaces the end-of-year claim process for employees donating via payroll giving. As stated earlier, the payroll-giving scheme legislation does not prescribe the nature of the arrangements or relationships between employers, employees and donee organisations, or how the schemes should be set up. Matters that would need to be decided upon by the relevant parties include: • the process for establishing a scheme that works best for all parties concerned; • the role of intermediaries; 1 1 In overseas jurisdictions, intermediaries are used to receive and distribute payroll donations to donee organisations (payment intermediaries) and/or to help employers establish payroll-giving schemes (facilitating intermediaries). Page 4 • the level of employee education about payroll giving that may be needed; • the process for selecting donee organisations to participate in the scheme; • the number of donee organisations that can participate in the scheme; • the level of engagement between donee organisations and employee donors; and • Any minimum payroll donation threshold. The examples below illustrate three possible approaches to establishing payroll-giving arrangements based on current New Zealand and overseas experiences. Example 1 The employer has established a charitable trust to receive its employees’ payroll donations and to decide on the ultimate destination of those donations. The charitable trust is itself a donee organisation. Donee organisations apply for grant funding from the trust. As there is employee representation in the grant-making process, employees have the ability to determine the ultimate destination of their payroll donations. Employees receive regular feedback about the impact of their support in the community. The employer-established charitable trust offers the employer and its employees a flexible payroll-giving programme. Example 2 The employer and its employees participate in selecting the donee organisations they wish to support. The number of donee organisations is limited to six organisations. Employee peer champions are selected and trained to communicate the benefits of the payroll-giving programme to employees and to facilitate on-going engagement in the workplace. Employees must give at least $2 or more each pay. Employees receive advice detailing the amount donated and to whom each year. The employer also provides a degree of matching donations. Employees are encouraged to increase their involvement with the selected donee organisations through the giving of volunteer time and expertise (pro bono work). There is a high level of employer/employee engagement in facilitating the payroll-giving programme. The six donee organisations are also actively involved in the programme. Example 3 The employer has partnered with a third-party intermediary (which is a donee organisation). The intermediary receives the employee payroll donations from the employer and decides who in the community should benefit. The intermediary ensures that payroll donations go to support certain community activities in the region in which the payroll donations are sourced. Employees have no control over where their payroll donations are applied. A third-party intermediary offers efficiency gains in time and costs for the employer and its employees. Page 5 The new tax credit for payroll donations Who can participate in the payroll-giving scheme (section LD 4(1)) Participation in payroll giving is voluntary for both employers and employees. Tax credits for payroll donations are available to any person: • whose employer chooses to offer payroll giving in the workplace; • whose employer files its employer monthly schedules and employer deduction forms by electronic means; and • who chooses to make a payroll donation in a pay-period from their pay. There is no registration process for payroll giving. An employer simply records any tax credits for payroll donations on the employer monthly schedule and then electronically files this form with Inland Revenue. Amount of credit (section LD 4(2) and (3)) The credit applies at the rate of 33⅓ percent on the dollar value of all qualifying payroll donations made by the employee in a pay-period. Maximum credit (section LD 4(4)) The maximum credit is limited to the income tax that the employee has paid in respect of the pay period in which the donation has been deducted. Non-refundable credit (section LD 4(5)) The tax credit for payroll donations is treated as a non-refundable credit. No refunds for payroll donations (section LD 4(6)) Payroll donations are not eligible for the end-of-year donation refund. Definition of “pay” (section LD 4(7)) A new definition of “pay” has been included for the purposes of payroll giving. The definition is intended to ensure that only people who earn income in connection with their employment can participate in the payroll-giving scheme. Cancellation of the tax credit (sections LD 5 and LD 6) New section LD 5 extinguishes the tax credit when a calculation or filing error has occurred. This provision also restores the tax credit if the error is subsequently corrected by the employer. Page 6 New section LD 6 extinguishes the tax credit when an employer or PAYE intermediary transfers an employee’s payroll donation to a recipient that is not a donee organisation. Extinguishing the credit would result in a shortfall in PAYE, and so the employee would have an additional PAYE liability to pay for the relevant pay- period. Ultimately, the employee would be liable to meet any shortfall in PAYE, as provided in section RD 4(1) and section 168 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. When a donation is returned to an employee (section LD 7) New section LD 7 extinguishes the tax credit if the donation is returned to the employee. There may be instances when the employee receives a donation back (for example, the employer might have the donation returned if it had been provided to an ineligible donee organisation so the amount can be returned to the employee). The tax credit they previously received for that donation would be cancelled. Meaning and ranking of payroll donations (section LD 8) New section LD 8 provides that an employee must meet his or her tax and other obligations in respect of each pay-period before they are able to make payroll donations for a pay-period. In practice, this means that the employer would make the required pay-period tax and social policy deductions (including student loan, child support payments and KiwiSaver obligations) and any other deductions required to be made from an employee’s salary and, if there are sufficient funds, make the necessary adjustments for payroll donations. This provision may affect the amount of payroll donations an employee may make in a pay-period and also the maximum amount of tax credit. Transferring payroll donations (section 24Q of the Tax Administration Act 1994) Section 24Q of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is intended to apply when an employer agrees to establish payroll giving in the workplace and an employee asks the employer to transfer an amount of payroll donation from the employee’s pay to a donee organisation. The provision provides that: • Employers must transfer any payroll donations to donee organisations on or before the due date required by sections RA 15 and RD 4 that is nearest to the end of the two-month period from the last day of the pay-period in which the donation was deducted. • Payroll donations are held in trust for employees until transferred to the donee organisations. • Employees are responsible for checking that the organisation they are donating to is in fact a “donee organisation” and for supplying their employer with sufficient details of the recipient to enable the payroll donation to be made. Page 7 Priority of payroll giving donations Schedule 7 of the Companies Act 1993 and section 274(2)(aa) of the Insolvency Act 2006 have been amended to confirm that when an employer goes into bankruptcy or liquidation and has not passed on the employee’s donations to a donee organisation, those donations will have the same priority for return to the employee in a bankruptcy or liquidation as unpaid wages. Information disclosure and record-keeping requirements New section RP 14(ab) requires PAYE intermediaries to transfer any payroll donations to the relevant recipients on or before the due date of the employer’s EDF/IR 345 nearest to the expiry of the two-month period that follows the pay period in which the donation was deducted. New sections RP 8(a)(iii) and (iv) require employers who use PAYE intermediaries to keep a record of the amount of payroll donations and any tax credit for payroll donations and provide this information to the intermediary. New sections 22(2)(ed) and 22(2)(ke) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provide that employers must maintain sufficient records to enable Inland Revenue to determine the transfer of an employee’s payroll donation to the recipient of that donation. Penalty and use-of-money interest provisions Section RD 2(1)(b) provides that the payroll donation tax credit provisions are part of the PAYE rules. Therefore, the normal penalty and use-of-money-interest charges that apply to the determination and payment of PAYE also apply to the tax credit for payroll donations. It would be a question of fact and degree whether the current late payment penalties or any of the shortfall penalties would apply and the application of penalties would be on a case-by-case basis. The only additional penalty for payroll giving is contained in section 141E(1)(c) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This provides that employers are liable to pay a shortfall penalty of 150% if they do not transfer the payroll donations to the correct recipient. The penalty is imposed on the tax credit that is extinguished, because the credit would represent the short-paid PAYE.

Page 1 13 October 2009 A special report from the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue Remedial amendments to the research and development tax credit As part of the recently enacted Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009, remedial amendments have been made to the now- repealed research and development tax credit for the 2008–09 income year. The amendments clarify the policy intention of the tax credit and make some technical changes to the administration of the tax credit. This special report is intended to help claimants who are in the process of calculating their tax credit entitlements and preparing claims to understand the legislative consequences of the amendments. This report outlines the amendments that clarify the policy intention of the original legislation. A description of the other technical amendments that have been made will be included in a more detailed account of the legislation, to be published in a Tax Information Bulletin later this year. Background While the R&D tax credits have been repealed from the 2009–10 income year, the government signalled further work to align the tax credit legislation with the policy intention in a number of areas. The remedial amendments arising from that work relate to: • eligibility of government agencies; • company groups and the eligibility rules; • feedstock rules; and • eligibility of labour R&D costs. Key features Government agencies (section LH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007) The tax credit rules require a claimant to be in business or to be an industry research co-operative. Some Crown agencies are specifically excluded from eligibility. Page 2 Under the previous legislation Crown agencies that could meet the business test and that were not specifically excluded were eligible for the tax credit. This is contrary to the policy intent of the tax credit, which aims to incentivise R&D carried out by private sector businesses. A new paragraph has been added to section LH 1(2) to exclude Crown entities as that term is defined in the Crown Entities Act 2004. A consequential amendment has been made to paragraphs LH 1(2)(b) and (c) which exclude associates of and those controlled by entities that are specifically excluded. Company groups (sections LH 1 and LH 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007) To qualify for the tax credit, among other requirements, a claimant must: • be in business; • control the R&D activity; and • effectively own the results of the R&D activity. This can be problematic for larger firms that separate aspects of their operation for commercial purposes. For example, a firm may locate its R&D division in one subsidiary but hold any resulting intellectual property in another subsidiary to manage risk. Group companies, which are essentially one economic unit, would be eligible for the tax credit if they restructured their activities so that one member of the group carried out all the necessary functions. Requiring firms to amalgamate these functions, which were previously carried out in separate subsidiaries within the group, in order to be eligible for the tax credit is inefficient and it would create unnecessary compliance costs. Section LH 1 has been amended to enable a New Zealand-resident member of a group to meet the requirement to be in business in New Zealand if another New Zealand- resident member of the group would meet that requirement. A consequential amendment has been made to section LH 3(1)(a). A new subsection LH 3(6)(a) has been added to allow a New Zealand-resident member of a group to meet the requirement to control the research and development activities if another New Zealand member of the group would meet that requirement. Similarly, the new subsection LH 3(6)(b) allows a New Zealand-resident member of a group to meet the requirements to effectively own the results of the research and development activities, if another New Zealand-resident member of the group, or another member that is controlled by a New Zealand-resident member, would meet that requirement. Page 3 Feedstock rules (schedule 21 part A paragraph 8, and part B paragraph 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007) The feedstock rules apply when the R&D includes the testing of a production process. The objective of the feedstock rules is to limit the amount of the R&D credit which can be claimed when some valuable output is produced. The feedstock rules have been rewritten to better reflect the intention of the original legislation. Paragraph 8, part A of schedule 21 makes it clear that, at first instance, expenditure or depreciation loss incurred in acquiring or producing things which are to be transformed as part of a production process is eligible for the credit. The limitation formerly in part A has been removed. The limitation in part B has been rewritten to make it clear that: • It only applies to things which are the input into the feedstock process. • It does not apply when a trial model or preliminary version is the output of the process. Example A mountain bike manufacturer is developing a new coating for bike frames which will be more durable than paint. It applies several different trial formulations of the coating to batches of frames to see whether the colour is consistent. Cost of inputs (value of bare steel frames and coating) $2,000 Other production costs (labour, electricity etc) $1,000 Total costs $3,000 Value of coated frames $2,500 The credit will not be available for the input cost of $2,000. The other production costs of $1,000 remain eligible for the credit. Labour R&D costs (section LH 5(4)(c)(ii) of the Income Tax Act 2007) The R&D credit is generally only available for expenditure which is deductible for income tax purposes. However, the credit is also available for capital expenditure where that expenditure is incurred in the intended development of depreciable property that is intangible property, or tangible property intended only for use in the R&D activities. Page 4 These rules mean that R&D expenditure on labour which is capitalised and is: • incurred in relation to a tangible asset which is intended to be used in the business, or • incurred on intangible property which is not depreciable– will not be eligible for the R&D credit when the expenditure is incurred. New section LH 5(4)(c)(ii) allows the credit for certain R&D labour costs. To be eligible for the credit, the costs must be: • of the type which falls within clauses 1, 3 or 9 of part A of schedule 21. These clauses refer to labour costs, costs which relate to labour, and contracted-out expenditure respectively; • incurred in scientific, investigative, and experimental activities referred to in section LH 7(1)(a), and not those which fall under the “support costs” limb in section LH 7(1)(b); and • not incurred directly in the construction of tangible property. Example A business is developing a new production line to produce items in a way that has never been done before. Developing the new production line involves the following stages: • The company’s production scientists design the new production line. On the facts of this case, designing the production line qualifies as R&D. • The company’s engineers construct the new machinery which makes up the production line. They are supervised by the production scientists. If the production line works satisfactorily, the business will use it in its normal business. The costs of the production scientists, the engineers, and the various materials used to construct the production line are capitalised as part of the costs of the new production line. The work of the production scientists in designing the new production line is eligible for the R&D tax credit under new section LH 5(4)(c)(ii). So is any expenditure relating to those scientists falling under paragraph 3 of part A of schedule 21. The expenditure on the engineers who build the production line, and the production scientists in supervising them, is not eligible because it is incurred “directly in the construction of tangible property”. The expenditure on materials does not qualify. In this example, if the production line, once completed, is used in the R&D process – perhaps for testing – depreciation on the production line will not be eligible for the credit. This is because the requirement in schedule 21, part A, paragraph 2(b) that “all the activities involved in the construction of the property are research and development activities” is not met because the construction of the production line is neither a scientific, investigative or experimental activity, and the production line is not constructed mainly for the purpose of scientific, investigative and experimental activities. The main purpose of the production line is use in the business. Page 5 Application date The amendments are retrospective and will apply for the 2008–09 income tax year. The provisions were repealed from the 2009–10 income year by the Taxation (Urgent Measures and Annual Rates) Act 2008.
Page 1 23 June 2009 A special report from the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue Use-of-money interest rates and underpayment rate method changes The use-of-money interest (UOMI) rates and the method for calculating the underpayment rate were changed by Orders in Council on 22 June 2009. • The UOMI underpayment rate has been reduced from 9.73% to 8.91%. • The UOMI overpayment rate has been reduced from 4.23% to 1.82%. These rate changes apply to any amount of unpaid or overpaid tax from 29 June 2009. This special report explains how the rates are set. UOMI objectives The UOMI rates are a cornerstone of the tax compliance system in New Zealand. The legislated twin objectives of the UOMI provisions are to: • fairly compensate the party (either the Crown or the taxpayer) that does not have the use of its money; and • encourage taxpayers to pay the right amount of tax at the right time. The rate-setting framework places more emphasis on the second objective, since it is not possible to achieve both with a single overpayment and underpayment rate. The underpayment rate attempts to reflect the fact that the government is an involuntary and unsecured lender, and is unable to assess the actual credit-worthiness of each taxpayer. The overpayment rate is designed to discourage taxpayers from using Inland Revenue as an investment opportunity. Case for reviewing the rates at this time When the UOMI rates were last reset, at the start of March this year, Ministers decided that the rates would be reviewed annually from now on, although officials would monitor interest rate movements and report to Ministers. Page 2 Overpayment rate Since March, the official cash rate has reduced twice, which has resulted in corresponding reductions in the 90-day bank bill rate. Because of these reductions the overpayment rate of 4.23% was one of the best rates available, and there is evidence that taxpayers were starting to overpay their tax to take advantage of this rate. This type of behaviour is contrary to the policy intention of the UOMI rates and constituted a significant fiscal risk. This rate was reset using the existing method. This method uses the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) 90-bank bill rate minus 100 basis points (1%). 1 Underpayment rate In order to maintain consistency between UOMI rates and reflect the reductions in the market rates, the underpayment rate was also reviewed. Underpayment rate method Changing the underpayment rate using the previous method (which was set in February this year) would have resulted in the underpayment rate reducing to 7.32%. This rate would have been too close to the cost of finance that is available to many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and individual taxpayers (especially for those who have fixed mortgages at higher rates for example, those on 9% mortgages fixed for three or so years). This would have resulted in tax deferral and fiscal risk concerns and would be contrary to the objective of encouraging taxpayers to pay the right amount of tax on time. These concerns are behind the government’s decision to change the method of setting the underpayment rate. Instead of using the RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate plus 450 basis points (4.5%) 2 , the new method of setting the underpayment rate is now based on the floating first mortgage new customer housing rate plus 250 basis points (2.5%). 3 New series While a number of series could be used as the basis for calculating the underpayment rate, the critical factor is the desired rate that will encourage taxpayers to pay the right amount of tax at the right time, rather than the specific type of series that is used. Furthermore, as noted above, the most suitable underpayment rate should reflect the fact that the government is an involuntary and unsecured lender, and cannot assess the actual credit-worthiness of each taxpayer. 1 Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates Setting Process) Regulations 1997. 2 Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates Setting Process) Amendment Regulations 2009. 3 Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates Setting Process) Amendment Regulations (No 2) 2009. Page 3 The floating first mortgage new customer housing rate series reflects the variable first mortgage interest rate offered to new borrowers for residential property, weighted by each surveyed institution’s total lending outstanding for housing purposes. This series was selected as the new benchmark for calculating the underpayment rate because: • It is likely to be more indicative of the cost of finance for many businesses (particularly small and medium enterprises) and individual taxpayers. • The Reserve Bank has a high level of confidence in this series and considers that it would be a good benchmark to use in calculating the UOMI underpayment rate. • Given the Reserve Bank’s recent projection of low interest rates for a prolonged period, this series should provide a more stable and appropriate benchmark during this period than the 90-day bank bill rate. Margin A judgment call is required in determining the margin to be added to the benchmark series in calculating the underpayment rate. Some taxpayers may consider that charging a margin above the benchmark series is too harsh because the rate is higher than their cost of borrowing. However, as mentioned earlier, the rate must be applied across a diverse group of taxpayers with different risk profiles which affect their cost of borrowing. Furthermore, the margin seeks to take account of: • the fact that the government is an unsecured creditor in respect of underpayments of tax (whereas financing rates reflect the provision of security to lenders); • the incentive for tax deferrals across the population of taxpayers in a climate where there are many taxpayers with a higher cost of finance than the “floating first mortgage new customer housing rate series”; and • the volatility of interest rates in a period of a global credit crisis and the practical difficulties in changing UOMI rates quickly and frequently to accommodate such volatility. The 250 basis point margin seeks to ensure that taxpayers have incentives to pay the correct amount of tax at the right time (as well as incentives to pay their taxes before meeting other financial commitments), without being unduly harsh to those taxpayers who make honest mistakes or unintentionally underpay their instalments of provisional tax (which is an inherently difficult tax to determine with accuracy). It is recognised that each additional basis point in the basis point margin imposes extra costs on taxpayers when they underpay their taxes. However, it is considered that any margin below 250 basis points does not provide sufficient incentives to taxpayers with varying costs of finance, nor does it provide sufficient buffer to manage the volatility in interest rates in a time of credit market crisis. As noted above, there are existing mechanisms available to taxpayers to reduce the adverse impact of high UOMI rates, including provisional tax pooling and the ratio method of paying provisional tax (which allows taxpayers to reduce UOMI exposure by more closely aligning the payment of provisional tax to the earning of income). Page 4 Wider review of provisional tax rules Importantly, the method for setting the underpayment rate will be further considered and consulted on as part of a proposed wider review of provisional tax issues. This review is on the government’s tax policy work programme and is intended to begin within a year. Consequently, the focus of making the current changes is to address fiscal risks and reflect a downwards movement in interest rates (while managing the incentives to defer tax). In the interim, officials will continue to monitor movements in the underlying interest rate series.

The provisions of this Agreement shall not impose on a Contracting Party the obligation to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process. Notwithstanding the foregoing, information of the type referred to in paragraph 4 of Article 5 shall not be treated as such a secret or trade process merely because it meets the criteria in that paragraph. 3. The provisions of this Agreement shall not impose on a Contracting Party the obligation to obtain or provide information, which would reveal confidential communications between a client and an attorney, solicitor or other admitted legal representative where such communications: (a) are communications between a professional legal adviser and a client made in connection with the giving of legal advice to the client; (b) are communications between a professional legal adviser and a client, professional legal adviser acting for the client and another person, or the client and another person made in connection with or in contemplation of legal proceedings and for the purposes of such proceedings; and (c) include items enclosed with or referred to in such communications and made: (i) in connection with the giving of legal advice; or (ii) in connection with or in contemplation of legal proceedings and for the purposes of such proceedings, when the items are in the possession of a person who is entitled to possession of them. 4. A request for information shall not be refused on the ground that the tax claim giving rise to the request is disputed by the taxpayer. 5. The Requested Party may decline a request for information if the information is requested by the Applicant Party to administer or enforce a provision of the tax law of the Applicant Party, or any requirement connected therewith, which discriminates against a national of the Requested Party as compared with a national of the Applicant Party in the same circumstances. ARTICLE 8 Confidentiality Any information received by a Contracting Party under this Agreement shall be treated as confidential and may be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) in the jurisdiction of the Contracting Party concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to, the taxes covered by this Agreement. Such persons or authorities shall use such information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. The information may not be disclosed to any other person or entity or authority or any other jurisdiction without the express written consent of the competent authority of the Requested Party. ARTICLE 9 SAFEGUARDS The rights and safeguards secured to persons by the laws or administrative practices of the Requested Party remain applicable. The rights and safeguards may not be applied by the Requested Party in a manner that unduly prevents or delays effective exchange of information. ARTICLE 10 COSTS Incidents of costs incurred in providing assistance (including reasonable costs of third parties and external advisors in connection with litigation or otherwise) shall be agreed by the Contracting Parties. ARTICLE 11 NO PREJUDICIAL OR RESTRICTIVE MEASURES 1. Neither of the Contracting Parties shall apply prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices to residents or nationals of either Contracting Party so long as this Agreement is in force and effective. 2. A "prejudicial or restrictive measure based on harmful tax practices" is a measure applied by one Contracting Party to residents or nationals of either Contracting Party on the basis that the other Contracting Party does not engage in effective exchange of information and/or because it lacks transparency in the operation of its laws, regulations or administrative practices, or on the basis of no or nominal taxes and one of the preceding criteria. 3. Without limiting the generality of paragraph 2 the term "prejudicial or restrictive measure" includes the denial of a deduction, credit or exemption, the imposition of a tax, charge or levy, or special reporting requirements. ARTICLE 12 Mutual agreement procedure 1. The competent authorities of the Contracting Parties shall jointly endeavour to resolve any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of this Agreement. 2. In addition to the endeavours referred to in paragraph 1, the competent authorities of the Contracting Parties may mutually determine the procedures to be used under Articles 5 and 6. 3. The competent authorities of the Contracting Parties may communicate with each other directly for the purposes of this Article. 4. The Contracting Parties may also agree on other forms of dispute resolution. ARTICLE 13 ENTRY INTO FORCE The Contracting Parties shall notify each other in writing through the diplomatic channel of the completion of their constitutional and legal procedures for the entry into force of this Agreement. This Agreement shall enter into force on the date of the last notification, and shall thereupon have effect in relation to all matters covered by Article 1 for taxable periods beginning on or after the first day of the thirteenth month next following entry into force, or where there is no taxable period, for all charges to tax arising on or after the first day of the thirteenth month next following entry into force. Article 14 Termination 1. Either Contracting Party may, after the expiration of 3�years from the date of its entry into force, terminate the Agreement by serving a written notice of termination to the other Contracting Party through the diplomatic channel. 2.

AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF NEW ZEALAND AND THE GOVERNMENT OF BERMUDA (AS AUTHORISED BY) THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND ON THE EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF NEW ZEALAND AND THE GOVERNMENT OF BERMUDA (AS AUTHORISED BY) THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND ON THE EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES THE GOVERNMENT OF NEW ZEALAND AND THE GOVERNMENT OF BERMUDA (AS AUTHORISED BY) THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND, DESIRING TO FACILITATE THE EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES, HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS: ARTICLE 1 OBJECT AND SCOPE OF THE AGREEMENT The competent authorities of the Contracting Parties shall provide assistance through exchange of information that is relevant to the administration and enforcement of the domestic laws of the Contracting Parties concerning taxes covered by this Agreement. Such information shall include information that is relevant to the determination, assessment and collection of such taxes, the recovery and enforcement of tax claims, or the investigation or prosecution of tax matters. Information shall be exchanged in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and shall be treated as confidential in the manner provided in Article 8. ARTICLE 2 JURISDICTION A Requested Party is not obligated to provide information which is neither held by its authorities nor in the possession or control of persons who are within its territorial jurisdiction. ARTICLE 3 TAXES COVERED 1. The existing taxes which are the subject of this Agreement are: (a) in New Zealand, direct taxes of every kind and description; and (b) in Bermuda, taxes of every kind and description. 2.

The Agreement shall also apply to such other taxes as may be agreed in an exchange of letters between the 2 Contracting Parties. The competent authorities of the Contracting Parties shall notify each other of any substantial changes to the taxation and related information gathering measures covered by this Agreement within a reasonable time. 3. The Agreement shall not apply to taxes imposed by any states, municipalities, or other political sub-divisions, or possessions of a Contracting Party. ARTICLE 4 DEFINITIONS 1. For the purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise defined: (a) "New Zealand" means the territory of New Zealand but does not include Tokelau; it also includes any area beyond the territorial sea designated under New Zealand legislation and in accordance with international law as an area in which New Zealand may exercise sovereign rights with respect to natural resources; (b) "Bermuda" means the Islands of Bermuda; (c) "Applicant Party" means the Contracting Party requesting information; (d) "collective investment fund or scheme" means any pooled investment vehicle, irrespective of legal form. The term "public collective investment fund or scheme" means any collective investment fund or scheme provided the units, shares or other interests in the fund or scheme can be readily purchased, sold or redeemed by the public. Units, shares or other interests in the fund or scheme can be readily purchased, sold or redeemed "by the public" if the purchase, sale or redemption is not implicitly or explicitly restricted to a limited group of investors; (e) "company" means any body corporate or any entity that is treated as a body corporate for tax purposes; (f) "competent authority" means in the case of New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or an authorised representative of the Commissioner and, in the case of Bermuda, the Minister of Finance or an authorised representative of the Minister; (g) "Contracting Party" means New Zealand or Bermuda as the context requires; (h) "information" means any fact, statement or record in any form whatever; (i) "information gathering measures" means laws and administrative or judicial procedures that enable a Contracting Party to obtain and provide the requested information; (j) "national" means: (i) in the case of New Zealand, any individual possessing the nationality or citizenship of New Zealand; and any legal person, partnership or association deriving its status as such from the laws in force in New Zealand; and 3 (ii) in the case of Bermuda, any legal person, partnership, company, trust, estate, association or other entity deriving its status as such from the laws in force in Bermuda; (k) "person" includes an individual, a company and any other body of persons; (l) "principal class of shares" means the class or classes of shares representing a majority of the voting power and value of the company; (m) "publicly traded company" means any company whose principal class of shares is listed on a recognised stock exchange provided its listed shares can be readily purchased or sold by the public.

It also includes intentionally obstructing, hindering, intimidating or resisting public officials. The tax offence must be of a serious nature. The tax liability must be of a significant or substantial amount, either as an absolute amount or in relation to an annual tax liability, and the conduct involved must either constitute a systematic effort or pattern of activity designed or tending to conceal pertinent facts from or provide inaccurate facts to the tax authorities of either Party, or constitute falsifying or concealing identity; and (r) "tax" means any tax to which this Agreement applies pursuant to Article 3. 2. As regards the application of this Agreement at any time by a Contracting Party, any term not defined herein shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meaning that it has at the time under the law of that Party, any meaning under the applicable tax laws of that Party prevailing over a meaning given to the term under other laws of that Party. 4 ARTICLE 5 EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION UPON REQUEST 1. The competent authority of the Requested Party shall provide upon request information for the purposes referred to in Article 1. Such information shall be exchanged without regard to whether the conduct being investigated would constitute a crime under the laws of the Requested Party if such conduct occurred in the Requested Party. 2. If the information in the possession of the competent authority of the Requested Party is not sufficient to enable it to comply with the request for information, the Requested Party shall use all relevant information gathering measures to provide the Applicant Party with the information requested, notwithstanding that the Requested Party may not need such information for its own tax purposes. 3. If specifically requested by the competent authority of the Applicant Party, the competent authority of the Requested Party shall provide information under this Article, to the extent allowable under its domestic laws, in the form of depositions of witnesses and authenticated copies of original records. 4. (a) Each Contracting Party shall ensure that its competent authority, for the purposes of this Agreement, has the authority to obtain and provide upon request: (i) information held by banks, other financial institutions, and any person, including nominees and trustees, acting in an agency or fiduciary capacity; (ii) information regarding the legal and beneficial ownership of companies, partnerships and other persons, including, within the constraints of Article 2, ownership information on all such persons in an ownership chain; in the case of trusts, information on settlors, trustees, beneficiaries and the position in an ownership chain. (b) This Agreement does not create an obligation on the Contracting Parties to obtain or provide: (i) ownership information with respect to publicly traded companies or public collective investment funds or schemes unless such information can be obtained without giving rise to disproportionate difficulties; (ii) information relating to a period more than six years prior to the tax period under consideration. (c) If information is requested relating to a person that is not a resident or national in one or other of the Contracting Parties, it also shall be established to the satisfaction of the competent authority of the Requested Party that such information is necessary for the proper administration and enforcement of the fiscal laws of the Applicant Party. Where such necessity has been duly established, the competent authorities shall consult as to the appropriate form of assistance. (d) Where the Applicant Party requests information with respect to a matter which does not constitute serious tax evasion, a senior official of its competent authority shall certify 5 that the request is relevant to, and necessary for, the determination of the tax liability of the taxpayer under the laws of the Applicant Party. 5. The competent authority of the Applicant Party shall provide the following information to the competent authority of the Requested Party when making a request for information under this Agreement to demonstrate the relevance of the information sought to the request: (a) the identity of the taxpayer under examination or investigation and evidence that such taxpayer is a resident in, or national of, one of the Contracting Parties; (b) the nature and type of the information requested, including a description of the specific evidence, information or other assistance sought; (c) the tax purposes for which the information is sought and why it is relevant to, and necessary for, the determination of the tax liability of a taxpayer under the laws of the Applicant Party; (d) the period of time with respect to which the information is required for the tax purposes; (e) reasonable grounds for believing that the information requested is present in the jurisdiction of the Requested Party or is in the possession or control of a person subject to the jurisdiction of the Requested Party and may be relevant to the tax purposes of the request; (f) to the extent known, the name and address of any person believed to be in possession or control of the information requested; (g) a statement that the request conforms to the law and administrative practice of the Applicant Party and would be obtainable by the Applicant Party under its laws in similar circumstances, both for its own tax purposes and in response to a valid request from the Requested Party under this Agreement; (h) a statement that the Applicant Party has pursued all means available in its own territory to obtain the information, except those that would give rise to disproportionate difficulties; (i) where the request is directed at a person, other than the taxpayer, confirmation that only information in such person's possession or control that directly relates to the taxpayer need be provided. 6. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 10 in particular, the competent authority of the Requested Party shall forward the requested information as promptly as possible to the Applicant Party. To ensure a prompt response, the competent authority of the Requested Party shall: (a) confirm receipt of a request in writing to the competent authority of the Applicant Party and shall notify the competent authority of the Applicant Party of deficiencies in the request, if any, within 60 days of the receipt of the request; and 6 (b) if the competent authority of the Requested Party has been unable to obtain and provide the information within 90 days of receipt of the request, including if it encounters obstacles in furnishing the information or it refuses to furnish the information, it shall immediately inform the Applicant Party, explaining the reason for its inability, the nature of the obstacles or the reasons for its refusal. ARTICLE 6 TAX EXAMINATIONS ABROAD 1. The Requested Party may allow representatives of the competent authority of the Applicant Party to enter the territory of the Requested Party to interview individuals and examine records with the written consent of the persons concerned. The competent authority of the Applicant Party shall notify the competent authority of the Requested Party of the time and place of the meeting with the individuals concerned. 2. At the request of the competent authority of the Applicant Party, the competent authority of the Requested Party may allow representatives of the competent authority of the Applicant Party to be present at the appropriate part of a tax examination in the Requested Party. 3. If the request referred to in paragraph 2 is acceded to, the competent authority of the Requested Party conducting the examination shall, as soon as possible, notify the competent authority of the Applicant Party about the time and place of the examination, the authority or official designated to carry out the examination and the procedures and conditions required by the Requested Party for the conduct of the examination. All decisions with respect to the conduct of the tax examination shall be made by the Requested Party conducting the examination. ARTICLE 7 POSSIBILITY OF DECLINING A REQUEST 1. The competent authority of the Requested Party may decline to assist where: (a) the request is not made in conformity with this Agreement; (b) the Applicant Party has not pursued all means available in its own jurisdiction, except where recourse to such means would give rise to disproportionate difficulty; (c) the disclosure of the information requested would be contrary to the public policy of the Requested Party; (d) the request is directed at a person, other than the taxpayer, in respect of information that does not relate specifically to the tax affairs of the taxpayer; or (e) the Applicant Party would not be able to obtain the information (i) under its own laws for purposes of administration or enforcement of its own tax laws or (ii) in response to a valid request from the Requested Party under this Agreement. 7 2. The provisions of this Agreement shall not impose on a Contracting Party the obligation to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process. Notwithstanding the foregoing, information of the type referred to in paragraph 4 of Article 5 shall not be treated as such a secret or trade process merely because it meets the criteria in that paragraph. 3. The provisions of this Agreement shall not impose on a Contracting Party the obligation to obtain or provide information, which would reveal confidential communications between a client and an attorney, solicitor or other admitted legal representative where such communications: (a) are communications between a professional legal adviser and a client made in connection with the giving of legal advice to the client; (b) are communications between a professional legal adviser and a client, professional legal adviser acting for the client and another person, or the client and another person made in connection with or in contemplation of legal proceedings and for the purposes of such proceedings; and (c) include items enclosed with or referred to in such communications and made: (i) in connection with the giving of legal advice; or (ii) in connection with or in contemplation of legal proceedings and for the purposes of such proceedings, when the items are in the possession of a person who is entitled to possession of them. 4. A request for information shall not be refused on the ground that the tax claim giving rise to the request is disputed by the taxpayer. 5. The Requested Party may decline a request for information if the information is requested by the Applicant Party to administer or enforce a provision of the tax law of the Applicant Party, or any requirement connected therewith, which discriminates against a national of the Requested Party as compared with a national of the Applicant Party in the same circumstances . ARTICLE 8 CONFIDENTIALITY Any information received by a Contracting Party under this Agreement shall be treated as confidential and may be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) in the jurisdiction of the Contracting Party concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to, the taxes covered by this Agreement. Such persons or authorities shall use such information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. The information may not be disclosed to any other person or entity or authority or any other jurisdiction without the express written consent of the competent authority of the Requested Party. ARTICLE 9 SAFEGUARDS 8 The rights and safeguards secured to persons by the laws or administrative practices of the Requested Party remain applicable. The rights and safeguards may not be applied by the Requested Party in a manner that unduly prevents or delays effective exchange of information. ARTICLE 10 COSTS Incidents of costs incurred in providing assistance (including reasonable costs of third parties and external advisors in connection with litigation or otherwise) shall be agreed by the Contracting Parties. ARTICLE 11 NO PREJUDICIAL OR RESTRICTIVE MEASURES 1. Neither of the Contracting Parties shall apply prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices to residents or nationals of either Contracting Party so long as this Agreement is in force and effective. 2. A "prejudicial or restrictive measure based on harmful tax practices" is a measure applied by one Contracting Party to residents or nationals of either Contracting Party on the basis that the other Contracting Party does not engage in effective exchange of information and/or because it lacks transparency in the operation of its laws, regulations or administrative practices, or on the basis of no or nominal taxes and one of the preceding criteria. 3. Without limiting the generality of paragraph 2 the term "prejudicial or restrictive measure" includes the denial of a deduction, credit or exemption, the imposition of a tax, charge or levy, or special reporting requirements. ARTICLE 12 MUTUAL AGREEMENT PROCEDURE 1. The competent authorities of the Contracting Parties shall jointly endeavour to resolve any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of this Agreement. 2. In addition to the endeavours referred to in paragraph 1, the competent authorities of the Contracting Parties may mutually determine the procedures to be used under Articles 5 and 6. 3. The competent authorities of the Contracting Parties may communicate with each other directly for the purposes of this Article. 4. The Contracting Parties may also agree on other forms of dispute resolution. ARTICLE 13 ENTRY INTO FORCE 9 The Contracting Parties shall notify each other in writing through the diplomatic channel of the completion of their constitutional and legal procedures for the entry into force of this Agreement. This Agreement shall enter into force on the date of the last notification, and shall thereupon have effect in relation to all matters covered by Article 1 for taxable periods beginning on or after the first day of the thirteenth month next following entry into force, or where there is no taxable period, for all charges to tax arising on or after the first day of the thirteenth month next following entry into force. ARTICLE 14 TERMINATION 1. Either Contracting Party may, after the expiration of 3 years from the date of its entry into force, terminate the Agreement by serving a written notice of termination to the other Contracting Party through the diplomatic channel. 2. Such termination shall become effective on the first day of the month following the expiration of a period of six months after the date of receipt of notice of termination by the other Contracting Party. 3. A Contracting Party shall remain bound by the provisions of Article 8 with respect to any information obtained under the Agreement.

ARTICLE 3 Definitions 1 For the purposes of this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires: (a) the term "New Zealand" means the territory of New Zealand but does not include Tokelau; it also includes any area beyond the territorial sea designated under New Zealand legislation and in accordance with international law as an area in which New Zealand may exercise sovereign rights with respect to natural resources; (b) the term "Bermuda" means the Islands of Bermuda; (c) the term "competent authority" means in the case of New Zealand the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or an authorised representative of the Commissioner and, in the case of Bermuda means the Minister of Finance or an authorised representative of the Minister; (d) the term "Contracting Party" means New Zealand or Bermuda as the context requires; (e) the term "national" means (i) for New Zealand, an individual who possesses the nationality or citizenship of New Zealand; and (ii) for Bermuda, an individual who possesses Bermudian status as defined by the Bermuda Immigration and Protection Act 1956; (f) the term "person" includes an individual, a company and any other body of persons; (g) the term "tax" means New Zealand tax or Bermuda tax as the context requires; and (h) the term "transfer pricing adjustment" means an adjustment made by the competent authority of a Contracting Party to the profits of an enterprise as a result of applying the domestic law concerning taxes referred to in Article 2 of that Party regarding transfer pricing. 2 As regards the application of this Agreement at any time by a Contracting Party, any term not defined therein shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meaning that it has at that time under the law of that Party, for the purposes of the taxes to which this Agreement applies, any meaning under the applicable tax laws of that Party prevailing over a meaning given to the term under other laws of that Party. ARTICLE 4 Resident 1 For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "resident of a Contracting Party" means: (a) in the case of New Zealand, a person who is a resident of New Zealand for the purposes of New Zealand tax; and (b) in the case of Bermuda, an individual who is ordinarily resident in Bermuda; and a company, a partnership, trust or association created under the laws of Bermuda. 2 A person is not a resident of a Contracting Party for the purposes of the Agreement if the person is liable to tax in that Party in respect only of income from sources in that Party. 3 Where by reason of the preceding provisions of this Article a person, being an individual, is a resident of both Contracting Parties, then the person's status shall be determined as follows: (a) the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the Party in which a permanent home is available to that individual; if a permanent home is available in both Parties, or in neither of them, that individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the Party with which the individual's personal and economic relations are closer (centre of vital interests); (b) if the Party in which the individual has their centre of vital interests cannot be determined, the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the Party of which the individual is a national; (c) if the individual is a national of both Parties or of neither of them, the competent authorities of the Contracting Parties shall endeavour to resolve the question by mutual agreement. 4 Where by reason of paragraph 1 a person other than an individual is a resident of both Contracting Parties, then it shall be deemed to be a resident only of the Party in which its place of effective management is situated. ARTICLE 5 Pensions 1 Pensions, (including government pensions) annuities and other remunerations paid to an individual who is a resident of a Contracting Party in consideration of past employment shall be taxable only in that Party. Pensions and other payments made under the social security legislation of a Contracting Party to an individual who is a resident of the other Contracting Party shall be taxable only in that other Party. 3 However, paragraphs 1 and 2 of this article shall not apply where the pension, payment, annuities or other remuneration is not subject to tax in the Contracting Party of which the individual is a resident. ARTICLE 6 Government Service 1 (a) Salaries, wages and other similar remuneration, other than pensions, paid by the Government of Bermuda to an individual in respect of services rendered to that Government in the discharge of governmental functions shall be exempt from New Zealand tax if the individual is not resident in New Zealand or is resident in New Zealand solely for the purposes of rendering those services. (b) Salaries, wages and other similar remuneration, other than a pension, paid by the Government of New Zealand to an individual in respect of services rendered to that Government in the discharge of governmental functions shall be exempt from Bermuda tax if the individual is not resident in Bermuda or is resident in Bermuda solely for the purposes of rendering those services. 2 Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, salaries, wages and other similar remuneration in respect of services rendered in connection with any trade or business carried on by a Contracting Party thereof may be taxed in accordance with the laws of a Contracting Party. ARTICLE 7 Students Payments which a student or business apprentice, who is or was immediately before visiting a Contracting Party a resident of the other Contracting Party and who is temporarily present in the first-mentioned Party solely for the purpose of their education or training, receives for the purpose of their maintenance, education or training shall not be taxed in that Party, provided such payments arise from sources outside that Party. ARTICLE 8 Mutual agreement procedure IN RESPECT OF TRANSFER PRICING ADJUSTMENTS 1 Where a resident of a Contracting Party considers the actions of the other Contracting Party results or will result in a transfer pricing adjustment not in accordance with the arm�s length principle, the resident may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those Parties, present a case to the competent authority of the first-mentioned Party. The case must be presented within 3 years of the first notification of the adjustment. 2 The competent authorities shall endeavour to resolve any difficulties or doubts arising as to the application of the arm�s length principle by a Contracting Party regarding transfer pricing adjustments. They may also communicate with each other directly for the purposes of this Article. ARTICLE 9 EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION The competent authorities of the Contracting Parties shall exchange such information as is relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Agreement. Information may be exchanged by the competent authorities for the purposes of this Article in accordance with provisions of the Agreement on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes concluded by the Contracting Parties. ARTICLE 10 ENTRY INTO FORCE The Contracting Parties shall notify each other, in writing, through the diplomatic channel of the completion of their constitutional and legal procedures for the entry into force of this Agreement. This Agreement shall enter into force on the date of the last notification, and shall, provided an Agreement on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes is in force between the Contracting Parties, thereupon have effect for any year of income beginning on or after the thirteenth month next following the entry into force of this Agreement. Article 11 Termination 1 This Agreement shall continue in effect indefinitely, but either of the Contracting Parties may, after the expiration of 3�years from the date of its entry into force, give to the other Contracting Party through the diplomatic channel written notice of termination. 2 Such termination shall become effective on the first day of the month following the expiration of a period of 6 months after the date of the receipt of notice of termination by the other Contracting Party.     PAGE9  '23:PQRbc����������    / Y Z \[ \\ n � � � � � � �

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Dunne: Further consultation on international tax rules

Revenue Minister Peter Dunne today announced a new round of consultation on the reform of New Zealand's international tax rules.

Addressing the International Fiscal Association conference in Christchurch this morning, he released an issues paper seeking feedback on suggested changes to the treatment of non-portfolio foreign investment funds.

"This consultation paper builds on the comprehensive reforms made last year to the taxation of New Zealand companies that have offshore subsidiaries so they can compete in world markets on the same basis as foreign competitors," Mr Dunne said.

"The main feature of those reforms was the introduction of an exemption from New Zealand tax on income earned through controlled foreign companies undertaking "active" business activities such as manufacturing, distribution or sales functions.

"This issues paper continues the reform process by looking at ways to remove further taxation obstacles to New Zealand companies' international competitiveness.

"In particular, it looks at how the tax exemption might be extended to some investment interests made by New Zealand companies in foreign companies - known as foreign investment funds or FIFs - in which they are not the controlling partner.

"New Zealand firms will often choose to enter new markets by establishing links with a partner in the host country by setting up a jointly owned entity. New Zealand firms considering expanding overseas may also use subsidiaries, joint ventures and other substantial investment in foreign markets in which they are not the controlling partner.

"While the New Zealand firm may not own the entity it usually makes a substantial contribution in areas such as management, or by providing technical or marketing expertise.

"These types of arrangement can bring considerable economic benefits to New Zealand businesses by allowing firms to improve their market knowledge or access to customers and suppliers in a way that facilitates export growth or an increase in high-value research, design and management activities in New Zealand.

"It is important that the tax system does not act as a barrier to New Zealand companies looking for opportunities to expand into new and emerging markets. The changes suggested in this issues paper focus on making the FIF rules easier and more coherent for taxpayers and advisors to understand and operate so that New Zealand firms can reap the commercial advantages of global investment more easily," Mr Dunne said.

The issues paper, New Zealand's International Tax Review: extending the active income exemption to non-portfolio FIFs, is available at www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz.

The closing date for submissions is 30 April 2010.

SPEECH

### Address to 33rd International Fiscal Association (IFA) Conference

**Holiday Inn City Centre, Christchurch**

**9am, Friday 19 March 2010**

Last year when I was invited to address your annual conference, New Zealand was facing one of its greatest economic challenges since the great depression of the 1930s.

Most of our trading partners were in recession and taking urgent steps to prevent economic collapse.

In New Zealand, our own economy was shrinking, our government deficit had ballooned, businesses were closing and unemployment levels were beginning to rise to levels not seen since the early 1990s.

In this context of global economic crisis, governments around the world were faced with many challenges.

Among them was the immediate problem of preserving their revenue base while balancing the needs and expectations of households and businesses facing economic hardship.

As part of the Government's immediate response, a $450 million package of tax assistance measures was introduced to help the smaller enterprises that make up over 95 percent of New Zealand businesses to weather the downturn.

The personal tax cuts introduced from 1 April 2009 also gave New Zealanders more money in their pockets.

Just 12 months later we appear to have come through the worst of the crisis in reasonable health.

The economy is again beginning to grow, employer confidence is lifting, and recent Crown accounts show core Crown revenue was $102 million higher than forecast at $32.4 billion in the seven months to 31 January while core crown expenses were $678 million below forecast at $36.2 billion.

While I think it is safe to say we have weathered the worst of the economic downturn somewhat better than some of our trading partners, our distance from the epicentre of the global economic collapse means we still have no cause for complacency.

Indeed, the recession reinforced the need for several of the most intensive reviews of New Zealand’s wider economic environment in a decade, opening for scrutiny and debate the foundations of our capital markets, our regulatory environment and, of course, our tax system.

The release in mid-December of the Capital Markets Development Taskforce's recommendations to improve the functioning of New Zealand's capital markets gave us the opportunity to review the overall health and efficiency of our capital markets.

As Minister of Revenue, I was particularly pleased that a significant number of those recommendations showed a high level of support for the Government's current tax policy work, and its programme towards building a world-class tax system.

It confirmed my personal view that while there are some areas that need attention, the New Zealand tax system has many solid features.

For example, we consistently rate highly in OECD rankings of transparency and ease in paying taxes.

Our GST system is perceived internationally as a model of simplicity and clarity, and the administrative costs of raising revenue are modest by international standards.

That message came through very clearly in the area of company taxation, for example, where four of the Taskforce's recommendations endorsed much of the Government's current work relating to the future shape and direction for our imputation system.

With the Henry Review in Australia now unlikely to be released until later this year, the Taskforce's endorsement confirms we are on the right track.

The formation of the Victoria University Tax Working Group in May last year and its work in placing the tax system under the microscope has helped to catapult the subject of tax into the mainstream of public debate, and done much to advance the Government's longer term vision of a tax system that will help to promote economic growth.

That is a credit to the scope and depth of the Group's work.

The Tax Working Group was a new approach to the development of policy thinking.

The Group was formed and operated independent of government, but with significant government input from officials.

The process was very open, with papers and discussions posted on the Group's website.

It was not a foregone conclusion that this novel approach would work; but I think there is a general consensus that it did.

The process allowed issues to be highlighted, and provided a framework for future tax reform to emerge.

As is clear from the Prime Minister's Statement to Parliament earlier this year, the Government has accepted the need to address the issues the Group highlighted and the reform framework the Group set out in its final report.

All things considered, it has been a very successful process.

As you know, the Group's recommendations are still being reviewed by the Government in detail and final decisions on the overall shape of any tax reforms will be announced in the Budget on May 20.

However it is pretty clear that there are certain areas of the tax system that should be addressed.

Accordingly, we are likely to see changes to the tax treatment of property to make the rules fairer and more equitable for all taxpayers.

This is not an attack on landlords, as some have protested, but a rebalancing act designed to address the concerns highlighted by both the Tax Working Group and the Governor of the Reserve Bank over the years about distortions favouring property investment over other forms of investment.

In short, we want investment decisions to be driven by the quality of the particular investments, not just the tax advantages that may derive from them.

There are also likely to be lower personal taxes across the board – not just for the top end of the income scale as some allege - to encourage productivity, investment and saving.

And much debate has ranged over the proposal to lift the GST rate to 15 percent, with appropriate compensation for those who need it.

I can make two points about that: there will be no increase in the rate of GST unless there is appropriate compensation, and there certainly will be no exemptions of specific items introduced into the GST system.

We are still considering the company tax rate and its relationship to the top personal tax rate and that of trusts.

As you know, I have long advocated a 30/30/30 alignment of tax rates as a simple solution to deal with problems that arise as a result of the differences in tax rates that allow companies and trusts to be used to shelter income.

The problem remains however, that in spite of the relatively recent reduction in the company tax rate from 33 percent to 30 percent, our rate remains higher than many OECD countries.

This does not necessarily mean that we need to drop the rate to match or outpace other countries.

There are trade-offs between:

*   a tax system that is as simple and coherent as possible;
*   the need for New Zealand to have a company rate that is attractive to investment compared with other countries; and
*   the fiscal constraints that the Government must operate under.

These are issues that Ministers are still weighing up, but the bottom line is, in line with the Working Group's conclusions, we want a tax system that is basically fair, competitive, and coherent.

As a partner in the world economy, our responses to tax policy development must be approached in the context of what is happening elsewhere in the world, yet tempered by our own unique set of social and economic circumstances as a small, geographically isolated economy.

We have made considerable advances over the past year in our international tax reforms and international tax negotiations with other countries.

Legislation enacted in December last year introduced a tax exemption for interests in controlled foreign companies that earn active income, a move aimed at making New Zealand a more competitive base for internationalised firms and enabling New Zealand-based businesses to compete more effectively in foreign markets.

A consultation paper was also released late last year which looks at whether AIL – the approved issuer levy – should apply at a zero rate, rather than the usual 2% on interest paid on corporate bonds that meet certain criteria.

AIL, which in some circumstances is an alternative to paying non-resident withholding tax on interest paid to non-residents, has sometimes been identified as a possible impediment to further growth of our bond market.

A new round of consultation is also about to begin with the release today of an issues paper on the tax treatment of non-portfolio foreign investment funds.

The main proposal in the issues paper is to extend the tax exemption that is already provided for controlling interests in foreign companies, to significant but non-controlling interests.

That will further reduce the obstacles to New Zealand companies' international competitiveness.

The proposal reflects the importance of joint ventures and other partnering arrangements in the expansion plans of New Zealand-headquartered enterprises.

These types of arrangements can bring considerable economic benefits to New Zealand businesses by allowing firms to improve their market knowledge or access to customers in a way that facilitates export growth or contributes towards research, design and management activities in New Zealand.

The paper will be available on Inland Revenue's Tax Policy website from today, with a closing date for submissions of 30 April.

Work has also been steadily progressed on our programme of tax treaty negotiations over the past year.

Most recently, two new tax Information Exchange agreements were signed this week with Dominica, and St Vincent and the Grenadines.

These bilateral treaties provide for full exchange of information on civil and criminal matters between two countries and are an important benchmark for offshore financial centres in meeting OECD standards for transparency and the exchange of information.

The growing number of these treaties is part of a new international emphasis on tax co-operation that is enabling Inland Revenue to get more and better information from its treaty partners concerning overseas transactions and investments made by New Zealand tax residents.

In the past year we also have advanced a number of other significant tax treaty negotiations, including a new double tax agreement signed with Australia.

Once in force, the Australia DTA will mean lower withholding taxes on dividend and royalty payments between the two countries and make pensions that are tax-free in one country also exempt in the other when recipients move across the Tasman.

2010 is also shaping up to be a busy year, with the first round of negotiations with the UK underway, a second round with Canada later in the year, and other negotiations in the pipeline.

We are also in the final stages of bringing the new Australian and United States treaties into force.

Once in force, these international agreements play an important role in facilitating trade and investment between New Zealand and our partner jurisdictions by reducing tax impediments to the course of business.

For our businesses to be successful in the international marketplace New Zealand must be seen to be part of a global tax system that is transparent, coherent and robust.

Strengthening our international tax relationships however is only part of the tax reform story.

Over the past couple of years I have gone on record as saying we cannot have a world-class, internationally competitive tax system that delivers fairness, equity and efficiency by policy measures alone.

We also need a first-class tax administration that collects revenue and delivers services with speed, certainty and in a way that allows taxpayers to self-manage their tax affairs with confidence in the technology, systems and people they are dealing with.

To turn this vision into reality, Inland Revenue has begun a major exercise that will see its administrative functions move away from the largely paper-based systems it has operated for the past two decades to the use of technologies that better reflect the needs of businesses using e-business tools and the internet.

Over time, much of the way Inland Revenue goes about its business will be transformed – from improving processes, re-engineering systems and renewing IT infrastructures towards a fundamental change in the way the department and taxpayers interact.

Legislation will be introduced in the next few months that will begin this process by simplifying the administration of student loan repayments by replacing the previous paper-based management of loan repayments to electronic management and communications.

The next step will be to look at ways to improve the functioning of the PAYE and personal tax summary systems.

One of the best ways that Inland Revenue can help support the efforts of business to be productive, competitive players in our economy is to minimise the amount of paper, telephone contacts and manual interventions that it currently takes for businesses to complete their tax obligations.

There are two strategies that can be employed in parallel to achieve this.

The first is to reduce the number of interactions which need to take place.

The second is to move as many as possible of those contacts which do need to take place into the electronic channel, where they can take place more quickly and more efficiently.

Implementing these proposals will dramatically change, for the better, the way in which employers, businesses and individuals interact with Inland Revenue.

I see this as a real opportunity for government to support the efforts of business, and I hope that we will be able to start consulting on these proposals in the second half of this year.

I would now like to bring you up to date with some of the other recent developments on the tax policy agenda.

In December last year I announced the release of an issues paper seeking submissions on how a system of income splitting for parents of dependent children might work.

This was pursuant to the provisions of the National/UnitedFuture confidence and supply agreement.

Submissions closed in February and officials are now working on the detail of proposals, based on the 54 submissions received with a view to developing legislation which I will introduce later this year.

I am also pleased to announce that I have agreed to a proposal to expand the Rewrite Advisory Panel’s current role of the panel to include the consideration of tax remedial matters not arising from the Rewrite Project.

As you are probably aware, the Rewrite Advisory Panel was established to review submissions on any unintended changes in the law in the rewritten tax legislation and, where necessary, to recommend appropriate legislative action.

It has also maintained a watching brief to ensure our tax legislation remains consistent with the objectives of the rewrite project in drafting tax law that is clear and in plain English style so taxpayers can easily understand and comply with the rules.

I have now agreed to a proposal to expand the role of the Panel to include remedial matters that do not arise from the rewrite project.

These may be matters that are raised by tax practitioners or Inland Revenue with a view to remedial amendments to any of the Inland Revenue Acts.

However, my expectation is that these remedial amendments would normally not relate to matters accepted for the tax policy work programme where relevant remedial matters would generally be included in existing projects.

Because the scope of the proposal is potentially quite large, only issues on particular topics will be called for – at least initially.

There are also a number of practical issues that will need to be resolved concerning how the new process will operate.

These include how Inland Revenue should receive and, if necessary, clarify potential remedial issues with tax practitioners, how issues that have been accepted for consideration are allocated to a relevant tax policy team to consider and research options, and how the Panel will ultimately deal with the submissions.

This new initiative recognises the success of the Rewrite Advisory Panel under the chairmanship of Colin Blair, Sir Ivor Richardson, and now David McLay, in providing a vehicle for effectively dealing with technical issues.

It also recognises the importance of ensuring that remedial work is progressed and that necessary running repairs and maintenance are handled efficiently.

We are investing considerable resources in reforms to build a world-class tax system, but we also need to be conscious that quick responses to remedial questions form an important part of this.

However, when priorities are set for the tax policy work programme, remedial work tends to be crowded out by other urgent matters.

Using the Rewrite Advisory Panel is a way of ensuring there is a mechanism for retaining a focus on remedial work that is quick and efficient.

Other tax policy projects in the pipeline for 2010 include consultation on the changes relating to the transforming of Inland Revenue's administrative functions that I mentioned earlier, an issues paper which examines concerns with the dispute resolution and challenge procedures and a paper which will look at clarifying the tax rules in relation to International Financial Reporting Standards.

All in all, 2010 is set to be another busy year for tax as we build upon the achievements of last year.

Among those was the successful resolution of Inland Revenue's long-standing court dispute relating to cross-border structured finance transactions that were widely used by foreign-owned New Zealand banks in the late 1990s and early 2000s to reduce their local tax liability.

It is good that this long standing issue has been resolved and that all parties can now move forward as we continue our work towards making the New Zealand tax system as efficient, fair and equitable as it can be.

While the likely tax content of Budget 2010 looks set to remain the primary focus of public attention in the coming weeks, I believe we can be confident that the changes we make will help to ensure that the tax system remains robust, and that it fulfils its function of supporting an economy that delivers quality services for the people of New Zealand.

Our work towards this goal will also be reflected in the new tax policy work programme for the next 18 months.

The current tax policy work programme was released in March last year and work involved in the Budget and any follow-up to that will inevitably require a review of the work programme.

This will be undertaken as soon as possible after the Budget.

It will require some hard choices to be made on what measures we can and should proceed with given our priorities as outlined in the Budget, and current resource and fiscal restraints.

As always, I appreciate any input you may have on where our ongoing priorities should be.

That brings my comments on the tax system today to a close.

I wish you well for the rest of the conference and look forward to your contribution to the debate as we work together to build a world-class tax system.

**More funding for Inland Revenue to strengthen tax compliance**

Inland Revenue will receive more funding to increase its audit and compliance activity around debt collection, the hidden economy and property transactions.  The GST rules will be changed from 1 April 2011 to prevent "phoenix" arrangements.  Under the changes, transactions between GST-registered persons involving land will be zero-rated. See:

More information:  
A special report by the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue which explains the technical details of the tax package proposals will be published here later today, after Budget day legislation is introduced.

The full set of Budget 2010 documents can be found at: [http://www.treasury.govt.nz/budget/2010](http://www.treasury.govt.nz/budget/2010)
1 20 May 2010 Budget 2010 tax changes – at a glance The tax package comprises: Personal tax cuts to reward effort, help families get ahead and encourage savings • All personal income tax rates will be cut from 1 October 2010. Income Current rates New rates $0 - $14,000 12.5% 10.5% $14,001 - $48,000 21.0% 17.5% $48,001 - $70,000 33.0% 30.0% Over $70,000 38.0% 33.0% • After-tax earned incomes at all levels of taxable income will rise by more than the increase in GST. • Secondary tax and resident withholding tax rates will be reduced from 1 October 2010, to align with the new personal tax rates. • Individuals and families can work out how Budget 2010 tax changes personally affect them at www.taxguide.govt.nz An increase in GST to encourage savings over consumption • GST will be increased from 12.5 per cent to 15 per cent from 1 October 2010. • Income support and other payments will be increased by 2.02 per cent from 1 October 2010, to compensate for this increase. These payments include: Rewards effort and helps families get ahead Attracts and retains skilled people in New Zealand Encourages savings and productive investment Makes the tax system fairer At all taxable income levels, tax cuts more than offset the GST rise 2 o All main benefits, Student Allowances and a number of supplementary benefits. o NZ Superannuation, Veterans Pension and CPI-adjusted Government Superannuation Fund and National Provident Fund payments. o Working for Families (Family Tax Credit and Minimum Family Tax Credit). Reductions in tax for companies and savings vehicles to encourage investment and savings • The company tax rate will fall from 30 per cent to 28 per cent from the 2011/12 income year. • The top tax rate for most portfolio investment entities (PIEs) will fall from 30 per cent to 28 per cent, while the other PIE rates drop to align with the new personal tax rates, from 1 October 2010. • The tax rate for life insurance policy holders and widely-held savings vehicles like unit trusts and superannuation funds will fall from 30 per cent to 28 per cent from the 2011/12 income year. Changes to depreciation rules to better reflect asset value reality • No depreciation deductions will be allowed for buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more (such as rental housing and office buildings) from the 2011/12 income year. • The current 20 per cent depreciation loading on new plant and equipment will be removed, for assets purchased after Budget day. Stricter tax rules for foreign multinationals to reduce their ability to minimise tax payments in New Zealand • Tax rules will change from the 2011/12 income year to reduce the interest deductions foreign multinationals can take by having high levels of debt allocated to their New Zealand subsidiaries. Changes to loss attributing qualifying company (LAQC) and qualifying company (QC) rules to ensure investors are taxed at the correct rate • LAQC and QC rules will be tightened from income years starting on or after 1 April 2011 to prevent people choosing to have losses deducted at their marginal personal tax rate but profits taxed at the lower company tax rate. Making Working for Families fairer • People will no longer be able to use investment losses, including from rental properties, to reduce their income and become eligible for Working for Families, from 1 April 2011. 3 • One part of the formula that adjusts Working for Families payments for inflation will be amended because it currently gives higher-income families a greater proportional increase than lower-income families. Tackling tax avoidance and improving the integrity of the tax system • IRD will get a significant funding boost to increase its audit and compliance activity around debt collection, the hidden economy and property transactions. • GST rules will be changed to stop the use of “phoenix” GST fraud schemes. Questions and Answers How much does the tax package cost? The tax package is fiscally neutral to the Government over the medium term. Costs in the first year are $460 million, but that is simply a timing issue around when different measures can be implemented. The package is revenue positive by the final year of the forecast period, as set out below. Costs of the tax package in the forecast period Costs ($m) 2010/112011/122012/132013/14 TOTAL Personal tax cuts -2,455-3,685-3,935-4,255 -14,330 Compensation for GST increase -420-585-610-620 -2,235 Companies, PIEs, etc to 28% -35-380-505-365 -1,285 IRD implementation costs -10000 -10 Total costs -2,920-4,650-5,050-5,240 -17,860 Revenue raising & savings ($m) GST to 15% (excluding clawback) 1,5902,2352,3452,460 8,630 Tax clawback 450605640700 2,395 GST base maintenance 15606060 195 Changes to depreciation rules 1409351,0001,045 3,120 Changes to LAQC rules 0706555 190 Thin cap threshold to 60% 0200200200 600 Changes to Working for Families 5407565 185 Increase in tobacco excise 135180210190 715 Increased audit/compliance activity 120210210205 745 Total revenue raising & savings ($m) 2,4554,5354,8054,980 16,775 Estimated macroeconomic effects 525205435 670 NET IMPACT ($M) -460 -90 -40 175 -415 4 Why is the compensation set at 2.02 per cent when GST is going up by 2.5 per cent? We have been advised by both Statistics New Zealand and the Treasury that the expected increase in the Consumer Price Index as a result of increasing GST is about 2 per cent. That is based on prices on items covered by GST going up by 2.22 per cent, but only about 91 per cent of spending on goods and services is on items that incur GST. How much does the tax package boost the economy? Treasury’s economic models are able to build in some, but not all, of the effects of the tax package on the economy. It estimates the package will increase the size of the economy by about 0.9 percent, spread over seven years. Doesn’t the tax package just favour high-income people? Not at all. Higher-income earners get the most benefit from income tax cuts, but they also bear most of the cost of other changes such as those around depreciation. The overall result is the tax package has a broadly even impact across household groups defined by income (see table below and graph on the next page). Impact of the tax package as a percentage of average disposable income, by bands of household incomes Less than $40,000 $40,000 to $85,000 Over $85,000 Personal income tax 0.9%2.8%4.2% GST -2.5%-2.5%-2.6% Compensation via income support 2.6%0.6%0.1% Other measures in the package -0.3%-0.5%-1.0% Net impact 0.7%0.4%0.7% In addition, aligning the top tax rate with the trust tax rate at 33 per cent ensures wage earners in the top tax bracket like many high-school teachers, nurses and police no longer pay a higher rate of tax than wealthy individuals who have been able to structure their affairs to effectively select the tax rate they want. A recent IRD survey of the 100 wealthiest New Zealanders found only half were paying the top tax rate. It also helps attract and retain these skilled New Zealanders, who might otherwise look for better opportunities overseas. 5 Impact of tax changes on households While higher income earners receive larger income tax reductions, they also bear the impact of most of the tax base broadening. The table below estimates the impact of the tax package on households at different income levels. The net gains are distributed broadly proportionally across household income groups. Estimated impact of tax changes as % of the average disposable household income Where possible, the static fiscal impacts for the 2011/12 year have been allocated to three household income bands. Where the main impact of a tax measure is on companies or trusts, the allocation to households reflects current dividend payment patterns. Some of the impact of the tax package (eg, changes to thin capitalisation rules and some proportion of the changes to the company tax rate and depreciation rules) has been allocated to non-residents and so is not shown here. The allocations are based on Household Economic Survey and Survey of Family, Income and Employment data sourced from Statistics New Zealand. 0.9% -2.5% 2.6% 0.1% -0.2% -0.2% 0.7% 2.8% -2.5% 0.6% 0.2% -0.4% -0.3% 0.4% 4.2% -2.6% 0.1% 0.3% -0.9% -0.4% 0.7% Households earning <$40k Households earning $40k - $85k Households earning > $85k Personal income tax GST NZS & benefit compensation Changes to depreciation rules\* Net impact Company tax & top PIE rate\* Integrity measures (WfF , GST, LAQC, Audit)\* \* indicates that because part of the impact of these measures is on companies, this impact has been partially allocated offshore and partially through dividend distribution data to households 6 How much of the tax package goes to middle-income earners? Looking at the collective impact of all tax cuts since 1996 - including Budget 2010 and excluding Working for Families – it is clear that low and middle income earners have been the big winners. After the Budget 2010 changes, workers earning between $15,000 and $50,000 a year are now paying between 40 and 50 per cent less tax than they were in 1996. The proportionate gains then fall away for people on higher incomes. This chart shows only changes to personal income tax rates including the Low Income Rebate, which was an integral part of the tax scale from the 1980s until 2008, and the Independent Earner Tax Credit, introduced in 2009.
1 20 May 2010 Fact sheet – GST and compensation What is changing? • The rate of GST will increase from 12.5 per cent to 15 per cent from 1 October 2010. • The Government will provide immediate compensation for the rise in GST, increasing payments from 1 October 2010 by 2.02 per cent for all those receiving: o New Zealand Superannuation or a Veterans Pension. o All main benefits, such as the Unemployment Benefit, the Sickness Benefit, the Invalid's Benefit and the Domestic Purposes Benefit. o The maximum rates of the Disability Allowance, Child Disability Allowance and Childcare subsidies paid through Work and Income. o The Family Tax Credit and Minimum Family Tax Credit, which are part of the Working for Families scheme. o Student Allowances. o CPI-adjusted payments from the Government Superannuation Fund or National Provident Fund. Why? • Personal tax cuts plus compensation for GST mean the vast bulk of people are better off, even if they spend all of their income. • GST does not tax savings. Therefore an across the board reduction in personal income taxes, together with an increase in GST, encourages people to save, or pay off their mortgage, rather than consume. • New Zealand relies heavily on personal income and corporate taxes, which are harmful for economic growth. Shifting the tax mix away from these taxes, and on to GST, is less distorting and better for the economy. • GST is a very difficult tax to avoid, no matter how people arrange their financial affairs. Key facts • Statistics New Zealand calculates overall prices – as reflected in the CPI – to rise by about 2 per cent as a result of increasing GST to 15 per cent, and that has determined the level of compensation for benefits, NZ Superannuation and other payments. 2 • Any rise in prices above Statistics NZ's estimation, excluding the impact of recent tobacco excise tax increases, will be picked up in the Consumer Price Index and reflected in the usual inflation adjustment for government assistance on 1 April 2011. • Compensation for benefits, NZ Superannuation and other payments will never run out or expire – 1 April 2011 adjustments ensure this is permanent. • People who receive NZ Superannuation or a Veterans Pension will get the benefit of a tax cut on top of the compensation for GST, thereby considerably increasing their after-tax income. • The increase in GST will raise $1.59 billion additional revenue in 2010/11, rising to $2.46 billion by 2013/14. • The compensation measures will cost about $420 million in 2010/11, rising to about $620 million a year by 2013/14. These figures include the impact of tax cuts on NZ Superannuation. • Items exempt from GST include rent for private premises, mortgage payments, school donations and some credit service charges. More information • Individuals and families can work out how Budget 2010 tax changes personally affect them at www.taxguide.govt.nz The effect of raising GST on prices Statistics New Zealand expects the CPI to rise by about 2 per cent as a direct result of increasing GST to 15 per cent. Therefore 2.02 per cent is the figure we have used for increasing benefits, NZ Superannuation and other payments. Consider a $100 pair of jeans. Because jeans are subject to GST of 12.5 per cent, the retail price is actually $112.50 (including GST). When GST rises to 15 per cent, the retail price of the jeans will increase to $115 (including GST). This increase from $112.50 to $115 is an increase of 2.22 per cent (not 2.5 per cent as sometimes assumed). Price increases of 2.22 per cent will also apply to other goods and services which are subject to GST. Some goods and services, like rent and mortgage payments, are not subject to GST. These account for about nine per cent of consumer spending. This means the overall increase in prices across the economy is lower than 2.22 per cent. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the general rise in prices across the economy. It is used to regularly increase benefits, NZ Superannuation and other payments, to maintain people’s standard of living.
Hon Bill English Minister of Finance Hon Peter Dunne Minister of Revenue 20 May 2010 Tax cuts strengthen economy and help families Across the board tax cuts and a package of other tax changes will strengthen economic growth and help families get ahead here in New Zealand, Finance Minister Bill English and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne say. • From 1 October 2010, personal taxes will be cut, GST will rise to 15 per cent and NZ Superannuation, Working for Families and benefit payments will increase – lifting incomes, keeping skilled Kiwis in New Zealand and helping families get ahead. • From 1 October 2010, the tax rates for most PIEs and bank interest will fall. The tax rate for other savings vehicles will fall to 28 per cent from 1 April 2011 – encouraging savings. • From 1 April 2011, tighter rules around the taxation of investment property will take effect – making the tax system fairer. • From the 2011/12 income year, the company tax rate will fall to 28 per cent – encouraging productive investment and lifting competitiveness. “This is the most significant tax reform package in New Zealand for nearly 25 years. For ordinary New Zealanders, it will reward effort, encourage savings and help families get ahead,” Mr English says. “The vast majority of people will be better off under the package. For example, a person on the average annual wage of about $50,000 with an average rent or mortgage will be more than $15 a week better off. A typical family with two children and average household income of $76,000 will be about $25 a week better off. “At all taxable income levels, the personal income tax cuts will more than offset the rise in GST – and low, middle and high income groups broadly receive the same proportionate increase in disposable income. “As well as improving incentives to work, the package tilts the economy towards savings, investment and exports and away from the unsustainable borrowing, consumption and over-investment in housing of the past decade. “These tax changes are broadly fiscally neutral and will make New Zealand more competitive globally at a time when many other countries are increasing taxes to tackle rising debt from the global recession. "That will help attract and retain skilled New Zealanders who might otherwise look for better opportunities overseas," Mr English says. Mr Dunne says the changes deliver on promises of a fairer tax regime. “New Zealand families will benefit from 1 October from tax cuts and they will benefit more over time from the lift in growth and jobs this package will create,” he says. “Aligning the top tax rate with the trust rate at 33 per cent ensures that wage earners in the top tax bracket - like many high-school teachers, nurses and police - no longer pay a higher tax rate than wealthy individuals who can structure their tax affairs and effectively select the tax rate they want. “In addition, the package closes loopholes in Working for Families and makes the tax treatment of property more equitable,” Mr Dunne says. 1 October 2010 changes include: • Across the board personal tax cuts worth $14.3 billion over four years. Income Current Rates New rates $0 - $14,000 12.5% 10.5% $14,001 - $48,000 21.0% 17.5% $48,001 - $70,000 33.0% 30.0% Over $70,000 38.0% 33.0% • Increasing the rate of GST from 12.5 per cent to 15 per cent. • Tax cuts on NZ Super and a 2.02 per cent increase in payments to recipients of NZ Super, main working-age benefits and Working for Families – reflecting Statistics New Zealand's calculation of the effect on prices of the rise in GST – worth $2.2 billion over four years. • A cut in the top tax rate for most PIEs from 30 per cent to 28 per cent. 1 April 2011 (or the 2011/12 income year) changes include: • A cut in the company tax rate from 30 per cent to 28 per cent. • A cut in the tax rate faced by unit trusts, life insurance policyholders and some other savings vehicles from 30 per cent to 28 per cent. • Ending landlords' and businesses' ability to claim depreciation on buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. • Tightening the rules for loss attributing qualifying companies (LAQCs) and qualifying companies (QCs) so shareholders cannot deduct losses at their marginal tax rate and pay tax on profits at the lower company rate. • Changes to the thin capitalisation tax rules to limit the scope for foreign multinationals to reduce their New Zealand tax liability. • Tightening the definition of income for Working for Families eligibility. The new rules will exclude investment and rental losses and end the automatic CPI indexation of the abatement threshold to stop higher- income recipients getting bigger increases than those on lower incomes. • Increasing IRD audit and compliance activity to improve the integrity of the tax system. Immediate change: • Removing the 20 per cent accelerated depreciation loading for new plant and equipment purchased after Budget day.

Media Statement

### Government consults on simplifying tax system

The Government is seeking public feedback on proposed changes to simplify the tax system and make it easier for people to manage their tax affairs, Finance Minister Bill English and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne said today.

The discussion document Making Tax Easier and an accompanying online forum include ways of simplifying PAYE and income tax returns for individuals and employers, Mr English says.

“Budget 2010 introduced a major rebalancing of the tax system away from consumption towards saving and investment that will better support New Zealand’s long-term economic growth.

“The Government is now looking to reform the way our tax system is administered to make it easier and more certain for taxpayers to manage their tax obligations.

The proposed changes also set out how people could self-manage most of their tax and social assistance entitlements such as Working for Families, using their own secure area on Inland Revenue’s website, Mr Dunne says.

“This would be done much like internet banking, making the whole process easier, faster and more certain for taxpayers,” he says.

“At the same time, the Government wants to ensure that the tax administration system operates efficiently and delivers value for money.

“The online consultation forum proposes several ways this might be achieved. The main idea is to shift Inland Revenue’s current emphasis away from paper-based systems towards greater use of customer-focused online technologies.

“To further simplify and reduce the number of interactions that individuals must have with Inland Revenue, a new approach is being proposed, which for some people would mean PAYE would be treated as a final tax.

“More timely and correct information would mean that tax is deducted at the right tax code each pay-day, so there would be a reduced need for an end-of-year square-up,” Mr Dunne says.

“This would give people greater confidence that the amount of tax they pay throughout the year is correct, with no unexpected tax bills arising at the end of the year.”

For businesses, including employers and the not-for-profit sector, PAYE tasks such as filing an employer monthly schedule could be managed by software that automatically communicates with Inland Revenue.

“Such a move towards electronic technologies would require all businesses to eventually move to electronic filing, Mr English says. “The Government wants to hear from employers and businesses on these proposals.”

Similarly, the Government wants to hear from the software development industry on how strategic partnerships might be developed to create the tools to help employers move to an electronic environment.

The closing date for comment on the proposals is 23 July 2010.
