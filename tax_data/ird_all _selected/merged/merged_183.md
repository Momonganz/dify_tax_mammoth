The forum sets out a number of options for change to improve the current tax system and invites you to post your thoughts and comments. The Government’s economic vision for New Zealand includes a tax system that supports and strengthens economic growth. A key step to achieving this vision was the Government’s Budget 2010 which included a package of tax policy measures to re-balance the tax system.

We are only a small company but it is one job I don't have to worry about. The cost per month for this service is very minimal and I don't have to worry about holiday pay workings etc. Results: Agree: 13 Disagree: 3 Brian. I guess this is just a tweak to the current payroll systems used by businesses. However, I find the current IRD ir-File system clunky and hard to use compared with other secure online websites (such as SOME banks websites). I hope IRD check out the competition and strive to be in the top layer for ease-of-use. Results: Agree: 11 Disagree: 4 cantaloupe As an employer of workers on a kiwifruit (KF) orchard I would have to say that the whole system of employee tax has become quite painful. Initially I could get in companies to do thinning etc and like any other company they would sort out their own tax. With some changes a few years ago WT (Withholding Tax) was brought in to this sphere of operation to cause companies to be taxed WT by the orchard owner. This now means I have a montly load of crap to sort out for the IRD and they seem to want this information back very quickly. The painful aspect I see with this whole WT system is that the requirements for when it should apply are bizarre to fathom out. Take as an example the IRD web site... Company A provides services under a contract which involves a high capital outlay (ie large use of machinery). As this contract is deemed to have a high capital outlay and low labour input, payments made to Company A in this circumstance will not have tax on schedular payments deducted. However, if the use of the machinery was incidental, with the supply of labour making up most of the contract, then payments made to Company A for this contract would have tax on schedular payments deducted. If you then look the recommended list of WT type payments from the back of the IR330 which is supposed to summarize the WT payments under Schedule 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007. On this list there is nothing about horticultural activities where a large capital investment has been made. Indeed the closest match would be... Agricultural contracts for maintenance, development, or other work on farming or agricultural land - rate 15c if IRD number supplied or 30c otherwise in the dollar. For a bobcat operator performing contracted work on agricultural land is he exempt or not fro WT (schedular payments)? Where this is heading is that the intrepretation of rules generated by IRD are so loose at times that not even IRD can consistently respond with the same answer. This does not make the job of payroll, which I never wanted to be involved in in the first place, very easy. Rest assured that if you do get it wrong there will be at least 5 penalties waiting to be charged ! An excellent example of this is where WT needs to be taken out (now called schedular payments which is even more difficult to understand what it means). I have been in touch with IRD on several occassions for the answer where a person/company, falling under the category of needing schedular payments deducted, has a special tax deduction certificate. The IR330 indicates that the STC tax code should be used but elsewhere on the website the following is stated... The tax code to use is "WT" even if they have a certificate of exemption or a special What do you think of having your payroll and accounting software manage your employees' deductions? | Making tax easier http://makingtaxeasier.ird.govt.nz/...usinesses-employers/what-do-you-think-having-your-payroll-and-accounting-software-manage-your.html\[24/10/2013 11:01:15\] Mon, 21/06/2010 - 12:28#7 Mon, 12/07/2010 - 19:15 #8 Mon, 21/06/2010 - 16:13 #9 Mon, 12/07/2010 - 19:02 #10 1 2 next › last » About this site Discussion document General tax questions Conditions of use Contact us Your privacy Keep up to date RSS feeds View the list For more information on government services go to tax rate.

I much prefer to have an Information booklet that I can mark with a post-it and highlight so that I can refer back to it next time. I think it is very short sighted of the IRD to not make PAYE tables available.

Results: Agree: 17 Disagree: 0 willy2212 The answer in simple terms is yes. The things that bug me now are: - The online returns are not user friendly - you need to put too much information in. You know who I am, put that information in before I start and I can complete the return. A classic example of this is the GST return - the paper one you send me has all my details in it already. - If I am in the online channel, keep me there - don't push me to paper or the phone line. Let me interact with you where I want to interact, not where you want me to Results: Agree: 22 Disagree: 0 Taniwha I decided today to try doing my return online. It was a very difficult process. I am self-employed with one employee, and each month I fill out an IR345 plus the monthly schedule. I expected to find a page which displayed the same information and I could fill in the numbers - and avoid writing them twice as I currently do. There appear to be separate requirements for PAYE, Kiwisaver deductions and Kiwisaver employer contributions. The same is true for electronic payments. Having filled out the paper form again, I went to the bank to pay electronically. I have to make three separate payments as opposed to the one cheque I send you. So you have substituted three separate pages, and three transactions, for one paper one. Doesn't look easier to me. Results: Agree: 13 Disagree: 1 NRGIZE My experiences with filling in IRD forms on line are that they are much harder and more time consuming than completing paper forms or working in excel.

Results: Agree: 12 Disagree: 0 P Gardner I want to take the opportunity to comment on the filing of PAYE returns monthly. Although I was originally advised that our Non profit organisation would be coded as irregular payer it never happened. In fact I went overseas and reminders were sent about non furnishing of returns. There has been no opportunnity to indicate this once a year payer status through the online service. We make one payment at the end of each year by way of honorarium and one PAYE payment but I must login 11 times to file NIL returns which is obviously a waste of my time. I also recieve 12 IR345 forms and 12 Return addresed envelopes - waste of resources/postage. There must be some discretion to allow "employers" the ability to pre set when they will be making PAYE liable payments and request an IR345 on demand. If the ability to request an irregular status already exists then it is an indictment on the web site that I could not find it.

I think there are two issues here: Firstly, less paper and more dependence on digital could contribute to global warming, not help it (this is an area of current debate)...I would like to know how this increase in digital dependence will affect IRD's carbon footprint, especially in terms of the increased server traffic and need for new servers (not sure exactly how this works) Second is a two-pronged issue: 1. Not everyone has fast internet or access to reliable computers. Yes, they could go to a library (unreliable too) or an internet cafe (extra cost) but what are the stats on the amount of people who this will be a disadvantage for? Are lower socio-economic groups going to struggle to fulfil the requirements? What is the current/proposed state of NZ broadband to allow this high traffic flow? 2. What percentage of the population are not digitally literate? Will there be paper options available for those people e.g. people who choose not to have an email address or who are worried about having their personal data online (don't use internet banking etc.) When you say secure, how exactly does that work? In terms of the actual return itself, it is purely another format of the same thing we do now, so still requires all the other paperwork to be able to fill it out. So, no change of time there, except if we don't have to wait for a personal tax summary (maybe these could be online?)

The proposal suggests that any update an individual makes to their personal tax information (via Inland Revenue website) will be automatically passed to their employers payroll software and the said software will be able to calculate the correct deductions without the employer being aware of what the deductions are for. Sure the software can adjust the calculation of deductions but this would be done by setting specific flags and/or values for the employee so it would not be hidden from the employer (or the payroll clerk) at all. However, the fact the proposal does not directly address the issue defined does not mean it is not a good proposal. Allowing individuals full control of their tax information online is a great idea but it must contain the facility to send (with attachments) and receive secure communications. I do think that once a taxpayer has agreed to deal online with IR then ALL their communication should be in that space e.g. confirmation of changes, statements, reminders etc – assuming the IR site provides the ability for them to be able to download/print any of the communications i.e. they can print themselves a hard copy if they want to. While there will always be a segment of taxpayers who for whatever reason will not use this technology perhaps there could be an incentive for switching to on-line technology e.g. quicker refunds, guaranteed turnaround times on queries, extended payment time for terminal tax. Results: Agree: 6 Disagree: 2 Viferpilot As a sole trader I presently use a spreadsheet as my cash book (downloaded a elegant template found on the Internet that seems to canvass everything I need). But what if IRD provided an online cashbook type service instead. One that was just as easy to use i.e. one that was totally integrated with all tax/ACC obligations so that sorting out my bimonthly GST returns would be 'automated'. An assessment at year end would be much simpler / automated too perhaps? ( this year I guess I'm going to have to tweak my spreadsheet when GST changes ... whereas an IRD service would do it once/right for everyone using such a service ... surely, nationally, this would save a lot of collective energy / effort ). Surely the hassles of keeping records for 7 yrs etc would also get solved too? (assuming everything will be digital, and our digital identities will be secure and our records digitally archived correctly, etc) Currently I have to copy/paste stuff from my spreadsheet into IRD's online forms. Similarly, at the end of the year to do my tax return online. Then of course IRD insist that I keep a paper copy (signed) of all my returns etc. Lets get off the fence ... either we're going digital or we're not! ... lets move away from a halfway house. I imagine that the whole process could be seriously renovated ... at least for relatively straightforward folk like me who are happy to work online and happy to authorise IRD to pull together RWT, ACC, taxable Dividends, banking records (GST EFTPOS transactions etc), to help automate the tax reconciliation processes. Isn't this what networked computers are good for! And I don't care where in the cloud the processing is done, as long as everything is totally secure, totally private and totally within the sovereignty of NZ.

The consultation ran from 9 June to 23 July, and is now closed. The consultation website, and comments posted on it, can still be viewed, but no new comments can be added. The Government is evaluating the comments posted on the forum, and these comments will help to guide the Government in its approach to reforms to the tax administration system. We will put a link here to any announcements made about this project. This Government consultation forum is about improving the administration of the tax system and making it more certain and speedy for you to interact with Inland Revenue. The forum sets out a number of options for change to improve the current tax system and invites you to post your thoughts and comments. The Government’s economic vision for New Zealand includes a tax system that supports and strengthens economic growth. A key step to achieving this vision was the Government’s Budget 2010 which included a package of tax policy measures to re-balance the tax system. The next step is improving the administration of the tax system so that interaction with it is more certain and speedy for taxpayers. This includes increasing the use of electronic services by taxpayers when they are interacting with Inland Revenue. Some of the ideas set out in this consultation forum may take several years to implement. Implementation of the ideas will be based on the feedback we receive and the technology available. However, the ideas on this consultation forum all illustrate the broad direction that the Government is seeking for the administration of the tax system, so it supports the Government’s vision for economic growth.

What do you think about being able to access, receive confirmations, and amend your Inland The proposed changes to the administration of the tax system affect nearly all taxpayers. This consultation forum focuses on changes that will affect individuals, businesses and employers, the not-for-profit sector, and software developers. Key proposals for improving the tax administration are to: reduce the use of paper and increase the use of online services and technology; reform the PAYE and personal tax summary process, including the possible option of making PAYE a final tax for many taxpayers; and introduce a new framework for Inland Revenue to share information with other government agencies, including consideration of appropriate safeguards of privacy. The details of the proposals for the identified groups are set out below. Individuals Self-management by individuals of most of their tax and social policy affairs through their own secure area in Inland Revenue’s website, much like internet banking. Individuals’ customer service experience would be faster and more certain. Use of better technology by employers to reduce errors in the PAYE system. The technology would be supported by Inland Revenue. A possible new approach to the taxation of individuals under which, for some, PAYE would be treated as a final tax. This approach would not apply to groups of taxpayers when the PAYE rules may give inaccurate outcomes. Taxpayers who receive additional income for example, from rents, will still square-up their non-wage and salary income at year–end. Discussion around Inland Revenue being more open with tax information to improve the efficiency across government by reducing the need for individuals to provide the same information multiple times. Privacy concerns will be an important consideration for the Government. Businesses, employers and the not for profit sector Software that takes care of routine processes. For example, PAYE compliance tasks such as the need to file an employer monthly schedule separately could be managed by software that automatically communicates with Inland Revenue. The software would have an option of providing information to Inland Revenue every pay-day. Inland Revenue would help employers get PAYE information right.

Inland Revenue would do this by providing information about employees’ PAYE obligations directly to a business’s payroll software, after appropriate validations. A move by businesses, employers and the not-for-profit sector to providing information electronically rather than by paper. The Government is raising for discussion whether mandating the use of electronic communication is acceptable and, if so, when. Businesses and not-for-profit organisations can expect better service from Inland Revenue as resources are freed up from checking errors and processing paper as a consequence of the proposals set out. Not for profit entities often have high staff turnover, so having software which manages more of the routine processes and supports better use of software will be of particular value. Software developers Inland Revenue would support software developers so they can develop and improve products for their clients. Inland Revenue is proposing strategic partnerships with these groups starting with payroll businesses. A key element to the proposals is that software developers would develop software that will be able to deal with routine tax compliance tasks, such as providing PAYE information directly into Inland Revenue systems without the need to access separate Inland Revenue systems. The Government is asking for views from software developers about how the strategic partnership to develop this software might work and what can be done to encourage employers to move from a paper to an electronic environment.

It is a long-term project, and some of these ideas may take several years to implement. The forum is being run on behalf of the Government by the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue. Comments made, and votes recorded in this online consultation forum will be used to develop ideas about how to achieve the Government’s economic vision for New Zealand, deliver better services to taxpayers and greater value from the public service. If there is support for the proposals set out on this site, legislative change will be required to provide more flexibility around the PAYE rules, to allow Inland Revenue to share information more widely, to make PAYE a final tax for some, and to provide Inland Revenue the ability to mandate electronic filing by employers.

HomeOverviewIndividualsBusinesses & employersNon-profitSoftware developers Wayne Dobson Our payroll software already has the ability to manage employee deductions. Once loaded this saves a lot of time and hassle. It would be useful to expand this, perhaps by adding the ability to connect to I.R.D (securely from within the software) when loading a pay run to receive corrections or feedback (regarding this and the previous pay run) or to add the ability to confirm the correct use of tax codes such as WT and STC. This could save a lot of time, stress and penalty fees, knowing that I.R.D has confirmed the correct application before the run has been posted. This kind of connectivity would also be useful to send our ir-File directly from payroll. Results: Agree: 5 Disagree: 0 cheetah100 The following is the text of a patent application I made but never followed up after initial rejection. You are free to use this idea as you see fit: Background of the Invention New Zealand Income Tax laws present a substantial obligation and risk to small business employers. The obligation of preparing PAYE returns every month, the obligation of correctly calculating the amount of tax to deduct from employee wages, the risk of penalties should those tasks not be performed correctly, and the risks that insufficient funds are set aside to cover tax payments resulting in penalties and possibly criminal sanctions. For large companies these obligations and risks have dedicated staff to handle them. The staff are expert in the preparation of PAYE information and will have automated computer systems to help with the preparation of the information. Small business owners however often lack the expertise and experience and so can get into difficulties, running the very real risk of large penalties and possibly even criminal sanctions if the proper returns are not filed and the right amounts of income tax are not paid. This is a discouragement to small businesses employing new staff. The Government now has a system where employees need not file income tax returns every year if they earn no other income except as an employee. This has greatly simplified collection of revenue for the Government from employees, and reduced the burden of preparing tax returns for hundreds of thousands of employees.

Summary of the Invention The invention is a system in which a company uses a bank operated automated service to handle income tax reporting and payment. The benefits of the invention will be the automation of monthly returns to the Government and the automatic handling of payments going to employees. This eliminates the possibility of tax not being properly paid. This in turn will eliminate the need for financial or criminal penalties and thus reduce the risks to a small business. The invention will typically be implemented by the bank used by the company concerned. According to the first aspect of the invention a bank will allow a company to set up special automatic payments for its employees. In addition to the normal information collected for an automatic payment such as bank account number, amount to pay and pay period, the bank will also collect the IRD number of the employee, the tax code, student loan information, and other information related to the employee tax obligations. The second aspect of the invention is that the bank will deduct the gross pay from the employers account in the same way that it would for a normal automatic payment. The bank will then transfer the net pay into the employee account and deposit the tax deductions with the IRD in the name of the employer, as if the employer had paid the amount themselves. The third aspect of the invention is that the bank will prepare reports for the employer detailing payments to each employee in order for the company to maintain their own record of pay and to provide deduction information to employees. The bank may also provide information to the employees directly in the form of a \[electronic\] payslip.

I even note that the dates at the head of each group of subjects (presumably embedded there by the organisers of this forum), are all for the year 2012. If presumed intelligent computer operators cannot get the facts right, what hope is there for the less competent of us? During my working years, the comment was often made about computer operations, that 'garbage in, garbage out'. This is still true today, and I wonder how long it will take for a compulsory computer system of taxation to grind to a dead stop, caused by a gridlock of faulty data input from thousands of untrained operators. For most of us we need to have confidence that the end result will be correct, and will be achieved with a minimum of effort and cost to each of us. We certainly do not wish to have more confusion as the end product. I am not certain at this time that IRD have a positive vote of confidence from taxpayers concerning this matter.

In theory I object to the idea of mandatory electronic filing but am presently at no risk of speaking out against it. The IRD have just had a conference with software developers and it is quite likely (I had to pull out so can't say for sure) there were organisations there lobbying for mandatory electronic filing. Chances are they will go ahead with it. The good news is that you will have no problems achieving this without ongoing costs even if you don't want to use a 3rd party service - you can always use the IRD's online tools which I'm sure they will eventually redesign and make more intuitive (website = great - online tools = terrible) Results: Agree: 8 Disagree: 1 clare hewitt the question is about electronic filing for ALL tax payers.

There would have to be a massive change in IRD's attitude & competency in use of electronic mediums before I would be comfortable in giving too much inofrmation to them on line.

Results: Agree: 6 Disagree: 0 flea In principle I agree that all businesses should have to use electronic filing. However I don't think business should be forced to purchase software to get the ability to file electronically. My company only has 2 employees, both of which are on salary so the monthly pay is really simple and I don't need to have software to work out any of it or track holidays etc. I just keep it a spreadsheet however I do file the paye and gst return electronically using the IR's online forms. I don't want to have to use payroll software. I am quite capable of working out the deductions correctly and unless the software gave me the benefit of being able to do the employee's banking transactions for me (as quickly and cheaply as I can already do them via internet banking) or being able to set up the banking transaction to pay IR then I see absolutely no benefit in using a software package. As I do all the company's banking electronically, I would love my internet banking system to track some of this information. For example, let me setup my employee's details e.g. their salary & deductions, and their bank account number. Then each month when I pay them, I call up the employee, check (and if necessary edit their pay details), press GO and have the bank's software create the payment to the employee, file the necessary information with IR and set up a future dated payment to IR for the paye – all done! I'd even be prepared to pay the bank a reasonable fee for this service. Alternatively, if the banks were prepared to play ball with IR, then IR could set up online a really simple pay sheet system. Login to IR, call up your employees, make any changes required, press GO, it calculates the deductions & net pay, connects to Would it be acceptable to make electronic filing mandatory for all taxpayers? | Making tax easier http://makingtaxeasier.ird.govt.nz/...sinesses-employers/would-it-be-acceptable-make-electronic-filing-mandatory-all-taxpayers@page=1.html\[24/10/2013 11:02:53\] Thu, 08/07/2010 - 16:27#18 Thu, 08/07/2010 - 18:07 #19 Thu, 08/07/2010 - 20:36 #20 « first ‹ previous 1 2 3 next › last » About this site Discussion document General tax questions Conditions of use Contact us Your privacy Keep up to date RSS feeds View the list For more information on government services go to your bank and sets up the employee payments & the future dated paye payment (all in a pending state).

Stuart Bale I work with Acclipse, who provide Income Tax preparation and management software to NZ Tax Agents. Part of Acclipse Tax retrieves 'statement' data for tax entities from the IRD Portal that Tax Agents regularly use. Those tax agents using Acclipse Tax find this a big time saver and convenience, as the information they need is at their finger tips, and we are able to integrate the data directly into their workflow. There would be some distinct benefits if this data was accessible in a more efficient method than we are using today, such as a web service. Stuart Results: Agree: 6 Disagree: 0 flea My company would have no issue with developing software that provides increased tax functionality and being able to communicate directly with IRD. However we do have concerns regarding where the liability would lie if incorrect tax information ends up being filed with IRD. There is always a fine line between providing software that meets legislative requirements while providing enough flexibility for the employer to be able to manage their own employees - currently the employer accepts they are ultimately liable for the information provided to IRD. If by providing more tax functionality in the software, the employer becomes unable to control or override the information, they will surely then expect the liability to lie with the software developer but as a developer we would not be comfortable with taking on the liability of any employer that uses our software.

Why can't our eftpos cards contain a memory chip that stores transaction data ie the receipts. The data could be uploaded and sorted by your computer. You could know how much tax you need to put away in real time, no more faded receipts from sitting in the car on a hot day, no more paying $60 an hour to have the accountants secretary sort through things - The benefits are on going and I believe a system like it is inevitable.

Results: Agree: 2 Disagree: 1 100000596760411... We have successfully been developing complex tax functionality into our software for many years. As mentioned earlier there are risks, however these are manageable. As Stuart has said the missing link is the ability to allow these applications to interact with the information on the IR data stores. Some kind of quality control over tax logic is required so providing developers with test data sets and certification is a good idea.

Providing a website users can log into and enter / update information will allow people to do what they do now via another medium. It will be more efficient for both parties and I am a strong supporter of it. However what could revolutionise the way individuals deal with the IR is to move these communications behind the scenes. There is a small (but growing) segment of the community that currently use software to manage their personal finances.

What about an option of an annotated help system that people could turn on, offering explanations for different steps? Even with a paper system, there are individuals such as people with disabilities, who require assistance to do their returns. I think the same group of people who have accounts do their tax work would probably continue to do so, maybe there could be a seperate log-on which would be for an authorised accountant to access? Perhaps there would be groups of people who would qualify for an accountant to deal with online accounts in the same way they would deal with the paper accounts? I know that using an accountant is somehow factored in to tax. Like any website, speed can be an issue without broadband, but waiting weeks for a piece of paper, versus waiting 10 minutes for a page to load, I know which one I would prefer.

I would very much like it if my summary of earnings from IRD included all the income from these sources, and indeed computed my likely refund or tax to pay, given that my summary of earnings represents my total earnings. Then all I would need to do is confirm that, and filling in my tax form would be trivial. Admittedly such a system would not cope with people with overseas shares, but perhaps eventually it would be possible to include shares from the most obvious country, namely Australia.

Results: Agree: 10 Disagree: 2 Midge If you have a joint bank account or a personal bank account and do not supply your IRD number to your bank then they will tax you at the highest rate. If you supply your IRD number then you can choose which rate you expect to be taxed at for the year on your Interest. But this is still irrelevant because once you do your tax return at the end of the year.. all your interest income and tax already paid on that interest is included so if you pay too much you will get it back in the refund anyway. If you have a joint bank account then the interest and tax credits are split between the both of you 50/50 and again this will be balanced off in your tax return. Your question - How are people going to get a refund if too much tax is deducted? That is the main reason people get a refund.... because they have had too much tax deducted throughout the year. (unless they are eligible for a tax rebate of course) Same thing goes with Dividends and Imputation credits.

LikeSign Up to see what your friends like. jethrocarr As the manager of a young software development company I would very much like to see a documented API based off an open standard (eg SOAP, REST, XML) which is avaliable to any company to use for communiticating with IRD. New Zealand has companies ranging from large corporates developing accounting packages down to small one or two people development houses working on ecommerce systems and lightweight accounts applications. It is important to be fair to both types of companies, making the API available to any company along with public documentation is the best way to do this. From what I can tell so far reading this website, it seems that this is the way that IRD is planning to proceed, if so, then it sounds fantastic and I look forwards to seeing how this progresses. -- Jethro Carr ( jethro.carr@amberdms.com) Results: Agree: 13 Disagree: 0 barnaclebarnes I agree with Jethro. We need access to the systems via easy to use (RESTful web services please) interfaces. IRD should not partner with large software providers exclusively as a first step as their needs will vary from some of the smaller players. The services should: RESTful Web Services The services should support REST based interfaces. REST has won the web API wars and is the easiest for people to pick up.

Results: Agree: 6 Disagree: 3 barnaclebarnes Sandbox There should be a sand boxed environment for testing that is open for developers to use. The 3am Test The API/service (at least the sandbox) should be available to start using at any time with no authorisation. In this way developers can get started on their own, develop their software and do all of the testing without having to talk to anyone. The more barriers you put up the less innovative services will appear. Documentation Good documentation with code examples in a number of languages (C#, Ruby, PHP, Python) is a must. Providing libraries that can be downloaded, are open source and hosted in shared environment such as Github will really help drive the developer ecosystem forward. And if you want decent comments allow more that 1000 characters ;-) Results: Agree: 12 Disagree: 2 matthewhaigh I agree with the sentiment here - good observations guys - lets have an API - hopefully RESTful with authentication using OAuth or something similar. I would like to understand how the igovt identification service could be used with this service. I note some disagreement from the existing comments - if you disagree with this - would really like to hear your opinion - what are we missing from this discussion? Noting the moves of the Australian Government about Standard Business Reporting (SBR) - of which NZ has signed up too - I assume that the XBRL mechanism will be implemented - to allow filing of returns and other information to a 'government gateway'. If this was the case - I would like to see some information on the data representation - not just the DTD - but how the IRD and government agencies will like to see this information represented and interpreted.

The most successful web 2.0 platforms provide a powerful API that allows developers to intergrate third party applications and extend the base platforms in ways the creators never imagined.

Let’s make these dreams possible! 2)Change management for your customers . Much of the population will embrace this change, ensure the ones that don’t are given enough attention.

We want to access several government systems and pull data in via API's. Ideally we would use standards such as oAuth to let users authenticate and give access to various data.

The tax compliance side of payroll is relatively easy compared to the Holiday Act requirements and therefore unless a small employer requires software to assist them with the holiday side of things why would they bother paying for payroll software when they can manage a couple of employees very easily manually (using printed tax tables or IRD calculators) and still file their EMS electronically. So while I am sure employers who already use payroll software would appreciate their software having enhanced tax compliance functionality (i.e. direct access to IRD) I doubt very much that that this type of enhanced functionality would create any significant new market for developers. There is possibly a small potential market for a developer to provide very simplistic "tax only" type software (i.e. not doing any holiday tracking etc) but unless the cost of this was tiny why would any small employer bother. In regard to general accounting software and tax compliance there are a few possible enhancements around GST, FBT, Prov Tax filing etc but again this would be popular with existing software users but would probably not really entice a new market.

LikeSign Up to see what your friends like. portia What is meant by small? Apart from very small refunds - perhaps $10 - if a person can be bothered going through the hoops that it takes to get a refund, Inland Revenue should be obliged to make it, especially if it is all going to be done on-line in the future. Results: Agree: 33 Disagree: 2 Taxpayer92 If a taxpayer is going to provide a bank account number, then the IRD should make a payment. Yes, make cheques by mail subject to a minimum amount. Results: Agree: 21 Disagree: 1 Bea They should not collect debts that are less than the cost of collecting them. They should, however, issue refunds when requested. That money is owed to the taxpayer and is not the government's to keep. Cheques by mail should not be subject to a minimum amount. A taxpayer should not be required to give the IRD their bank account number in order to extract a refund out of them - they should be entitled to keep their bank account number private from the Inland Revenue. IRD has powers to dip into people's bank accounts for various reasons under tax legislation - taxpayers should not be forced to allow IRD to build up a database of their private bank account numbers that IRD can then use in the future.

I personally wouldnt ask for a cheque but until they are no longer supported by the banking system, then IRD should still issue a cheque if requested - but maybe that takes a little longer as a disincentive. IRD should look at different turn around times for different types of customer If I file online, on time, supply all the required information and provide a bank account then I want my money in 2-3 days If I file on paper, maybe its 2-3 weeks. If I ask for a cheque maybe I need to wait another 2-3 weeks. I think most people would opt for the bank account direct deposit option if they could be given faster turn around times. This is how its done in Australia. Results: Agree: 14 Disagree: 2 Kim No. Firstly you need to define what 'small' is. You maybe talking about anything up to $200+. Also you say that the improved system will ensure that there is no error between PAYE and business software - this is difficult to believe. There are myriads of ways to qualify for a tax refund and everyone so have the right to be able to check they have paid the correct amount of tax and claim a refund if needed. This is simply IRD trying to cut down their workload of which I imagine a far bit consists of people filing for Personal Tax Summaries at the end of the financial year. Move it to online to increase efficiencies but don't take away our right to check we've paid the correct amount of tax. Results: Agree: 18 Disagree: 1 hbblue I am proof that business software dose not always calculate PAYE correctly, last year I had a bill from IRD for $911.50, this year I am preparing for another $700- $750. We can not controll how much tax our employer takes each week, but if that is short at the end of the year IRD expect us to pay the short fall. Maybe if the empolyer was responceable for the short fall they would keep better track of, 1 What an employee had earnt 2 How much tax had been paid 3 How much tax should have been paid Results: Agree: 4 Disagree: 5 Hughmama Actually the way tax works is it is a yearly square-up. Software can only approximate how much tax should be deducted each week/pay in order to get to as close as possible to the amount as calculated over a year. Unless you are being paid an unchanging amount every pay over the year they will invariably estimate incorrectly, as will the IRD online tools when used for weekly tax estimations.

Wait a minute but you might have some tax on interest received from a bank (if your lucky).... oh boy this is already getting complicated. Simplification of the tax structure should go hand in hand with these changes. For example why not just charge a standard 15% on any interest received from a bank if your expected income was less than $50,000 pa and 25% if your income is expected to be higher.

Not happy. Results: Agree: 3 Disagree: 0 hbblue Over the past 3-4 years I have had to deal with 2 IRD departments, 1 for tax and 1 for child support. As the pay-roll system my employer uses seems to be failing for my income, which is affected by verying hours as I work on a call-out situation, for the past 2 years I have been landed with tax short falls of approx. $1,000 year. Money I now have to try to pay. How can I, or IRD, ensure that this dose not happen in the future. After all I can not controll how much my employer taxs my income each week, and if this is short at the end of the year I now have to find it. As for having to deal with Child Support as well, it is very stressful as they are not interested that I am trying to pay $1,000 back for tax as well as $900 a month to them. I feel that there needs to be some consideration when the average worker is landed with such large bills to 1 Govt. department while trying to pay another. IRD has the job of gathering money from the workers of N.Z. to sustain our Welfare State, but should this be done by adding stress to the workers who are the main sorce of that income.

Zero-rating means that GST is charged at zero-percent. Girl – “Ok. I’m under the registration threshold at the moment, will those suppliers count and mean that I may need to register. Call Centre Operator – “Those suppliers are still considered as turnover regardless of being zero rated. If your turnover is over $60,000 dollars in a 12 month period then you must register, however you may wish to consider voluntary registration if your turnover is below $60,000 dollars”. Girl – “I think Australia has different GST rules to us - can you tell me about Australian GST”. Call Centre Operator - You can find information on Australian GST by going to www.gststartup.gov.au. You may also find the customs website helpful at www.customs.govt.nz “ Girl – “Oh ok, I see, thanks for that”. Girl hangs up the phone looking confused. “Later that day” flicks onto the screen Screen then shows girl reading through a printed document and looking confused. She then calls a number on the telephone. A message is received: “I’m sorry you have called outside the operating hours”. Girl puts it down quickly looking annoyed. She goes back to computer and clicks into the IRD website again. Girl looks confused, sighs, puts head in hand. TOMORROWS WORLD flashes onto the screen Introduction Scene starts showing the girls pencil sketches in a folder followed by a page of the Molly’s costings, shipping costs, suppliers, marketing, legal stuff and tax on another page which she has written. Scene then shows Molly sitting at her desk looking through these documents. She then moves left to her laptop on the table and starts typing. She is on the IRD “GST” web page, types in search of “I want to sell products in Australia" 4 links appear and Molly clicks on "Information about GST for goods exported to Australia" The text box appears with two options asking you need to register or, if you would like to find out more information on GST. Scene then shows Molly writing on her pad looking pleased. Molly clicks on "Register for GST" The Gst registration is updating and processing online, Molly smiles as it flicks back to the computer to show she has been registered. Scene shows Molly smiley and happy that it is so easy. The next scene she is sitting at her desk in front of her open laptop, writing notes, nods with happy smiley face typing at her laptop. “A few days later” flashes onto the screen. Molly is sitting at laptop at desk in a different dress, typing and moving the mouse. Suddenly she screams and jumps out of her chair. She calls a number on the telephone beside her. Person at other end (Mum) answers “Hello Wendy speaking” Back to scene of Molly at desk on telephone saying “Guess who just scored their first international contract” Mum – “Molly, that’s fantastic love” Molly - “they said they loved my designs, they said I was really professional and thorough and they appreciated how quickly I got back to them.” Mum – “I knew you could do it. I guess this means you need to hire someone in to help fill the order in a hurry”. Molly – “that’s the next thing I need to get onto I suppose. Hiring someone. The deadline is really tight, I had better start getting an advert together. Talk to you later. Okay”. Mum – “Okay love, see you later”. Molly puts down the telephone.

I have a preference for online forms and submissions. I do not want to see IRD cutting off telephone services though. There is always the odd-ball issue that will come up and therefore will need further clarification. Plus, it can be quite frustrating going through the website looking for 'specific' information...especially when the website is not user-friendly and full of bling bling (flashy icons) in your face. Results: Agree: 8 Disagree: 1 Brian. Phone contact with IRD is essential for us to get 'immediate' response to problems or queries.

As the call centre people are alot of the time are reading from scripts, perhaps some of the load of the call centres could be split to robots that ask questions and get responses by way of keybord input and screen. The call centres will still be required when the scripts don't quite met the questions being asked. Results: Agree: 9 Disagree: 4 GWY\_Trusts Many non-profit organisations require two signatories for 'all' transactions. The Charities Commission recognises this in requiring specific acknowledgement that on- line annual returns are being made with prior approval. The 'two signatories' rule makes operation of on-line bank accounts impossible. Further, electronic records are subject to corruption and machine failure making hard copies necessary for both audit and long-term storage purposes. Results: Agree: 11 Disagree: 3 admini The two signatories rule does NOT make operation of on-line bank account impossible. I am Treasurer for TWO non-profits where any TWO of several signatories are required to authorise ALL payments and both Westpac & ANZ both offer services to cater for this. BTW Westpac was by far the most simple to set up and user friendly to operate. ANZ took weeks to arrange. Results: Agree: 3 Disagree: 0 Mozee1 For good accounting practices, governance and transparency, it is critical that two signatories are required. It comes down to how the organisation sets up their authority rules and how accessible the authorisers/creators are in processing payments etc. Results: Agree: 1 Disagree: 2 ronpen While it may be possible to set up the service to have two signatories operate the on-line system, the fact remains that for many not-for-profit organisations, the signatories often do not live in the same town or city. Getting any two of them together to operate the on-line system is therefore probably more difficult than using the present manual system. Results: Agree: 1 Disagree: 0 Litterarum I agree that the use of online banking for two signatories is possible for businesses, but not always viable for not-for-profits. I am a treasurer of a very small not-for-profit, and the fees that would be charged by our bank for changing across to a business account (which they require to do two signatures online), and additional fees for operating an online banking verification system are simply not worth while for our size of organisation.

If it beats talking to a computer and cutting down the wait time on the phone then I'm all for it. Results: Agree: 2 Disagree: 1 ronpen I do not think that this would be a good idea, as it would probably be a chat line between taxpayers, as I do not expect that IRD will have operators waiting at monitors to join in at all times. It is also likely that the chances of having another taxpayer on line who could comment on any particular problem at a given time would be extremely very small. In other words it would be just as frustrating as the present telephone system.

Results: Agree: 1 Disagree: 0 fannington So let me get this straight. IRD is going to work with software developers so that we have to access our files via our accounting program. What that means, of course, is that everyone will have to buy a new version of their accounting program just to comply with government edicts. Good scam for the software people. I only wish this would mean MYOB would work better and be more intiutive. My experience with MYOB is that they certainly won't get it right (or make it easy) in the first several versions. But then again, they're all about selling users "essential" up-dates, aren't they.

LikeSign Up to see what your friends like. Hughmama Well I was one of the design team working on this issue (more specifically EMS) in 2007/2008 for IRD. It was clear then that people are comfortable with their current systems, be they informal paper based or fragmented electronic. Change requires a good deal of attention and self control. Moving from something that you need pay virtually no attention to while doing it - kind of muscle memory - to something that you have to apply great scrutiny to in order to ensure compliance within your context - until it also becomes "safe" is not something people will just wake up and decide to do. If it's the IRD that wants to provide the incentive for this change they are going to have to pay generously, whether that be financially or otherwise. In all honesty the IRD have little chance at figuring this one out themselves. Fortunately I think others will find reason and means to do it for them. Results: Agree: 2 Disagree: 0 100001082712603... I really like this idea of employee self management. However, I don't like the idea of having to purchase "integrated software". If the bulk of employee information is due to be stored in the IRD system, then the IRD should provide the few remaining tools to calculate the pay run... e.g. 1 - Employer enters gross pays. 2 - IRD calculates deductions and kiwisaver contributions and produces a direct credit schedule to the employer.

Even better if - if the IRD could collect details regarding sick days, holidays, stats, etc, and provide a clear report to employees and employers on their current status, allowance and legal obligations. Thus being a fair and impartial record. Results: Agree: 6 Disagree: 0 100001082712603... The IRD could automatically email employees their pay slips (or a monthly summary), and correctly adjust tax rates for employees with multiple jobs, so that it is clear what an employees total tax is on a total income from multiple jobs. With the IRD maintaining the relationship between the employer and employee, there would be greater participation by all individuals, and complete transparency of the way the system works. The IRD should also take care of garnishing employees wages for court fines also, and all communications regarding that, again so that an employees circumstances remain private, and the employers admin time is reduced. Thank you for the opportunity to have a say. Results: Agree: 6 Disagree: 0 cansoc It would be helpful when entering EMS data online if there was an option to select employees alphabetically instead of only by IRD number, as this is the way our payroll software (MYOB EXO Employer Services) prints out the report. Yes, it would be good to have the report downloaded directly into IRD's website so we don't have to double handle it. Results: Agree: 0 Disagree: 0 NRGIZE The IRD will have to improve their systems so that they work as well as Excel does in tracking payroll, deductions and vacation and sick days. Have a look at Westpac's banking site to see how easy it is to make a payment to the IRD and then compare it to how complicated it is to fill out the IRD PAYE form online. IRD is slow and complicated. Westpac has all the information on one page and proof on payment prints on one page.

After spending signficant funds on software to go electronic I now find my self printing more documents for client approval as the majority of my clients are not online or need further skills to be internet sucessful (boomers and X). Those costs are significant and while some overhead has been absorbed by me, the client is paying for the digital divide. This is producing compliance cost increases. My practice relied on IRD statements to confirm to the client that IRD has there information, now these will be produced by me.

They would therefore have a common date for PAYE and GST as opposed to different dates currently. Such a facility would ease cash flow for SMEs like us and, probably to a small extent, the Government. Company tax would be a little more problematic due to fluctuations in income and expenses: I would prefer this to be an annual return based on the results for the whole year. The reduction in forms would be of marginal benefit and I would still like the option of printing a return as a more permanent record.

Tax compliance, Kiwsaver, Holidays Act compliance, student loans, child support, allowances, and the list goes on, are a minefield to navigate in this day and age.

For this reason we prefer not to use online software such as Smartpayroll, to manage or complete this process for our business. I also have to complete all of our accounting reconciliations at year end for audit so I like to know what's actually happened and not find errors or whatever 6 months down the track. Our business uses IMS payroll software to manage the payroll process, which takes care of all the tax deduction calculations, kiwisaver, all types of leave calculations etc, as long as everything is set up correctly to start with. This system creates electronic files for simply uploading online at the IRD website. There is still the option to manually edit these files if necessary. We use Moneyworks Gold (yes we love Macs!) accounting software. Again, GST compliance is simple and we now use the online GST form to submit to IRD rather than the paper form. These processes for us are quick and easy, whilst still maintaining a level of control over the process. I think IRD have done a great job at getting their online services up and running and coming up with improvements. Results: Agree: 10 Disagree: 8 GR1952 As a tax agent we use SmartPayroll. Once set up, it is a breeze. It is web based. They deduct 100% of the payroll each pay period, pass on the payment to the IRD when due & take care of all the forms. The cost each month is minimal. We take about an average of 10 mins per week to administer each payroll we oversee. SmartPayroll do have direct customers. Their phone number is 0800 10 10 38 or website www.smartpayroll.co.nz .

If you bank provides accounts for businesses, they will have this capability as nearly every business requires two signatories for cheques. We now use ASB's Fastnet Business. I am on a board of a couple of other not-for-profits and when the branch from different bank said they couldn't do online banking for two signatories, I suggested we move to a bank that could provide the service. Very quickly the problem of resolved and we were offered an account suitable for our requirements. Depending on which bank you are with, you may need to pay a small monthly fee but it is covered in the savings made in not using cheques. Results: Agree: 7 Disagree: 0 746598114@facebook We use online systems for Payroll and Accounting. PAYE is easy but GST is a manual process as although we can file on line, we can't integrate it with Xero. So it would be good to have the same upload capability for our GST. Also, why can't the IRD deal electronically with other Government departments to supply information, particularly the Department of Statistics when relating to payroll. There is no need for them to post us paper based forms to fill in about wages and hours worked when this information can be supplied electronically through the payroll system.

I was very disappointed in how unfairly IRD handled my query. Given that I was on the standard option for provisional tax and tried to follow all the rules in the documents I had, I was still penalized by $3500 interest and having to pay $30000 before the official due date to stop paying ridiculous interest rates. I am now working in a project environment where a lot of my collogues are also independent contractors. When I discussed it in the group how badly I was treated by IRD, I found out that I am not the only one that has stepped into the trap. I suggest that IRD review the approach to the Second year of operation for provisional tax calculation methods and communications to small business and the self employed. It is an untold trap I will not easily forgive the IRD for. Results: Agree: 9 Disagree: 2 Ctasnz I agree.

The provisional tax system is a dog, which is probably being a bit hash on our for legged fiends, obviously designed by some malevolent accountant it is time it was made simpler and more business friendly. eg give business an option of making regular monthly or bimonthly payments based on pevious years income and a balance amount when the tax return is completed, An option of revisiting with the IRD the scheduled payment if annual income has significantly changed. Would it hurt for IRD to send an auto email reminder if payment has been missed with a 48hr grace period to pay, most of us are able to pay tax online so a red hot reminder that penalty interest will kick in would see a high percentage of payment and a significant reduction in angry taxpayer phone feedback.

Deitrich von Stade Is it the amount thats important or is it that the customer is defaulting and not making any attempt to sort their debt out. In terms of being able to report to credit reports maybe it needs to be for amounts that are significant, or several years overdue? Id hate to think theyd report me if I was 2 weeks late on a small income tax bill. Shouldnt IRD also be looking for other ways to recover outstanding debts? Putting a debt recovery charge on top of PAYE deductions would be a way to achieve this. Dont know if this is actually done/common practice now? Results: Agree: 10 Disagree: 3 Bea I strongly disagree with this proposal. IRD already has a penalties regime to discourage late payment. There is also the frequent circumstance where in a family business, there is a credit in one taxpayer and a debt in another, or a credit in one period and a debt in another or a credit in one tax type and a debt in another and they have yet to be offset against each other. IRD would be disclosing the debts to credit reporters when no net debt exists. If lenders who use credit reporters wish for assurance that there is no tax debt, they are perfectly able to seek proof from the borrower such as a letter from a chartered accountant or a printout of tax balances.

Privacy is such a delicate issue and there are a myriad of situations such as those mentioned above, which are hard to quantify. If it is up to the individual to disclose IRD debts when applying for credit, some people would choose to withold this information, so making it available would protect lenders from these potential liabilities. With the increase in online data being shared, privacy is an ongoing issue that should be open for serious public debates, especially in these cases. I do think that IRD debts should affect individual's credit ratings, the same as for any seriously overdue amount that gets sent to Veda Advantage for example. That way, creditors get a full picture and are then able to make an informed decision. I think it would depend on the total debt, length of debt etc. the same as for debts that currently get sent to collection agencies. There is no reason why IRD debts should be excluded from this. They should definitely be included somehow. What else are they talking about sharing? This is only one example. I would like to know please in plain bullet points what exactly they propose to share and to whom, thanks. It seems a bit vague to me right now. At the moment it sounds like the opposite of a secrecy rule! Back to the point at hand, I think the same lengths of time and amounts as what are dealt with by Veda for other debts should apply to IRD, maybe there is a standard? They must have some sort of scale, or is it purely done by timeframe? Creditors should be entitled to a full picture of applicants liabilities, regardless of dollar amount. If other debts have to be verified, why shouldn't IRD debts? Many individuals in this country spend outside their means. The subprime mortgage crisis in the US was a reminder that there needs to be safeguards in place. This particular disclosure would save a lot of people a lot of heartache, but what other information and to whom are you proposing is shared?....thank-you. I can't agree to something unless I know what it is. Results: Agree: 6 Disagree: 2 Andrew Elphick There are alot of reasons why someone does to not furnish a return on time just as there are vaid reasons to issue default assessments to encourage filing of the returns. I wonder what percentage of IRD debt is default assessments. Would be fair that given all the circumstances are not avaialbale that IRD be given the opportunity to destroy credit ratings on a default assessment? In addition a crystalised debt may have hardship will the credit report destroy a persons rating after the write off by hardship? Will CSA debt which is at an all time high be added and hence reduce any chance at all of lending money to repay the debt? Are you advocating that if you don't pay your tax your credit rating wll be destroyed and hence it is better to go no assets procedure or bankrupt, after all there is nothing more to lose! Hasn't IRD social responsibilities?mmm Results: Agree: 5 Disagree: 2 NoName I think if that person hasn't done anything to sort out a debt they've got with ANYONE - let alone IRD - then IRD hsould be able to do anything/everything they can. I pay my taxes why shouldn't everyone else. But this should only be allowed when a significant length of time has gone past, and if the income tax return or GST return or whatever has actually been done. And only by an actual person at IRD - some things must be done automatically and get stuffed up when that happens. But then IRD can already go to someone's boss and take the money out of their wages - your credit card can't, so giving you a bad credit rating is the only thing they can do.

Last year the select commitee was taking submissions for changes to Transport (Vehicle and Driver Registration Act) 1986, for varied reasons including that Veda Advantage was data mining the motor vehicle register to sell the infromation to companies for direct marketing purposes. The first I was aware of this was when I received an offer from Cigna for a life insurance and they used my first name. This raised warning bells as I always go by my middle name which is Michael. I contacted them and found out they had obtained my details from Land Transport Motor Vehicle Registry via Veda. I also received an offer for a pre approved charge card from American Express in a similar fashion. A few years ago I also discovered how easy it is to screw up someones credit rating, again it was Veda Advantage involved (Known as Baycorp then). All the perpretrator has to do was make up a phony invoice with my company's name on it, and send it to Veda with the correct phone number but fake address, and presto - screwed credit rating I had engage a lawyer to threaten them with legal action. Ironically Veda were also pursuing the perpetrator's business for $100k. I recived a phone call from Veda, I strongly denied the debt, and that was the last I heard so I thought the matter was finished. Unfortunately I hadn't replied to their letter (I didn't recieve it) and they did what they did, no proof whatsoever required for the phony 'debt'. In short while credit rating agencies may serve a useful purpose to commerce but they are also a law on to themselves and they are not to be trusted. My Mother's last law job in law was working in the legal side of debt collection. She also told me about Baycorp and co's cowboy antics. It will be a big mistake for the IRD to give them or any of their ilk any implied credibility.

First of all, I must congratulate IRD for taking the initiative of creating this site and exploring new ways to making tax issues easier! \*Big round of applause to you all\* I'm a campaigner of Disability issues. I found this site through Facebook. When I visited the video section I was stunned to see lingual-segregation in practice. What is lingual-segregation? It is the action of seperating forms of language (visual, spoken, written). The use of video's is fantastic - how it's been done is not. I noticed there was a transcript below the video. If there is a transcript - then what purpose does the video serve? I highly recommend that the video has open captions inserted. There are 239,000 New Zealanders over the age of 15 with a form of hearing loss who require assistance to fully participate in normal activities. Assistance such as /subtitles captions and NZ Sign Language (NZSL is an official language of NZ). NZ has also adopted the NZ Disability Stragety. To date, no where on this site recognises either of the official languages, disability stragety or recognises NZ's signatory of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 1 in 5 New Zealanders have a Disability. If you do the maths, almost under 1 million citizens of NZ are being barriered. Yet, they pay tax... I would like to request the site admins to look into this to make information and discussions more accessible to these 1 in 5.To resolve the site accessibility, I recommend that the admins contact Jan Scown from Office for Disability Issues. ODI has done alot of work over the years to making government departments accessible. My concerns are valid as the disability community pays alot of tax, yet full access to tax matters in not provided. For years I've had lots of problems understanding IRD forms etc as I'm limited in communication face to face due to being Deaf. Please make IRD accessible to all. Thank you Results: Agree: 9 Disagree: 0 Forum admin Kim, thanks for your feedback.

The main purpose of the transcripts was to provide access to the video content for visually impaired people who rely on screen readers, although the transcripts also provide an alternative for those with hearing loss. However, your point about lingual separation and providing captions on the videos themselves is a good one, and we will aim to implement that when we next launch a site which uses videos.

Single income families should be able to split the income across the couple. This is only fair, if the partner that isnt earning isnt able to claim any kind of benefit because they are treated as a couple. My family would be much better off if we were divorced.

Recent experience when dealing with CODES calculated by IRD based on monthly employer returns and notified to the employer for mandatory application resulting in significant overpayment suggests that IRD systems take no account of changed circumstances and the stage in the Tax Year in which they occur . The case in point related to a young entrant to full time employment in January 2010. Income to that point was minimal (under $9,000). After the first month of Full Time employment and the employers return to IRD this seemingly was interpreted by what appears to be a computerised function to represent Annual Income of $30,000. The mandatory change advised to the employer resulted in an over deduction of a significant three figure sum which has now been refunded, but the proposal to make deductions final would have precluded that. IRD procedures for dealing with approaches to report changed circumstances are also flawed. Their letter to the employer based upon a false assumption must be acted upon by the employer. The onus to correct falls upon the employee who must present another declaration.

One of the basic principles of the privacy act is that no inofrmation is held under a common unique identifier. This would be necessary to enable this kind of sharing. If other government agencies need to see my data they can put in an official request and then the IRD would have to follow the principles of the Privacy Act to supply that information. The more automated sharing of data is allowed, the more margin for error exists. Also the more information that is held in one place about someone, the greater the exposure to possible identity theft by anyone who obtained unlawful access to that information.

Filling out a paper based form gives me certainty and I can double check that I have put all the figures in the right place. Mistakes made on a paper form are easily rectified - I rub figures out and write in the correct figures.

Without deadlines nothing happens and while it might initially cause negative feedback it will become accepted – a bit like analogue TV being turned off and lots of people having to go out and buy new TVs. During the transition period the IR should work with private sector to come up with a "kiosk type" business module which will provide terminals for taxpayers to use and also have relevant expertise available to help people (could be just a direct phone line back to IRD?). A small fee could be charged for this service (so the provider can cover their costs) and the taxpayer should get a tax rebate for making use of the service (so the tax payer is not out of pocket, maybe even give them a bonus rebate for be brave enough to try it!). The kiosks could be anywhere in the community e.g. a local store, an accountants office, bank, library etc - basically anywhere that a business is prepared to offer the service from. The kiosk would obviously have to be secure and only allow access to IR (unlike internet cafes or libraries where they can connect to anywhere and get infected with key loggers etc). It could perhaps even be franchise type business? There would obviously need to be a huge effort put into public awareness and maybe even some sort of travelling road show to show people how the kiosks works and what the benefits are etc. The kiosk would be great even for those with their own internet access that are temporarily away from home/office?

If I'm understanding this correctly, any loss I make wouldn't be claimable against my salary which would mean I would have to sell the house as I could no longer afford it. My tennant has lived there for ten years. They can't afford to buy a home of their own as their income is even lower than mine. Having one rental property is part of my retirement fund. Im not a professional property developer, nor am I a slum lord with dozens and dozens of houses and apartments. This would be reason enough to move to Australia where I can still make this kind of lifestyle and financial choice.

Results: Agree: 1 Disagree: 3 portia The ability to claim back a refund should not be based on the time worked, but the amount of the refund. Many people, especially beneficiaries work intermittently and this proposal could deny these people - those who need every dollar they can get - their refund. Results: Agree: 10 Disagree: 2 Jim I strongly disagree that PAYE should be a final tax. Working less during the year while taxing at a full year rate will punish anyone over the month threshold discussed. Sure, IRD wants to reduce its compliance costs and to hold onto small refunds that have high marginal costs for refunding. In my opinion, that's tough. We work to earn a living, and that is money we earned. Keeping more than the absolute calculated correct amount is both lazy and immoral. It is up to IRD to design systems that make their job easier at their own end, without penalising the hard working public. If you want to collect as much tax as possible, fine. But it is not a one way street. We have burdens to bear to comply with your tax law, you have a burden to make sure we can get back as much benefit as we can. If we have refunds available, we should be able to claim them, end of story. So to answer the question, everyone should be able to file an income tax return. If you have small amounts due from us, and the cost benefit of you collecting them is not worth your trouble, then that is your call, not ours. $50 might not mean anything to such a huge organisation, but it will buy shoes for the kids, food, or at least some benefit in our lives. Such a move would only provide benefit to IRD, not the public who, believe it or not, you are here to serve. Results: Agree: 28 Disagree: 6 760357388@facebook It's not 'their' tax law.

If you had any other form of income, or earned more than $200,000 in one year, you were required to file. There are some more details which I can't recall, but rather than taking away the ability to file, why not take away the requirement? That way you will not be making people give up on a potential refund, remove paperwork for a lot of people, and free up some precious time for IRD employees to help those with real problems. Probably you'll get a lot of people with part time work or irregular employment leaving money in the system also. Added bonus for the govt coffers! Results: Agree: 9 Disagree: 1 Bea I agree with the above two that everyone should be able to file a return if they want to, but that under certain circumstances they should not be required to file a return. There are already circumstances under which people are not required to file a return, so I think the current rules are close to adequate. IRD's online system needs to be improved to make it easier for individuals to calculate whether they have overpaid tax or not, so they can easily make the choice. Changes that would be beneficial are: raising the threshold of overseas interest/dividends earnt before you are required to file a return (currently only $200), and not being required to file a return to bring forward a loss from the previous year or excess imputation credits from the previous year (they should be brought forward automatically without the taxpayer being required to do anything). Results: Agree: 17 Disagree: 1 portia The more I think about this, the more I think it will be unfair unless Inland Revenue is able to demonstrate that the changes it is going to make to PAYE deductions reduce the current inaccuracies. The figures given in paragraph 7.11 of the discussion document show that just 20% of taxpayers had close to the correct deductions made. Of the other 80%, 31% were overdeducted and 49% underdeduction - with the averages being $188 and $108 respectively. I don't know anyone who would not claim a refund of $188, and this is just the average - some refunds must be much greater than this. Therefore, taxpayers must continue to be able to claim their refunds until such time as PAYE is significantly more accurate. Results: Agree: 14 Disagree: 1 portia The comment by the Forum Administrator to Deitrich von Stade that the proposals wouldn't affect her ability to offset rental losses against wage and salary income is not quite correct. In the discussion document, at paragraph 7.15, "Bill" is to receive a credit based on the amount of PAYE that should have been deducted from his employment income. In other words, any under or overdeduction is to be ignored and tax paid on the rental income at "Bill's" marginal tax rate. Presumably losses will also be cashed up at the taxpayer's marginal tax rate.

Mid rate changes in tax rates creating compoiste rates of tax, new rebates such an independent earner rebates as well as the seasonal nature of NZ's economy toeghther with the movement to part time employment in the service sector are producing alot more chance of under or overpayment.

For example, if someone works different hours each week, or has a change in pay rate. There would be no way the PAYE system would be able to correctly calculate the annual income tax if the weekly income is varying up and down. My understanding of the proposal is that those who have other income or losses eg rental income, dividends, self employed or overseas income in addition to their salary and wages, would still file an IR3 exactly the same as they do now. These people have the opportunity to square up their salary and wages income as part of that process. The same option needs to be available to anyone who ONLY has salary and wages income, even if its only optional.

Deitrich von Stade Of course IRD should be able to issue any media statement that it thinks is in the best interest of NZ tax payers. If that means issuing a press notice to say that a newspaper or a TV got some facts wrong then go for it. The NZ public has the right to know, and we should hold IRD accountable. They should be able to use any form of communication that will help them meet those accountabilities - that includes the use of social media, which to my surprise IRD seems to completely avoid at present. Results: Agree: 12 Disagree: 2 Bea The taxpayer's right to confidentiality should be paramount and should not be breached under any circumstances by IRD. If someone is seriously ripping off the tax system as in the example, then it becomes public through due process of the Courts. IRD should not pre-empt this. If IRD had the right to release a taxpayer's personal information in this way, it would be able to use that right to lean on the taxpayer. Nobody would wish to publically debate the actions of the IRD for fear of the IRD leaning on them in this way.

We've upped it from 1,000 to 5,000. Results: Agree: 2 Disagree: 0 flea Any form of quality management of this nature always creates additional workload for the developer as it needs to be built into their software development lifecycle process and I question the need for this type of control. Does being a "registered developer" or having "IRD approved" attached to your product really add value to the customer? Sure it might increase customer confidence for buying products sold off the shelf via retail outlets or online, but as for the developers that don't use those channels for their sales is it really of any benefit? As a developer of many years we are confident in our own ability to develop software that meets legislative requirements without the need to be certified/endorsed – fundamentally if our software was not meeting the requirements we would not have any customers. If it is deemed necessary to have a quality management system then I think the Australian Tax Office system works fairly well. It breaks down the various areas of compliance (as Jethrocarr has suggested) and as a developer you can register your product, after testing your product using the test scenarios provided by the ATO, for whichever areas are relevant to your product. Under the ATO model you don't normally register a specific version of your product and as a developer it is your responsibility to ensure that once you have registered your product any subsequent versions/updates remain compliant (always using the latest published test scenario). It is also the developer's responsibility to ensure any new/updated test scenarios published by the ATO are tested against their product.

Management of debt and unfiled returns
======================================

This category is limited to activities to prevent returns and debt becoming overdue, and to collect unfiled returns and overdue payments, whether for the Crown, other agencies or external parties.

How we performed
----------------

| 2019-20 actual |     | 2020-21 target | 2020-21 actual | 2021-22 target |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     | **Primary measures** |     |     |     |
| 93.2% | Percentage of returns filed by customers on time | 85% | (M) 94.3% | 85% |
| $40.22 | Value of assessed revenue for every unfiled return dollar spent | $40.00 | (M) $53.75 | $45.00 |
|     | This measure demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of our work to recover assessed revenue from returns not filed by the due date.<br><br>We use our advanced analytical tools to identify unfiled returns that are likely to be of a higher value, and we’re finalising more high-value returns through our Budget 2018 initiatives work.<br><br>We are increasing the target for this measure from $40 to $45 for 2021-22. |     |     |     |
| 85.9% | Percentage of tax payments made by customers on time | 85% | (M) 89.9% | 85% |
| $64.54 | Cash collected for every debt dollar spent | $40.00 | (M) $40.03 | $40.00 |
| 70.0% | Percentage of child support assessments paid on time | 70% | (M) 72.5% | 70% |
|     | **Supporting measures** |     |     |     |
| $50.83 | Average cost of finalising an unfiled return | $30.00 or less | (D) $44.71 | Measure retired |
|     | Not achieved - The average cost of finalising an unfiled return decreased from last year. This measure demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of our work finalising returns not filed by the due date.<br><br>We focus on finalising unfiled returns with value attached, rather than those which are less economical to pursue. Through our advanced analytics, we can now identify those unfiled returns that are likely to be of a higher value. As we leverage information collected by our systems to determine customer obligations and entitlements, the volume of unfiled returns decreases.<br><br>This measure relates to the volume of filed returns rather than value and is no longer fit for purpose. We’re retiring this measure for 2021-22. Our ‘value of assessed revenue for every unfiled return dollar spent’ measure is more appropriate. |     |     |     |
| 45.1% | Percentage of unfiled returns that are finalised within 6 months | 60% | (D) 49.2% | 60% |
|     | Not achieved - The percentage of unfiled returns finalised within 6 months increased from last year. This measure demonstrates the effectiveness of our activities to help customers with unfiled returns.<br><br>To support customers through COVID-19, Release 4 of our transformation programme and automatic income tax assessments, we reduced our focus on compliance activities. We’ve now resumed compliance activities and are revising our strategy for managing payments and assessments.<br><br>Transformation has allowed us to automatically determine more customer obligations and entitlements using information we already have. Because of this, we’re moving away from requiring all customers to file returns. Consequently, the volume of unfiled and late-filed returns is decreasing: 566,922 returns were late in 2019-20, compared to 547,071 in 2020-21. |     |     |     |
| 51.6% | Percentage of collectable debt value over 2 years old | 50% or less | (D) 51.7% | 40% or less |
|     | Not achieved - The percentage of collectable debt value over 2 years old increased slightly from last year. This measure looks at how much of our collectable debt is aging and, therefore, becoming harder to collect.<br><br>With the introduction of automatic income tax assessments in 2019, we have more customers receiving an annual tax assessment and, as a result, an increasing number of customers with debt.<br><br>Collectable debt includes student loan debt, which contributes to a high proportion of debt over two years old. Most is owed by overseas-based borrowers and is harder to collect. Student loans cannot be written off as bad debt (with limited exceptions such as for death or bankruptcy).<br><br>We’re removing student loan and Small Business Cashflow (loan) Scheme debt from the measure for 2021-22 and, therefore, tightening the target to 40% or less. To maintain visibility of student loan performance, for 2021-22 we’re introducing a new measure: ‘percentage of student loan customers that meet their obligations’. |     |     |     |
| 70.8% | Percentage of new customer debt resolved within 6 months | 80% | (D) 49.7% | 50% |
|     | Not achieved - The percentage of new customer debt resolved within 6 months decreased from last year. This measure focuses on customers who have recently gone into debt and the debt being cleared in a timely manner.<br><br>To support customers through COVID-19, Release 4 and automatic assessments, we reduced our focus on compliance activities, helped customers set up instalment arrangements and provided other relief options. We did not run our usual 7 February and 7 April payment reminders and paused automatic deduction notice processes. Automatic assessments for individual income tax brought more customers with debt into the system.<br><br>In 2021-22, we’re decreasing our target to 50% and removing student loans and Small Business Cashflow (loan) Scheme loans from the measure. Removing these products from the measure will provide better visibility of tax debt categories that we can influence directly.<br><br>To maintain visibility of student loan performance, for 2021–22 we’re introducing the measure: ’percentage of student loan customers who meet their obligations’. |     |     |     |
| 80.1% | Percentage of New Zealand liable parent child support debt cases resolved within 12 months | 75% | (M) 79.8% | 75% |

All targets are unaudited.

Managing client messages
========================

The 'All client messages' dashboard is similar to the current 'All client mail' service. You can filter messages to us from your staff and messages from us within a date range of up to 2 weeks at a time. You can sort the results by clicking on the column headers and filter the results by account type or message direction.

Other features include:

*   being able to view the web logon of the person in your agency who sent or received a client message (for messages received, you can see when your staff member opened it or if it’s still unread)
*   the ability to open a message thread and any associated attachments
*   an export tool to create a PDF of the selected message content to file into your own client management system.

This service is only for viewing messages. You'll still need to use the 'Messages' service to reply to us.

To minimise the security risk of opening up access to all client messages, the following applies:

*   Owner, administrator and restricted administrator logons can access the dashboard. The existing client list security settings are applied.
*   The dashboard is only for client-specific messages between us and an intermediary. It does not show messages between us and the client, or their third party (such as their nominated person).
*   Messages relating to your agency's IRD number are not included, even if you're linked to yourself.
*   To protect the privacy of past messages, we only show messages sent from the date the dashboard went live on 4 May 2022. However, replies to older messages will bring the whole message chain into the dashboard.
*   If a client changes intermediaries, the client messages between us and the old intermediary are not available to the new one.

**Exporting messages to PDF**
-----------------------------

You can create a PDF of message content by clicking the ‘Export’ button. This will allow you to select the message rows 1 at a time or you can ‘select all’. If you have filtered by account, message direction, or both, this will reduce the messages shown onscreen and the ‘select all’ will then work across what you have filtered.

After selecting the messages you wish to export click the ‘Export to zip’ button to convert the messages into a zip folder. The PDFs will then be available to save into your own client management system.

**Message attachments**
-----------------------

Inbound and outbound messages that contain an attachment will have a tick showing in the 'Attachment column' on the dashboard. Message attachments are not able to be exported in bulk using the ‘Export to zip’ function. If you need to save a copy of an attachment offline you can open the message from the dashboard and then open the attachment. Once the file is open you save it in the usual way you would save a file.

**File name formatting**
------------------------

The files follow a prescribed format with an underscore as the separator between each group of data.

_yyyymmdd\_hhmmss\_123456789aaa000\_name40\_subject50.pdf_

*   Year then month then day.
*   Hours then minutes then seconds.
*   Client ID number or account ID.
*   Client name (truncated to 40 characters with any invalid characters removed).
*   Subject line (truncated to 50 characters and any invalid characters removed).

The file name format for messages differs from client letters as there is no unique letter ID - the date time stamp is included to ensure uniqueness of the file name. As there is no 5-digit letter ID the subject line has been included but can be very long. We have excluded the period and hyphens in the account ID to shorten the files overall length.

[All Income tax dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[Income tax])

Most Māori authorities need to set up a Māori authority credit account (MACA) to keep track of their tax activity. MACAs record income tax paid and credits available for members. Māori authorities that do not need a MACA are those:

*   whose rules do not allow it to distribute its income or property to members
*   that only get exempt income within a [wholly owned group](/api/glossary/item?id={0D199BE9-BE71-40C4-95FC-9DC483D2F3CD})
     (except for certain types of dividends).

What MACAs record
-----------------

The account records Māori authority activity from 1 April to 31 March regardless of an authority’s balance date. The account details an opening balance, credit or debit entries and the closing balance.

The opening balance of a MACA is the same as the previous year’s closing balance. This may be a debit or credit amount. New Māori authorities start with an opening balance of nil.

If the closing balance is a credit, the Māori authority can use the credits in following years. A debit closing balance means further income tax is required. This tax needs to be paid by 20 June. A 10% Māori authority distribution penalty tax will also need to be paid.

Credit entries
--------------

These entries increase the credits available to members. Credit entries are recorded as dollar amounts. They can be:

*   further income taxes paid to reduce a previous year’s closing debt balance
*   Māori authority credits attached to distributions received from other Māori authorities
*   imputation credits attached to a dividend that the Māori authority receives
*   overturned adjustments made to offset previous debt we allocated
*   resident withholding taxes deducted from income that the Māori authority receives
*   foreign dividend payment (FDP) credits attached to dividends received by Māori authorities that do not have a FDP account.

Credit entries may also be income tax paid to meet provisional tax requirements or tax liability. There are exceptions for income tax that:

*   would have been payable had the MACA year ended the day before the Māori authority was formed
*   was paid using credits the Māori authority already held in its MACA, received as income from another Māori authority
*   is further income tax credited against any tax that happens after the payment of further income tax
*   is an allocation of any overpayment of provisional tax by a Māori authority.

Debit entries
-------------

These entries reduce the credits available to members. Debit entries are recorded as dollar amounts that are:

*   Māori authority credits attached to distributions paid to members
*   overpaid provisional tax used to satisfy tax of another wholly owned Māori authority
*   allocation debits that may have arisen from using an incorrect credit ratio
*   adjustments for when a shareholding change of more than 34% has happened
*   overpaid income tax for liabilities other than income tax or provisional instalments
*   apportions of income tax for days the organisation was a Māori authority
*   amounts equal to the credit balance immediately before the Māori authority ceases
*   adjustments for when we consider arrangements have been made for tax advantage
*   adjustments made to remove unused credit after loss of membership continuity
*   refunds of FDP paid to Māori authorities that are not foreign dividend account companies.

Debt entries may also be income tax refunds received during the year, except where the refund relates to:

*   an income year where the authority did not maintain a MACA
*   a part of a year where the authority did not operate a MACA.

Ngā tohanga mana Māori Māori authority distributions
====================================================

The taxing rules for distributions change if an eligible company or trust elect to be taxed as a Māori authority.

Distributions of cash or kind are Māori authority distributions to authority members. Māori authority distributions are either taxable or non-taxable distributions.

Making distributions
--------------------

Shareholders of companies that are Māori authorities, and beneficiaries of trusts that are Māori authorities, are generically termed members (of a Māori authority).

Distributions of dividends to shareholders and trust distributions to beneficiaries of a Māori authority are generically referred to as Maori authority distributions to a member.

A distribution that is a taxable Māori authority distribution to a member is a distribution from an authority’s post-2005 and subsequent tax years tax paid income reserves.

All other distributions between a Māori authority and its members is more than likely a non-taxable distribution to the member.

It is the directors or trustees of a Māori authority that determine whether a Māori authority distribution will be taxable or non-taxable. Factors that may be relevant in making this decision are the balance of pre-2005 income year income reserves, the balance of post-2005 income year income reserves, current year’s income and the balance in the authorities MACA account.

Examples of Māori authority distributions are set out below.

| Distribution type | Example |
| --- | --- |
| The amount paid or credited by the Māori authority to a member or in any manner or under any name. | A Māori authority pays a distribution to its members based on the individual members land shares. |
| A taxable bonus issue made by the Māori authority. |     |
| An amount applied by the Māori authority exclusively for the member. | A Māori authority may pay a member’s electricity bill. Although this amount isn’t paid or credited to the member, it’s treated as a distribution as it’s applied for the benefit of that member. |
| An amount advanced by the Māori authority to a member to the extent that the advancement isn’t a genuine investment by the Māori authority. | A Māori authority may extend an interest-free loan to a member. As they would have received interest if they had invested that money in a bank, the interest forgone by the Māori authority is treated as a distribution to the member who received it. |
| Property disposed of by the Māori authority to a member without payment in cash or kind or where the payment is less than the market value of the property. | A Māori authority owns a hectare of land with a market value of $30,000. If the Māori authority sells that land to a member for $20,000, the $10,000 difference between the market value and the actual price paid will be treated as a distribution to the member. |
| Property disposed of by a member to the Māori authority for more than the market value of the property. | A Māori authority member owns a hectare of land with a market value of $30,000 that the Māori authority wishes to use for its own purposes. If the Māori authority were to pay $40,000 for the land, the $10,000 that the member receives over and above the market value of the land will be treated as a distribution. |

Specific Distributions
----------------------

Every year Inland Revenue is asked to explain the tax treatment of particular types of distribution to members. These are distributions that are described as kaumatua grants and education grants.

The descriptive words to describe a particular distribution does not determinate whether the payment is taxable or non-taxable.

As with all distributions they are either taxable or non-taxable. It is non-taxable if paid from pre-2005 year reserves. It is taxable if paid from post-2005 year reserves. It is the authorities directors or trustees who are responsible for making this decision.

Kaumatua grants
---------------

This is a monetary payment made by a Māori authority to a member. It is a Māori authority distribution. It will be taxable if the distribution is paid from post-2005 income.

Education grants
----------------

An education grant is a monetary payment made by a Māori authority to a member, generally made to enable that member to gain a trade or tertiary qualification.

A grant may be a bursary, a scholarship, or other financial assistance to the members to assist children attend primary and secondary schools or tertiary institutions.

An education grant is a Māori authority distribution. An education grant may be accounted for by the Māori authority as a non-taxable or a taxable distribution. The authority must apply the MACA rules if the distribution is a taxable distribution.

[Māori authority credit accounts](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/income-tax-for-maori-authorities/maori-authority-credit-accounts-maca)
 

Members who receive taxable distributions must include that income, inclusive of MACA tax credits, in their individual tax return.

Educational grants that are bursaries and scholarships that are taxable Māori authority distributions when paid by the authority are exempt income to the member. Taxable distributions will have an amount of MACA tax credits attached. A member may obtain a refund of these tax credits by including them in their end of year tax return.

If a Māori authority is a registered charity and qualifies for an income tax exemption, the rules regarding Māori authority distributions do not apply. Refer to our charities page for more information on your requirements.

1 Māori Economy Landscape – Interim Report Defining Inland Revenue’s Māori customer base “They’re about growing whānau...growing hapū...growing iwi” July 2019 | Customer Insight & Evaluation IN CONFIDENCE 1 IN CONFIDENCE2 Contents What is the business problem? How can we solve the business problem? What did we learn?What will we do next? Tu a t a h iTuaruaTuatoruTu a w h ā IN CONFIDENCE3 What is the business problem? Tu a t a h i IN CONFIDENCE 3 IN CONFIDENCE4 Inland Revenue wants to better understand Māori customers and their needs Inland Revenue has a constitutional responsibility to the Treaty of Waitangi to work in partnership with Māori, encourage participation of Māori in our work, and protect Māori knowledge, practices and language. However, currently, Inland Revenue does not have a good understanding of how it currently influences outcomes for Māori. This is partly because we don’t have monitoring and evaluation in place for our Māori customers, and it’s also difficult to identify Māori customers in our data. This means that we don’t know who our Māori customers are or what is needed to help meet their tax obligations and access our services. 4 “The first thing to understand for all government agencies is that the demographic makeup of Māori is diverse. You do not have a homogenous Māori population, and you do not have a homogenous Māori economy. So the types of services will actually be variable.” IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE5 How can we solve the business problem? Tuarua IN CONFIDENCE 5 IN CONFIDENCE6 We will produce a customer landscape document to help Inland Revenue make strategic choices about outcomes for Māori, and improving those outcomes Inland Revenue is developing two initiatives focused on Māori: •The Māori Customer Strategy •Māhutonga (Inland Revenue’s strategic approach to working with Māori) These two initiatives will help Inland Revenue: •Meet its constitutional responsibility to the Treaty of Waitangi •Drive activities that support achievement of Māori customer outcomes that are aligned to the Government’s wellbeing outcomes. The Māori Economy landscape will feed into these two initiatives. It will help us to show: •who our Māori customers are, •what their journey and experience is with us, •future changes that may influence Māori customers, and •the direction for improving outcomes for Māori customers. 6 IN CONFIDENCE7 The landscape takes a two-phase approach that starts with Inland Revenue talking with Māori customers PHASE 1 This interim document reports on the outcomes of Phase 1: •Define who Inland Revenue’s Māori customers are. •Identify what Māori customers see as important. •Produce a prioritised list of Māori customer groups to focus on in Phase 2. “You need to understand the cultural understandings of Māori, or else you’ll still be asking ‘Who’s a Māori?’. Māori is about whakapapa.” PHASE 2 A final document will report on the outcomes of Phase 2: •Who our Māori customers are. •What their journey and experience is with us. •Future changes that may influence Māori customers. •The direction for improving outcomes for Māori customers. “If you could get people participating in the formal economy and standing on their own two feet ... whānau wellbeing increases ... But it needs to be integrated ... can’t be doing something fantastic on the IRD side if MSD aren’t on board ... then the whānau will suffer” INFORMS IN CONFIDENCE8 Our research takes a kaupapa Māori approach that is informed by tikanga Māori This is a research project conducted using kaupapa Māori principles. This means that appropriate time and consideration has been given to tikanga Māori in the planning and conduct of fieldwork and reporting. We drew on the approach developed by Te Arawhiti to guide stakeholder engagement. “It’s quite refreshing to have this type of approach, where people are coming out and talking to us from IRD... this is a continuation of the relationship building exercise.” 8 IN CONFIDENCE9 Multiple methods in Phase 1 helped to produce quality insights CUSTOMER INTERVIEWS To identify te ao Māori perspectives important to Māori customers lives. INTERNAL WORKSHOP To present and refine findings from the interviews and literature review. LITERATURE REVIEW To understand how other agencies define the Māori economy. Producing quality insights IN CONFIDENCE10 We consulted multiple parties on issues facing Māori customers 31 CUSTOMER INTERVIEWS Talked with Māori customers from whānau, hapū and iwi across urban and rural locations in New Zealand. 14 INTERNAL STAFF INTERVIEWS Gathered feedback from Inland Revenue staff representing various areas across the organisation. 4 SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS Consulted internal subject matter experts with regards to taking a kaupapa Māori approach to the research. 5 EXTERNAL PUBLICATIONS Considered publications from other agencies and organisations when defining the Māori economy. IN CONFIDENCE11 What did we learn? Tuatoru IN CONFIDENCE 11 IN CONFIDENCE12 Māori views of the economy are influenced heavily by key values of te ao Māori These values were weaved through their stories about the Māori economy. Below depicts te ao Māori values that our Māori customers identified on as being important for them. A snapshot of individual values can be found over the next few pages. IN CONFIDENCE 13 Below are some views from our Māori customers when describing the Māori economy IN CONFIDENCE 14 Below are some views from our Māori customers when describing the Māori economy IN CONFIDENCE 15 Below are some views from our Māori customers when describing the Māori economy IN CONFIDENCE 16 Below are some views from our Māori customers when describing the Māori economy IN CONFIDENCE17 Whakapapa Māori (Māori ancestry) is an essential indicator when determining who is in the Māori economy Also, whānau are considered most important. Whānau are represented throughout all structures that exist in the Māori Economy. Māori views are that if you grow whānau, then you grow hapū and iwi. IN CONFIDENCE18 Inland Revenue desires a deeper understanding of its Māori customer base Inland Revenue wants to improve its knowledge of te ao Māori. Inland Revenue’s understanding of its Māori customers is limited to those that it can easily identify e.g. iwi entities and Māori Authorities. Inland Revenue wants a better understanding of how Māori place whānau at the centre of Māori wellbeing, and what that means for our services. IN CONFIDENCE19 A definition has been produced that brings the views of our Māori customers together with Inland Revenue’s perspectives: Customers and their whānau with whakapapa Māori (Māori ancestry), who contribute to the cultural, social and economic wellbeing of Aotearoa New Zealand. 19 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE20 Common themes from the feedback received were: 1. All customers are Inland Revenue’s customers, no need to specify that 2. Need to include those who aren’t technically Inland Revenue’s customers e.g. tamariki, volunteers 3. Having Māori ancestry is essential regardless of whether they are owners, employers, employees, etc 4. Recognise those who contribute by giving or receiving goods and serivces 5. Needs to also include te ao Māori and Māori wellbeing 6. Should show link that improved Māori wellbeing would positively influence the nation Taken from our customers views and literature, a definition was presented to Inland Revenue participants at the internal workshop: “Inland Revenue customers with whakapapa (Māori ancestry) that contribute to the New Zealand economy.” Feedback was taken into consideration and used to refine the definition to: “Customers and their whānau with whakapapa Māori (Māori ancestry), who contribute to the cultural, social and economic wellbeing of Aotearoa New Zealand.” REFINETESTREVIEW IN CONFIDENCE21 Through listening to the voice of the customer, Inland Revenue was able to recognise knowledge gaps and the need to focus on specific priority groups: Māori individuals, whānau and Māori business 21 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE22 Common themes from the feedback received were: 1. Focus on the customer groups that we know the least about 2. A huge gap is that we struggle to even identify certain customer groups 3. Inland Revenue’s understanding of whānau is limited 4. The customer groups shouldn’t be segmented from an Inland Revenue standpoint We presented Inland Revenue with priority groups for further focus. These were decided after listening to what customers told us were important to them during the interviews. The initial groups were: whānau, marae, Māori small business. Feedback was taken into consideration and used to refine the priority groups to: •Individuals, whānau, Māori business These customer groups need to be understood from a te ao Māori perspective and not from the typical Inland Revenue centric view: •Individuals means pēpē, rangatahi, pakeke, kaumātua and kuia. Not salary and wage earners, provisional tax payers, Student Loan borrowers or KiwiSaver customers. •Whānau means the combination of all the Individuals mentioned above. Not a focus on parents and tamariki under our Families customer segment touching products like Working for Families or Child Support. •Māori businesses means te ao Māori and whānau are at the heart of their business models. Not necessarily its growth, size or profitability. REFINETESTREVIEW IN CONFIDENCE23 What will we do next? Tu a w h ā IN CONFIDENCE 23 IN CONFIDENCE24 “Working with them like that, like the whānau ora concept ... working with whānau, it’s not working with that person, so it’s the whole whānau concept. So businesses like ours, we’re a whānau business. So working from a whole whānau perspective.” IN CONFIDENCE Phase 2 will involve another deep dive into our Māori customers world to look for opportunities that contribute to improved wellbeing for Māori The definition and priority groups are now being used to produce a scope for the Phase 2 work. Kaupapa Māori principles will again be followed when designing our approach. The methods we use will help us to gain a deeper understanding of: •who our Māori customers are, •what their journey and experience is with us, •future changes that may influence Māori customers, and •the direction for improving outcomes for Māori customers. The scope will allow us to consider timing, methods and resources and whether we will need to narrow the priority groups further. Now that we have a better understanding of our Māori customers’ views, we will consider if we should relabel the landscape so that it better reflects the all-encompassing nature of our Māori customer base. 24 IN CONFIDENCE25 Disclaimer The views, opinions, findings, and conclusions expressed in this report do not necessarily reflect the views of Inland Revenue.

This landscape will go on to inform two specific initiatives at Inland Revenue: •Māhutonga is an approach to weave the Treaty of Waitangi into our organisation; and •Mauri Ora Te Whānau is a strategy providing direction for how we respond to and support our Māori customers. The landscape brings whānau, hapū and iwi perspectives into Inland Revenue. The rich stories and insights from whānau, hapū and iwi provide an understanding of what is important when engaging with us. Building empathy with, and a deeper understanding of, our Māori customers’ world will help Inland Revenue to become a customer-centeredorganisation. It will also help us to meet our responsibilities under the Treaty of Waitangi and ultimately –improve outcomes for our Māori customers. 1) Family, extended family, family group, kinship –the primary economic unit of traditional Māori society. 2) Subtribe, kinship group –consists of a number of whānau sharing descent from a common ancestor. 3) Tribe, extended kinship group –refers to a large group of people descended from a common ancestor and associated with a distinct territory. 1 2 3 They also present opportunities for Inland Revenue to improve its practice when working with our Māori customers. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Three important principles underpinned our research. Multiple research methods were used to ensure robust and compelling findings. Understanding authentic Māori views from whānau, hapū and iwi were the drivers behind each method. Kaupapa Māori research principles were followed so that appropriate time and consideration was given to tikanga Māori (Māori protocols) in the planning and conduct of our fieldwork and reporting. 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Customer interviews with 75 whānau across Aotearoa New Zealand. A literature review to better understand whānau and whānau-centred practice. 8 A customer survey receiving 331 responses from our Māori customers. Additional supplementary analysis that drew on existing insights from other internal and external sources to better understand the impacts of COVID-19 for Māori. Workshops with internal stakeholders. Our findings have come from a variety of sources. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 9 Our early research set the focus for the landscape on the concept of ‘whānau’. In the past Inland Revenue tended to focus on how we can support the ‘Māori economy’, but our early research broadened our understanding. Our first phase of research found that views about the Māori economy from whānau, hapū and iwi were that: The Māori economy is influenced heavily by cultural values of the Māori world. Whānau are represented throughout every structure in the Māori economy. Whānau is extremely important to Māori (Customer Insight & Evaluation, 2019b). These fundamental learnings enabled us to better define who Inland Revenue’s Māori customers are, being: “Customers and their whānau with whakapapa Māori (Māori ancestry), who contribute to the cultural, social and economic wellbeing of Aotearoa New Zealand”. This definition confirmed that the focus for the landscape would include Māori individuals, families and businesses and that Inland Revenue would seek to explore these groups through a collective, ‘whānau’ lens. The rationale is that through supporting whānau Māori to achieve their aspirations, Inland Revenue will contribute to positive long-term outcomes for iwi Māori, the Māori economy, and Aotearoa New Zealand. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] We have also overlaid a COVID-19 lens to ensure a timely and appropriate response from Inland Revenue for our Māori customers. Resources have been allocated at an unprecedented scale and pace to address the economic crisis the COVID-19 pandemic has caused. Inland Revenue adapted its approach during COVID-19 to support people through the response, recovery and rebuild, while continuing to promote voluntary compliance. The landscape considers the challenges that whānau Māori are facing during COVID-19 and ensures that any opportunities for Inland Revenue to improve will allow us to provide a response to the pandemic that is appropriate and timely. 10 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 11 Understanding our Māori customers’ needs and aspirations 02 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] How can Inland Revenue be more cognisant of this holistic cultural world view when supporting whānau Māori? The Māori world view is holistic. 12 In the Māori world everything is interconnected. Social, cultural, environmental and economic perspectives are intertwined. The Māori world view involves cultural values that are applied through traditional knowledge, beliefs and practices. These values include, but are not limited to: Manaakitanga is about hospitality and the act of caring for others by showing kindness, generosity and reciprocal support. -Ahu whenua trustee, Bay of Plenty “We have very strong values of manaakitanga, kotahitanga, whanaungatanga, and we tend to work with organisations that are similar, and they don't necessarily even have to be Māori.” Whanaungatanga is about relationships, feeling a sense of belonging and embracing genealogical connections. Kaitiakitanga is about guardianship, the connection between people and the natural world, and looking after resources for future generations. Rangatiratanga is about self-determination, self- management and having the ability to decide your own aspirations in life. Whakapapa is about lineage through many generations, and linking to people and land. Kanohi ki te kanohi is about the importance of meeting face to face, being able to determine genuine intentions, and building trust. Intergenerational wellbeing is paramount. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Inland Revenue can better support our Māori customers, both as individuals within a whānau and as a collective, by placing whānau at the centre of our work. Whānau is central in the Māori world and is fundamental to wellbeing. 13 The term whānau is multifaceted and influenced by different factors, and therefore it cannot be defined by a single idea. There are two ways we look at the idea of whānau: Whakapapa whānau: Individuals connected through whakapapa (ancestry/kinship), bloodlines and generally link back to a common ancestor. -Kuia, Small whānau trust “Individually, yes, there are a lot of people within the Inland Revenue who understand whānau, but as a business or a Government department, no.” Kaupapa whānau: Individuals who share a common goal, values or who may live within close proximity to each other (Inland Revenue, 2019d). He Korowai Oranga (Ministry of Health, 2002) states that: External research shows that 93% of Māori support sustainable wellbeing and intergeneratonal change being whānau-based, both for individuals and collectives (Tūhono, 2019). 93% -He Korowai Oranga “as a principal source of strength, support, security and identity, whānau plays a central role in the wellbeing of Māori individually and collectively”. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 14 To understand the current context of our Māori customers’ lives, we need to take a step back. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] In signing the Treaty of Waitangi, two different worlds came together. 15 The Treaty was signed in 1840 and is considered to be the founding document of Aotearoa New Zealand. The overarching intention was to enable European settlers and Māori to live and prosper together. -Kuia, Bay of Plenty “That's what colonisation is about. They don't want to even look at the Treaty, it's too dangerous, because they'd have to face facts.” Ultimately one world view dominated to the demise of the other. However, European settlers brought with them a world view that was compartmentalised and individualistic. This was in conflict with the collective, holistic Māori world view. These differing world views meant that agreements made in the Treaty were understood in different ways. This resulted in contractual breaches by the Crown which devastated Māori and negatively impacted on Māori / Crown relations. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Since the signing of the Treaty, certain historical events have shaped Māori / Crown relations and the implications of these on Māori wellbeing remain in place today. 16 Local Government Councillor “Two generations back my mum was beaten for speaking te reo. Why would you beat someone up for speaking their language? That doesn't make sense, but it's a hurt we carry through generations.” As an agent of the Crown, and whose purpose it is to support the Crown in its relationships with Māori and deliver good outcomes for Māori customers, it’s vital that Inland Revenue acknowledge and empathise with this history in order to move forward. This included Government policies that focused on land confiscation, or preventing Māori from speaking their own language, which have had detrimental impacts on the Māori population. These negative implications extended to times of crisis similar to COVID-19, such as the 1918 Spanish flu, where the Māori mortality rate was 7 times higher in contrast to the British settlers. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 17 Historical grievances between Māori and the Crown have contributed to the intergenerational mistrust that our Māori customers havein Inland Revenue. Negative beliefs that Māori have about the Crown have been passed down from previous generations. This is a key reason why Māori have lower levels of institutional trust in comparison to non-Māori. 67% 32% 35% 36% 33% 83% 64% 56% 51% 50% Non-MāoriMāori Political system Legal system Tax system Education system Health system And these lower levels of institutional trust have contributed to the higher levels of mistrust that our Māori customers have in Inland Revenue. Percentage of customers who do not trust the following systems: 4 Levels of trust in Inland Revenue 5 4) Trust Perceptions Survey, 2019, base is between n=250 and n=260 for Māori and n=3,274 and n=3,338 for non-Māori. 5) Trust Perceptions Survey, 2019, n=254 for Māori and n=3,397 for non-Māori. 60% 39% 31% 43% 9% 18% Non-Māori Māori TrustNeutra lMistrust \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] The intergenerational mistrust that our Māori customers have in Inland Revenue, has some connection with attitudes to compliance. 6 -Managing Trustee, Whānau-focused service “It's a mistrust that's so ingrained. It goes beyond Inland Revenue, it's just a lack of trust, and it gets reinforced every day. Every day the rivers get dirtier, every day more shellfish die, and every day traditional food hunter-gatherers are being disadvantaged, so it reinforces their thinking that they're a victim of their circumstance. Government departments who try and get involved under the guise of helping are just seen as an arm of the oppression.” Focusing on improving relationships with Māori will go a long way in building trust. This in turn should improve attitudes about compliance. It should also contribute towards improving the wider Māori / Crown relationship. 18 6) Māori Customer Suvey, 2020, n=331 Those who have lower levels of trust tend to have more negative attitudes towards paying tax. For example, of those who had negative attitudes, 3% had lower levels of trust as opposed to 1% who had higher levels of trust. In contrast, those who have higher levels of trust tend to have more positive attitudes towards paying tax. For example, of those who had positive attitudes, 19% had low levels of trust while 31% had high levels of trust. Inland Revenue’s strategy to encourage voluntary compliance focuses on building trust with our customers, which in turn should build trust in the tax system. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Inland Revenue can address these enduring narratives by showing empathy when supporting whānau Māori. In addition, Inland Revenue’s dual role of providing support and enforcement is seen to be out of balance by some Māori customers. 19 Inland Revenue wants our customers to believe that if they are trying to do the right thing, that we will be there to help them. But, being fearful of the repercussions when obligations cannot be met means that some Māori customers avoid coming to us for support which often sees matters escalate into significant issues later on. Local Government Councillor “If you truly want to understand why things continue to happen cyclically, it's an intergenerational framework of fear, misunderstanding, and a lack of knowledge.” Inland Revenue is perceived by some of our Māori customers to have heavy-handed approaches to compliance, and this has contributed to the view that our Māori customers have of us. Non-Māori Māori Māori are less likely to feel that Inland Revenue trusts them to do the right thing, in comparison to non-Māori. 7 87% Further, 87% of Māori see us as an enforcer rather than a supporter. 9 Māori are more likely to feel that Inland Revenue lacks empathy and understanding and that Inland Revenue is not on their side, in comparison to non-Māori. 8 56% 71% 28% 41% 63% 35% 51% 74% MāoriNon -M āor i Inland Revenue lacks empathy Inland Revenue lacks understanding Inland Revenue is not on my side Percentage of customers who agree with the following: 7) Trust Perceptions Survey, 2019, n=302 for Māori and n=3,334 for non-Māori 8) Trust Perceptions Survey, 2019, base is between n=271 and n=296 for Māori and n=2,900 and n=3,297 for non-Māori. 9) Trust Perceptions Survey, 2019, n=277. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 20 It is these 3 beliefs that underpin how Inland Revenue thinks and responds so that we are striking a good balance between support and enforcement. Inland Revenue promotes these 3 beliefs that we want our customers to have in us. Three beliefs driving Inland Revenue’s practice should help strike a good balance between support and enforcement. When I am trying to do the right thing, Inland Revenue will help me. When I pay my taxes, I am doing a good thing (and that is what people like me to do). When someone else is trying to do the wrong thing, Inland Revenue will find them. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Pockets of good practice exist at Inland Revenue, signalling that we can strike a good balance between support and enforcement. 21 Business Transformation engages with Māori organisations to provide visibility and support of the upcoming tax and social policy changes for our Māori customers. MENE is a Network Group of internal stakeholders with a strategic and tactical focus on the delivery of services to our Māori customers. Policy are developing ways to engage Māori in the policy development process. Māhutonga weaves the strands of Tiriti o Waitangi and Māori perspectives, process and practice into IR. Kaitakawaenga Māori work in Community Compliance and respond to the needs of whānau Māori supporting them to achieve their aspirations. Customer Insight & Evaluation employs Māori researchers and evaluators to undertake research and evaluation with whānau Māori using kaupapa Māori principles. However, this good practice is in small pockets only. Taking more significant, systemic measures to embed this practice across Inland Revenue will ensure a wider reach. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 22 Now, more than ever, Inland Revenue needs to get it right to support Māori through the respond, recover and rebuild phases of COVID-19. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 51% 30% We know that our Māori customers will be struggling, and while Inland Revenue is delivering a COVID-19 response we could also be considering how to deliver a tailored and targeted response for our Māori customers. Māori are likely to be more impacted than non-Māori from the fall-out of the pandemic. 23 Many people living in Aotearoa New Zealand will be facing a long road of difficulties and uncertainty as the health of the economy and individuals is threatened. This will be felt most by those who were already living in precarious circumstances. Unfortunately this is the case for many Māori, who will recall similar inequities and suffering from the past. For example, Martin Jenkins (2020d) explains: During the economic downturn of the late-1980s, Māori unemployment was 4 times higher than for non- Māori. During the global financial crisis, Māori unemployment was 15.5%, in comparison to 4.6% for NZ Europeans. The economic impacts of COVID-19 are yet again expected to hit Māori communities the hardest: 51% of Māori households are ‘in difficulty’, in comparison to 30% of European households (Commission for Financial Capability, 2020). Even though the largest uptake of the Jobseeker Support since March 2020 has been non-Māori, Māori continue to be the largest group that is receiving this assistance (Ministry of Social Development, May 2020). There is a real potential to discriminate against Māori who have less access to necessary services, technology and data. This includes, but is not limited to, kaumātua and those living in rural communities (Inland Revenue, 2020j). Non-Māori Māori 15.5% 4.6% Māori Non-Māori \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 24 How can Inland Revenue meet the needs of Māori and better support whānau aspirations? \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 25 Opportunities for Inland Revenue 03 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Meeting our obligations under the Treaty of Waitangi will guide our approach to address the needs of our Māori customers and support whānau. 26 “IRD can be part of the ongoing problem, or they can be part of the solution. They can use their position to do partnership, protection and participation well. Now's the time.” Putting these principles into practice will help Inland Revenue to ensure that we are working towards being a better Treaty partner. To work in partnership with Māori. To encourage participation of Māori in our work. To protect Māori knowledge, practices and language. We focus on 3 principles that underpin the Treaty of Waitangi. Local Government Councillor \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] We have identified 3 tactical approaches that Inland Revenue can implement to put into action the Treaty principles. 27 Grow our understanding and empathy of the Māori world view so that when we are working with Māori we are responding appropriately. Foster active partnerships with Māori to show that our intentions to support whānau are genuine and that there are mutual benefits for both partners. Deliver whānau-focused services so that we are placing whānau at the centre of our work. Putting these approaches into action will ensure Inland Revenue contributes towards positive long-term outcomes for whānau Māori. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 28 Here’s how Inland Revenue can put these 3 tactical approaches into action. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] First, some important points to mention. Several actions, along with features of each action, were identified through our qualitative interviews with whānau Māori. To help Inland Revenue to allocate resources, these actions and features were assessed and prioritised in our survey, based on level of importance to the respondents. They were also tested with key Inland Revenue stakeholders. 29 The survey results were collected pre-COVID and so it is important to consider that peoples priorities may have changed post-COVID. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 30 Grow our understanding and empathy of a Māori world view. Tactical Approach 1: \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Understanding Māori history and using tikanga Māori (Māori protocols) and te reo Māori (the Māori language) will help Inland Revenue to ensure that whānau Māori are comfortable to come to us for support. This will also help Inland Revenue to build trust and empathy with whānau Māori. Understand Māori history and use tikanga Māori (Māori protocols) and te reo Māori (the Māori language) when interacting with whānau Māori. 31 In our survey, 81% agreed that Inland Revenue needs to improve its understanding of Māori history, and use tikanga Māori (Māori protocols) and te reo Māori (the Māori language) when interacting with whānau 12 . “To build relationships, don't send people out to the community with "how do you do?" They've got to learn te reo Māori. You don't have to be expert and you don't have to be fluent in te reo Māori but get your vowels right.” A list of prioritised features of how Inland Revenue could do this includes, but is not limited to: 11 Inland Revenue respecting the cultural beliefs, needs and preferences of whānau. 81% Inland Revenue understanding and respecting Māori history, including the history of the iwi that is connected to their local area. When thinking about the types of interventions to design for whānau Māori, evidence shows that the integration of tikanga Māori (Māori protocols) and te reo Māori (the Māori language) are commonly recommended as being effective (Martin Jenkins, 2020c). Inland Revenue observing and responding to tikanga (protocols) when necessary, including when being welcomed onto marae (meeting grounds) as manuhiri (visitors). Inland Revenue providing forms and information in te reo Māori (the Māori language), including digitally. Inland Revenue using te reo Māori (the Māori language) when interacting with whānau, including correct pronunciation. Rated by whānau as 2nd most important action for Inland Revenue to undertake. 10 10) Māori Customer Survey, 2020, n=331. 11) Māori Customer Survey, 2020, n=269.12) Māori Customer Survey, 2020, n=331. -‘Tāua(grandmother), Christchurch 1 2 3 4 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Providing welcoming environments will help Inland Revenue to ensure that whānau Māori are comfortable to come to us for support. This will also help IR to build trust and empathy with whānau. Provide physical and digital environments that are welcoming when whānau Māori need us for support. 32 In our survey, 74% agreed that Inland Revenue needs to provide environments that are welcoming when whānau need us for support. 15 “I know that manaakitanga (kindness), aroha (concern), and those principles, can be injected into the organisation. I think at the beginning, though, it's the front office, they're the ones who can either make or break the connection.” A list of prioritised features of how Inland Revenue could do this includes, but is not limited to: 14 Inland Revenue providing public spaces where whānau can comfortably bring their tamariki (children) to. 74% Inland Revenue providing large private rooms for when there are many whānau members included in meetings. Commentators have identified pros and cons to whānau Māori relying more on digital environments as a result of COVID-19 and its impacts: Inland Revenue using Māori greetings like “Kia ora” (“Hello”). Inland Revenue providing public spaces that are influenced by Māori cultural designs, te reo Māori (the Māori language) and traditional artefacts, including digitally. Inland Revenue using te reo Māori (the Māori language) in everyday conversations with whānau Māori. Rated by whānau as 3rd most important action for Inland Revenue to undertake. 13 13) Māori Customer Survey, 2020, n=331.14) Māori Customer Survey, 2020, n=331.15) Māori Customer Survey, 2020, n=255. It is important that whānau Māori can access environments that are comfortable for them when interacting with us. This includes our internal environments (front-of-house, phone, and digital) and when appropriate, meeting whānau in external environments like at their own homes, marae (meeting grounds) or community spaces. Deloitte (2020) note that the new normal of digital engagement will result in new ways to engage with land dividends beneficiaries and stakeholders through virtual platforms without the traditional barrier of distance. On the downside, the digital divide (poor internet and/or no device to access the internet) could mean some Māori customers miss out on opportunities to fully participate. -Māori land trustee 1 2 3 4 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 33 Foster active partnerships. Tactical Approach 2: \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Building enduring relationships with whānau, hapū and iwi will help Inland Revenue to ensure that Māori are active partners in addressing the needs of whānau Māori. This will also contribute towards improving the wider Māori / Crown relationship. Build enduring relationships with iwi, hapū and whānau. 34 In our survey, 78% agreed that Inland Revenue needs to improve its relationships with iwi, hapū and whānau 18 . “You really want to engage with Māori, then they have to be part of co-decision making, not co-design.” A list of prioritised features of how Inland Revenue could do this includes, but is not limited to: 17 Inland Revenue working together with iwi, hapū and whānau when designing strategies, policies, and legislation which impacts whānau Māori. 78% Inland Revenue participating in iwi-led hui/wānanga (a place of learning) including those that are held on marae (meeting grounds) and being able to participate appropriately. Iwi are a valuable Treaty partner for Inland Revenue as they are in a position to have the connections into communities to provide innovative and strategic solutions to support whānau and Māori businesses (Inland Revenue, 2020k). Inland Revenue forming meaningful relationships that are reciprocal and ongoing. Inland Revenue actively participating in Māori community-led events. Inland Revenue employing Māori people, including in leadership, who specialise in relationships with whānau, hapū and iwi.

The pandemic is an opportunity for Inland Revenue to support and work closely with iwi. If we do this well, then potentially we can build trust within a short period. -RūnangaTrustee, South Island 1 2 3 4 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Whānau Māori feel more comfortable going to trusted organisations for support. By building partnerships with these organisations, Inland Revenue will be in a better position to deliver our support and services to whānau Māori. Build partnerships with organisations that deliver services focused on whānau Māori. 35 In our survey, 79% agreed that Inland Revenue needs to build partnerships with organisations that deliver services focused on whānau Māori . 21 “What a lot of organisations need to think about is by Māori, instead of it being led by IRD.” A list of prioritised features of how Inland Revenue could do this includes, but is not limited to: 20 Inland Revenue supporting iwi, hapū and whānau initiatives that are focused on working with whānau. 79% Inland Revenue working with organisations to provide business training programmes for whānau Māori. Further, Inland Revenue (2020k) has identified a number of Government agencies working in partnership to support Māori through the pandemic. Inland Revenue working with other agencies to provide a mobile one-stop-shop for Government services for vulnerable whānau Māori. Inland Revenue working with relevant organisations to simplify land succession or whānau Māori. Inland Revenue working with social services providers so they know how Inland Revenue can support whānau Māori.

In the COVID-19 rapid review series, Martin Jenkins (2020c) highlights the importance of including non-Government organisations in Government responses to whānau Māori needs during COVID-19, as they have access to intelligence, networks and resources that can be leveraged at a local level. Te Arawhiti, the Office for Māori Crown Relations, is supporting iwi with their local response plans (Beehive, 2020). New Zealand Tourism and the Federation of Māori Authorities are working in partnership to provide support and guidance to struggling Māori businesses nationwide (Beehive, 2020). The Māori Trustee (Te Tumu Paeroa) have established a $10 million Māori Small Business Cashflow scheme to support Māori SMEs to meet their core operating costs (Te Tumu Paeroa, 2020).

Tactical Approach 3: \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Being whānau-focused will help Inland Revenue to deliver a culturally grounded, holistic service so that whānau Māori are engaged and driven to achieve their aspirations. 37 In our survey, 85% agreed that Inland Revenue needs to better understand, and respond to, a diverse range of whānau Māori. 24 Te PuniKokiri(2015) describe whānau-centred approaches as: “a culturally grounded, holistic approach focused on improving the wellbeing of whānau (families) and addressing individual needs within a whānau context”. A list of prioritised features of how Inland Revenue could do this includes, but is not limited to: 23 Inland Revenue supporting whānau Māori to access all the services that they need. 85% Inland Revenue considering the needs of whānau Māori, both collectively and individually, rather than just as individuals. Our literature review explains that: Inland Revenue providing information and support that whānau Māori need so they can make informed decisions. Inland Revenue working with whānau Māori to achieve their goals and aspirations. Inland Revenue working with whānau Māori so that they can determine their own needs and aspirations. Rated by whānau as 1st most important action for Inland Revenue to undertake. 22 22) Māori Customer Survey, 2020, n=331.23) Māori Customer Survey, 2020, n=280.24) Māori Customer Survey, 2020, n=331. A one-size-fits-all approach that focuses on individual needs and single-issue problems leads to services being fragmented and lacking in integration and coordination for Māori. By placing whānau at the centre, allowing whānau to identify for themselves what it is they want to achieve, and then supporting them to achieve these aspirations – whānau-centred approaches can empower whānau. Whānau ora (wellbeing) is achieved when whānau are the best that they can be. For the whānau-centred approach to be successful in any initiative it must be guided by tikanga Māori (Māori protocols). (Inland Revenue, 2019d) Respond to and support a diverse range of whānau Māori who have different needs and aspirations. 1 2 3 4 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Developing and promoting face-to-face options where possible will help Inland Revenue to build trust and improve relationships with whānau Māori. Develop and promote face-to-face options so they’re available to whānau Māori when necessary. 38 In our survey, 80% agreed that Inland Revenue needs to develop and promote face-to-face options . 27 -CEO, Iwi trust “Our old people still operate under your word is your bond. If you can't come and meet with me face to face, and look me in the eye, then you're a bit of a dodgy character. The other thing is it helps them to get a feel for people, and then they feel comfortable to talk about things.” A list of prioritised features of how Inland Revenue could do this includes, but is not limited to: 26 Inland Revenue visiting whānau Māori who find it difficult to access our services, like whānau living in rural areas. 80% Inland Revenue visiting drop-in centres making it easy for whānau Māori from rural areas to come to us for support. As mentioned earlier, kanohi ki te kanohi or face-to-face communication is an important cultural value for Māori, and in this digital world is especially important for whānau who are digitally excluded. Inland Revenue providing a regular kaumātua (elderly people) service in comfortable environments, like on a marae. Inland Revenue providing video calling as an option for whānau Māori to contact us. Inland Revenue holding face-to-face hui when large groups of whānau Māori want to be included. Rated by whānau as 6th most important action for Inland Revenue to undertake. 25 25) Māori Customer Survey, 2020, n=331.26) Māori Customer Survey, 2020, n=279.27) Māori Customer Survey, 2020, n=331. However, in light of the COVID-19 situation, the posed health risks have meant that prioritising face-to- face when necessary is not always possible right now. With the focus mostly on phone and digital contact, it’s important that Inland Revenue understands that this will have implications for some Māori. For example: Citizen’s Advice Bureau (2020) reports that Māori are over- represented amongst those who are digitally excluded. When developing the Digital Inclusion Blueprint for Aotearoa, the Department of Internal Affairs explained that, “as had been expected, we found factors such as poverty, health, education and social needs that disadvantage Māori generally, also have a direct correlation to the access, motivations, trust and skills that are related to digital inclusions/exclusion” (Piripi, 2018). With this in mind and because of current limitations due to COVID-19, Inland Revenue should be considering initiatives that seek to create a more equitable and inclusive digital environment. 1 2 3 4 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Developing targeted services and education/information resources will assist in ensuring whānau receive the support they are entitled to, and help whānau Māori to understand their obligations which should improve voluntary compliance. 39 In our survey, 79% said that Inland Revenue needs to develop targeted services and education resources specifically for whānau Māori. 30 -CEO, Te WhareWananga “Have wānanga with rangatahi to support their ideas; set our kids up better to understand business into the future.” A list of prioritised features of how Inland Revenue could do this includes, but is not limited to: 29 Inland Revenue providing specific advice for whānau trusts and land trusts. 79% Inland Revenue providing resources in te reo Māori. Inland Revenue providing specific advice for marae. Inland Revenue contributing to articles in Māori publications. Inland Revenue providing specific advice for rangatahi. Rated by whānau as 7th most important action for Inland Revenue to undertake. 28 28) Māori Customer Survey, 2020, n=331.29) Māori Customer Survey, 2020, n=280.30) Māori Customer Survey, 2020, n=331. Some Government departments and iwi are considering the most effective way to reach whānau Māori with messages during COVID-19. This includes: Providing tailored communications to Māori communities through appropriate and trusted channels (Ministry of Health, 2020). Going often with consistent messages from a small group of trusted voices, using multiple channels (Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei, 2020). We already know that Māori have low awareness of Inland Revenue’s products. For example, 60% of Māori weren’t aware that Working for Families Tax Credits entitlements will change if their family income changes -like reduction in hours worked or job losses. 60% Providing targeted information during COVID- 19 will help whānau Māori to make informed decisions about how to manage obligations and/or receive correct entitlements. 1 2 3 4 5 Develop targeted services and education resources / information specifically for whānau Māori. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 40 Recommendations & next steps 04 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Improving trust and outcomes for whānau Māori, and embracing our role as a Treaty partner, will take some fundamental, systemic changes. 41 Inland Revenue is a large, complex organisation that’s seeking to change its thinking and work in new ways. Changing mindsets and behaviours can be difficult, and the COVID-19 pandemic has further increased this complexity and shifted priorities. It is not a situation where we can improve one or two things and expect to move the dial. And while improving trust is already part of our long-term organisational strategy, we can do better at executing this for our Māori customers. And now is the prime opportunity to build trust and improve our relationship with Māori. If we can do that well in the current environment we will make good progress in moving that dial. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Next steps This landscape has identified a set of key opportunities that can help Inland Revenue to become a better Treaty partner and to improve outcomes for its Māori customers. Initially, these opportunities will be used to inform Māhutonga and the Māori Customer Strategy and its associated road map. Future ideation sessions focused on these opportunities will take place with other parts of Inland Revenue. 42 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 43 APPENDICES \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 44 Bringing it all together This diagram summarises the findings from our research i.e. the insights into our Māori customers’ world, their needs as a result of the issues being faced when interacting with us, the opportunities for Inland Revenue to improve, and some of the outcomes we’re working towards. Insights Historical grievances between Māori and the Crown have contributed to the intergenerational mistrust that our Māori customers have in Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue can address these enduring narratives by showing empathy when supporting whānau Māori. The Māori world view is holistic. Inland Revenue can better support our Māori customers, both as individuals within a whānau and as a collective, by placing whānau at the centre of our work. Focusing on improving relationships with Māori will go a long way in building trust. This in turn should improve attitudes about compliance. It should also contribute towards improving the wider Māori / Crown relationship. Inland Revenue’s dual role of providing support and enforcement is seen to be out of balance by some Māori customers. How can Inland Revenue be more cognisant of this holistic, cultural view when supporting whānau Māori? Whānau is central in the Māori world and is fundamental to wellbeing. Opportunities for Inland Revenue Putting these principles into practise will help Inland Revenue to ensure that we are working towards being a better Treaty partner: Working in partnership with Māori. Encouraging participation of Māori in our work. Protection of Māori knowledge, practices and language. Deliver whānau- focused services so that we are placing whānau at the centre of our work. Iwi, hapū and whānau Māori are achieving their aspirations which is contributing to their social, cultural and economic wellbeing. Foster active partnerships with Māori to show that our intentions to support whānau are genuine and that there are mutual benefits for both partners. Grow our understanding and empathy of the Māori world view so that when we are working with Māori we are responding appropriately. Develop targeted services and education resources / information specifically for whānau Māori. Develop and promote face- to-face options so they’re available to whānau Māori when necessary. Respond to and support a diverse range of whānau Māori who have different needs and aspirations. Understand Māori history and use tikanga and te reo Māori when interacting with whānau Māori. Provide physical and digital environments that are welcoming when whānau Māori need us for support. Build enduring relationships with iwi, hapū and whānau. Build partnerships with organisations that deliver services focused on whānau Māori. Inland Revenue meets its obligations as a Crown agency to be a good Treaty partner under the Treaty of Waitangi. Inland Revenue contributes to the social and economic wellbeing of Aotearoa New Zealand. NeedsTreaty principlesTactical approachesActionsOutcomes \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 45 Qualitative methodology We conducted two phases of qualitative interviewing: i.Phase 1 focused on better understanding who our Māori customers are and produced a prioritised group to explore in Phase 2. ii.Phase 2 focused on understanding what is important to our Māori customers when interacting with IR and to highlight opportunities for IR to improve. We used purposive sampling to ensure that we could understand perspectives across the diverse range of our Māori customers. The Customer Insight and Evaluation team, along with support from Kaitakawaenga Māori, engaged in kōrero (conversations) with whānau, hapū and iwi across the following demographics: i.Different age groups: Kaumātua (elderly), pākeke (adults) and rangatahi (youth). ii.Different locations: Urban, regional and provincial areas from the North and South Islands. iii.Different income situations: Employees, self-employed, business owners, iwi/hapū board/committee members. During our conversations we engaged in whakawhanaungatanga 31 before listening to the rich stories and whakaaro (thoughts) that were shared with us around what was important to whānau when engaging with IR. 31) Process of making connections and establishing relationships. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 46 We created a coding frame for interview transcripts, which we then analysed and produced an interim report on the project’s qualitative work. We were then able to test these qualitative findings in a follow-up survey. The ‘opportunities for IR to improve’ were prioritised with the purpose of providing guidance in the event that IR needed to prioritise its resource allocation: i.Through the qualitative interviews we identified several actions for IR to improve, along with features of each action. ii.To help IR with resource allocation, these actions and features were assessed and prioritised in our survey, based on level of importance to our respondents. iii.They were also tested with key IR stakeholders. iv.Survey completion was pre-COVID, it’s important to consider that peoples priorities may have changed post-COVID. Qualitative methodology \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 47 The sample frame for the online survey included individuals who had active engagement with IR in the last 12 months for Student Loan, KiwiSaver or the auto-calc process. Individuals who were excluded from the sample frame were those selected for IR surveys in the previous 6 months, and those living overseas (those living overseas with a Student Loan were included). At the time the survey was done, the total number of entities in the sample frame was 2,161,335 individuals. A stratified random sample was drawn from the sample frame. A total of 54,557 invitations to the online survey were delivered to the random sample. IR admin data does not have an ethnicity indicator so the invitation provided an option for individuals to self-identify as Māori and complete the Māori customer survey, while everyone else would complete the general customer survey. Quantitative methodology \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 48 A low Māori response rate was expected so we identified the areas that had high Māori populations and over-sampled there. The survey was live for 2 weeks during which we also sent out 2 reminder invitations encouraging people to have their say by completing the survey. As a result 3,566 valid responses were received of which 331 had completed the Māori customer survey. To determine the response rate we estimated that 14% of the sample would be Māori. This allowed us to estimate the response rate to be 4.3%. The maximum margin of random sampling error associated with a sample of this size is ±5.4 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. Quantitative methodology \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 49 Weighting has been used to align the characteristics of the survey respondents with those of the population of Māori customers. Although weighting has been used to correct for the non-response bias present in the survey, other sources of non-sampling error such as memory recall, and estimation errors are also likely to be present. The characteristics compared included age and region. The survey data was only weighted using the comparison characteristics noted above. Although the survey collected data on respondents’ age, ethnicity, personal income, and income sources Inland Revenue does not have this type of information about the population of Māori customers.

Withheld under s18(c)(i) of the OIA. 3 IR2021/105: Transformation status update: March 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Budget performance to date 6. Between 1 July 2014 and 30 June 2020, the programme spent $747 million in operating, and $374.9 million in capital. Any under-spending to date has either been moved to later periods or returned to the Crown. Stage 4 budget 7. Including the contingency held by the Commissioner and transitional funding, the overall budget for the current phase of transformation, Stage 4, is $211.5 million for operating expenditure and $88.3 million for capital expenditure. On 5 February 2021, the Strategic Governance Board approved an increase in the budget for transitional costs for early life support and for changes to be made as part of our future operating model.

Paid parental leave, unclaimed money, New Zealand foreign trusts, and duties continue to run smoothly on new systems and processes. We are experiencing a very low number of issues being raised, with no critical or high priority issues to resolve. 10. As planned, we exited hyper-care (the initial period of early life support where a heightened level of support is available) on 19 March 2021. This means that we are confident in the stability of new systems and processes and have amended the level of support provided as we move into the next phase of early life support. We are still monitoring how everything is operating to make sure that we are across any issues and can respond quickly if needed. 11. Early life support is scheduled to end on 28 May 2021. Other updates Stage 4 second release 12. This release will move child support to new systems and processes, and upgrade both the START software our people use and the online services customers use. The release is scheduled to go-live in October 2021. 13. While solution design and development is tracking slightly behind schedule, no key dates are currently at risk. Mitigations are having a positive impact and include an increased number of developers, greater management attention, and careful management of subject matter experts. 14. We continue to closely monitor test preparation and development verification testing which is slightly behind schedule in some areas. Business system testing execution (making sure START works as expected) is on track. We continue to monitor and manage dependencies as well as the time spent by our subject matter experts across writing test scenarios, reviewing scenarios, and completing verification testing. 15. We have begun preparation for the first full mock data conversion run. The conversion data is expected to be available in early April 2021, and the team is on track to run the first full mock-go -live in early July 2021. Policy 16. The Child Support Amendment Bill received Royal Assent on 24 March 2021. 17. The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020-21, Feasibility Expenditure and Remedial Matters) Bill had its third reading on 23 March 2021 now awaits Royal Assent. 18. The changes contained in these Bills complete the review of policy and legislative settings begun in March 2015 to frame and support the modernisation of the revenue system. New payday filing format 19. From 1 April 2021, employers are required to send us employment income information using a new payday filing format. 20. There is no change for employers filing on-screen through myIR or on paper as they have been filing in this format since April 2020. 5 IR2021/105: Transformation status update: March 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 21. Employers using a payroll bureau or intermediary service or payroll software should notice little change as we have been working with providers since April 2020 to ensure they build the new filing format into their systems in good time. We are asking employers to contact their providers if they have any questions. 22. The biggest change is for employers who have their own inhouse software. We have been communicating directly with employers about this change since November 2020. We will work with employers who have not been able to make the necessary changes in time. 23. The new filing format provides us with more employment income and employee information. Key changes 24. The Employment Income return includes some new optional fields: • Hours paid. • New fields for errors in past returns. This lets employers adjust the current return rather than having to amend an earlier return (there are some rules for when they can do this). • New fields for special deductions (eg voluntary and compulsory extra student loans deductions and employee share scheme benefits). This means employers will not need to add extra lines for these deductions. • The payday frequency field becomes mandatory for those filing through gateway services. It is already mandatory for customers filing on-screen in myIR, through file upload, or on paper. 25. Changes to employee details: • The employee details form and KiwiSaver forms are being combined so there will be fewer forms and less duplication of information. • There are fewer KiwiSaver status codes. • There is no longer any need to update us on start and finish dates for KiwiSaver savings suspensions. • The KiwiSaver exempt income indicator only needs to be applied once. • It will be easier to see, keep track of and update employee deductions. 26. These changes are intended to make it easier for employers to provide us with employment income information and to correct errors. Credit card convenience fees 27. We are charged a convenience fee of 1.42% on credit card transactions by our banking providers. This charge relates to merchant fees and is a pass-through cost. 28. Since we began accepting credit card payments in 2009, we have incentivised overseas customers paying student loan and child support obligations by credit card by absorbing the 1.42% charge. We did this because we did not have many payment channels for overseas customers at that time. We pass on the 1.42% charge to all New Zealand- based customers and overseas customers other than student loans and child support customers. 29. From 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2020, we received 38,500 credit card payments (representing 0.4% of the total payments we receive) from student loans and child support customers based overseas to the value of $38.1 m illion. 6 IR2021/105: Transformation status update: March 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 30. We now offer multiple payment options including payment by direct debit. This allows overseas customers living in Australia, the United Kingdom, Europe, America, and Canada to pay using their domestic currency. The vast majority of our overseas customers are based in these regions. This is in addition to other options such as third party payment providers that our overseas customers can use to make payments. Therefore, we will no longer absorb the 1.42% convenience fee for this group of customers from October 2021. The cost will be passed through in line with all other customers. 31. We will work closely with our overseas customers to outline the other payment options available to them. Enterprise support services – payroll update 32. As reported to you (IR2020/457 refers), we use SAP to run our payroll and it is housed in our heritage data centres which need to be de-commissioned by 30 June 2022. To achieve this we need to move off all our heritage applications by then, including SAP. 33. Late last year we issued a request for proposal (RFP) for a new payroll solution to enable us to completely decommission SAP. As part of the RFP, respondents were asked to indicate how confident they were about being able to implement a solution in the timeframe and to the level of quality required. Respondents concluded that they could not confidently confirm their ability to implement a replacement solution in time to enable us to decommission SAP and exit the data centres. As a result, we concluded the RFP process without awarding the work. 34. We have since investigated a number of options and have concluded that moving our existing payroll application to a cloud-based solution provided by SAP is the most viable approach. On 18 March 2021, the Portfolio Governance Committee (PGC) approved proceeding with this option. 35. Our next steps include finalising a commercial arrangement with SAP to move our payroll solution to the cloud by the end of 2021. This will extend the life of our current solution until 2027. Given this, there is now no urgency to replace our payroll solution. Key risks and issues 36. The transformation programme’s risk profile remains amber 1 , with a future trend of amber. An amber profile means that risks and mitigations are reasonably defined and understood, and support is needed from senior leaders to actively manage specific issues in some areas. 37. We are monitoring one issue (a risk that has been realised). This relates to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the delivery of the programme. There are no concerns to report at this time. 38. As at March 2021, the programme has a total of 61 open risks 2 , of which 14 are reported to the PGC. 39. The risk level of one risk reported to the PGC has improved. The current rating of the risk relating to delays in de-commissioning E-File (IR2021/068 refers) has improved from very high to high. The current likelihood of this risk occurring has improved from possible (an 11% to 20% chance of occurring) to unlikely (a 3% to 10% chance of occurring). The replacement solution was delivered as part of Release 4.1.1 on 28 February 2021. We will 1 The risk RAG status is separate from the overall programme status which is light amber as stated on page 2. Table 1 on page 2 shows the RAG key for risk as amber and the overall programme rating as light amber. 2 During the month, six new programme risks were raised and two were closed. 7 IR2021/105: Transformation status update: March 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] continue to monitor this risk until the end of early life support on 28 May 2021 to ensure that all customers have moved to the new solution. 40. The top three risks for transformation remain unchanged and relate to the need to move off all our heritage applications by 1 July 2022, so that we can fully decommission our heritage data centres. Coming up in the next two months 41. Key activities over the next two months include: April 2021 • Complete business function definitions for the second release in Stage 4 (child support and upgraded online services). • Decommission E-File. • Appear before the FEC, with the Commissioner, for a hearing on the Office of the Auditor General’s review of our benefit management practices. May 2021 • Exit early life support for the first release in Stage 4 (paid parental leave, unclaimed money, New Zealand foreign trusts and duties). • Complete solution design for the second release in Stage 4 (child support and upgraded online services).
1 In Confidence Of fice of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Government Administration and Expenditure Review Committee Inland Revenue’s Final Transformation Update Proposal 1 This paper provides the final progress update regarding the modernisation of the revenue system. I am asking Cabinet to note that Inland Revenue has successfully implemented its transformation programme and delivered the intended outcomes. Executive Summary 2 In just over 5 years, Inland Revenue has successfully transformed the revenue system in a multi-year, multi-stage programme. Changes have been made to every aspect of the way Inland Revenue operates, including policy settings, processes, its people capabilities and technology. This has been a high risk, highly complex programme of a scale seldom, if ever, seen previously in New Zealand. 3 The first customer-facing changes were implemented in February 2017 and the final changes in October 2021. The programme has been delivered on time and has achieved the intended outcomes. Inland Revenue estimates it will hand back $ 250 million to $275 million 1 at the completion of the programme, in addition to the $160 million 2 handed back to date. This is a significant achievement. Many programmes of this size, scale, duration and ambition, whether in the public or private sector, are never fully completed, let alone deliver the outcomes intended. Furthermore, Inland Revenue has achieved this while continuing to deliver services to New Zealanders, navigating earthquakes and building closures, and supporting government to respond to a global pandemic. Formal programme closure is now just months away and will occur by 30 June 2022. 4 One of the objectives of transformation was to provide confidence that revenue would continue to be collected no matter the circumstances. For the year ending 30 June 2016, the year immediately before transformation began, Inland Revenue collected $63 billion in Crown revenue. For the year ended 30 June 2021, Inland Revenue collected $94 billion, an increase of nearly 50%. Over the same period, the number of full-time equivalents working at Inland Revenue reduced by 28% and all staff are now in capability based roles, showing just how much more efficiently and effectively the department is now able to work. 5 Customers’ ability to self-serve has radically changed. This is reflected in customer uptake of myIR, Inland Revenue’s secure online service, where total user sessions have nearly tripled from 17 million to 50 million in total over the 5 year period. Customer contacts through other channels, such as calls to Inland Revenue, have reduced as a result. Experiences for customers have improved significantly. Individual customers now 1 Including depreciation and capital charge 2 I ncluding depreciation and capital charge IN CONFIDENCE \_ EXTERNAL RELEASE 2 have refunds automatically calculated and paid to them. Businesses can meet their obligations through their accounting software. The information Inland Revenue holds is more accurate and up-to-date and combined with new analytical capabilities is enabling integrity checks to be completed in real time. Inland Revenue can now act far more quickly to help New Zealanders pay and receive the right amounts and identify and stop those who have fraudulent intent. 6 Although the programme will very shortly close, Inland Revenue will continue to focus on making the most of the suite of new capabilities introduced by transformation to reduce effort and improve experiences for customers further. 7 The arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 has meant there have been few other times in our history when getting support to New Zealanders as quickly and easily as possible has been as important. New Zealand now has a very responsive and robust revenue system, which has enabled relief packages such as the Small Business Cashflow (loan) Scheme and the Resurgence Support Payment to be delivered within weeks. Online applications with built in checks have made it easy for customers to check their eligibility for support and, for those eligible, payments arrive in their accounts within days. This would simply not have been possible before transformation. The final changes in Inland Revenue’s transformation programme have gone live 8 Child support moved to new systems and processes as planned on 28 October 2021. Child support customers now have better visibility of their obligations and payments in myIR, Inland Revenue’s secure online service, and are able to do more for themselves, including applying online and advising the department of any changes in their circumstances. 9 Payments now get to carers faster. Since November 2021, child support payments have been passed on by the 23rd of the same month, as long as the liable (paying) parent has paid on time on the 20th. Previously, payments were made on the 7th of the month following the due date. 10 Legislative changes have also taken effect. Deductions of financial support from payments made by an employer are now compulsory for newly liable parents. As expected, it has taken time for some customers to get used to new ways of doing things and there have been some post go-live issues to address as there has been for every release. 11 As part of the final release, Inland Revenue also upgraded the online services all its customers use. A more modern look and feel for myIR, and simplified presentation of information and navigation, is making it easier for customers to find and do what they need to do. The layout adapts to fit the size of any screen without loss of functionality. Following go-live, Inland Revenue surveyed customers to find out about their experiences with using the new look myIR. Overall, most customers found it quite or very easy to do what they needed to do. 12 Co-existence, which refers to running old and new systems in parallel, was the biggest risk to the revenue system during transformation. Inland Revenue’s operational risk profile has reduced significantly following the implementation of the final release as all products are running on new systems and processes. The previous system, FIRST, was decommissioned on 1 December 2021. One of the key objectives of transformation was to deliver stable and robust technology to underpin the revenue system. This is now a IN CONFIDENCE \_ EXTERNAL RELEASE 3 reality and we have much greater flexibility to make changes to the products Inland Revenue administers. This needs to be balanced against the very full tax policy work programme we have asked Inland Revenue to deliver and any further COVID-19 related initiatives the department may be required to support. 13 There is still work to be done to decommission all remaining heritage systems and processes, and close the programme by 30 June 2022. However, this work will be largely invisible to anyone outside Inland Revenue. I am asking the committee to authorise the Minister of Finance and me to confirm the closure of the programme at the appropriate time. 14 While the programme will close, Inland Revenue will continue to modernise the revenue system by further embedding its new capabilities. In addition, Inland Revenue’s benefit commitments extend through until 2023/24. As programme-specific reporting will now cease, the department will report on the progress it is making with continued modernisation and achievement of its benefit commitments as part of its Annual Reports for 2022, 2023, and 2024. Inland Revenue has valuable experience others can learn from 15 We have begun a period of significant reform in many areas of the public sector and it is important that these reforms are implemented successfully. In my view, there is much that can be learned from Inland Revenue’s experience in successfully implementing what has been a highly complex, high-risk and multi-year programme. 16 Before getting anywhere near seeking funding and approval to begin implementation, Inland Revenue took the time to understand what it would take to be successful. This included the need to invest in the right capability, dedicated leadership, strong and effective governance, having a clear vision and roadmap, making core technology decisions early, building and maintaining stakeholder and customer support, and taking its people on the journey. Inland Revenue is the first to admit it didn’t get everything right and has some hard-won insights about pitfalls to avoid. The department has actively shared its experiences with other agencies and will continue to do so. 17 I believe it is essential that the lessons Inland Revenue has learned are captured and shared more widely across the public sector so that others may benefit from them. In my view this needs to happen sooner rather than later, while recollections are still fresh and before the key people involved move on to other things. I have asked Inland Revenue to provide a report to the Minister of Finance and me by June 2022 outlining its views about why it has been successful, what lessons it learned along the way, and what it would recommend other major change programmes should consider to set themselves up for success. 18 There are also undoubtedly opportunities to leverage the investment made in Inland Revenue more widely to improve outcomes for New Zealanders and support a unified Public Service. An independent review into where these opportunities may lie was commissioned by Inland Revenue and undertaken in November and December 2021. The findings have been shared with the Minister of Finance and me and the report is consistent with our view that there are opportunities to leverage and recommends: 18.1 The establishment of a system level strategic transformation capability to guide transformation. IN CONFIDENCE \_ EXTERNAL RELEASE 4 18.2 Appointing Lead Agencies for major shared delivery processes. 18.3 Reviewing the enabling regulatory frameworks as this is a primary source of complexity. 18.4 Strengthening the business case process to incentivise re-use of approaches and systems. 18.5 Ensuring business transformation programmes are funded through multi-year appropriations. 18.6 Conducting a feasibility study into the deployment of common and core capabilities. 19 As these recommendations are all at system level, I have asked the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to work with the Public Service Commissioner to inform further advice to Ministers on how to continue to leverage the business transformation investment and capabilities across the Public Service. The Minister for the Public Service is bringing proposals to this Committee relating to alignment and coordination of key functions across the Public Service that will provide an opportunity to respond to take this work forward. Transformation has delivered the outcomes intended 20 Inland Revenue recognised that a true transformation would involve a combination of changes to policy settings, process, technology, and people capabilities. Changes across all these dimensions were planned for through a multi-year, multi-stage programme. Transformation is far more than an upgrade of technology and has meant changing every aspect of the way Inland Revenue operates. The intent was to deliver a modern, digital revenue system that made tax and social policy payments simpler and more certain for customers. This has been achieved. Customers have significantly improved digital services and can do more for themselves 21 Digital services put customers in control, enabling them to do as much for themselves as possible in a way and at a time that suits them. This makes it much easier for them to interact with Inland Revenue when they need to. Use of Inland Revenue’s digital channels has increased significantly in recent years. 22 Through their myIR account, customers can file returns, make payments, advise Inland Revenue of changes in their circumstances, and apply for support online. Customers are voting with their fingers as illustrated by the examples below. 22.1 The number of myIR sessions has nearly tripled from around 17 million for the year ending 30 June 2016, the year immediately before transformation began, to more than 50 million for the year ending 30 June 2021. A huge amount of this growth, nearly 20 million sessions, was the result of customers accessing myIR from a mobile device. This was not possible before transformation. 22.2 Individual customers have embraced digital channels. As at 31 December 2021, 99 % of individual income tax payments were made digitally, up from 85% for the IN CONFIDENCE \_ EXTERNAL RELEASE 5 year ending 30 June 2016 3 . Over the same period, the percentage of donations tax credit claims made digitally increased from 51% to 82%. 22.3 The amount of paper being sent to Inland Revenue has reduced dramatically. 99% of returns were filed digitally for the year ended 31 December 2021. This is up from 73% for the year ended 30 June 2016. As at 31 December 2021, 88% of the correspondence sent to Inland Revenue was sent digitally, up from 57% as at 30 June 2018 4 . 22.4 More than 99.5% of the applications for COVID-19 support have been made online. As at 14 February 2022, of the approximately 135,000 applications received for the small business cashflow (loan) scheme, just 312 were not made through myIR. For the resurgence support payment, of the approximately 896,000 applications received, just 3,896 were not made through myIR. 23 Visits to Inland Revenue’s website have also increased considerably. The re-designed website went live in stages from April 2019 with a simplified and improved information structure, navigation, and language. The website is continually optimised based on customer usage patterns and feedback. The number of user sessions nearly doubled to 57 million for the year ending 30 June 2021, compared to 5 years earlier. 24 Working for Families customers whose entitlements had been too high can now pay back their overpayment by reducing their current entitlements. Customers can set up an instalment arrangement themselves through myIR, or Inland Revenue’s staff can set one up for them after a conversation with the customer. Since this option became available in April 2020, there has been a steady increase in customers setting up arrangements. Currently, around 2,000 customers have chosen to reduce their entitlements to pay back Working for Families debt. It was not possible to do this before transformation. The options previously available to customers were to try and pay it back in a lump sum, ring Inland Revenue to set up a payment arrangement, or have it taken out of their wages. 25 Despite the high uptake of digital services, there will always be customers unable or unwilling to use them or who need to contact Inland Revenue for other reasons. Phone calls and appointments will continue to be available to customers in these situations. While it is clear that use of these services is declining as customers choose digital options, they remain an important part of Inland Revenue’s service offering. The number of attempted calls to Inland Revenue declined by around 25% between the years ending 30 June 2017 and 30 June 2021, and the number of visits to the department’s offices declined by a similar amount. It i s easier for customers to pay and receive the right amounts 26 New processes and new capabilities are making it seamless and low effort for customers to meet their obligations and receive the right entitlements. 27 Inland Revenue is about to assess entitlements for approximately 380,000 Working for Families customers which will apply from 1 April 2022. This happens in February each year and is known as rollover. This process is now faster and more accurate, providing certainty to customers sooner, following the move of Working for Families to new systems and processes in April 2019. 3 Inland Revenue stopped accepting cheques in March 2020. 4 This measure is not available as at 30 June 2016. IN CONFIDENCE \_ EXTERNAL RELEASE 6 27.1 Previously, using old systems and processes. it took more than 12 hours to rollover entitlements. Now, it takes around 30 minutes. 27.2 Previously, Inland Revenue notified customers over a 4 to 5 day period what their future entitlements would be. Now, notifications are sent as soon as entitlements have been calculated. 27.3 Based on what occurred for the 2021 rollover, Inland Revenue expects to let around 95% of customers know what their entitlements will be through myIR. This is up from around 80% previously. 28 Since the year ending 31 March 2019, an end-of year income tax assessment has automatically been issued to individuals. Inland Revenue pre-populates information in their myIR account and calculates the refund or tax to pay for them. Customers only need to let Inland Revenue know if this information is incorrect or incomplete. Refunds are automatically paid into bank accounts. 29 As at 30 June 2021, more than $1.8 billion in income tax refunds had been automatically paid out to customers over the 3 years the new process has been running. Over the same period, $305 million in bills for tax to pay had been issued. As at 30 June 2021, 90% of the refunds paid for the year ending 31 March 2021 went to customers earning less than $70,000, putting $410 million in customers’ pockets. 30 Prior to the introduction of the new year-end process, Inland Revenue estimates that approximately 1.4 million people did not have any end-of-year interaction with the department. Many could have been entitled to refunds if they had applied for them. For the year ending 31 March 2018, refunds totalling approximately $450 million were paid to those who applied for them. Customers could check to see whether they had a refund owing or tax to pay before taking any action. Inland Revenue’s assumption is that those who did not take any action either had tax to pay or were unaware they could have received a refund. 31 Fundamental changes, such as the introduction of automatic assessments, required an extensive programme of policy changes, all of which have now been implemented. Amongst the most significant legislative changes were the move to payday filing and changes to reporting requirements for investment income. 32 As a result, individuals’ income information is now more accurate and up-to-date and Inland Revenue has greater confidence in sharing it with others to improve outcomes for New Zealanders, with appropriate security permissions in place. This was a pre-requisite for introducing automatic income tax assessments and is helping to make payments during the year more accurate so that fewer people end up in debt or missing out on their entitlements. It has also contributed to the COVID-19 response, particularly in supporting the Ministry of Social Development to administer the wage subsidy. IN CONFIDENCE \_ EXTERNAL RELEASE 7 Analytical capabilities are enabling Inland Revenue to proactively help customers 33 Inland Revenue is proactively using the more accurate information it holds to help customers, support the outcomes of social policies, and improve compliance. 34 Much greater visibility of customer behaviour enables Inland Revenue to quickly provide support and education where customers are struggling. Early detection of errors, both accidental and deliberate, means Inland Revenue can quickly identify and act on areas of confusion and/or compliance risks. For instance, it quickly became clear that customers filing their 2021 returns were either not including the wage subsidy they had received or were filing an incorrect amount. Within a week, Inland Revenue had pre- populated this information for customers. 35 To help ensure people receive the payments they are entitled to, each week Inland Revenue identifies between 50 and 100 customers who should be receiving Working for Families tax credits and aren’t and gets in touch with them. This was not possible before transformation. Inland Revenue also uses information from employers to pick up changes in customers’ income and notifies them that their entitlements may need to adjusted. 36 Automated rules enable the right checks and balances to be put in place upfront so things that need to be looked at by one of Inland Revenue’s people get stopped and those that don’t get processed more quickly, providing certainty to customers sooner. This means that a high trust model does not have to mean high risk. As at 14 February 2022, approximately 135,000 applications for the resurgence support payment had been stopped from being submitted by upfront checks 5 . A further 168,000 had been stopped by these checks to be reviewed by one of Inland Revenue’s experts, with around 70% subsequently approved. Most of the 840,000 payments to 231,000 eligible businesses totalling $2.9 billion so far had the funds in their accounts within three days. 37 Every return that can generate a refund is checked automatically. All amended returns are checked and screened. Between 1 July 2020 and 30 June 2021, approximately 117,000 returns across all tax types were identified that had errors or potentially fraudulent with a value of just over $300 million. Please note this data is unaudited. 38 Both these examples show the power of Inland Revenue’s analytical capabilities to quickly identify and address fraudulent behaviour and ensure those that are eligible for support or a refund get it as quickly as possible. 39 New analytical capabilities are also helping people to better understand their compliance obligations. Compliance with the bright-line rule has been one of the first focus areas. Inland Revenue’s data has been brought together with LINZ and commercial third party data to begin to provide a view of property transactions throughout the country and identify those which are potentially subject to the bright-line rule. 40 When Inland Revenue sends information to customers (or their agent) reminding them that if a sale is subject to income tax due to the bright-line rule, then any profits from the sale must be declared in their income tax return when it becomes due, it delivers results. For the year ended 30 June 2021, 397 voluntary disclosures were received – a 300% increase on the 91 received the previous year. In addition, contacting people shortly after a sale has been made has led to a noticeable increase in bright-line information being filed with tax returns. By prompting more people to come forward and self-correct, Inland 5 This does not necessarily equate to 99,000 individual applications as it could include the same IP address attempting multiple entries. IN CONFIDENCE \_ EXTERNAL RELEASE 8 Revenue’s compliance specialists are freed up to focus on the more non-compliant customers. Inland Revenue’s systems interact directly with customers’ and partners’ systems 41 Through transformation, the role of third parties in the revenue system has been significantly expanded. Services are increasingly being delivered in partnership with other organisations in both the public and private sector. This means that the timeframes for third parties need to be considered when implementing changes, for example changes to software packages. 42 Businesses are able to meet their obligations through their natural business systems. They can file through software and easily provide Inland Revenue with information at the time they’re carrying out a normal business process. For example, reporting employment income information to the department when they do their payroll. As at 31 December 2021, just over 210,000 small to medium sized businesses and tax agents were using business accounting or payroll software to manage their GST obligations. 43 Use of software platforms by customers has increased, in particular the big accounting and business management platforms, the banks and payroll providers (employers and payroll intermediaries). Previously Inland Revenue’s digital channels were not available to many software platforms so most customers used a combination of myIR, phone and paper. 44 Gateway services enable two-way, direct machine-to-machine interactions between external systems, such as tax agents and KiwiSaver providers, and Inland Revenue’s systems. They are a fast, high-volume channel providing on-call access to up-to-date information. All KiwiSaver providers are now using gateway services with a marked improvement in experience for customers. Customers are being enrolled and getting their contributions faster with much lower error rates. For the year ending 30 June 2021, 95% of members’ contributions were transferred to their scheme providers within two days. Previously it took an average of 20 to 23 working days. Inland Revenue is also receiving far fewer manually facilitated requests such as membership queries from KiwiSaver providers. Inland Revenue is working more efficiently 45 Higher levels of automation and rules built into systems mean straight forward transactions are processed with no human intervention. For example, around 93% of GST returns are processed straight through, ensuring customers get valid refunds quickly. As customer effort has reduced, the nature of Inland Revenue’s work has changed. This has freed Inland Revenue up to focus on customers who need help and support and those who choose not to comply with their obligations. The size of Inland Revenue’s workforce has reduced commensurately, with 28% fewer full-time equivalents (FTEs) as at 30 June 2021 compared to 30 June 2016. The reduction of 1,556 in the number of FTEs was achieved by adopting a set of workforce management principles. This meant that redundancies were limited to around 450, some of which were voluntary, with the balance achieved through attrition. 46 Over the same period, revenue collected has increased by nearly 50% and discrepancies identified by Inland Revenue’s compliance specialists have remained relatively steady at around $1 billion a year. The focus of compliance has moved from the end (enforcement) to ‘Right from the Start’, as the quality and frequency of the data Inland Revenue collects IN CONFIDENCE \_ EXTERNAL RELEASE 9 has improved. Using analytics, the focus is now on real time integrity, both at the time a transaction takes place and intervening earlier when customers get it wrong, either accidentally or deliberately. This reduces the need for post-return work, whether that is debt collection or audit and investigation. However, discrepancies continue to be identified through investigative activity where the dollar value or risk to the integrity of the revenue system warrants it. 47 To help its people make the most of its new capabilities, Inland Revenue has invested significantly in training and development opportunities. Capability-based roles are focused on transferable skills such as customer service or digital literacy as well as new capabilities such as data analytics, enabling people to build their capabilities as work has changed. A full organisational redesign was completed. The new operating model enables Inland Revenue to harness collective strengths and knowledge to solve issues and innovate and improve services using new digital capabilities and networked ways of working. Delegated decision-making is enabling Inland Revenue’s front-line people to make decisions in real time as they are working with customers. 48 Mobile workplace technology is enabling Inland Revenue’s people to work from anywhere. This has meant that Inland Revenue could keep providing services during several significant disruptions that occurred during the implementation of the programme, including the Kaikoura earthquake, long-term building closures due to seismic issues, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Inland Revenue’s ability to keep providing services would have been severely constrained in these situations prior to transformation. 49 Mobile technology and flexible working practices are highly valued by Inland Revenue’s people. The 2021 Public Sector Census showed that Inland Revenue people, compared to all public servants, feel they have and can use more flexible working opportunities and are more satisfied with their work/life balance. The programme will come in under budget and unused funding will be handed back through the Budget 2022 Technical Initiatives Process 50 Previously, Inland Revenue has handed back approximately $127 million in capital and operating funding of the total approved $1,870 million capital and operating funding for the period 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2024. Additionally, the department handed back approximately $33 million of the total $740 million approved funding for depreciation and capital charge over the same period 6 . Jointly, the amount handed back to date is around $160 million. 51 Now that the programme is nearly complete, Inland Revenue estimates it will be able to hand back a further $90 million to $100 million in capital and operating funding and $160 million to $175 million of depreciation and capital charge. In total, Inland Revenue estimates it will be able to hand back $250 million to $275 million including depreciation and capital charge through the Budget 2022 Technical Initiatives Process. 52 The total estimated amounts to be handed back over the life of the programme are $410 million to $435 million including depreciation and capital charge. This represents about 16% to 17% of the total funding approved for transformation and approximately 30% to 32% of the new Crown funding approved. 6 At the time the business case was approved in November 2015, the capital charge was 8%. This has since reduced to 5%, reducing the approved funding for depreciation and capital charge to $664 million. IN CONFIDENCE \_ EXTERNAL RELEASE 10 Funding transfer for residual activities following the closure of the transformation programme to be requested through the Budget 2022 Technical Initiatives Process 53 In 2022/23 and 2023/24, Inland Revenue intends to undertake necessary residual activities following the closure of the transformation programme on 30 June 2022. These activities were unable to be completed due to COVID-19 priorities. 54 To fund these activities, Inland Revenue intends to cover capital costs estimated at around $21 million from internal reserves as well as to seek expense transfers from the current year’s operating appropriation totalling between $30 million and $35 million. 55 The expense transfers for the operating cost will be requested through the Budget 2022 Technical Initiatives Process. Next steps 56 The next steps are to: 56.1 complete decommissioning of all heritage systems and processes; 56.2 provide a lessons learned paper to the Minister of Finance and me by June 2022; and 56.3 close the programme by 30 June 2022. Consultation 57 A copy of this paper has been provided to the Accident Compensation Corporation; the Department of Internal Affairs (Government Chief Digital Officer); the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet; the Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment; the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Social Development; the New Zealand Customs Service; and Stats NZ.

Legislative Implications 60 The proposals in this paper do not require any changes to legislation. Regulatory Impact Analysis 61 The proposals in this paper do not require a Regulatory Impact Statement. Gender Implications 62 The proposals in this paper have no gender implications. IN CONFIDENCE \_ EXTERNAL RELEASE 11 Disability Perspective 63 The proposals in this paper have no implications for people with disabilities. Proactive Release 64 I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, and associated minutes, in whole within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Central agencies’ comment (The Treasury, Public Service Commission and Government Chief Digital Officer) Business Transformation was complex, risky project... 65 The Treasury, Public Service Commission and Government Chief Digital Officer agree that Inland Revenue has successfully implemented its Business Transformation programme. This was a very substantial and complex undertaking. ...which has delivered significant change... 66 Every aspect of Inland Revenue’s work has been affected by changes that have made the tax system generally more efficient, more responsive to change, and easier to engage with. 67 Inland Revenue’s management of its finances and its technology throughout the process has been exemplary. And despite being disrupted by a global pandemic and the closure of the agency’s main premises in central Wellington, the project will substantively close in June this year, on-time and under-budget. 68 Business Transformation has already delivered important benefits for Inland Revenue’s customers and the Government. More people are filing electronically and Inland Revenue is better able to help people get their obligations ‘right from the start.’ The agency was also able to play a critical role in the response to COVID-19, standing up the Resurgence Support Payment and Small Business Cashflow Scheme faster than would have been possible before. ...while not detracting from BT’s success, central agencies note... 69 Other benefits are harder to assess. Central agencies have previously questioned whether the projected revenue uplift would be achieved. This is because the agreed proxy measures for revenue uplift only loosely correlate with increased revenue (the proxy measures are supplemented by case studies, which are also inevitably incomplete). Inland Revenue correctly notes that revenue has grown by approximately 50% over the course of Business Transformation, but other factors have also contributed. 70 The evidence is also mixed for some other benefits of the programme. Administrative savings have been achieved through downsizing of Inland Revenue’s workforce, thereby reducing the agency’s baseline beyond the end of the programme. But temporary funding has been provided to prevent some of the downsizing out of concern that this would affect ongoing service levels, especially during the current pandemic. 71 Inland Revenue and the Treasury will need to continue to monitor the sustainability of Inland Revenue’s funding. IN CONFIDENCE \_ EXTERNAL RELEASE 12 72 In respect of compliance costs, the direct interaction between Inland Revenue’s systems and business customers’ systems saves time, as does the pre-population of information on returns and automatic refunds. However, the time taken by some taxpayers, such as SMEs, to comply with their tax obligations has not fallen as much or as consistently as hoped. Tax agents, too, have raised concerns about engaging with Inland Revenue. 73 In terms of technology, central agencies would like to better understand IR’s roadmap of future system investment, including the core system provided by FAST. Specifically, when will an investment of a similar scale be needed in the future, and to what extent can Inland Revenue’s systems be continuously and sustainably managed, enhanced and replaced? ...and there are many lessons that can be learned, both for Inland Revenue and for future projects. 74 Ongoing responsibility for tracking Business Transformation benefits has passed to IR’s Performance and Reporting team. The Minister of Revenue should also continue to seek and interrogate assurances from officials that Inland Revenue remains focused on maximising the benefits of BT, and that the agency is addressing areas where there are further opportunities to improve. 75 While central agencies await with interest Inland Revenue’s “lessons learned” report, Business Transformation has shown the importance of taking a rigorous approach to risk management, monitoring, and working collaboratively. Taking this approach will put future projects on track to deliver real benefits for New Zealanders, as this programme has. Recommendations I recommend that the Committee: 1 note that this is the final progress update on Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme; 2 note that child support successfully went live on new systems and processes on 28 October 2021 and that Inland Revenue’s online services were upgraded at the same time; 3 note that Inland Revenue has now implemented New Zealand’s future revenue system in four stages as agreed by Cabinet in November 2015; 4 authorise the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue to confirm the closure of the programme by 30 June 2022; 5 note that the Ministry for the Public Service is bringing a paper to this Committee relating to the alignment and coordination of key functions across the Public Service that will provide an opportunity to leverage the business transformation and capabilities across the Public Service; 6 note that Inland Revenue estimates it will hand back a further $250 million to $275 million, including depreciation and capital charge, through the Budget 2022 Technical Initiatives Process, taking the total to be handed back over the life of the programme to about $410 million to $435 million, including depreciation and capital charge; IN CONFIDENCE \_ EXTERNAL RELEASE 13 7 note that Inland Revenue intends to undertake necessary residual activities following the closure of the transformation programme on 30 June 2022, and that to help fund these Inland Revenue will be seeking expense transfers totalling $30 million to $35 million through the Budget 2022 Technical Initiatives Process; 8 note that Inland Revenue will continue to report on its progress in meeting its benefit commitments through its Annual Reports for 2022, 2023, and 2024.

Masala restaurant co-owner jailed for money laundering and tax evasion
======================================================================

**28 February 2020**

A co-owner of the Masala Restaurant chain has been jailed for hiding millions of dollars in cash sales and laundering large amounts of it.

Rupinder Singh Chahil was sentenced today at the Auckland High Court to three years and two months in prison, plus a $50,000 fine, on nine money laundering charges and 34 tax evasion charges.

A former accountant, Vijay Kumar Gupta, was also sentenced today to 10 months home detention and ordered to pay $5,000 in reparations.

Inland Revenue spokesman Tony Morris says the evasion wasn’t particularly sophisticated but was carried out on a massive scale.

“Chahil provided 114 individual GST returns to Inland Revenue on behalf of the Masala Related Companies, which together concealed more than $6.5 million of mainly cash sales,” Tony Morris says.  

“The tax offending was linked inescapably to the money laundering but the money laundering was far more complex, involving multiple bank accounts here and overseas.

“Chahil and another co-owner, Joti Jain, collected cash from the Masala Restaurants, and delivered the money to Gupta to be laundered.

“Gupta controlled the deposit of large amounts of cash into bank accounts, transferred the cash to overseas banks, purchased large amounts of foreign currency, and then brought the money back to New Zealand.”

The tax offending spanned six years, from April 2008 to April 2014 through regular, two-monthly false returns to IR. The money laundering took place over 14 months through a series of transactions from 15 February 2012 to April 2013.

“Tax evasion hurts everyone because taxes are what fund essential items like hospitals, schools, and national parks. On a more basic level, tax evasion allows unscrupulous people to get a leg up over their competitors,” Tony Morris says.

“Hiding their cash sales, and laundering the proceeds of their offending, meant the Masala Restaurants were inevitably able to undercut other restaurants.

“The tax evasion and money laundering were uncovered at a tremendous public cost. It required a substantial effort to detect, uncover and prosecute this case.

“The investigation took longer than it should have because Chahil had false responses prepared to deliberately frustrate the enquiries. IR’s investigation into the money laundering meant contacting tax authorities in Australia and India where he and Gupta tried to hide their criminal proceeds.

“The offending itself caused significant financial loss to society. The money laundering was designed to hide the tax evasion and allow Chahil to enjoy the fruits of his crime at society’s expense,” Tony Morris says.

Joti Jain, who was a former co-owner of the companies running the Masala chain, pleaded guilty to 21 charges of tax evasion and was sentenced to nine months home detention in 2018.

Gupta pleaded guilty to nine charges of money laundering along with Chahil who also pleaded guilty to 34 charges of tax evasion in October.

Chahil previously had imposed and served a sentence of Home Detention for charges relating to providing false or misleading information to Immigration New Zealand.

1 In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Cabinet Committee on State Sector Reform and Expenditure Control STAGE 2 OF TRANSFORMING NEW ZEALAND’S REVENUE SYSTEM Proposal 1.This paper provides an update regarding preparations for Stage 2 of the transformation of New Zealand’s revenue system. I am asking Cabinet to: note that Stage 2 will implement all tax products, the Accounting Income Method for calculating provisional tax and the Automatic Exchange of Information with tax treaty partners in START, and implement enabling technologies, capabilities and a new organisational model for Inland Revenue; note the benefits and costs until 30 June 2018 of Stage 2 which are within the multi-year funding approved by Cabinet (CAB-15-MIN-0249 refers) for implementation; and note that approval has been provided through the March Baseline Update for a multi-year appropriation of funding for transformation. Executive Summary 2.Stage 1 of transformation went live on 7 February 2017, three months ahead of schedule. New services are making it quicker and easier for customers to manage their GST online, representing a very significant and public step forward in the journey to modernise New Zealand's revenue system. 3.Preparations for implementation of Stage 2, which will build on and extend these new services, are underway. In comparison to Stage 1 which focused on a single tax product and involved little legislative change, Stage 2 will see more than 20 products migrated to new systems and processes and legislative changes introduced. Accordingly, the requirements for co-existence, integration, testing, stakeholder engagement and change management are exponentially greater and more complex. 4.Given the scale of changes that will be made, Stage 2 is likely to be implemented in a series of releases throughout 2018 and 2019. Once Stage 2 has been implemented, the effort required by businesses to keep on top of their tax obligations will be significantly reduced. The changes being introduced in this stage will also allow existing social policy processes to be more effectively supported and assistance better matched to the needs of individuals. 5.Inland Revenue has estimated capital costs of $224.6 million and operating costs of $330.4 million for implementing transformation from 1 March 2017 to 30 June 2018. These costs are within the funding approved for transformation (CAB-15 -MIN-0249 refers). Based on Inland Revenue’s performance to date and the transparent, regular reporting of progress, approval was provided through the March Baseline Update for the multi-year funding Proactive release This document was released by Inland Revenue under section 81(1B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This release supports the purposes of the Official Information Act 1982 by increasing progressively the availability of official information to the people of New Zealand. 2 approved by Cabinet to be managed through a multi-year appropriation (from 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2021). Business transformation is a once-in-a -generation opportunity to modernise New Zealand’s revenue system 6. A modern, digital, revenue system will serve the needs of all New Zealanders. It will help customers to get their tax and social policy payments right first time, avoid errors and give them a clearer view of what they’ve paid and what they owe during the year. The revenue system will be simple to comply with and responsive to customers’ changing circumstances. It will be easy for customers to get things right and difficult to get wrong. They will spend far less time and effort ensuring they meet their obligations and receive their correct social policy entitlements, as tax will be correctly withheld and assistance provided at the time it is needed. 7. Customers’ interactions with government and Inland Revenue will fundamentally change. In the future, most customers will not need to interact with Inland Revenue as their information will be provided to Inland Revenue on their behalf. Those with less complex needs will only need to confirm their details using automated, straight-through digital services. Customers who do have to provide information will use their own systems and processes to do so as part of their everyday business activities. Information will be checked when it is received and errors fixed wherever possible. 8. Although Inland Revenue will design digital channels with customers in mind - easy to use, intuitive and interactive - and will strongly encourage their use, there will be some customers who are unable or unwilling to use digital services. Exceptions will need to be made for customers without access to internet services or computers, and for groups who would incur disproportionate compliance costs, e.g. the smallest employers. 9. Earlier, more complete information will be available to Inland Revenue which will lead to greater accuracy and mean fewer under or over payments for customers. Government will be able to make policy changes more quickly and cost effectively and there will be more opportunities to provide broader access to the information Inland Revenue holds. 10. Modernising the revenue system will significantly contribute to improving digital interactions with government, the Business Growth Agenda and a growing, healthy economy, and achieving Better Public Services Results 9 and 10. Inland Revenue successfully implemented Stage 1 on 7 February 2017, just under three months ahead of schedule 11. New systems and processes were available for GST customers to use from 7 February 2017, nearly three months ahead of schedule, representing a very significant and public step forward in the journey to bring New Zealand's revenue system into the modern world. It’s now quicker and easier for customers to manage their GST online. Customers can now:  file and pay their GST at the same time; 3  make GST payments by direct debit, or credit or debit card;  set up email and text message reminders of when GST returns and payments are due to avoid penalties;  set up GST instalment payment plans and, in most cases, receive immediate confirmation and approval; and  request a change to an already filed GST return. 12. These are the first of many changes Inland Revenue will make over the next few years to make tax and social policy payments simpler for New Zealanders. As at 31 March 2017:  there had been more than 670,000 logins to myGST;  more than 280,000 GST returns had been filed using the new web service;  more than 43,000 customers had set up direct debits, enabling them to file and pay their GST at the same time;  more than 6,500 GST returns had been amended online by customers, saving them from having to contact Inland Revenue to arrange this;  more than 2,400 instalment arrangements had been set up online to pay off debt; and  more than 4,300 new migrants, visa holders and organisations had registered for IRD numbers through the new digital registration service. 13. The majority of customers are working well with new systems and processes. However some, including tax agents, have experienced challenges with initial set-up tasks, navigating the new system and working in a digital environment for the first time. Inland Revenue has initiatives and processes in place to manage and resolve issues, including an active programme of communications consisting of emails, newsletters, and site visits including 1:1 sessions with customers where needed. 14. Inland Revenue is on track to realise the benefits committed from the implementation of Stage 1. These are improved experiences for customers, compliance cost reductions for small–medium sized businesses and administrative savings for Inland Revenue:  Customers using their accounting software to manage their GST obligations are providing positive feedback on their experience and on other enhancements to Inland Revenue’s services.  Customers perceive that the level of effort in meeting their GST obligations has reduced by approximately 10 hours since 2013. 1  Administrative savings are being achieved as customers increasingly self-manage and use digital channels. 1 Inland Revenue’s 2016 survey of compliance costs for small and medium enterprises 4 The scope of Stage 2 is all tax products and once completed will significantly reduce customer effort Customer experiences will improve 15. Planning for Stage 2 is well advanced. Stage 2 will build on and extend the new services delivered to customers in Stage 1. Once Stage 2 has been implemented the effort required by businesses to keep on top of their tax obligations will be significantly reduced, enabling them to spend more time running their businesses. 16. The likelihood of errors will be much reduced, resulting in greater certainty, fewer interactions, less debt, and less need for compliance checks. Businesses will have a clearer view of their tax position during the year and will be able to meet their tax obligations at minimum cost and minimum disruption. 17. Once Stage 2 has been completed customers will have:  More on-line services for all tax products;  Integrated tax and business processes;  Faster, more accurate tax information, providing near real-time visibility of tax;  Faster tax refunds; and  Less likelihood of tax debt and more payment options. 18. Initiatives that continue to improve customers’ experiences when they do have to interact with Inland Revenue will be piloted as part of Stage 2. Customers will be able to request immediate assistance when they need it with their digital interactions through pilots of click-to-chat and virtual assistant services. More efficient handling of investigations and litigation will improve customer experiences as all case management will be undertaken in START following implementation of Stage 2. All taxes will be administered using new systems and processes 19. In line with the roadmap attached as an annex and noted by Cabinet (CAB-15-MIN- 0249 refers), Stage 2 will include all tax products. 2 Following subsequent decisions made by Cabinet, this stage will also include the Accounting Income Method (AIM) option for calculating provisional tax (CAB-16 -MIN-0089 refers) and the Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) with international tax treaty partners (CAB-16-MIN-0189.25 refers). 2 PAYE information collection is part of Stage 2, whereas PAYE processing will remain in FIRST until Stage 3 to minimise the amount of technical integration required. 5 20. As part of Budget 2016, Cabinet noted that the preferred implementation option for AEOI was to be determined (CAB-16-MIN-0189.25 refers). Inland Revenue has determined that implementing AEOI in START 3 during Stages 2 and 3 is the best option as:  START has the functionality required already built in and will be configured to support AEOI without the need for any customisation.  Technology delivery and change management for AEOI will be aligned with the wider changes Inland Revenue is making, minimising change impacts for both customers and staff.  Information about customers’ incomes, whether earned in New Zealand or overseas, will be held in one place and there will be a single interface for all Inland Revenue services.  Inland Revenue will be able to more effectively match data received through AEOI with information already held about customers, providing greater options for use of data.  START is scalable for Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). 21. Stage 2 will also include gaming machine duty. This is a stand-alone duty not linked to other taxes. Implementing gaming machine duty in Stage 2 should allow Inland Revenue’s heritage FIRST mainframe to be decommissioned at the end of Stage 3 rather than at the end of Stage 4 as originally envisaged. Improvements to Inland Revenue’s foundational infrastructure will continue 22. To enable Inland Revenue to provide customer-centred, intelligence-led services, improvements to internal processes and systems are required. To ensure that customer information is secure and accessible by those with appropriate authorisation, Inland Revenue will further develop its security capabilities. 23. To reduce the cost of providing the department’s services, improvements will be made to workplace and network technology by continuing the migration to the all-of- government telecommunications-as-a-service common capability. Inland Revenue will also continue to consolidate its existing applications, and to de-commission those superseded or no longer required in its new systems environment. Stage 2 is likely to be implemented in a series of releases 24. Given the scale of changes that will be made to systems and processes by Inland Revenue, business partners and customers, Stage 2 is likely to be implemented in a series of releases throughout 2018 and 2019. These will reflect the annual tax cycle, i.e. processes required at the beginning of the tax year will be released first, with end-of-year processes released later. 3 START stands for simplified tax and revenue technology, and is the name chosen by Inland Revenue for the GenTax software provided by FAST Enterprises LLC. 6 25. While Inland Revenue has every expectation that Stage 2 releases will go-live successfully, the requirements for co-existence, integration, testing, stakeholder engagement and change management are exponentially greater and more complex. Given this, Inland Revenue will continue to place considerable emphasis on maintaining its strong management and governance of transformation. Notwithstanding, there may be unforeseen issues which arise and this is not unexpected in a transformation of this nature. Change management will be critical during Stage 2 26. In comparison to Stage 1 which focused on a single tax product and involved little legislative change, Stage 2 will see more than 20 products migrated to new systems and processes and legislative changes introduced. Together, these changes will simplify customers’ tax affairs and make it easier for them to meet their obligations. 27. Inland Revenue has begun planning for the work needed to ready customers for change. In particular, the department intends to work closely with key government agencies and other stakeholders, such as banks, who are both customers and business partners. The need for a well integrated approach is recognised. 28. Customers will be supported to adapt to using new systems and processes and Inland Revenue intends to minimise any disruption resulting from the changes being made. As customers will be interacting with a revenue system administered via two systems that will need to co-exist until the heritage FIRST system is decommissioned, considerable emphasis will be placed on communications and engagement. 29. Business customers will be the principal beneficiaries of Stage 2. Employers, government agencies, software developers, business partners and service providers will benefit from modernised information sharing processes and greater integration with Inland Revenue’s systems. 30. To be able to fully leverage these benefits, and meet requirements to provide investment income and PAYE information more regularly, they will need to make changes to their own systems and processes. Those with customised payroll software will need to upgrade it; typically this will be larger corporates and government agencies, as will providers of accou nting and payroll software. As previously noted by Cabinet (CAB-15-MIN-0249 refers) Inland Revenue has not included any costs and benefits to other Crown organisations and stakeholders in making any changes to their systems and processes. 31. In addition, during the same period, changes that will help smaller businesses tailor their tax payments to their circumstances (the accounting income method option for calculating provisional tax) and help to detect and prevent tax evasion (AEOI reporting requirements for financial institutions) come into effect. 32. The changes being introduced in Stage 2 will allow Inland Revenue to more effectively support existing social policy processes and ensure better matching of assistance to the needs of individuals. More accurate and timely income information will improve access to entitlements and delivery of services to individuals. Engagement with key 7 stakeholders about possible improvements to social policy has already begun and will continue throughout 2017. Transformation will have a significant impact on Inland Revenue’s work. 33. At the end the department expects to be a leaner and more agile organisation, approximately 25%-30% smaller than today. Estimated cumulative administrative savings of between $495 million and $580 million until 2023/24 are part of Inland Revenue’s funding contribution to transformation. 34. A new organisational model for Inland Revenue has been agreed in principle by its senior leadership team. Three new organisational groups are proposed to be established early in 2018 to support customer-centred delivery of services and new ways of working, and enable the realisation of administrative savings. Planning for the changes that will be made has been completed and preparations are well underway, including on-going engagement with unions. Consultation on the proposed changes begins on 9 May 2017. The proposed changes mean that some people transition costs will be required earlier than originally planned. This change in timing means Inland Revenue will need to bring forward funding from 2019/20 to 2017/18. The costs and benefits of Stage 2 are consistent with the estimates made in the detailed business case Costs and funding 35. Inland Revenue has estimated the costs of implementing transformation from 1 March 2017 to 30 June 2018, as shown in the table below . 36. These estimates include costs for bedding down Stage 1, implementation costs for Stage 2 during this period, costs for preparation for future stages, and contingencies held by Inland Revenue to allow the department to manage financial risks. 37. These costs, along with the associated depreciation and capital charge, are within the funding approved for transformation (CAB-15-MIN-0249 refers) and AEOI (CAB-16-MIN- 0189.25 refers). Subsequently, a swap between capital and operating funding for AEOI was approved by the Ministers of Finance and Revenue 4 in September 2016 to enable Inland Revenue to minimise the impacts on its legacy system. 38. Major cost drivers include the implementation of business taxes in START, co- existence with the heritage environment, implementation of foundational technologies and 4 IR2016/374 $ million 2016/17 2017/18 Total Capex 41.0 183.6 224.6 Opex 67.9 262.5 330.4 Total 108.9 446.1 555.0 8 intelligence-led ways of working. As Stage 2 is likely to be implemented in a series of releases, some costs for this stage will be incurred after 30 June 2018. These will be reflected in future transformation updates. 39. Since multi-year funding for the implementation of the future revenue system was approved by Cabinet (CAB-15 -MIN-0249 refers), Inland Revenue has achieved an A Investor Confidence Rating and successfully delivered Stage 1. The Treasury is encouraging agencies to use the new flexibility afforded by changes to the Public Finance Act to support the delivery of major transformations. 40. Based on Inland Revenue’s performance to date and the transparent, regular reporting of progress, approval has been provided through the March Baseline Update for the multi- year funding approved by Cabinet to be managed through a multi-year appropriation (from 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2021). 41. This will provide greater flexibility for managing changes in the timing of expenditure that are expected in a programme of this nature. A multi-year appropriation will minimise unnecessary technical processes while maintaining transparency. Performance will continue to be measured through milestone measures linked to each stage, which will be included in Inland Revenue’s Estimates of Appropriations each year. 42. Inland Revenue requested expense and in-principle transfers as part of the March 2017 baseline update. These transfers were requested to:  better align investment with the implementation of START; and  reflect the rapid ramp up of resources required for Stage 2 and the potential for market constraints and other circumstances outside of Inland Revenue’s control to hinder this. Benefits 43. Stage 2 will deliver both non-financial and financial benefits in line with the estimates noted by Cabinet (CAB-15 -MIN-0249 refers) as shown in the table below. Stage 2 financial benefits for the period 2015/16 to 2023/24 Compliance effort savings $635m - $1,060m (8 – 14 hours per annum) Administrative savings from IR $260m - $300m Additional assessed Crown revenue $2,880m Stage 2 non-financial benefits Easier for customers  Revenue system resilience Improved resilience of technology infrastructure Agility to implement policy Improved agility for tax products 9 44. Following stage 2, government will have much greater agility for tax products. The complex inter-relationship between income and social policy may however place some limits on this until Stage 3 is completed. Full policy agility will be provided once transformation is complete. Similarly, resilience will be enhanced however Inland Revenue’s technology risk profile will remain high until completion of transformation due to the need for old and new systems to co-exist. 45. Financial benefits for Stage 2 include the realisation of administrative savings resulting from a more efficient, smaller Inland Revenue of between $260 million to $300 million over the period until 2023/24. Inland Revenue will apply these savings to transformation as part of its funding contribution (CAB-15-MIN-0249 refers). Additional, cumulative Crown revenue of approximately $2,900 million 5 is expected over the same period. Inland Revenue will have improved analytical capabilities which will enable better and earlier detection of non-compliance, and opportunities for non-compliance will reduce as core transactions will be provided through accounting software. 46. The effort required by customers to meet their obligations will further reduce, building on the gains already made in Stage 1. Inland Revenue estimates that small and medium businesses will spend between 8 and 14 fewer hours a year on compliance by 2023/24 as a result of the changes being introduced in Stage 2. This will further contribute to Better Public Services Result 9. Policy changes 47. Stage 2 will give effect to the decisions Cabinet has already made to introduce AIM, a provisional tax option (CAB-16-MIN-0089 refers), and require more regular reporting of PAYE (CAB-16-MIN-0283 refers) and investment income information (CAB-16-MIN-0307 refers). The costs and benefits of these policy changes have been accounted for. 48. For policy which has not yet been consulted on, full fiscal implications will be included in final policy advice provided to Cabinet following consultation. Transformation is consuming the majority of Inland Revenue’s change capacity given its size and high risk profile 49. Transformation remains inherently high risk. Although implementation risk for Stage 1 was successfully mitigated, Stage 2 is higher risk given the breadth and complexity of products to be migrated and the consequent impacts on customers, staff, other stakeholders and Inland Revenue itself. 50. In November 2016, the Government announced its updated tax policy work programme for the next 12 months. This, combined with the implementation of Stage 2 of transformation, means Inland Revenue has very limited capacity to implement additional policy changes. These would need to be assessed on a case by case basis. 5 Includes inflation 10 51. Officials have advised me that if additional initiatives are added, the work programme may need to be reconsidered to ensure that the change capacity Inland Revenue does have is used on our highest priorities. Factors that will need to be taken into consideration when considering new opportunities are:  Inland Revenue’s capacity to deliver further reforms over the next three income years in FIRST will likely be exhausted;  A number of items on the current tax policy work programme have administrative implications and are also drawing on Inland Revenue’s change capacity; and  Transformation costs and timelines assume that implementation of policy changes are aligned with the roadmap. 52. Progress and risks will be constantly re-assessed. Any material changes or trade-offs will be highlighted for Ministers to consider. The next transformation update will be provided to Cabinet by December 2017 53. Inland Revenue h as been directed (CAB-15-MIN-0249 refers) to provide transformation progress updates to Cabinet by July and December each year. 54. When Cabinet considered the most recent update in November 2016, Inland Revenue indicated that these updates could be supplemented with a report back in March to confirm any inputs required for the Budget process. Cabinet noted (CAB-16-MIN-0621 refers) that the c osts and benefits of Stage 2 would be confirmed by March 2017 and that the July 2017 transformation update would provide an overview of the results of the go-live of Stage 1. 55. As both these topics have been covered in this paper and as no significantly new information about Stage 1 go-live will be available by July, the most opportune time for Cabinet to consider the next progress update will be December 2017. Comprehensive monthly reporting of progress will continue to be provided to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue. Next steps 56. The next steps are to:  complete bedding down of Stage 1 by May 2017;  support the passage of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017-18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Bill which contains key transformation proposals;  finalise the discussion document and communications strategy regarding social policy for consideration by Cabinet in May 2017;  release the Individuals’ and social policy discussion documents in June 2017;  complete detailed design for Stage 2 for the first release by June 2017;  provide a summary of submissions and then final proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act for Ministers; and 11  prepare a transformation update for consideration by Cabinet by December 2017. Financial implications 57. Inland Revenue is tracking to the multi-year funding agreed by Cabinet in November 2015. The management of Inland Revenue’s multi-year, multi-stage transformation has been simplified through the adoption of a multi-year appropriation. Agreement has been provided through the March Baseline Update to establish a multi-year appropriation to run from 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2021. Human rights implications 58. The proposals in this paper have no human rights implications. Legislative implications 59. The proposals in this paper do not require any changes to legislation. Regulatory impact analysis 60. The proposals in this paper do not require a Regulatory Impact Statement. Publicity 61. I intend to ask Inland Revenue to publish this paper on its website once it has been considered by Cabinet. Consultation 62. A copy of this paper has been provided to the Accident Compensation Corporation, the Department of Internal Affairs, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Social Development, the New Zealand Customs Service and Statistics New Zealand. Central agencies’ comment (The Treasury, State Services Commission and Government Chief Information Officer) 63. Corporate Centre agencies were consulted on this update. 64. Since the November update, Inland Revenue has successfully migrated GST to the new platform, three months ahead of schedule. This will build confidence for the successful delivery of Stage 2. We understand Inland Revenue is increasingly sharing lessons and good practice with other agencies for the benefit of wider government and anticipate this will continue. 65. Preparation for Stage 2 implementation is underway. Inland Revenue is preparing lessons learned to support implementation and expects to share these more widely. As noted 12 by Inland Revenue, Stage 2 is a much more complex operation. Adding further change may add risk to an already risky programme. 66. Stage 2 is likely to impact other government agencies through changes to the administration of income taxes. Inland Revenue has committed to working with agencies to minimise impacts where possible, though Ministers should note that Stage 2 changes could result in additional cost to the wider government system. We will work with Inland Revenue to bring matters to Ministers attention. Recommendations I recommend that the Committee: 1. Note that Stage 1 of Inland Revenue’s transformation was successfully implemented on 7 February 2017; 2. Note that Stage 2 will focus on: i. the end-to-end implementation of tax products, the Accounting Income Method for calculating provisional tax, and the Automatic Exchange of Information with international tax treaty partners in START, including enhanced customer interaction and case management capabilities; ii. implementation of enabling technology and capabilities; iii. implementation of a new organisational model for Inland Revenue; iv. preparation for future stages, including social policy; 3. Note that expected benefits of Stage 2 are in line with the estimates previously noted by Cabinet; 4. Note that the expected costs of Stage 2 until 30 June 2018 have been updated and are within the funding approved by Cabinet for transformation and the Automatic Exchange of Information; 5. Note that the next transformation update will be provided to Cabinet to consider by December 2017; Multi-year appropriation 6. Note that approval has been provided through the March Baseline Update to establish a multi-year appropriation for the departmental other expense Transformation to run from 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2021; Vote Appropriation Minister Title Type Scope Revenue Minister of Revenue Transformation MYA Departmental Other Expense This appropriation is limited to the design and implementation of a modern system for tax revenue and social policy administered by Inland Revenue 13 7. Note that changes to appropriations have been approved through the March Baseline Update to give effect to the establishment of a new multi-year appropriation.

Between 1 July 2014 and 30 June 2020, the programme spent $747 million in operating, and $374.9 million in capital. Any under-spending to date has either been moved to later periods or returned to the Crown. Stage 4 budget 7. Including the transitional funding, the overall budget for the current phase of transformation, Stage 4, is $20 1. 8 million for operating expenditure and $90.3 million for capital expenditure. We are on track to come in on budget for Stage 4. 8. The delivery budget for Stage 4 and the contingency held by the Commissioner have changed this month for both operating and capital expenditure. This follows a comprehensive assessment of the remaining in-scope activities for the programme. The biggest contributor to these changes is the decision to move our payroll system to the cloud rather than implement a replacement solution (IR2021/105 refers). Recommended action 9.

Noted Noted Greg James Deputy Commissioner, Transformation 02 June 2021 Hon Grant Robertson Hon David Parker Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue / /2021 / /2021 4 IR2021/228: Transformation status update: May 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Stage 4 first release update 10. Paid parental leave, unclaimed money, New Zealand foreign trusts, and duties continue to run smoothly on new systems and processes. We exited early life support as planned on 28 May 2021. These status updates will now focus solely on the second release from next month onwards. Stage 4 second release 11. This final release will move child support to new systems and processes and upgrade the online services all customers use and the START software our people use. Go-live will be in October 2021, with the exact date to be confirmed. 12. Following go-live, child support customers will have better visibility of their obligations and payments in myIR, and be able to do more for themselves, including registering online and advising us of any changes in their circumstances. 13. Child support is a complex product and the move from our old systems and processes needs to be managed carefully. As we have for previous releases, we have processes in place to manage this including extensive testing and ensuring our data and information is in the best possible shape before go -live. However, issues are likely to arise after go-live, as has been the case for previous releases. We will again provide early life support for around three-months after go-live to ensure we identify and resolve issues. 14. Given the sometimes complex circumstances of child support customers, and the changes to online services that all customers use, we are expecting some customers to get in contact as they get used to new ways of doing things. It is highly likely that customers will see some differences in the way the new system works compared to the old system. We are very focused on minimising any impacts on customers, however our experience with previous releases shows that customer contacts increase following go-live until customers become familiar with the new systems and processes. We are managing our resourcing to ensure we can support customers appropriately after go-live. 15. We completed business function definitions (these describe what the solution needs to do for a particular activity) on 14 May 2021 as planned. This means that any changes to the solution design now require formal approval . 16. We are around halfway through Business System Testing (making sure START works as expected), which is tracking slightly behind schedule due to the complexity of the child support solution. We are likely to start to consume some of the timeline contingency. This has occurred in all prior releases and is not cause for concern. We are actively addressing the areas under pressure. 17. There is some risk associated with the potential volume of data cleansing work which may emerge from heritage system data issues and historical workarounds. 18. We are preparing for the first, of three, mock go-lives (a full-dress rehearsal for go- live) in July 2021, and preparing our deployment approach, including a high-level view of cut-over sequencing and duration. The mock go-lives will help us to confirm how many days we will need to be closed in October 2021 to cut over to new systems and processes and, consequently, what the go-live date will be. Readying our customers 19. Our communications approach is based on the successful rollout of previous releases. We will build customers’ awareness, understanding, and readiness for the changes being made. We will use several techniques to ensure we reach customers, including: 5 IR2021/228: Transformation status update: May 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] • Advertising for the child support changes using an agency that has proven experience in reaching family customers. • Building awareness and understanding for tax intermediaries and employers through our regular customer news channels and a series of bite-sized webinars. • Several rounds of highly targeted direct marketing (letters, emails, text messages and day 1 packs), supported by website content, advertising, and community group collateral. 20. Our main communications activity will run from June to November 2021. The timing will differ for each audience, based on the expected impacts and whether they need to take any action to prepare for the changes. Since late last year, we have been warming up employers, tax intermediaries, and advocacy groups for the changes coming. 21. Our key audiences are child support customers, tax intermediaries, and businesses and employers who use myIR frequently. • Tax intermediaries will require ongoing support. User experience testing with tax agents will help shape the key messages, timing, and channels for this audience. • Child Support receivers and liable parents will receive direct communication preparing them for the changes. • Businesses and employers who use myIR frequently will also require ongoing support. Tutorials and day 1 packs will be provided for new businesses, employers and intermediaries signing up to myIR. • After go-live, using new functionality in myIR, we will be able to link customers from myIR directly to self-guide tutorials. User testing will inform the topics we create tutorials for. • To support our people to communicate effectively with external stakeholders, collateral and support will be provided to them. Key to this release will be working with consumer and community advocate groups and agency partners. 22. Taking a no surprises approach, we will work first with professional bodies and industry associations. We will alert organisations, including tax intermediaries, where appropriate before we communicate to their clients or customers. We will help organisations (including software developers) share consistent messages to their audiences and end users. Readying our people 23. Training will take place from August to November 2021 and will again be a mix of classroom sessions and online learning. 24. Mandatory classroom training of between three to four days will be provided for approximately 600 people who work with child support customers and will include training on the START and myIR upgrades. This will take place during September and October 2021. An additional approximately 700 people will have mandatory training for child support delivered online in October 2021. Mandatory training for the START and myIR upgrade will be delivered online from August to October 2021 to a further 2,500 people approximately. 25. Recruitment for 8 trainers to start in July 2021 is currently underway. Train the trainer sessions and piloting of training material will take place in July and August 2021. 26. Following go-live, booster training will be available for those who would like to access it. Key users will provide desk side support and triage issues during the early life support period, as has been the case with previous releases. 6 IR2021/228: Transformation status update: May 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Other updates Enterprise support services – payroll 27. We have finalised a commercial arrangement with SAP to move our payroll solution to the cloud by the end of 2021 (IR2021/105 refers). 28. Mobilisation of the project team has been slightly delayed due to a combination of vendor resource constraints, and COVID-19 issues in India, delaying the onboarding of SAP resources. However, this does not affect our plan to complete the relocation of our payroll solution by mid-December 2021. Following the relocation to the cloud, we will decommission SAP from our heritage data centres by the end of March 2022. Key risks and issues 29. The transformation programme’s risk profile remains amber 1 , with a future trend of amber. An amber profile means that risks and mitigations are reasonably defined and understood, and support is needed from senior leaders to actively manage specific issues in some areas. 30. We are monitoring two issues (risks that have been realised). The first relates to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the delivery of the programme. There are no concerns to report at this time. 31. The second issue relates to the departures of some key people working in the security architecture 2 area, both within the programme and in the wider business, which is impacting delivery in some areas (IR2021/180 refers). We have made an appointment to the vacant Security Architect position on a temporary basis while we continue to search for someone to fill the role permanently. 32. As at May 2021, the programme has a total of 55 open risks 3 , of which 12 are reported to the Portfolio Governance Committee (PGC). 33. The risk relating to delays in completing the decommissioning of E-file has been closed. E-file was successfully decommissioned on 16 April 2021 (IR2021/180 refers). 34. The status of one risk reported to the PGC improved during the month. 35. The current rating of the risk relating to organisational design changes distracting programme resources has improved from very high to high. The current likelihood of this risk occurring has improved from likely (a 21% to 50% chance of occurring) to possible (an 11% to 20% chance of occurring). The consequences of this risk occurring have also improved from major to moderate. All recruitment is now complete, and most appointments have been made. 1 The risk RAG status is separate from the overall programme status which is light amber as stated on page 2. Table 1 on page 2 shows the RAG key for risk as amber and the overall programme rating as light amber. 2 The technology, tools, and processes that help protect an organisation from cyber threats. 3 During May 2021, four programme risks were closed, including one reported to the PGC, and one new programme risk was accepted. 7 IR2021/228: Transformation status update: May 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 36. The top three risks for transformation remain unchanged this month and are: • The need to move KiwiSaver providers off a heritage function they use to automatically send data to us, to new gateway services by 30 June 2022. • Realising the benefits that we committed to deliver in the timeframes indicated. • Possible changes in payments once child support is moved to new systems and processes 4 . Coming up in the next two months 37. Key activities over the next two months include: June 2021 • Complete the first checkpoint for the second release in Stage 4 (child support and upgraded online services) in the readiness assessment framework. • Provide a copy of the July 2021 Transformation Update Cabinet paper to the Minister of Revenue to review. July 2021 • Complete the second checkpoint for the second release in Stage 4 (child support and upgraded online services) in the readiness assessment framework. • Complete the first mock go-live (a full-dress rehearsal for go-live). • Begin scaled business simulation testing (practicing go-live step-by -step). • The Cabinet Government Administration and Expenditure Review Committee considers the July 2021 Transformation Update Cabinet paper. 4 As reported in April 2012 (IR2021/180 refers), there is a risk that customers’ child support payments could change as a result of differences between our old and new systems in how assessments are processed, the way debt/payment allocations are handled, and the timing of employment income information processing.

1 Memorandum of Understanding At the signing today of the Agreement Between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United States of America to Improve International Tax Compliance and to Implement FATCA (hereinafter the “Agreement”), the representatives of New Zealand and the United States of America wish to confirm their understanding of the following: It is understood that organizations registered under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957 and the Charities Act 2005, and donee organizations as defined in the Income Tax Act 2007, would be treated as NFFEs that satisfy subparagraph B(4)(j) of section VI of Annex I. It is understood that an entity established in New Zealand that (i) manages or operates an employee stock option or employee share purchase plan and (ii) is not otherwise a New Zealand Financial Institution, would be treated as an NFFE that satisfies subparagraph B(4)(i) of section VI of Annex I. It is understood that in the case of securities registered with a “designated settlement system” for purposes of part 5C of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989 that are held by or through one or more other Financial Institutions that are not Nonparticipating Financial Institutions, the relevant Financial Accounts would be treated as held by such other Financial Institutions, and such other Financial Institutions would be responsible for any reporting necessary with respect to such Financial Accounts. However, in accordance with paragraph 3 of Article 5 of the Agreement, the relevant settlement system may report on behalf of such other Financial Institutions. 2 It is understood that for purposes of subparagraph 4(b) of paragraph A of Section I of Annex II, the term “Guardians of New Zealand Superannuation” includes any wholly-owned subsidiary of the Guardians of New Zealand authorized by statute to carry out any of the investment functions of the Guardians of New Zealand. It is understood that for the purposes of paragraph A of Section I of Annex II, the entities controlled by the New Zealand Government known as Southern Response and Crown Asset Management would be treated as Non-Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions and as exempt beneficial owners for the purposes of sections 1471 and 1472 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. It is understood that for purposes of paragraph 1 of Article 2 (Obligations to Obtain and Exchange Information with Respect to Reportable Accounts), the use of the term “annually” is not intended to preclude the Parties from exchanging information on a more frequent basis than annually. In reference to paragraph 1 of Article 10 (Term of Agreement), the Government of the United States understands that the Government of New Zealand has introduced legislation that is to enable the Agreement to be implemented in New Zealand, with the goal of having the Agreement enter into force by September 30, 2015. Based on this understanding, as of the date of signature of the Agreement, the United States Department of the Treasury intends to treat each New Zealand Financial Institution, as that term is defined in the Agreement, as complying with, and not subject to withholding under, section 1471 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code during such time as New Zealand is pursuing the necessary internal procedures for entry into force of the Agreement. The United States further understands that New Zealand’s Inland Revenue intends to contact the United States 3 Department of the Treasury as soon as it is aware that there might be a delay in the New Zealand internal approval process for entry into force of the Agreement such that New Zealand would not be able to provide its notification under paragraph 1 of Article 10 of the Agreement prior to September 30, 2015. If upon consultation with New Zealand, the United States Department of the Treasury receives credible assurances that such a delay is likely to be resolved in a reasonable period of time, the United States Department of the Treasury may decide to continue to apply FATCA to New Zealand Financial Institutions in the manner described above as long as the United States Department of the Treasury assesses that New Zealand is likely to be able to send its notification under paragraph 1 of Article 10 by September 30, 2016. It is understood that should the Agreement enter into force after September 30, 2015, any information that would have been reportable under the Agreement thereafter (and prior to its entry into force) had the Agreement been in force by September 30, 2015, is owed on the September 30 next following the date of entry into force. Signed at \_\_\_\_\_ , in duplicate, in the English language, this \_\_ day of \_\_\_\_\_, 20\_\_. FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF NEW ZEALAND: FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:

Mercury NZ v CIR - court case
=============================

**26 August 2019**

The recent court case between Inland Revenue and Mercury NZ Ltd is only the second time New Zealand courts have analysed the modern depreciation regime, introduced in 1993.

The case was heard in the High Court at Auckland in June and centred on whether the turbines at Nga Awa Purua and Kawerau are buildings or not.

IRD had said the turbines were buildings and therefore subject to a depreciation rate of zero percent, while the power company said that they were part of the plant, specifically the gantry crane, and therefore the 9.6 percent rate should apply.

On 1 July 2019 Justice Hinton issued her decision in the tax challenge brought by Mercury NZ Limited.

It was an important decision for the department as it was the first case to consider the meaning of “building” in the Income Tax Act 2007, an area of particular significance after the 2010 Budget reduced the depreciation rate for buildings to zero per cent.

Justice Hinton found in the Commissioner’s favour that Mercury’s geothermal turbine halls at Nga Awa Purua and Kawerau were buildings, and accordingly had a depreciation rate of 0%. 

"This is not one of those relatively rare cases where a structure is part of the apparatus for carrying on a business, or so integral to the production process itself, that it should be properly classified as 'plant'," the July 1 decision says.

The judgment is consistent with the Commissioner’s published interpretation statement on the meaning of “building”. It also provided guidance by confirming the questions to be asked and the order of those questions when applying the depreciation provisions.

In her judgment, Justice Hinton says ”the financial implications flowing from the different approaches to depreciation of the powerstation/turbine hall are considerable. The additional depreciation claimable by Mercury for the 2012–2015 years alone …  is estimated at $7.4 million”.

The Court agreed with the Commissioner that “building” is to be given its “ordinary and natural” meaning.

Mercury did not appeal the decision.

Justice Hinton’s decision is available on the Justice website: [https://forms.justice.govt.nz/search/Documents/pdf/jdo/30/alfresco/service/api/node/content/workspace/SpacesStore/47cd35ef-54f6-4867-89ba-1b37606e9a41/47cd35ef-54f6-4867-89ba-1b37606e9a41.pdf](https://forms.justice.govt.nz/search/Documents/pdf/jdo/30/alfresco/service/api/node/content/workspace/SpacesStore/47cd35ef-54f6-4867-89ba-1b37606e9a41/47cd35ef-54f6-4867-89ba-1b37606e9a41.pdf)

Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

### Lower non-resident withholding tax rates for dividends

#### Question:

Has the Most Favoured Nation obligation contained in Article 9 of the Protocol to the double tax agreement between New Zealand and Mexico (“the Mexican DTA”), that relates to the treaty withholding rate for dividends, been triggered?

#### Answer:

Yes, the Most Favoured Nation obligation was triggered on 1 May 2010. From that date, the following provisions shall apply as if they had been specified in paragraph 2 of Article 10 of the Mexican DTA.

> i. The dividends shall not be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident at a rate exceeding 5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner of those dividends is a company which holds directly at least 10 per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividends.
> 
> ii. The dividends shall not be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a company that is a resident of the other Contracting State that has owned, directly or indirectly through one or more residents of either Contracting State, shares representing 80 per cent or more of the voting power of the company paying the dividends for a 12 month period ending on the date the dividend is declared and the company that is the beneficial owner of the dividends meets one or more of the following criteria:
> 
> (a) The company has its principal class of shares listed on a recognised stock exchange specified in subparagraph (iv)(a) and (b) of the definition below and is regularly traded on one or more recognised stock exchanges specified in paragraph (iv).
> 
> (b) The company is owned directly or indirectly by one or more companies:
> 
> (I) whose principal class of shares is listed on a recognised stock exchange specified in subparagraph (iv)(a) and (b) of the definition below and is regularly traded on one or more recognised stock exchanges specified in paragraph (iv); or
> 
> (II) which, if that company or each of those companies owned directly the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid, would be entitled to equivalent benefits in respect of such dividends under a tax treaty between the State of which that company is a resident and the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident.
> 
> (c) The company does not meet the requirements of subparagraphs (a) or (b) but the competent authority of the first-mentioned Contracting State determines that the first sentence of the following paragraph does not apply. The competent authority of the first-mentioned Contracting State shall consult the competent authority of the other Contracting State before refusing to grant benefits under this subparagraph.
> 
> iii. The new, lower rates shall not apply if it is the main purpose or one of the main purposes of any person concerned with an assignment of the dividends, or with the creation or assignment of the shares or other rights in respect of which the dividend is paid, or the establishment, acquisition or maintenance of the company that is the beneficial owner of the dividends and the conduct of its operations, to take advantage of those new rates. In any case where a Contracting State intends to apply this paragraph, the competent authority of that State shall consult with the competent authority of the other Contracting State.
> 
> iv. The term “recognised stock exchange” means:
> 
> (a) the Mexican Stock Exchange (Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, BMV);
> 
> (b) the securities markets (other than the New Zealand Debt Market) operated by New Zealand Exchange Limited; and
> 
> (c) any other stock exchange agreed upon by the competent authorities.

### Competent Authority Determinations

#### Question:

With respect to the previous question, how do I apply for a competent authority determination that a zero-rate of withholding tax will apply to the payment of a particular dividend?

#### Answer:

You will need to apply in writing to the relevant taxation authority requesting competent authority consideration of the matters by setting out in some detail the relevant facts and circumstances of your case, before payment of the relevant dividend.

For New Zealand subsidiaries of Mexican parent companies, please direct your correspondence to:

New Zealand Competent Authority  
International Revenue Strategy  
Compliance Planning and Development  
P O Box 2198  
Wellington 6140  
New Zealand

Your letter to the New Zealand Competent Authority should include the following:

*   background details as to corporate structure since 1 January 2008;
*   any material changes in capital structure since 1 January 2008;
*   recent trading history (including why the dividend is unimputed);
*   confirmation that the 80% voting power requirement has been met; and
*   why it is considered the first sentence of the third paragraph of the criteria set out above does not apply.

[Student Loan Scheme Act 2011](/new-legislation/act-articles/student-loan-scheme-act-2011 "Student Loan Scheme Act 2011")

Miscellaneous amendments
========================

2011 amendments to the Student Loan Scheme Act including payment allocations, the administration fee, repayments and recall of loan balances.

_**Sections 189-226 and schedules 5-10**_

Changes have been made to the way payments are allocated and offset against a borrower's consolidated loan balance, and an annual administration fee of $40 introduced to reflect the cost of administering the loan. There are also a number of other general amendments made to the Act, which are outlined below, together with the introduction of a new provision that allows the Commissioner to recall a loan, on demand, in certain circumstances.

**_Administration fee_**

A new Inland Revenue administration fee has been introduced to recover more of the costs of administering the student loan scheme from borrowers. The administration fee reflects the costs incurred by Inland Revenue in administering borrowers' loans.

To ensure that borrowers are not charged two fees in the same year, the administration fee will only be charged in years when a borrower is not charged an establishment fee through StudyLink.

The administration fee will be imposed when the borrower's loan is $20 or more as at 31 March each year and imposed on 1 April each year.

The annual administration fee applies from 30 August, being the day after the date of Royal assent.

**_Payment allocation rules_**

The payment allocation rules specify the order in which the Commissioner offsets payments made by a borrower against their consolidated loan balance. For the period 1 April 2012 until 31 March 2013, the payment allocation rules reflect the rules enacted as part of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 namely, that payments satisfy interest first and any remainder is applied to the principal of the loan.

### Changes from 1 April 2013

From 1 April 2013, more detailed payment priority rules will come into force, although the underlying concept remains that payments will go to repay debt first before current year obligations and debt repayments will go to pay interest first and then the loan principal.

The payment allocation rules are as follows.

For standard salary and wage deductions and additional deductions required by the Commissioner to repay a significant under-deduction, any amounts received must be offset against the borrower's consolidated loan balance.

Amounts received through salary and wage deductions required by the Commissioner to repay debts, or deductions required by the borrower or payments in respect of the borrower's consolidated loan balance (for example, from overseas-based borrowers), will first go towards paying any unpaid amount. Any remainder will be used to satisfy current year obligations. Any further amounts remaining will be offset against a borrower's loan balance.

There is an exception to these rules where payments are received by or for a borrower who is in an instalment arrangement. Borrowers who are in an instalment arrangement are required to comply with their current year obligations in order to continue to qualify for the instalment arrangement. The payment allocation rules in the Act reflect this requirement and therefore payments from or for borrowers in an instalment arrangement will first go to meet the current year's obligations, then any remainder will be offset against any unpaid amount. If there is any remainder, that amount will be offset against the borrower's loan balance.

**_Cancellation of interest when loan balance is repaid early_**

The Act continues the current practice whereby interest is calculated and accrued daily and is charged and compounded annually. When a borrower pays the amount outstanding as outlined in the last statement they received, they will still have a small amount of interest outstanding for the period between the last statement and the date of payment.

To address this issue, the new legislation ensures that when the loan is repaid in full within 30 days of the last statement, any loan interest incurred during the 30-day period is cancelled.

This amendment will only apply from 1 April 2012 until 1 May 2013, when the new method of calculating, charging and compounding loan interest applies and removes the need to provide specific rules for the cancellation of interest if the loan balance is repaid early.

**_Recall of loan balance_**

New section 204 allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to exercise existing powers in student loan contracts that provide for the full amount of student loans to be recalled or repaid on demand.

Previously, the Commissioner only had the ability to collect loan amounts that were due and owing and had the power under the relevant Acts to enforce only the payment of arrears.

All student loan contracts contain a clause allowing the loan balance to be recalled in certain circumstances, but in most cases this power is not available to Inland Revenue (instead this rests with another Crown agency).

The new legislation allows the Commissioner to exercise existing powers in student loan contracts that provide for the full amount of student loans to be recalled or repaid on demand.

The powers conferred on the Commissioner are no greater than the powers in the loan contracts as signed by borrowers in terms of the amount that can be demanded and the circumstances in which the recall powers can be exercised.

The powers clarify that Inland Revenue as the agency responsible for collecting student loan repayments, has the ability to exercise this existing recall term of the student loan contract. This will enable it to better manage cases of serious non-compliance.

The application of the change to enable the Commissioner to recall the loan will be 30 August 2011, being the day after the date of Royal assent.

**_Write-off of consolidated loan balance_**

From 1 April 2012, a borrower's consolidated loan balance must be written off (reduced to zero) if:

*   the borrower dies; or
*   the Commissioner has reasonable grounds for considering that the borrower has died; or
*   the borrower's consolidated loan balance is less than $20 at the end of the year.

When a borrower dies or the Commissioner considers the borrower has died, the write-off has effect from the date the borrower dies or is suspected to have died.

When the borrower's consolidated loan balance is less than $20 at the end of the year, the write-off occurs at that date.

### Changes from 1 April 2013

From 1 April 2013, when a borrower's loan balance is less than $20 at any time during the year, the Commissioner may write-off the consolidated loan balance with effect from that date. This change will result in loans of less than $20 being closed off sooner, thereby reducing both compliance and administration costs.

**_Other changes_**

A number of consequential amendments have been made. These:

*   provide the ability to make regulations, which applies from 30 August 2011;
*   prescribe the way a borrower and the Commissioner may provide information to each other, which comes into force on 1 January 2012; and
*   include specific provisions to ensure a smooth transition between the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 and the commencement of the new Act which apply from 1 January 2012.

Also, an amendment has made to ensure borrowers cannot gain an unintended advantage from the interest-free policy. The change precludes borrowers from obtaining a refund of excess payments made in the 2004 and 2005 years. This amendment applies from 30 August 2011, being the day after the date of Royal assent.

[Part 5 - General provisions](/new-legislation/act-articles/kiwisaver-act-2006/part-5-general-provisions "Part 5 - General provisions")

Miscellaneous provisions
========================

KiwiSaver Act 2006 miscellaneous provisions including consent for electronic transactions, direct credit refunds, the role of and information obtained by the CIR.

#### Consent to electronic transactions

A person who gives his or her electronic address is treated under the Act as having consented to accept information in an electronic form. In the case of investment statements, however, a hard copy must be sent if the person has provided a street address or post office box number.

#### Refunds made by direct credit to a bank account

Section 221 specifies that refunds of KiwiSaver contributions must be made by direct credit to a bank account nominated by the person entitled to the refund. When a person claims a refund, the person must provide the Commissioner with the particulars of a bank account in New Zealand that the direct credit is to be made to. However, if the Commissioner is satisfied that payment by direct credit would result in undue hardship to a person or is not practicable, a refund may be made by other means acceptable to the Commissioner.

A "bank account" is defined as an account with a registered bank within the meaning of the Reserve Bank Act 1989, a private savings bank, a credit union, a building society or the PSIS Limited.

#### Role of the Commissioner

Section 222 gives the Commissioner the function of ensuring oversight of the provisions that are administered by Inland Revenue under section 224. Without limitation, this includes the functions and powers of:

*   requiring persons affected by the Act to verify certain matters with the Commissioner as requested; and
*   requiring persons to give notice to the Commissioner to ensure that the Act is complied with.

#### Use of information by the Commissioner obtained under the Act and other Inland Revenue Acts

Section 223 specifies that despite anything in any other Act, nothing prevents the Commissioner or any officer of Inland Revenue from:

*   using information obtained under the Act for the purposes of carrying into effect any of the Inland Revenue Acts; or
*   using information obtained under any of the Inland Revenue Acts for the purposes of carrying into effect the provisions of the Act.

Section 208 outlines certain limits to the application of section 223.

#### Administration of the Act

Section 224 specifies that Parts 1 to 3 and Schedule 3 of the Act are administered by Inland Revenue. Part 4 and Schedules 1 and 2 are administered in the particular department of State that has been delegated responsibility by the Prime Minister.[18](#18)
 Part 5 is administered in the department of State that has been delegated responsibility by the Prime Minister, and different departments may be authorised to administer different sections.[19](#19)

#### Fee subsidy

Section 225 enables a fee subsidy to be paid to a member of a KiwiSaver scheme. The Act allows regulations to be made prescribing the amount of the fee subsidy and the manner in which it is paid. It is the government's intention that the fee subsidy be paid as a contribution to the member's account.

#### Crown contribution

Section 226 specifies that the Crown must pay a contribution to the first KiwiSaver scheme of which a person is a member:

*   as soon as practicable three months after the Commissioner receives the first contribution for that person, in the case of a person that subpart 1 of Part 3 applies (to a person that is required to have deductions of contributions from salary or wages);
*   as soon as practicable after three months after the Commissioner is given notice that the person is a member of the KiwiSaver scheme, for any other case.

The amount of the contribution will be $1,000 or an amount prescribed by the Governor-General by Order in Council. The provider must credit this contribution on a pro rata basis across the investment products of the KiwiSaver scheme to which the person has subscribed or been allocated. Each member is only entitled to one such contribution. If a person ceases to be a member of a KiwiSaver scheme and subsequently becomes a member of another KiwiSaver scheme, they will not be entitled to another Crown contribution.

#### Status of fee subsidy and Crown contribution for tax purposes

Section 227 states that the Crown contribution and fee subsidy paid by the Crown are not income for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 2004 or a gift for the purposes of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968.

#### Regulations

Section 228 allows regulations to be made by the Governor-General by Order in Council for a number of purposes, including:

*   prescribing forms and specified information or documents to be included or attached to forms;
*   prescribing requirements for documents that are sent, given, or delivered and the information that must be included in a notice that is in addition to the information specified in the Act;
*   prescribing fees payable to the Commissioner or Financial Markets Authority or the manner in which the fees may be calculated;
*   recognising specific foreign superannuation schemes or classes of schemes based in named countries as schemes to which funds can be transferred on permanent emigration;
*   prescribing the circumstances for who can qualify for the first home ownership withdrawal provision;
*   prescribing the maximum number of default providers that can be appointed;
*   specifying what information or matters must be used in information packs;
*   providing for operational matters and electronic compatibility between the Commissioner and providers, including requirements for providers to enter into a scheme provider agreement with Inland Revenue and the matters to be included in those agreements;
*   providing for the payment of fee subsidies to members or classes of members of KiwiSaver schemes, and the setting of those fee subsidies or the manner by which they may be calculated;
*   specifying when fee subsidies will be paid, the terms and conditions relating to payment, their application and how they may be enforced;
*   prescribing matters that are relevant to determining whether a fee is unreasonable;
*   prescribing matters which may be considered as significant financial hardship; and
*   providing any other matters necessary for the Act's administration or for giving it full effect.

#### Regulations relating to mortgage diversion

Section 229 specifies that the Governor-General may, by Order in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance), make regulations providing for a mortgage diversion facility that allows contributions to be withdrawn from KiwiSaver schemes and applied towards payment of a mortgage.

The recommendation may be made if the Minister is satisfied that the mortgage diversion facility will be consistent with the following principles:

*   there is no compulsion on KiwiSaver scheme providers to provide a mortgage diversion facility;
*   there is no compulsion on mortgagees to allow amounts secured by mortgages to be paid via KiwiSaver contributions;
*   the facility is available to be used by a member any time after 12 months have expired from the earlier of the date that the Commissioner received the first contribution for the member or the date that the provider received the member's first contribution;
*   the facility is available only in relation to a mortgage over the member's principal residence (for example, the family home);
*   the mortgage diversion may apply for the remainder of the terms of the mortgage after the diversion is made available;
*   after the total amount secured by the mortgage is paid, ongoing contributions are retained automatically in the member's KiwiSaver account;
*   if the member chooses to end the mortgage diversion facility before the mortgage is fully paid, the contributions are redirected towards retirement savings;
*   the provider, and not the Commissioner, is responsible for paying the amount diverted under the mortgage diversion facility;
*   the diverted amount is capped at no more than half of the member's contribution rate and is a fixed dollar amount;
*   employer contributions may not be diverted; and
*   the facility is available for new mortgages and existing mortgages.

The regulation may specify all or any of the terms and conditions that apply to the mortgage diversion facility, including:

*   which types of mortgages qualify;
*   what a scheme must do to participate;
*   how the regulations affect the scheme's trust deed;
*   what happens if the scheme decides to terminate participation;
*   whether payment via the facility counts as payment by the mortgagor for the purpose of the terms of the mortgage; and
*   any other matters.

If a provider chooses to participate in the mortgage diversion facility, any withdrawal made in accordance with those regulations will be treated as a withdrawal permitted under the KiwiSaver scheme rules.

#### Transitional measure

Section 232 specifies that as a transitional measure all contributions must be paid to the Commissioner for the first three months after the automatic enrolment rules have come into effect. No provider may accept contributions in the first three months.

18 Ministry of Economic Development has been delegated responsibility for these provisions.  
19 Inland Revenue has been delegated responsibility for sections 207, 208, 211 to 218, 221 to 224, 226, 227, 229, 231 and 232 and the Ministry of Economic Development has been delegated responsibility for sections 205, 206, 209, 210, 219, 220, 225, 228 and 230.

Miscellaneous Remedial Amendments
=================================

Miscellaneous remedial amendments to various acts - the Income Tax Act 1994, Income Tax Act 2004, Tax Administration Act 1994, Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 and the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994.

### Disclosure provision for premiums paid to non-resident insurers

**_Section FC 17 of the Income Tax Act 1994_**

As a result, a special disclosure provision in section FC 17 of the Income Tax Act 2004 requiring the disclosure to the Commissioner of premiums paid to residents of The Netherlands became unnecessary.  This provision has therefore been repealed with effect from 1 April 2005, the same application date as the related amendment to the double tax agreement.

### Redundant foreign tax credit provision

**_Section LC 15 of the Income Tax Act 2004_**

The dividends Article in the double tax agreement between New Zealand and the United Kingdom was recently replaced, with application from the 2005-06 income year.  Section LC 15 of the Income Tax Act 2004, which related to the claiming of foreign tax credits from the United Kingdom, was relevant only for the purposes of the previous dividends Article, which allowed New Zealand-resident individuals a tax credit in the United Kingdom.  (The new dividends Article follows the standard New Zealand model and does not allow such a credit.)  The redundant section LC 15 has therefore been repealed, with application from the date the Income Tax Act 2004 came into effect, the same application date as the new dividends Article.

### Redundant provisional tax provisions

**_Section MB_** **_2 of the Income Tax Act 2004_**

Section MB 2(1)(aa) and (ab) of the Income Tax Act 2004, which related to provisional tax payments, were redundant and have been repealed with application from the commencement of the Income Tax Act 2004.   These provisions were first enacted in 1998, with application to provisional tax payments for the 1998-99 income year only, and should not have been re-enacted as part of the Income Tax Act 2004. 

### Dividend withholding payment credit cross-references

**_Sections ME 5 and MG 5 of the Income Tax Act 2004_**

Sections ME 5(1)(h) and MG 5(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act 2004, which relate to debiting imputation credit and dividend withholding payment accounts, contained an incorrect cross-reference.  The reference to "section LD 8(1)(a)" has been replaced with "section LD 8(1)(c)", with application from the date the Income Tax Act 2004 came into effect.

### Resident withholding tax exemption for community trusts

**_Section NF_** **_9 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Income Tax Act 2004_**

An income tax exemption for trustees of community trusts - section CB 4(1)(m) of the Income Tax Act 1994 - was enacted by the Taxation (GST, Trans-Tasman Imputation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003 with application from the 2004-05 income year.  An amendment allowing a resident withholding tax exemption certificate to be issued to a trustee of a community trust has been made to section NF 9 of the Income Tax Act 1994 to match this income tax exemption, to apply from the 2004-05 income year.   An equivalent amendment has also been made to the Income Tax Act 2004. 

### Late payment penalty cross-reference

**Section NH** **3 of the Income Tax Act 2004**

Section NH 3(4) of the Income Tax Act 2004, relating to the disallowance by the Commissioner of an election by a company to satisfy a dividend withholding payment liability by reducing a net loss, contained a reference to an additional tax penalty imposed under former section 150 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.  The reference was redundant and has been replaced by a reference to late payment penalty imposed under section 139B of the Tax Administration Act 1994, with application from the date the Income Tax Act 2004 came into effect.

### Definition of "finance lease"

**_Section_** **_OB_** **_1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and sections FC 8B and_** **_OB_** **_1 of the Income Tax Act 2004_**

The Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 amended the finance lease rules in the Income Tax Act 1994 and Income Tax Act 2004.

Some of the amendments made to the Income Tax Act 2004 were not consistent with leasing terminology used in other provisions in that Actt. Several minor changes have therefore been made to ensure consistency of terminology.

*   The various references to "lease term" in the definition of "finance lease" in section OB 1 and in section FC 8B(2) and (3) have been replaced with "term of the lease".
*   The use of the term "personal property lease asset" in the definition of "finance lease" in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 has been standardised.
*   The reference to the term "lease payments" in the definition of "finance lease" in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 has been replaced with "personal property lease payments".

Several features of the definitions of "finance lease" in the Income Tax Act 1994 and Income Tax Act 2004 have also been amended for consistency purposes.

*   The requirement that the definition in the Income Tax Act 1994 applies to leases entered into on or after 20 May 1999 has been reinstated.
*   The requirement that it be ascertained whether a leasing arrangement is a finance lease at the time the lease is entered into has been amended to apply to all limbs of the definition, except an arrangement involving a lease term that is more than 75% of the lease asset's estimated useful life.  This exception is necessary because consecutive or successive leases may satisfy the 75% requirement only some time after the beginning of the lease.

The amendments to the Income Tax Act 2004 apply from the date the Act came into effect while the amendments to the Income Tax Act 1994 apply for arrangements entered into on or after 29 March 2004.

### Definition of "net loss"

**Section** **OB** **1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Income Tax Act 2004**

The definition of "net loss" in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 contained two drafting errors.  First, the cross-reference to "section 177C(4)" of the Tax Administration Act was incorrect and has been replaced with "section 177C(5)".  Secondly, the reference to the amount "written off" by the Commissioner has been replaced by a reference to the amount "extinguished" by the Commissioner, in order to align the definition with the correct terminology used in section 177C.  These amendments apply from the date the Income Tax Act 2004 came into effect.  An equivalent amendment to the second amendment has been made to the definition of "net loss" in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, with application from 1 July 2002. 

### Superannuation fund expense transfers

**_Section DI 3 of the Income Tax Act 1994_**

A master superannuation fund is now allowed to elect in which year (2000-01 or 2001-02) it will deduct certain expenses of a member fund.  The amendment deals with a timing anomaly that arose from an amendment to section DI 3 in 2001.  Master funds previously deducted the expenses on the day they were incurred but, after the change, deducted the expenses in the income year in which they were incurred.  Master funds could not deduct 2000-01 member fund expenditure incurred after their 2000-01 balance date.

### Small claims jurisdiction of Taxation Review Authority

**_Section 89E of the Tax Administration Act 1994_**

Section 89E allows taxpayers to elect in their notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) to have their dispute heard in the small claims jurisdiction of the Taxation Review Authority in certain circumstances.  Section 89E refers to a NOPA issued under section 89D (a taxpayer NOPA to an Inland Revenue assessment) but not section 89DA (a taxpayer NOPA to a self-assessment).  Section 89E has therefore been amended to include a cross-reference to section 89DA to ensure that taxpayers can elect to use the small claims jurisdiction of the Taxation Review Authority in self-assessment situations.  The amendment applies for disputes that are begun under Part 4A of the Tax Administration Act on or after 1 April 2005. 

### Redundant binding rulings provision

**_Section 91E of the Tax Administration Act 1994_**

Section 91E(6) contained a definition of "assessment" for the purposes of the Commissioner making a private ruling.  This definition was redundant, because of the general definition of "assessment" in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act, and has therefore been repealed, with application from the date of enactment.

### Non-filing taxpayers

**_Sections 92 and 108 of the Tax Administration Act 1994_**

Sections 92(4) and 108(1B) were enacted as part of the self-assessment amendments in 2001 and were intended to ensure that the tax position of a non-filing taxpayer for an income year becomes certain and final in the same way as for filing taxpayers.  These provisions became unnecessary under section BC 1(1) of the Income Tax Act 2004, which provides that the income tax liability of a non-filing taxpayer is the total tax withheld in respect of the taxpayer; this ensures that the tax position of a  
non-filing taxpayer becomes certain and final.  Accordingly, sections 92(4) and 108(1B) have been repealed, with application from the 2005-06 income year.

### Use-of-money interest for income statement recipients

**_Section 120C of the Tax Administration Act 1994_**

The provisions concerning the calculation of use-of-money interest in relation to income statement recipients could previously produce incorrect results.  In particular, paragraph (b)(iii) of the definition of "interest period" in section 120C(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 did not work properly in some cases and could result in an interest end-date that was before the interest start-date.  The provision was also unnecessary as the general provisions cater adequately for income statement recipients.  Accordingly, the provision has been repealed, with application from the 2004-05 income year.

### Updating unacceptable tax position provisions

_**Section 141B of the Tax Administration Act 1994**_

Section 141B is concerned with the imposition of shortfall penalties in relation to unacceptable tax positions.  Before 1 April 2003 the provision was concerned with unacceptable interpretations of tax laws.  Section 141B(5) and (6) has been updated to take into account this change of approach in section 141B from unacceptable interpretation to unacceptable tax position.  The amendments apply from the date of enactment,  
21 December 2004.

### Reduction of penalties for previous behaviour

**Section 141FB of the Tax Administration Act 1994**

Section 141FB(5) allows tax shortfalls to be grouped and effectively treated as a single penalty.  This provision has been amended to allow all grouped tax shortfalls to qualify for the reduction for previous behaviour.  The amendment has the same application date as the new section 141FB - 21 December 2004.

### GST on imports

**_Section 12 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985_**

Section 12, which relates to the imposition of GST on imports, has had a minor clarifying amendment made to it.  The change involved making the input tax terminology in section 12(4)(d)(ii) consistent with the approach used in section 12(4)(c) by referring to an "input tax deduction" under section 20(3).  The amendment applies from the date of enactment, 21 June 2005. 

### Adjustment provision

**_Section 25 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985_**

Section 25(2)(a) previously referred to "tax charged by the supplier", which was incorrect because it is the GST Act itself that charges tax on supplies.  A clarifying amendment has been made to correct the error by adopting the approach used in section 25(4), with application from the date of enactment, 21 June 2005.

### Factored debts provision

**_Section 26A of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985_**

Section 26A requires registered persons who account for GST on a payments basis to pay GST on the remaining book value of a debt when it is factored.  This provision has been restructured to integrate it with the calculation of tax payable in section 20 of the GST Act, with application from the date of enactment, 21 June 2005.

### Refund of excess tax

**_Section 45 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985_**

The Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 amended the timeframes within which tax refunds are allowed under the Income Tax Act 1994, Income Tax Act 2004 and section 45 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985.

The terminology used in the new refund provision in section 45 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 has been amended where appropriate to align with the terminology used in the new refund provisions in the Income Tax Act 2004. 

The amendments have the same application date as the new section 45 of the GST Act and apply to taxable periods beginning on or after 1 April 2005. 

### Meaning of "precedent"

**_Section 13B of the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994_**

A definition of "precedent" has been recently included in the Taxation Review Authorities Regulations 1998 to clarify that a "precedent" case is one that has wider implications for other taxpayers.  For consistency, a similar amendment has been included in the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994, where "precedent" is referred to in section 13B(1)(b).  The amendment applies for disputes that are begun on or after 1 April 2005.

Miscellaneous technical amendments
==================================

2006 technical amendments to the Income Tax and Tax Administration Acts.

### Rollover of exemption for investments in listed controlled foreign companies

#### Section EZ 29 of the Income Tax Act 2004

Section EZ 29 has been replaced to extend the exemption for investments in listed controlled foreign companies (CFCs) up to and including the 2010-11 tax year.

As with the previous section EZ 29, new section EZ 29 provides an exemption from the CFC rules in certain circumstances if the CFC is resident in a socalled grey list country and the company is listed on a recognised exchange in that grey list country. (The grey list comprises Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Norway, Spain, United Kingdom and United States.) The exemption applies if, by virtue of the grey list country's stock exchange listing rules, the New Zealand resident holding the CFC interest cannot obtain sufficient information to calculate income under the CFC rules. The exemption will apply if the stock exchange listing rules of the grey list country:

*   prevent the CFC from providing sufficient information for the person to calculate CFC income; or
*   provide that, if the CFC provides sufficient information for the person to calculate CFC income, the CFC is required to make a further disclosure of information that would be harmful to the CFC's commercial interests.

The previous section EZ 29 applied for the 2001-02 to 2005-06 tax years. New section EZ 29 applies for the 2006-07 to 2010-11 tax years.

### Remedial amendments to PAYE

#### Section LD 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004

Three amendments have been made to section LD 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 to amend drafting errors. The first amends section LD 1(2) to ensure that an employee receives credit for the amount of PAYE deducted by the employer rather than just the amount of PAYE paid to the Commissioner.

The second amends section LD 1(2A) to remove the reference to family assistance credits paid by the employer to their employee as the employer no longer pays family assistance.

The final amendment is to section LD 1(6)(b) to ensure that if too much PAYE is refunded to a shareholder employee the shareholder employee and the employer are jointly and severally liable for the difference between the amount refunded and the amount actually paid to the Commissioner by the employer. The current wording only recoups the difference between the amount refunded and the amount shown on the employer monthly schedule and therefore potentially benefits employers who underpay their PAYE to Inland Revenue.

These amendments apply from 3 April 2006, being the date of assent of the Act.

### Companies required to maintain imputation credit accounts

#### Section ME 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004

A New Zealand-resident company must establish and maintain an imputation credit account (ICA) under section ME 1(1) of the Income Tax Act 2004 unless it is prohibited from doing so under any of the circumstances listed in section ME 1(2). Before an amendment made by the Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004, section ME 1(2)(a) prohibited a company from having an ICA if it was "not resident in New Zealand". This provision was redundant and should have been repealed because only a New Zealandresident company can have an ICA. However, the 2004 amendment replaced section ME 1(2)(a) with a provision that prohibited a company from having an ICA if it was "resident in a country other than New Zealand".

The 2004 amendment had the unintended effect of prohibiting all dual-resident companies from having an ICA. This should not be the case. Only a dual-resident company of the type listed in section ME 1(2)(b) - that is, a company treated as not being a New Zealand resident for the purposes of a double tax agreement - should be prohibited. Section ME 1(2)(a) has therefore been repealed with application from the 2005-06 income year (the same application date as the 2004 amendment).

### Definition of "beneficiary income"

#### Section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994

The definition of "beneficiary income" in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 uses the term "income year". The term "income year" is defined as the tax year (ending 31 March) or the non-standard accounting year approved by Inland Revenue. The definition of "beneficiary income" provides for distributions to be made to beneficiaries during the income year or within six months after the end of the income year. The effect of the reference to "income year" is that the six-month period expires on a date that is six months after the (approved) balance date of the trust. This is different from the Income Tax Act 1994 where the period ended six months after 31 March (30 September). The Rewrite Advisory Panel considered a submission that the 2004 Act contains an unintended change from the 1994 Act. The Panel agreed that such a change had occurred, but decided that the 2004 Act should remain unchanged and that a retrospective change to the 1994 Act should be made to bring it into line with the 2004 Act.

The definition of "beneficiary income" in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 has therefore been amended so that it applies to non-standard accounting years as well as years ending on 31 March. The amendment applies from the 1995-96 income year. The amendment to the 1994 Act protects the position of all options used by taxpayers by giving them the later of six months post-balance date (for those who followed the 2004 Act position) or 30 September (for those early balance date taxpayers who followed the previous 1994 Act position).

### Removal of "in writing" requirement for requests for penalty remissions

#### Sections 183ABA and 183H of the Tax Administration Act 1994

Section 183H of the Tax Administration Act no longer requires requests for remission of late filing penalties, non-electronic filing penalties, or late payment penalties to be in writing. Changes made to section 183ABA are consequential amendments.

The removal of the "in writing" requirement for requests applies from 4 April 2006.

Mixed commercial and residential situations
===========================================

Tax is different for commercial and residential property, but some mixed situations also have their own special tax rules.

[The difference between commercial and residential property](/property/commercial-residential/tax-difference)

Airbnb and other short-stay accommodation
-----------------------------------------

This type of accommodation is residential, even if you’re running it as a business.

### Special depreciation rule - 4 or more units in a single building

If you have 4 or more units in a single building that you run as short-stay accommodation, you can claim depreciation on these units. For example, apartments within an apartment building.

[Depreciation](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/types-of-business-expenses/depreciation)
  
[Renting out residential property](/property/renting-out-residential-property)

Mixed business and residence
----------------------------

If you rent out part of your property to a business and part as a residence, the property is part commercial and part residential. For example, if you have a 2-storey building with a shop downstairs and a long-term rental apartment upstairs.

You need to work out how much each part is, then share out your costs accordingly. For example, 40% commercial and 60% residential.

[Property interest limitation rules](/property/renting-out-residential-property/residential-rental-income-and-paying-tax-on-it/property-interest-rules)

Renting out your house to a business
------------------------------------

If you’ve converted your house and rented it out as a business premises, it’s fully commercial property. For example, a dentist or doctor’s surgery.

Boarding houses
---------------

Boarding houses have special rules for income tax and GST depending on how many rooms they have and whether those rooms are self-contained.

### GST rules

Any boarding house is commercial property for GST. 

[Are you operating a boarding house? - Tenancy Services website](https://www.tenancy.govt.nz/starting-a-tenancy/boarding-houses/are-you-operating-a-boarding-house/)

### Income tax rules

For income tax, your boarding house is commercial property if it has:

*   a minimum of 10 boarding rooms that are not self-contained
*   shared living facilities, including kitchens and living areas available to all residents
*   servicing and management taken care of by the business.

In this case, it’s called a ‘boarding establishment’.

If you do not meet these requirements, your boarding house is residential property and you’re limited in how much interest you can claim against your income.

[Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2013](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-livestock-valuation-assets-expenditure-and-remedial-matters-act-2013 "Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2013")

Mixed-use assets: GST changes
=============================

2013 changes to the GST Act mean owners of mixed-use assets can claim input tax deductions similar way to income tax deductions for the same item.

_Sections 20(3JB), 20G, 21B, 21D and 21G of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985_

### Summary of proposed amendments

Changes are being made to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 consistent with those being made in the Income Tax Act 2007 for mixed-use assets (ie, land (including improvements), aircraft and boats). It is important to note that the GST changes will apply only to GST-registered persons. These changes however do not apply to a widely-held company (see section 20G(8)).

These changes will ensure that mixed-use asset owners that are registered for GST will be able to claim input tax deductions in a similar way as they would be able to claim income tax deductions for the same item.

Some GST-specific rules are required to cater for the fact that:

*   GST has always recognised that supplies can be made for below-market value to non-associates.
*   An asset will have a GST component that will need to be apportioned over the ownership period (whereas for income tax purposes this would be capital expenditure).
*   Some items of expenditure relevant for the income tax calculation will not be relevant for GST (such as interest).
*   GST is not calculated on an annual basis.

### Application dates

The GST changes are broadly aligned with the income tax changes. For assets for which the income tax changes take effect from the 2014-15 income year (ie, aircraft and boats), the GST changes will apply from 1 April 2014.

However, for assets for which the income tax changes take effect from the 2013-14 income year (ie, land (including improvements)), the GST changes will only apply from 17 July 2013 (the date of Royal assent of the Act).

### Key features

Owners of mixed-use assets will, under the proposed changes, be required to apportion their input deductions in a way that reflects their relative taxable and non-taxable use of the asset. This is consistent with the proposed treatment of income tax deductions.

The formula used for calculating GST deductions (contained in new section 20G) incorporates the income tax definitions as far as possible. Having the GST calculations as close as possible to those for income tax is intended to reduce the compliance costs associated with the proposed rules.

The main differences between the income tax and GST definitions relate to:

*   the treatment of supplies for less than market value; and
*   what constitutes "expenditure".

These differences reflect the different nature of the two taxes. In particular:

*   GST has always recognised the right of registered persons to make supplies for lower than market value to non-associates.
*   "Expenditure" is not a word generally used in a GST context, so the GST formula replaces "expenditure" with "input tax".

### _Below market value supplies_

The definition of "income-earning days" in the GST formula includes any day on which the person supplies the asset for use and derives consideration, irrespective of whether this supply is above, at or below market value. This allows asset owners to make supplies at below market value if they chose to do so, with these days still being "income earning". This is consistent with general GST principles.

It is important to note that, if the owner supplies the asset to an associated person, section 10(3) will generally require them to treat the supply as being made at market value. This will require output tax to be paid on the supply, but it will also be treated as "income-earning" for the purposes of calculating entitlement to input deductions. Similarly, if the supply is a fringe-benefit, section 21I will apply to deem consideration to have been received - this will also be an income-earning day.

### _"Expenditure"_

The replacement of expenditure for input tax ensures that GST deductions are based on what the GST Act allows. Expenditure on some assets will be subject to GST, but irrelevant for income tax purposes. The most obvious example is likely to be the main mixed-use asset itself, which may have a GST component (either explicitly or through the secondhand goods rules). It is also to clarify that input tax on durable assets (such as a holiday house) is relevant for each subsequent adjustment period in the same way as it is for the general apportionment rules. On the other hand, interest is a relevant expense for income tax but not for GST purposes.

### Rules in practice

### _Link with apportionment rules_

As mixed-use assets are used partly for private and partly for business purposes, the general apportionment rules in the GST Act should also apply to expenditure in relation to these assets. To facilitate this, the definitions used in the apportionment rules: "percentage intended use", "potential actual use" and "percentage difference" in section 21G have been extended to apply to the mixed-use asset formula in section 20G.

The effect of this change is that a GST-registered recipient of a supply in respect of their mixed-use assets will need to perform an initial estimate of their percentage intended use of the supply. This estimate should be done based on the result the person thinks the formula in section 20G would produce. In calculating this, an asset owner will need to be aware that the section does not apply to supplies used solely for income earning days or solely for private days. If a supply is used solely for income earning days, all input tax is deductible and no apportionment is necessary. Conversely, if a supply is used solely for private days, no input tax is deductible.

As with the general apportionment rules and the formula used for income tax, section 20G requires a registered person to perform annual calculations to determine the level to which they can claim input tax deductions. As with the general apportionment rules, section 20G requires the registered person to pay any output tax or allow them to claim input tax on any positive or negative adjustment produced by the formula.

### _Filing_

One issue specific to GST is that GST is not generally calculated on an annual basis, so GST-registered owners of mixed-use assets will be required to file returns on a monthly, two-monthly or six-monthly basis. Although the general apportionment rules provide for annual adjustments, section 20G sets put specific rules for the calculation and what to do for intervening taxable periods.

Section 20G requires a person to perform the calculation at the end of an adjustment period, as defined. This is usually an annual period. However, as stated above, the registered person must estimate their taxable use of a supply in the intervening periods and calculate their actual taxable use at the end of each adjustment period. This wash-up calculation will determine the person's true tax position for each of the taxable periods within the adjustment period. To ease the compliance burden on registered persons, the rules require input tax in the adjustment period to be aggregated. Only if the estimated deductions are 10 percentage points or greater than the actual taxable use (or less than 10 percentage points but more than $1,000) is a wash-up necessary (see section 20G(6)).

An alternative approach, which ensures greater accuracy but that might reduce cash-flow, would be for the registered person to delay claiming input deductions in the intervening periods and instead claim their annual entitlement at the end of each adjustment period when the calculation is performed.[1](#01)

### _Disposal_

Section 20G(7) provides that the disposal of the relevant asset by a registered person will be a taxable supply and section 21F will apply to it. This means that output tax will be payable on the disposal and a registered person will be able to apply the section 21F formula to claim any input tax not previously claimed.

[All Income tax dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[Income tax])

Mixed-use assets are property (for example holiday homes), aircraft and boats with both private and income-earning use. You need to work out the amount of private and income-earning use for each asset, as this decides how much income you declare and what expenses you can claim.

You have a mixed-use asset if during the tax year the asset is:

*   used for both private use and income-earning use
*   unused for 62 days or more. 

The rules apply to any:

*   property, regardless of cost price or current value
*   aircraft, ship, boat or craft used for navigation on or under the water which had a cost or market value of $50,000 or more when you bought it
*   additional item or accessory relating to the asset, for example a quad bike stored at a holiday home.

The rules do not apply to a:

*   residential property used for long-term rental
*   business asset where the private use is minor, for example once a year
*   home office where your expense claim is based on floor area
*   room in your home rented out for short-term stays.

These are known as excluded assets.

Mixed-use assets and GST
------------------------

The mixed-use asset rules also apply to GST.

If you're GST-registered, you can claim GST on the percentage of expenses that relate to the asset's business use.

Learn more about the GST rules on mixed-use assets in the Tax Information Bulletin.

[Tax Information Bulletin | Volume 25 No. 9 | October 2013](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/tib/volume-25---2013/tib-vol25-no9)

Opting out of the mixed-use asset rules
---------------------------------------

If you meet certain criteria for the income year, you can choose to leave out income and expenses relating to your asset from your income tax and GST returns. You can opt out if one of the following apply:

*   your gross income for the tax year from the income-earning use of the asset is less than $4,000
*   your asset is loss-making and your gross income from income-earning use is less than 2% of the value of the asset (see below for how to calculate this value).

The above exemptions do not apply to holiday homes owned by companies.

Loss-making holiday homes
-------------------------

If your deductible expenditure under the mixed-use asset rules for your holiday home is more than the income from it, you may not be able to claim the whole deduction in that year. 

This will be the case if your income from income-earning use of the holiday home is less than 2% of the holiday home’s value (see below for how to calculate this value).

In that situation, you can only claim a deduction equal to the amount of the income from income-earning use of the property.  You’ll have to carry forward the excess deductions to a future income year when you earn income from the holiday home.

You can use the carried forward excess deductions in a future year if the income from income-earning use of the holiday home in that year is more than that year’s deductions under the mixed-use asset rules. The maximum amount you can claim from the excess is the difference between that year’s income from income-earning use of the holiday home and that year’s allowable deductions under the mixed-use asset rules for the holiday home. Any remaining excess continues to be carried forward to future years.

Calculating the value for your mixed-use asset
----------------------------------------------

For property (for example holiday homes), calculate the value by using whichever is most recent:

*   the local authority capital or annual value (rateable value)
*   the purchase price.

If you bought the property from an associated person, use the market value at purchase if the purchase is more recent than the local authority valuation.

For aircraft, ships, boats and other craft used for navigation on or under the water, use the [adjusted tax value](/api/glossary/item?id={672D0EE8-25C1-4111-9165-9E7F6C172EA4})

Inland Revenue report: Monitoring business transformation Date: 11 April 2016 Priority: Medium Security level: In confidence Report number: IR2016/125 Action sought Action sought Deadline Minister of Revenue Note the contents of this report 18 April 2016 Contact for telephone discussion (if required) Name Position Telephone Ac ting Deputy Commissioner, Change Withheld under s18(c)(i) of the OIA IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 11 A pril 2016 Mi nister of Revenue Monitoring business transformation 1.In November 2015, Inland Revenue secured Cabinet’s agreement to invest in the implementation of New Zealand’s future revenue system. The Business Transformation programme is the delivery vehicle for a modern, digital revenue system. 2.At the request of the Minister of Finance, Inland Revenue and the Treasury have worked together to develop recommendations for monitoring the programme as it progresses into implementation. The Treasury has a key role in monitoring the government’s investment portfolio and accordingly provide independent advice to the Minister of Finance on performance. 3.Su bject to Cabinet’s agreement to the introduction of the Investor Confidence Rating approach, monitoring of the programme will focus on delivery progress and realisation of benefits. The basis for programme monitoring will be Inland Revenue’s existing assurance and reporting mechanisms. 4.Th e proposed monitoring arrangements consist of key performance indicators (KPIs) and outcome measures. The KPIs will track programme delivery progress against ten areas relating to programme health. The outcome measures will track achievement of the programme’s investment objectives and realisation of the agreed programme benefits. Key performance indicators 5.The proposed KPIs for the programme are drawn predominantly from existing reporting, as shown in the table below. Health area (KPI) Description How measured Scope The work to be delivered to accomplish programme objectives. Monthly through the programme’s change request process. Schedule Focussed on controlling production and acceptance of fit-for-purpose programme deliverables. Monthly through earned value reporting. Delivery partners Aimed at managing effective relationships with key delivery partners through sound contracts and contract management. Monthly through commercial and sourcing vendor scorecards. Risks Identifying and effectively managing risks to minimise impact on the programme. Monthly through the programme risk dashboard. IR2016/125: Monitoring business transformation 1 IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Health area (KPI) Description How measured Issues Identifying and effectively managing issues to minimise impact on the programme. Monthly through the programme risk dashboard. Resources Recruiting and maintaining motivated people required for completion of the programme. Vacancy tracking (monthly) and programme climate surveys (six monthly). Financials Maintaining up to date forecasts and managing actual costs relative to approved budget. Monthly through financial reporting. Benefits Estimating and monitoring the realisation of benefits. Refer to paragraphs 8 to 10 below. Interdependencies Identifying and coordinating projects which have a high level of dependence with the programme. Monthly through the integrated programme planning forum and programme dependency register. Stakeholder engagement Maintaining support by those who influence or are affected by the programme. Through external stakeholder surveys (annual), customer satisfaction surveys and media analysis (on- going) and reference groups (on- going). 6. Each of these KPIs is assigned a red-amber-green (RAG) status (with intermediate ‘light’ steps for each) according to the likely impact of the measured area on the programme. 7. Overall programme status against all ten keys will be regularly reported to you and the Minister of Finance, as is currently the case. Outcome measures 8. Measures tracking the programme’s performance against investment objectives often relate to more than one objective at a time. The programme-level benefit map (refer to appendix A) shows that there are three main measures of success: • easier for customers; • reduced time and cost to implement policy (policy agility); and • administrative savings to Inland Revenue. 9. Inland Revenue’s progress towards achieving these outcomes will be reported to Cabinet annually as changes are likely to be gradual and more frequent reporting is unlikely to be of greater value. The proposed outcome measures are shown in the table on the next page. IR2016/125: Monitoring business transformation 2 IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Outcome Description How measured Administrative savings to Inland Revenue Measures achievement against the following investment objective: • Improving productivity and reducing the cost of providing Inland Revenue’s services Measured by financial benefits released as a result of the programme. Includes: • Digital uptake by taxpayers by product • Reduction in Inland Revenue’s workforce Easier for customers Measures achievement against the following investment objectives: • Delivering new and more effective services to improve customer compliance and help support the outcomes of social policies • Improving the customer experience by making it easier and simpler for our taxation and social policy customers, with a particular focus on enhanced digita l provision of services • Increasing the secure sharing of intelligence and information to improve delivery of services to New Zealanders and improve public sector performance • Increase in number of taxpayers who find it easy to comply, measured by net ‘agree’ score in Inland Revenue ’s Customer Satisfaction & Perceptions Survey • Reduction in customer effort as a result of information sharing and security of information, demonstrated by case studies • Digital uptake by taxpayers by product • Reduction in the number of hours taken to complete tax activities, from Inland Revenue’s SME compliance survey • Improved business perception that the revenue system requires less effort, measured by Inland Revenue’s R esult 9 indicator • Government services to businesses perform similarly well as those of leading private sector firms Reduced time and cost to implement policy Measures achievement against the following investment objectives: • Improving agility so that policy changes can be made in a timely and cost effective manner • Minimising the risk of protracted system outages and intermittent systems failure • Increase in the mean time between failures for customer- facing services • Increased revenue system resilience as assessed by Inland Revenue • Reduction in the time and cost to implement policy, demonstrated by case studies 10. Measuring performance against investment objectives in each stage will relate to the product types deployed in that stage. For example, in Stage 1, digital uptake will specifically measure uptake of the digital GST product. IR2016/125: Monitoring business transformation 3 IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE Other reporting to the corporate centre 11. Inland Revenue and the corporate centre 1 currently meet every two months to review programme performance. A range of internal Inland Revenue reports are already provided as part of the meeting material, including the outcome of assurance reviews, the programme’s risk register, and other significant programme documentation. 12. The programme will report earned value to the corporate centre as part of the major projects monitoring process managed by the Treasury. 13. In addition to formal reporting, the Programme Director has agreed to make available to the corporate centre quarterly ‘deep dive’ opportunities into topics of particular interest, such as organisational change and the co-existence of the FIRST platform and the new technology environment. These sessions will be covered as part of the existing bi-monthly meetings and will re-use material prepared for briefing Inland Revenue governance groups. This approach will help to minimise the amount of additional work required and the risk of distracting key programme staff. Reporting to Cabinet 14. As directed (CAB-15-Min-0249 refers), I nland Revenue will report to Cabinet twice yearly regarding programme progress. 15. An annual programme update will be presented to Cabinet by December each year providing visibility of delivery progress, updated costs and benefits, and any material changes. The programme update will provide Ministers with an opportunity to provide direction if necessary, and consider any opportunities which may have arisen. 16. An interim programme update will be presented to Cabinet by July each year providing visibility of delivery progress and any trade-offs that need to be considered. The interim updates will provide Ministers with a view of whether the programme is on track, and enable direction to be provided if necessary. 17. The annual and interim programme updates are intended to provide assurance to Cabinet in the absence of further business cases. As agreed with the Treasury, the existing business case approach is less suited to a programme of the length and scale of Business Transformation. As a result, the Treasury has proposed to the Minister of Finance that a more fit-for -purpose approach to monitoring business transformation be adopted. 18. Thresholds for the programme’s KPIs are to be agreed by Inland Revenue and the Treasury and, once developed, will be reported to both you and the Minister of Finance. If KPIs deteriorate below the agreed thresholds, next steps would be recommended on a 1 The Treasury, Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, State Services Commission, NZ Government procurement, Government Chief Information Officer, advisors in the offices of the Ministers of Finance and Revenue IR2016/125: Monitoring business transformation 4 IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE case-by-case basis.

More than two million logins to new tax system
==============================================

**07 May 2019**

Customers have logged into the new myIR more than two million times since one of the largest data migrations undertaken by a New Zealand government agency.

Some 20 million income tax records, representing around $5 billion in financial transactions, were moved over to Inland Revenue’s new tax system during a seven-day shutdown of services.

Since Inland Revenue reopened on Friday 26 April, the new system has handled:

• 2.1 million logins to myIR  
• 160,544 Working for Families payments made, worth $32.6 million in total  
• 159,794 payday filing returns  
• 83,777 GST returns  
• 22,432 individual income tax returns  
• 17,906 addresses updated in myIR  
• 8,561 donation tax receipts lodged

“This was a monumental task – far larger than our two previous releases but we have managed to complete it successfully,” says Greg James, Inland Revenue’s Deputy Commissioner, Transformation.

Inland Revenue has been back open for 12 days following the shutdown to implement the third release in its multi-year transformation project.

“We’re pretty happy with the way the new system has been working in the first week or so but given the scale of what we’ve done there are bound to be a few bumps in the road ahead.

“The tax system that we have now is vastly superior to the one we had before and I think all taxpayers will get to experience the benefit of that.

“We realise that some of our changes will take some getting used to but we have a website that’s packed full of information and our people are trained and ready to help.”

Almost 300 people worked across 185 hours to get the new system up and running – a job that required more than 1,100 tasks to be completed.

“The scale of this year’s release puts our two previous releases in the shade,” says Mr James. “Migrating income tax records was always going to be our biggest test but now that’s been done we can begin the process of issuing automatic tax assessments later this month.”

Planning is already well underway for release four. This involves bringing KiwiSaver and Student Loan records over to the new system.

“Our transformation is running on time and under budget and is already delivering benefits to New Zealanders,” says Greg James.

Mortgage diversion regulations - questions we've been asked
===========================================================

Questions and answers about the mortgage diversion regulations applying to KiwiSaver.

This section of the TIB sets out answers to some questions we've received on the mortgage diversion regulations applying to KiwiSaver which may be of general interest to readers.

All references are to the KiwiSaver Regulations 2006 unless otherwise stated.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Q:  | In relation to regulation 23(1)(b) "secures obligations in respect of the mortgagor's principal residence", it is not clear what the intention of this regulation is. It is not clear whether this regulation covers mortgages that secure obligations in respect of the mortgagor's principal residence, or whether these words extend to mortgages that secure obligations in respect of the mortgagor's principal residence and other obligations. As an example, would a mortgage that secures obligations in respect of the mortgagor's principal residence and a car fall within the regulation? Also, it is not clear from the wording of Regulations 23(1)(c) and 23(2) if revolving credit facilities and contracts payable in instalments are both excluded from participation in the facility. |
| A:  | Regulation 23(1)(b) "secures obligations in respect of the mortgagor's principal residence" includes mortgages that secure obligations in respect of the mortgagor's principal residence and other obligations.<br><br>"All obligations" mortgages to secure residential lending are almost universal across the banking sector. These types of mortgages allow banks to allocate consumer debts to increase home loan debt in times of default. Due to the prevalence of these security instruments, it was not considered possible to exclude these mortgages while at the same time maintaining a widely accessible KiwiSaver mortgage diversion scheme.<br><br>It was recognised that it is difficult for banks to determine with any precision whether a loan given by a bank is being used principally to fund the purchase of a home. While the regulations could impose such a requirement, it is unlikely that banks could police such a provision without incurring substantial costs.<br><br>Regulation 23 provides the types of mortgages that qualify for participation in the facility. A mortgage qualifies if it is a mortgage over the mortgagor's principal residence, secures obligations in respect of the mortgagor's principal residence, and is not a mortgage that secures obligations under a revolving credit contract. This means that where a mortgage secures both a revolving credit facility, a home loan, and other obligations, the entire mortgage is excluded from mortgage diversion by virtue of the revolving credit contract. A revolving credit contract is defined under Regulation 23(2).<br><br>Fixed-rate loan contracts are not excluded from mortgage diversion, by virtue of the wording in Regulation 23(2)(b) "does not include a contract that provides for a known or determinable amount of credit by instalments if known or determinable amounts". |
| Q:  | It is not clear who mortgage diversion applies to or who the mortgagor and borrower must be. |
| A:  | For the purposes of understanding mortgage diversion, the principles of mortgage diversion in section 229 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 and the regulations need to be read together. The principles in the KiwiSaver Act provide that the facility is available to a person at any time after 12 months have expired since the earlier of: the date the Commissioner received the first contribution for that member, or the date that a provider received the first contribution for that person's membership of a KiwiSaver scheme. Mortgage diversion can only apply to mortgagors who are KiwiSaver members. |
| Q:  | What is the meaning of "principal residence" and how does mortgage diversion work when the mortgagor consists of two people and only one of them lives in the relevant residence? |
| A:  | Mortgage diversion is available in relation to a mortgage over the person's (the KiwiSaver member's) principal residence. Therefore, a member of a scheme can only divert money to pay the mortgage on a property if the member is the mortgagor and the mortgage is over the member's principal residence. Therefore, mortgage diversion will not be available to a person who has a mortgage over a residence, but who does not live in that residence. If there is a mortgage in joint names and only one of the mortgagors lives in the residence, the person living in the residence can participate (provided they are a KiwiSaver member and meet the other requirements of mortgage diversion - for example, 12 months have expired since the first contribution was received in respect of their membership (by either the Commissioner or their scheme)). In other words, not all parties to the mortgage must have that property as their principal residence (or participate in mortgage diversion) - only the KiwiSaver member applying for mortgage diversion. |
| Q:  | The regulations should be clarified regarding the part of the mortgage that the diverted payments must be applied to. Can the facility be used to make up the minimum mortgage payment? Can diverted funds be credited into the loan funding account? |
| A:  | The regulations are silent on this matter, to allow industry the flexibility to develop new products that allow for the amount diverted in the minimum payment. Industry feedback during consultation was that it would not be feasible for amounts diverted under a mortgage diversion facility to form part of the minimum mortgage repayment amount. Doing so would introduce risks, due to the involvement of a third party (Inland Revenue) in terms of timing issues, the potential for amounts to vary, and monitoring and enforcing mortgage payments. It is therefore recognised that it is likely that any payment received by banks will be additional amounts over and above existing repayment obligations. Banks should ensure that any money diverted under mortgage diversion facility cannot be redrawn by the mortgagor before being applied to the loan. |
| Q:  | Can a KiwiSaver member avail themselves of the mortgage diversion facility when a family trust or other party is the only mortgagor of the relevant mortgage? |
| A:  | Because the KiwiSaver Regulations require a member participating in mortgage diversion to be a mortgagor (although not necessarily the only one), the answer is no. Read cumulatively, Regulations 24 to 27 show this requirement exists. The terms of Regulations 24, 26 and 27 show that the mortgagee involved in the facility must be the member's mortgagee. Regulation 25 meanwhile requires certain actions from mortgagees who have agreed to participate in the facility in respect of a mortgagor. |

Mortgage diversion
==================

2008 mortgage diversion regulations allow member contributions to be withdrawn from KiwiSaver and applied to a mortgage over principal residence.

#### KiwiSaver Amendment Regulations (No 2) 2008

The mortgage diversion regulations provide a facility that allows member contributions[1](#01)
 to be withdrawn from a KiwiSaver scheme and complying superannuation fund and applied towards amounts that are secured by a mortgage over a member's principal residence, if the provider and the mortgagee (bank) choose to participate.

The KiwiSaver Amendment Regulations (No 2) 2008 amend regulation 23 governing which types of mortgages qualify for participation in the mortgage diversion facility. The measure was approved by Order in Council signed on 15 September 2008, with effect from 16 October 2008.

The intent of the regulations is to ensure that a mortgage over a member's principal residence is eligible, provided that the mortgage secures amounts (including principal interest and other amounts) used or acquired in connection with the member's principal residence (defined as a home loan facility) regardless of whether the mortgage also secures other obligations. This recognises that most mortgages are "all obligations" in nature, and they secure many different loan types or credit facilities, and that it will not be practical to restrict eligibility to those mortgages that secure only advances used in connection with a member's principal residence.

This is achieved by stipulating two conditions which must be complied with at all times in order to qualify for mortgage diversion:[2](#02)

*   Contributions diverted from the member's KiwiSaver scheme may be applied only to the payment of amounts (including principal, interest, or any other amounts payable) that are owing under the home loan facility secured by the qualifying mortgage (subclause 2).
*   If contributions are diverted to a home loan facility, the member must not be able , without making a specific application to the mortgagee (bank), to access, withdraw, or redraw (as applicable) the amount of any diverted contributions (in whole or in part).

The policy rationale for the words "without making a specific application to the mortgagee (bank)" is to prevent members having an automated ability to withdraw diverted contributions because the purpose of mortgage diversion is to help reduce debt. Therefore, some positive action on the part of a bank employee needs to occur in order to comply with this requirement. If the bank cannot comply with this condition the mortgage securing the loans does not qualify.

This condition strikes a balance between acknowledging that re-financing through the use of a mortgage cannot be realistically prevented, and ensuring that members cannot immediately access diverted contributions.

**Example 1**

John's mortgage secures an instalment (table) loan, an interest only loan, and a non-reducing revolving credit facility with his Bank.

John's mortgage will qualify, provided that:

*   the mortgage is over his principal residence
*   the mortgage secures obligations that arise under the home loan facility
*   the table loan and interest only loan are primarily used or acquired for purposes in connection with the member's principal residence
*   the diverted contributions are applied to the payment of amounts that are owing under the table loan and interest only loan secured by the mortgage
*   John cannot, without making a specific application to the bank, access, withdraw, or redraw the diverted contributions.

The instalment (table) loan and interest only loan satisfy the definition of "home loan facility". The contributions cannot be diverted to the 10% non-reducing revolving credit loan because this type of loan is specifically excluded from the definition of home loan facility.

* * *

**Example 2**

Laura's mortgage is a variable rate mortgage and her bank allows her to re-draw amounts that she has paid over the minimum payment stipulated by her repayment schedule. Laura's mortgage will qualify, provided that:

*   the mortgage is over her principal residence
*   the mortgage secures obligations that arise under the home loan facility
*   the variable rate home loan was primarily used or acquired for purposes in connection with her principal residence. If Laura's variable rate home loan was
*   used to finance the purchase of an investment property, or to finance a business, then the mortgage will not qualify
*   Laura's diverted contributions are applied toward the payment of amounts owing under the variable rate home loan secured by the mortgage
*   Laura's bank can ensure she cannot, without making a specific application to the bank, access the diverted contributions.

* * *

**Example 3**

Amelia has a reducing limit revolving credit facility, where she can repay and draw down funds up to a set limit, but that limit reduces on a regular basis. Amelia's mortgage will qualify, provided that:

*   the mortgage is over her principal residence
*   the mortgage secures obligations that arise under the home loan facility
*   the reducing limit revolving credit facility was primarily used or acquired for purposes in connection with Amelia's principal residence
*   the diverted contributions are applied to the payment of amounts that are owing under the reducing revolving credit facility
*   Amelia cannot, without making a specific application to the bank, access, withdraw or redraw the diverted amount.

* * *

1 A member may divert up to half of the total contribution.

2 This is in addition to the mortgage being over the principal residence and that it secures obligations arising under a home loan facility, whether or not the mortgage also secures other obligations (see regulation 23(1).

IR offers file upload services that give employers, tax agents and payroll intermediaries secure and convenient methods of filing employment information online. The Multi-Payment Option (MPO) account at Inland Revenue allows tax preparers to submit a single payment that must be posted against multiple customers’ accounts. This document provides the detailed specifications for multi-payment option filing through the file upload process through MyIR. This process has been available from mid-2020. 1.1 Caveats Whilst every reasonable attempt has been made to ensure legislation has been correctly interpreted, this document is intended as a technical interface specification only. If you have an enquiry in relation to tax technical matters, please contact us either by: • sending us a secure e-mail through myIR • writing us a letter • calling our employers line on 0800 377 772 between 8:00am and 8:00pm Monday to Friday or 9:00 to 1:00pm Saturday If you need to contact Large Enterprises Services (LES), please phone 0800 443 773 between 8.00am – 4.30pm Monday to Friday only, or 04 916 7118 for overseas calls. Any updates of this specification can be found at the following link: https://www.ird.govt.nz/digital-service-providers/services-catalogue/returns-and- information/payday-filing/payday-filing-through-file-upload-services 1.2 Intended audience This document provides a mechanism for external parties to validate the record formats required by IR for payday filing. 1.3 Supporting information This document is based upon information gathered from; • Payroll Calculations & Business Rules Specification • Payday filing business use cases • IR335 Employers Guide • Inland Revenue’s online PAYE Calculator • IR341 Four-weekly and monthly PAYE deduction tables • IR340 Weekly and fortnightly PAYE deduction tables • KS4 KiwiSaver Employer Guide 1.4 Change A change log will be kept of all changes to this document (see Appendix 4.2) 1.5 Disclaimer The example test files and myIR test screen examples shown were created specifically for this document and are to illustrate what is expected and what will display to customers. Multi-payment Option Schedule Filing File Upload Specification 2021 V1.0 01 April 2020 to 31 March 2021 4 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 2 Electronic Filing Requirements The myIR system enables employers, tax agents, payroll bureaus, payroll intermediaries and others to send electronic information across the internet to our server, which is then transferred into our tax system. The following are requirements for using myIR. 2.1 Operating systems The myIR system is operating system independent. However, a supported browser is required. 2.2 Supported web browsers At the date of publication of this document, the following web browsers are supported for use with myIR: • Apple Safari • Google Chrome • Microsoft Edge • Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 or Newer • Mozilla Firefox If an unsupported browser is detected accessing the site, a message will display advising that some website functionality may not be available, and that IR recommends switching to a supported browser. 2.3 Messages and validations in myIR Transferred files are validated by myIR and the customer informed of any errors. This validation is designed to provide instant turnaround, ensuring customers are provided with an immediate response of any errors. File validation rules include • file format • mandatory (required) data fields • data fields formats e.g. numeric, alpha numeric • data fields maximum lengths Error messages will be displayed using the current myIR format. 2.3.1 Error messages There are a number of error messages that can be received when transferring files to us. The messages will display clear details of the error or issue that has been found. Note: some of the most common issues encountered when uploading a file are the ‘line too long’ and ‘incorrect number of fields’ errors. These errors are usually caused by creating, editing and/or saving a csv file using Excel. Excel will add extra comma(s) to the end of each line when it is saved as a csv file, as it tries to make all lines the same length. This, in effect, adds another column, resulting in the errors. This is not specific to IR files; it’s a feature of Excel in general. To avoid this issue, IR does not recommend opening the file with Excel prior to uploading. If a file needs to be viewed or changed, IR recommends using a programme like Notepad or Notepad++ when opening or changing the file prior to uploading. Multi-payment Option Schedule Filing File Upload Specification 2021 V1.0 01 April 2020 to 31 March 2021 5 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 3 Multi-payment Option Schedule The Multi-Payment Option (MPO) account at Inland Revenue allows tax preparers to submit a single payment that must be posted against multiple customers’ accounts. The schedule must be uploaded through MyIR under the tax preparer’s MPO account. This document defines the file specifications for an accepted payment schedule as well as the processing of the schedule and schedule corrections. 3.1 CSV File Specifications One option to upload a schedule is by creating a CSV file. It must have an extension of “.csv” and must use the pipe delimiter “|”. 3.1.1 Header Record The first record in the file must be the header record which contains information about who is submitting the schedule and the total amount of the schedule. RecordType|IRDNumber|TotalAmount|SubmittedDate Header record field constraints Constraints on the fields are as follows: Field Examples Constraints Record type HDR - Cannot be anything other than “HDR” - This record type cannot appear twice in the file. IRD number 123456789 or 012345678 - Must be 9 digits only (must contain a leading 0 if the IRD number is 8 digits) - The IRD number given must be registered to have an MPO account at IR. Total amount 1000.50 or 1000 or 100.00 - Must be a positive decimal value. - A full stop should be used when the amount includes cents. Otherwise a full stop is not required but would be accepted. - Amounts should not contain commas if greater than 999.99 - The summation of all item records must equal the value of this field. Submitted date 20190820 - Must be a valid date in the format of yyyymmdd - Should be the date that the schedule is submitted to IR. - Dates in the future will not be accepted. 3.1.2 Item Record Each record after the header must be an item record, which contains the schedule information of where the payment to IR should be directed. There can only be one account type listed per record. Name|IRDNumber|AccountType|Period|Amount Item record field constraints Constraints on the fields are as follows: Field Examples Constraints Record type ITM - Cannot be anything other than “ITM” Name John Smith or Smith, John - Cannot be greater than 255 characters - Cannot be blank if IRD number field is blank Multi-payment Option Schedule Filing File Upload Specification 2021 V1.0 01 April 2020 to 31 March 2021 6 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] IRD number 123456789 or 012345678 - Must be 9 digits only (must contain a leading 0 if the IRD number is 8 digits) - Cannot be blank if Name field is blank Account type INC or GST - Must be a 3-character code as listed in the Accepted account types table below Period 20190331 - A period is not required for each record and the field can be left blank. - Some accounts must have a blank period, see the Blank Period required column in the Accepted account types table below. - Must be a valid date in the format of yyyymmdd - The date must be the last day of the month - The date cannot be more than 2 years in the future and no more than 10 years in the past. Amount 1000.50 or 1000 or 100.00 - Must be a positive decimal value. - A full stop should be used when the amount includes cents. Otherwise a full stop is not required but would be accepted. - Amounts should not contain commas if greater than 999.99 If there are any errors with the above fields then the entire CSV file will be rejected, and the customer will be asked to upload the corrected file again. 3.1.3 Accepted Account Types Code Account type Blank period required? AIL Approved Issuer Levy AIP Account Information Provider CRS Common Reporting Standard FAM Working for Families DWT Dividend Withholding Tax FBT Fringe Benefit Tax GMD Gaming Machine Duty GSD Goods Sold in Sat. of Debt GST Goods and Services Tax INC Income Tax KSS KiwiSaver Member X IPS RWT on Interest NRT Non-Resident Withholding Tax PIE Portfolio Investment Entity EMP Employer Activities 1 REB Donation Tax Credit RLT Residential Land Withholding Tax RWT Resident Withholding Tax SLS Student Loan Borrower 1 – Employer activities (EMP) account covers Pay as you earn (PAY), Child Support - Employer (CSE), Student Loan - Employer (SLE), KiwiSaver Employee Deductions (KSE), KiwiSaver Employer Contributions (KSR), and Employer Superannuation Contribution Tax (SSC) Multi-payment Option Schedule Filing File Upload Specification 2021 V1.0 01 April 2020 to 31 March 2021 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 3.2 Additional File Formats A CSV file is not the only option to use when uploading a multi-payment option schedule. A customer has the ability to download an excel spreadsheet of a multi-payment option schedule template from MyIR and manually enter in the records. The fields on this spreadsheet are the same as the CSV file and have similar constraints. The main differences are: • There is no header record on the excel file • The record type field does not exist on the excel file • The IRD number field can include hyphens (eg. 123-456-789). This means that the max length of the field is 11 characters. • The account type field is a drop-down box that matches the list of account types in the Accepted account types table above. The three-character code is not required in this format. • The period field should be in the format of dd/mm/yyyy. 3.3 File Processing As stated above, if any field in the file does not comply with the defined constraints then the entire file will be rejected, and the tax preparer will be asked to resubmit. If the file is loaded successfully, then additional validations will occur on each record to ensure that a matching customer, account type, and filing period can be found in the system. Tax preparers will be able to correct records in error within MyIR. If there are no issues with the multi-payment option schedule, and there exists a payment on the multi-payment option account with an amount that matches the sum of every amount field in the schedule, then the payment will be allocated to each customer that same day. If the payment amount and the schedule amount do not match, then no allocations will be made by the system until the schedule is corrected by the tax preparer. 3.4 Schedule Corrections Once a file has been uploaded to the multi-payment option account in MyIR, the tax preparer will have the ability to edit the schedule before it posts the allocations of the payment. Once a payment has been allocated, the schedule cannot be updated through MyIR. The available schedule correction options are: • Delete an entire schedule • Upload a partial schedule to append to the existing schedule • Add a record to the schedule • Delete a record from the schedule • Edit existing records in the schedule Multi-payment Option Schedule Filing File Upload Specification 2021 V1.0 01 April 2020 to 31 March 2021 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 4 Appendix 4.1 myIR format and layout This section specifies the file format and layout that will be sent through the myIR system. 4.1.1 File format The file format for all myIR file transfer services must be in ASCII comma delimited format with the exception of the Employee Details excel file upload service which must be in the excel file format. 4.1.2 Location The output file must be placed in a directory that is easily accessible from the desktop. Depending on the file size, it can either be placed in a local or a LAN drive. 4.1.3 File naming suggestions There is no standard file naming required. However, for easier identification we suggest the following: • A unique, period-based name. • Inclusion of the type of return to differentiate it from other returns, which may be required to be filed electronically in the future. • A CSV extension for Employment Information • An CSV extension for Employee Details or alternatively an xls or xlsx extension for Employee Details that accepts new and departing employee details. 4.1.4 Compression File compression using the zip compression algorithm is acceptable, provided that the following rules are adhered to: Filing as an intermediary through the Tax preparer tab: • Must be a PAYE Intermediary, Payroll bureau, tax agent, Bookkeeper or Other representative who has Tax preparer tab • The content of any zip file must consist only of uncompressed files, i.e. a compressed file cannot be included within any other zip file. A ‘nested’ zip file cannot be processed and will cause the whole file to be rejected. • Only zip files of the same type. All files within that zip must represent the same file service type. E.g. Zip file cannot contain both Employee details csv file and Employment information csv file. • A zip file must be a single file only. In other words, a multi-part zip file (usually created to span removable media) will be rejected, as the decompression application will fail when trying to process a part file as a whole file. Filing through the employer’s Payroll account > File transfer service (I want to) • A zip file can contain different file types as long as the files are for that same Payroll account. E.g. A zip file can contain both an Employee details csv file and an Employment information csv file where the employer is the same as the Payroll account the file is submitted from. • All zipped files must be complete files. I.e. a zip file must not contain any files where the contents are split across two separate files. • A zip file must be a single file only. In other words, a multi-part zip file (usually created to span removable media) will be rejected, as the decompression application will fail when trying to process a part file as a whole file.

Multinationals to pay fair share of tax
=======================================

**27 June 2018**

New measures to ensure multinational companies pay their fair share of tax will come into force next week.

The Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill tonight passed its third reading in Parliament. Revenue Minister Stuart Nash says it takes effect from 1 July and will considerably improve the integrity of the tax system.

“Companies should ideally pay tax in the right country,” says Mr Nash. “This legislation will ensure that multinationals pay tax based on the actual economic activity they carry out in New Zealand.

“It is not in the interest of New Zealand taxpayers if multinational companies avoid paying taxes here. The changes address the problem of companies operating cross-border and using aggressive tax structuring to reduce the tax they pay.

“Estimates from Inland Revenue are that these measures could result in an extra $200 million of tax revenue each year, once fully phased in. This will contribute to other Government priority areas like health, housing, education and policing.

“Ultimately however this is a matter of fairness – multinationals paying their fair share. Most multinationals operating here pay the tax they should and are compliant. But some adopt base erosion or profit shifting \[BEPS\] strategies to minimise their tax obligations.

“The BEPS strategies distort investment and threaten the integrity of tax systems all over the world. It also means Governments lose out on tax revenue. Unlike smaller domestic companies and individuals, large companies with cross-border structures can exploit opportunities to get around tax rules.

Mr Nash says the BEPS legislation is a first step, and he has asked Inland Revenue officials to work closely with international agencies like the OECD and G20 to consider whether further measures are required.

“These changes enjoy the unanimous support of Parliament and are possible thanks to the work of MPs from all political parties, as well as valuable advice from tax professionals and useful submissions from members of the public.

“We will have a better, fairer tax system as a result of these changes,” Mr Nash said.

The changes will prevent multinationals from using BEPS strategies, including:

*   artificially high interest rates on loans from related parties to shift profits out of New Zealand
*   related-party transactions which are intended to shift profits to offshore group members in a manner that does not reflect the actual economic activities undertaken in New Zealand and offshore
*   hybrid mismatch arrangements that exploit differences between countries' tax rules to achieve an advantageous tax position
*   artificial arrangements to avoid having a taxable presence or a permanent establishment in New Zealand
*   tactics to stymie an Inland Revenue investigation, such as withholding relevant information that is held by an offshore group member.

Te tikanga whakaaetanga matarua (MAP) Mutual agreement procedure (MAP)
======================================================================

What

You're seeking to resolve a dispute concerning the application of a double tax agreement.

Who

A taxpayer affected by a treaty.

New Zealand has 40 double taxation agreements (DTAs), each with an article establishing a mutual agreement procedure (MAP) for resolving difficulties arising out of the application of the particular DTA. New Zealand has 11 tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs) in force which also contain a MAP article, as well as 6 supplementary agreements to these TIEAs which include a MAP article. In addition, the DTAs with Australia and Japan contain arbitration clauses for resolving disputes.

New Zealand's DTAs generally follow the OECD Model Tax Convention (OECD MTC). New Zealand has made no observations or reservations on Article 25 of the OECD MTC which covers the MAP.

Under the MAP article, the competent authorities of the contracting states engage with each other and endeavour to resolve disputes that arise from the way one or both contracting states are interpreting or applying the particular DTA. Article 25 effectively equips the tax administrations with the practical means to ensure that cross-border income earning activity is taxed correctly in accordance with DTAs.

The New Zealand competent authority role falls in the first instance on the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, but in practice is delegated to John Nash (Strategic Advisor, International) who leads on double taxation cases arising from audit/compliance activities, and Carmel Peters (Strategic Policy Advisor) who leads on treaty interpretation issues. These 2 competent authorities work closely together and interact with other divisions of Inland Revenue as needed to resolve MAP cases. The competent authorities act independently of others, forming their own view of issues in dispute.

Our overall aim is to complete MAP cases within 12 months of receiving a request for assistance. The time taken to resolve MAP cases will vary depending largely on the complexity of the matter in dispute.

For the 2021 calendar year, 13 MAP cases were completed, with an average cycle time to completion of 7 months.

For the 2022 calendar year, there were 26 completions, with an average cycle time of 7 months.

For the 2023 calendar year, there were 24 completions, with an average cycle time of 8 months.

Scope of MAP
------------

Our general position is to support the availability of the MAP in a wide range of double taxation cases, including those arising from:

*   transfer pricing adjustments
*   attributing profits to permanent establishments
*   determining residence for individuals and companies
*   withholding taxes deducted incorrectly
*   the application of anti-abuse provisions in DTAs or the general anti-abuse doctrine applicable to the interpretation of DTAs
*   the application of domestic anti-avoidance provisions
*   bona fide taxpayer-initiated foreign adjustments.

The OECD MTC allows for competent authorities to consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for by a particular DTA. Our general approach is to allow taxpayers the benefit of the MAP where possible, so the terms of individual DTAs should be read broadly. If the terms of a DTA are unclear, New Zealand will allow access to the MAP.

Domestic disputes process
-------------------------

Part 4A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 contains the domestic administrative procedures for resolving tax disputes. Taxpayers can initiate the MAP and the domestic disputes process simultaneously. Access to MAP is not limited with respect to matters resolved through the Disputes Review Unit. Requesting assistance to resolve a dispute under the MAP does not preclude any domestic action. A request for assistance under the MAP can be made even if an audit settlement has been agreed domestically.

The competent authority is legally bound to follow a domestic court decision in MAP cases but is willing to enter into dialogue with other competent authorities to explain the New Zealand position in any case where double taxation may have arisen as a consequence.

Suspension of Collection Procedures
-----------------------------------

We apply the same conditions to collection for cases in progress under MAP as we apply to a person pursuing a domestic administrative or judicial remedy. Collection procedures are suspended during the period in which a valid MAP case is proceeding, unless there is a significant risk that the tax in dispute will not be paid.

Filing a MAP request
--------------------

We generally follow the 3-year time limit in the OECD MTC. However, there are variations across our DTA network so please read the relevant DTA article in this regard.

No fees are charged for a MAP request.

We have found that pre-filing conferences produce a well-informed understanding by all concerned of both the substantive and procedural issues that could arise in considering a proposed MAP case. They lead to a more focused approach and a marked reduction in the information required from the taxpayer to initiate the MAP case. Early engagement with 'all cards on the table' is the most effective means to fast-track dispute resolution.

MAP requests should be submitted to:

John Nash  
Strategic Advisor (International)  
Inland Revenue  
PO Box 2198  
Wellington 6140

[\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#60030f0d100514050e144e011514080f12091419200912044e070f16144e0e1a)

In any case where it appears that a MAP request may be inadmissible or not justified, we will write to the competent authority of the other contracting state setting out the reasons why we consider the request to be invalid and invite the other competent authority to provide their views before making a final decision on whether to accept or reject the request.

In an appropriate case, where the relevant DTAs allow, we will engage with other competent authorities to resolve the matter multilaterally. If the relevant treaty network does not provide a mechanism to work multilateral cases, we will engage bilaterally but in a coordinated manner, making use of exchange of information provisions to resolve the matter as efficiently as possible. Other jurisdictions may follow different approaches due to their own legal requirements, so we work to coordinate early with their competent authorities on practical measures that can be taken to consider the case multilaterally.

Information required in a MAP request
-------------------------------------

Taxpayers can facilitate the MAP by ensuring the competent authorities of both contracting states receive complete, accurate and timely information. Depending on what may be determined as a result of a pre-filing conference, the following information should be included in a taxpayer's MAP submission.

| Question | Checklist |
| --- | --- |
| 1   | Name, address and IRD number of the taxpayer. |
| 2   | The provision of the specific article of the DTA which the taxpayer considers is not being applied correctly by either one or both contracting states. |
| 3   | The relevant facts of the case including any documentation substantiating these facts, the period involved and the amounts involved. |
| 4   | An analysis of the issues involved supported by relevant documentation. |
| 5   | Where a request has also been made to the competent authority of the other contracting state, a copy of that submission. |
| 6   | If the issue has been previously dealt with by some other means (such as an advance ruling, advance pricing agreement (APA) or settlement agreement), then a copy of any relevant ruling or agreement. |
| 7   | If the MAP request has been submitted to another authority under another instrument that provides for a mechanism to resolve treaty-related disputes, then a copy of that submission (including all related documentation) unless the content of both MAP submissions are exactly the same. |
| 8   | If the MAP request is 'protective' (that is, submitted to ensure compliance with a time frame provided under the relevant tax treaty but not to be examined until further notification from the taxpayer to do so), then a clear statement to this effect. |
| 9   | A final statement confirming that all information provided in the MAP request is accurate and additional information will be provided in a timely manner if required by the competent authority. |

In multilateral cases, so that competent authorities can discuss and find a resolution, taxpayers should identify the following:

*   details of all associated parties and connected jurisdictions involved in the relevant transactions
*   details of all relevant transactions, including diagrammatical representation where possible
*   details of all treaties that are relevant to the MAP case
*   details of action(s) that create taxation, or the possibility of taxation, not in accordance with such treaties
*   an analysis of the issue(s) to be resolved in all jurisdictions and related documentation (particularly for transfer pricing issues)
*   details of other MAP requests being submitted simultaneously on the same issue
*   details of pending audits, domestic remedies initiated or decisions from such remedies in any of the jurisdictions in connection with the transactions.

Implementation of MAP agreements
--------------------------------

Assessments for additional tax or refunds are processed as soon as possible and generally within 1 month of concluding a MAP case.

Where the correctness of a taxpayer's underlying tax position is disputed under the MAP, the imposition of penalties and interest are not generally deferred until that dispute is resolved. Penalties and interest can only be deferred if the Commissioner's assessment is challenged through either the domestic disputes process in the TAA or the New Zealand courts.

Taxpayers may request multi-year resolution of recurring issues through the MAP. Transfer pricing disputes may be resolved through the conclusion of APAs. Unilateral APAs can be rolled back without restriction for at least 4 income years. If the APA has been made pursuant to a DTA that contains a specific time limit override then there is no restriction on rolling back the agreed transfer pricing methodology.

Downward adjustments, primarily arising from transfer pricing disputes, will only be made after notification to the competent authority of the other contracting state. This is to prevent an outcome that leads to non-taxation of all or part of the adjustment made.

From time to time, agreements are also reached between competent authorities resolving difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of a tax treaty in relation to issues of a general nature which concern or which may concern a category of taxpayers. Provided the competent authority of the other contracting state consents, we will publish such agreements on the Tax treaties section of our Tax Policy website.

Telling us about income
-----------------------

If you receive more than $200 in income with no tax deducted, you'll need to tell us. You do that on an individual tax return - IR3.

The IR3 is used at the end of the tax year to:

*   tell us about all your taxable income
*   claim expenses, such as costs for operating your business or maintaining your rental property
*   calculate your tax assessment so you know how much tax to pay or refund to expect.

| Error | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| No filing exists for <IRD number> and tax code <code> for filing period <date> | If you’re adding an employee in an employment information amendment file you must include a DTI line followed by the DAI with the employee’s details (EIA or EIA2).  <br>  <br>**Example**  <br>  <br>DTI,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  <br>DAI,111111111,Brown John,M,,,20210519,20210602,WK... |
| All DAI records must be preceded by a DTI record | The employment amendment file is missing the DTI record.

Check the amended file is for the right period and pay date and change if required. If the dates are correct, upload an Employment information file instead. |
| You are unable to amend a return for IRD number <field> and filing period with this version of the file | Check if the pay period is missing from the return. Add a pay period using the format CCYYMMDD. For example, 30 May 2021 is entered as 20210530. |
| You are unable to amend to an empty employee IRD number | Make sure there is an IRD number in the DAI line.<br><br>If the employee cannot give you their IRD number enter 000-000-000 in the employee’s IRD number field and update the employee’s tax code to ND (non-notified rate). |

myIR v12 Functional Definition V12 Design Approach \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] INTRODUCTION ANDCONTEXT PURPOSE OF THISPRESENTATION Provide BT LT with an overview of the proposed myIRdesign approach for V12 Show how the design approach relates to and is supported by customer testing and business engagement activities Give an overview of the scope of design work related to the myIRV12 upgrade BACKGROUND Customer testing of myIRV12 started in January 2020 and was followed by an analysis of the expected change impact on critical myIRuser groups. Based on the positive outcome of this analysis a recommendation to proceed with the upgrade was endorsed by the TEWC in July 2020. In endorsing the recommendation and in recognition of the extensive scope of the changes, the TEWC requested that BT proactively engage with customers and the wider organisation to validate design and prepare the user community for the upgrade. Work has begun on a unified plan that integrates the design approach with customer and business engagement activities and supports the change management activities associated with the transition to myIRV12. The high-level plan in this presentation sets out the sequencing of various design tasks and the dependencies between these and different customer testing activities. The presentation includes: Scope of myIRV12 design activities Categorisation of in-scope BFDs as the basis for design and testing Proposed design approach Explanation of the various design and testing activities that will be used (including examples) High-level plan for design, engagement and customer testing \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] V12 BUSINESSFUNCTIONALDEFINITIONS 137 BFDS There have been 137 Business Functional Definitions (BFDs) raised in Stage 4.1.2 to successfully deliver START Version 12. Most of these BFDs focus on conversion of existing site specific functionality from the current Version 11. A small number of BFDs represent new functionality included in Stage 4.1.2 scope or required as part of the deployment of Version 12. The broad categories of site specific code addressed by BFDs: Navigation Landing pages Menu’s and account functionality Intermediary client management Most functionality that customers interact with remains unchanged as a result of the conversion from Version 11 to Version 12. This means that beyond the initial navigational changes – customers won’t experience many changes to the services they are used to. DESIGNAPPROACH The design approach used to deliver the Version 12 changes is based on the evolving myIRDesign Approach developed since Release 4 and further refined in Stage 4.1.1. This design approach (explained on the next slide) helps to bring decisions to the appropriate group earlier in the development cycle. The aim being informed decision making about what’s required, what works for customers, and is sustainable in the myIRplatform. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Design Approach myIRBFD •Define outcome / purpose •Define business and user requirements •Establish common use cases, risks and mitigations myIRScope Recommendation •Determine the optimum set of requirements for the service •Where required prepare scope recommendation •Present scope recommendation to Design Group •Record decision on myIRscope myIR Design Session •Design session to develop first iteration that meets agreed requirements and myIRdesign patterns •If multiple design options are identified then prepare mock-up for review and approval Development •\[Information redacted\] begins development based on first iteration of design •SME reviews development alignment against the agreed design and functionality •First review of content Quality Assurance •Pre-development verified demo (myIR team) •Ensuring these requirements are met: •Content, •Pattern application, •Usability, and •Design. • Development task is verified / rejected based on feedback My IR Design Group - review, escalation, arbitration \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] BFD TESTINGGROUPS The myIRteams has been working with the \[Information redacted\] eService architect for the last three years to realise many of Inland Revenue’s requirements as part of the development of START Version 12. This long term work has provided the opportunity for agreater adoption of out-of-the-box configurable functionality over site specific capability. THEOBJECTIVE to move a greater proportion of myIRservices to out-of-the-box functionality THEBENEFITS provides for a more stable platform, capable of upgrade to future versions with reduced conversion effort. As a result, the myIRteam has prioritised the implementation of out-of-the-box functionality over new site specific build. The 137 BFDs have been categorised into test groups based on the extent to which site specific code can be safely converted to out-of-the-box(OTB): Show & tell – Functions for which V12 OTB meets existing design without any change. There is no planned scope for change - communication to customer and business. Consult– Functions for which V12 OTB meets existing design with minimal configuration/pattern options. There is limited scope for change - communication to customer and business, limited customer testing. Co-refine– Functions for which V12 OTB requires extensive configuration to meet existing design, or V12 design will not match V11 design. Design patterns have been established. There is moderate scope for change. Significant customer testing and business engagement is planned. Co-design– Functions requiring redesign as a result of V12 design. No design patterns have been established. There is moderate scope for change and site specific configuration may be required. Significant customer testing and business engagement is planned. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Version 12 BFD test groups Show & TellConsult Co-RefineCo-Design NoYe s Ye sNo Ye sNo Is out-of-the-box functionality available in V12 to replace site specific component? Is minor design change needed to match V11 capability? Are there established design patterns to support this functionality? Where V12 delivers an equivalent capability to site specific functionality in V11, myIRwill utilise core V12 functions over site specific code. 691140 1 16 System and non-customer functionality New/Site specific to Site specific New/Site specific to out-of-the-box 125+ V12 BFDs (Existing site specific functionality) 12 V12 BFDs (New functionality) \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] myIRV12 Factory 833 SCREENSTOBEUPDATED The majority of functionality in myIRwill be converted through the myIRV12 Factory. Because most features in myIRhave been delivered through configuration rather than site specific code, and because Version 12 does not change the underlying systems myIRrelies to operate it is possible to easily convert these features. This means the 833 screens that need to be converted from Version 11 to Version 12 simply need the ‘new look and feel ’ – defined in the Version 12 Pattern Library – to be applied to them. Despite the apparent simplicity of this change an approach has been established to manage this work. APPROACH The myIRFactory approach has been designed to ensure accurate and successful conversion of existing functionality, identify and minimise the risk of adverse impacts, escalate changes required to V12 design to manage V11 site specific issues. The high-level process for myIRV12 Factory: 1.FAST developer is assigned a screen for conversion, 2.The developer refers to the V12 Pattern library and configures appropriately, 3.myIRSME reviews development as it is assigned, 4.Periodic quality assurance to ensure V12 Pattern Library adherence. Delivery of the myIRV12 Factory conversion has been planned and agreed with FAST to facilitate early customer testing, and stakeholder demonstrations. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] V12 customer testing V11/V12 COMPARATIVETESTING Survey based testing using screenshots of developed functionality, 6 weekly cycle between July 2020 and September 2021, 3 weeks of survey followed by 3 weeks to complete analysis and prepare the report. DESIGNVALIDATION Aligned with the V12 definition and development plan More detailed testing plan will become available as delivery of V12 BFDs progresses Design Validation will utilise differing techniques to collect feedback reflecting the inputs required. This may include such techniques as; Demonstrations, Surveys, Card Sorting, Observational lab testing, and A/B testing.

Less cluttered and clear, simple language” “\[V11\] is a "hunt and peck" look. I'd make more clicks than I needed to find what I wanted. \[V12\] promotes a quick decision on where it is relevant to click” Mobile: “I can see alerts straight away, don't have to look for other links to click to find out info.” “\[V12\] gave the most information at a glance. It also felt closer to social media with the tab layout and more applicable to the majority of present-day users.” “I like the list of alerts/things to do, which allow me to work through them one by one. Also if the alert list is empty, it would clearly indicate that there is nothing to do.” “This is much clearer and cleaner. However the instructions are not time bound. The word "late" is used but what date is late? Late is subjective.” "Does not seem like every task I need is available” Z Annual individual 27% 80% preferred V12 “There is a lot of info that doesn’t require my attention” “Not convinced having to scroll so far down is good, so much more to read to find what you are after” “...different coloured font so the user knows they need to complete an action.” “The lack of difference in colour that \[V12\] had makes things seem less important. If I were in a hurry I might skim read these items quickly and think they are optional things I can worry about later.” “You can see there is an alert/s by the colour dot. The overall whole page view is good and easy to see. I wonder if I would notice that they were alerts though? But you get a good view of what you need to do. “It would be much easier if the screen default was set on Alerts, then I would see what I needed to do and could click on Summary for other when necessary.” “This option is better in that it tells you why it is important to read the new message. But, I didn't notice the 'Alerts' tab on the first screenshot. That may have been because it is an unfamiliar layout, but it may also be that it needs to be more prominent.” “The first page clearly suggests action needs to be taken under the alerts section, but it's not completely clear on that action until you select the actions tab.” “better than \[V11\], but does not show what the due payment is for or when it was due.” “I feel it has been broken down into bite size information that I can process.” “It is immediately apparent what needs to be done. There are 3 tasks to complete, and it is straight forward as to which accounts those tasks are for.” “The alerts and my immediate obligations are very easy to see, but I had to look hard to see where to click if I really wish to do something else first.” Simplifies how customers determine what they need to do Most customers liked the simplicity of the alert tiles in V12. They felt that it enabled them to quickly assess what needed attention on their account and what they needed to do. Since they were given more relevant information up front, they were able to decide whether they needed to perform an action or dismiss the notification with less clicks. Not immediately clear where to go Some customers found they would not have thought to click on the alerts tab as their first port of call. They felt the alerts tab wasn’t sufficiently highlighted to signify its importance and therefore they may have missed some of the notifications or deemed them unimportant. Note this was mainly due to familiarity with V11 and customers noted they would need to get used to going to the alerts screen when they first log in. 21 How required tasks are presented to the customer, and how the customer recognises that an action is required. Customers were presented a V12 landing page and notifications centre; and a V11 landing page and account page. Both displayedoutstanding notifications/alerts. They were then asked choose which option they felt gave them a clearer understanding of what actions needed to completed. customers 281 Difficult to determine importance of alerts Some customers felt there was no indication of a hierarchy of alerts and therefore the importance of the notifications was difficult to determine. They thought the alerts screen needed to highlight the most important notifications or display a clear hierarchy such as order of due date so that they could quickly identify and perform the most important actions first. They also suggested adding or highlighting due dates and the relevant period would help in assessing the priority.

Looks easier to navigate” “The subheadings and organisation of \[V12\] make it easier to skim through to find what I need.” ‘“Much easier than \[V11\]. I like how the list is ordered by categories, I don't need to scan the whole list, I first scan the headings, find the appropriate one (register, apply and enrol), then just scan through those.” “I would not want to do this on my phone. It would have to be done on a PC as you have so much too choose from.” “There are so many things that a user might want to do that to put every action in one place just looks messy. It is quite easy to miss a link as you read the page as it is so full of clutter.” Z Annual individual 27% 79% preferred V12 “No summaries of the headings are provided. People who don't use the system often, such as those that might be using a mobile device to access it, will find it more difficult to find exactly what they were looking for” “\[V12\] assumes I would know what the links mean or that I am happy to click a link, discover that it was not what I wanted and to go back to previous page.” “The “I want to” is hidden on the front page.” “I had to go back and see where the “I want to" icon was.” “The 'I want to' option on the first page is not particularly obvious at first glance.” “...the search bar assures me that I don't have to wade through the list to find what I want.” “The search bar stood out more...” “I like the search area in V12. I just went back and see V11 does have a search area, but I didn't see it” “"I want to..." doesn't stand out” “I like the lens for the search field.” “...the sample of actions is helpful as it gives you a clue as to what sort of things are there whereas \[V12\] has none of those visible” “...but no indication of what each heading relates to - may require a bit of "seek & find" before getting to the right one.” “Obvious headings and subheadings. Makes it easier to sort out what needs to be done” “Far easier to find what you are looking for, as the options and section headers are organised properly.” “I like the placement \[of the\] search option which is easier to see and use.” “The light grey has a tendency to blend in and not be as easy to spot” “The i want to button isn't obvious Customers preferred the layout and categorisation of V12’s ‘I want to’ menu​ Across all user types and devices, customers preferred the layout of the V12 ‘I want to’ screen. They felt the display was clean and modern, and that finding actions would be easier. Many respondents noted that the subheadings/groupings of the ‘I want to’ menu were much more helpful in V12, allowing them to quickly scan and find the action they required. V12’s search option was more noticeable While both V11 and V12 provide a field for searching the ‘I want to’ menu, customers found the V12 version better drew their attention and was more easily recognisable as a search box. ‘I want to’ tab not prominent Some users found that the ‘I want to’ tab on V12 was not prominent enough. This was often combined with the misconception that V12 had less options available as V11 displays a selection of ‘I want to’ options on the landing page. Customers familiar with V11 would need to get used to accessing all ‘I want to’ options from that tab. 22 Findability, layout and usability of the ‘I want to’ menu. Customers were presented with both the V11 and V12 landing & customer level ‘I want to’ screens. They were asked to choose whichoption they felt provided a better way to find actions that they want to complete. Social Policy 71% preferred V12 30% customers 280 “Although there is the same detail on the page, it is broken into sections which makes it more digestible and less daunting.” “I like that subheadings are used to organise the actions and this would no doubt make it easier to find the action I am looking for.” 49.6% PC view 50.4% Mobile view 75% preferred V12 Mobile ‘I want to’ list more difficult Some customers felt that the ‘I want to’ would be difficult to navigate on mobile due to the long list to scroll through. This was made more difficult by the lack of descriptions for actions when viewed on mobile. Therefore they felt that there needed to be a balance between being able to identify and understand actions without having to read a large amount of text.

On a mobile app it will help to respond faster when you are asked things while out of the office.” “Much cleaner interface, easier to work with/type etc” “Easier and more consistent with other websites” “...too much text, making things look cluttered and therefore complicated.” Simpler, more streamlined mobile experience Most customers preferred the mobile experience of V12 as they found the display simpler and less overwhelming. This meant they could quickly identify relevant information about their accounts and see a clear path when needing to complete an objective. They felt V12’s display fit better on a mobile screen and due to it providing an account ‘snapshot’, made it easier for customers to read the page details and assess what actions they might need to perform without needing to log on to myIRthrough their PC. Consistent with other websites and web standards Some customers felt V12 had a more ‘modern’ approach which matched other modern-day websites. This gave them confidence they would easily learn to navigate through myIRwhen using their mobile device. Too much unnecessary information which results in excessive scrolling At times customers felt that pages still had too much information that was irrelevant to them. When viewed on a mobile this resulted in too much scrolling to find what they were after. Optimisation 23 Due to the increase in mobile usage, we need to focus on maximising the user experience on smaller screens. Customers were presented with a mobile view of each other task in the cycle (Calls to action, Action selection & Logon Settings)and asked to provide their feedback for each. After viewing and completing each task, they asked about their overall perception of the mobileexperience.

They felt that the options displayed under ‘Manage my profile’ is more in line with what they would expect to see. This meant they were able to find what they were looking for with less clicks. ‘Manage my profile’ could be more prominent on the landing page. Some customers felt the ‘Manage my profile’ link was not immediately obvious and could possibly be missed. It was suggested it needed to be more prominent. Some expected options not included A few customers thought there were some options missing that they would expect to see on the ‘Manage my profile’ page.

Nail your tax
=============

**14 March 2023**

Inland Revenue has launched a campaign to encourage tradies to get their tax back on track.

The construction industry is crucial to New Zealand’s economy and continues to grow. Inland Revenue spokesperson Richard Philp says that puts more pressure on the construction sector.

“We know businesses in the construction sector have struggled with increases in the cost and availability of materials, supply chain constraints and labour shortages over the last few years,” Richard Philp says.

“They’ve also been dealing with the pressures of running their businesses through the pandemic and the aftermath of recent cyclones.

“Despite these struggles the sector has continued to grow, fuelled mainly by large infrastructure and ‘shovel ready’ projects, free apprenticeships and trades training and an ongoing focus on housing stocks, particularly new builds.

“We also know around 50,000 customers within the construction industry have at least one outstanding return and/or some form of debt to Inland Revenue. So, we’ve developed a ‘toolbox’ – a one-stop-shop to help tradies get their tax affairs in order.

“Our data shows that under-declaring income, often via cash jobs, is prevalent in the construction sector. Some people actively avoid their tax obligations, while others may be simply struggling to keep up with the day-to-day grind.

“We’ve put appropriate resources and tools in an accessible, online format – the Tax Toolbox website – [www.ird.govt.nz/the-tax-toolbox](https://www.ird.govt.nz/the-tax-toolbox)
 .

![Construction sector campaign](/-/media/project/ir/home/media-releases/2023/construction-campaign-bespoke-1-resized.jpg?modified=20230312220716)

“Through the Tax Toolbox we encourage tradies to watch pre-recorded seminars, book a business advisory visit with us, or to talk to a tax agent.

“We also present core tax topics in a simple way, with links to more information on record keeping, expenses, income tax, GST, and employer obligations. We also encourage customers to make voluntary disclosures if they realise they’ve made any errors or forgotten any details off past tax returns.”

Richard Philp says the construction sector needs this help now.

“The construction sector has the highest amount of tax debt and customers in liquidation. It is also the most commonly reported industry through Inland Revenue’s anonymous information channel which shows the level of concern within the community.

“We want to help. So, there’ll be video, social, and online advertising directing tradies to the Tax Toolbox, along with in-store promotions at trade hardware stores, to help tradies nail their tax.”

API ingoa Name API
==================

The name API enables the creating, updating and deleting of the customer's names. It is 1 of 8 APIs that, together, make up the customer services suite.

[How customer services work](/digital-service-providers/services-catalogue/customer-and-account/customer-services-suite/how-customer-services-work)
 

How the name API works
----------------------

The name API requires the customer API to be integrated.

The name API enables the preferred name and trading name of a customer to be added, updated and deleted. It requires either:

*   the customer ID for the addition of a name
*   a name ID for the update or deletion of a name.

The name ID is available through a call to the customer API. The name API does not allow any access to the legal name of a customer.

The name API can only be used by:

*   the customer the data is associated to
*   a user with delegated access
*   an intermediary who’s linked to the customer.

The name API enables the above users to update Inland Revenue’s customer data from their native systems, and to avoid the use of manually facilitated channels.

| API operation | API path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | /name | Adds a name of a given type (preferred or trading) to the customer data set. |
| PUT | /name | Updates the details of an existing name in the customer data set. |
| DELETE | /name | Deletes a given name from the customer data set. |

Name API business use cases
---------------------------

The following are examples of how to use the name API to achieve specific business outcomes. The sequence of operations, the order in which they should be called, is indicated in the column of each operation.

| Number | Use case | POST /name | PUT /name | DELETE /name | Dependencies |

UNCLASSIFIED DETERMINATION > LIVESTOCK> NATIONAL AVERAGE MARKET VALUE National Average Market Values of Specified Livestock Determination 2024 Issued: 24 May 2024 NAMV 2024 NAMV 2024 | 24 May 2024 Page 1 of 5 Note to this determination This note does not form part of the national average market values of specified livestock determination 2024 (the determination) but is produced to aid Inland Revenue staff, taxpayers and their agents in their understanding of how the values contained in the determination are arrived at and how they should be used. Section EC 15 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (the Act) requires that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) make a determination declaring the national average market values (NAMV) for an income year for each class of specified livestock set out in Schedule 17 of the Act. Historically, this determination has been published in May each year. NAMVs are declared for an income year and used by taxpayers, that are in the business of livestock farming, to value any specified livestock that they have on hand where the taxpayer has elected to use the herd scheme to value that livestock in the income year. As the name of this determination suggests, NAMVs provide the national average market value for the specified livestock classes. They may therefore not always reflect the market value of the livestock of a particular taxpayer, or even of a particular region. Because of this, the values are not intended to be used for any other purpose than that for which they are produced; valuing livestock of taxpayers who have elected to value their livestock under the herd scheme in the income year for which the determination relates. To ascertain the national average market value of the various classes of livestock the Commissioner contracts with highly experienced livestock valuers situated throughout the country. 1 Each valuer is asked to provide the market value of the various specified livestock classes located in a specified region. There is generally more than one valuer contracted for each region. The market valuations required are for “good quality on-farm animals (capital stock) on 30th April”. From these values the CIR then calculates the national average market value for each livestock class. In the case of the sheep, beef, dairy cattle and deer (red, wapiti and elk) classes a weighted average is used against the values produced by each valuer. weighted average is calculated based on total livestock numbers for a type of livestock in a particular region compared to the national herd numbers for that type of livestock. 2 Because of their comparatively low numbers, a straight average is used for the remaining livestock types 1 Thirty-eight valuations were obtained for the 2024 determination. 2 Numbers are based on data collated by Statistics New Zealand. NAMV 2024 | 24 May 2024 Page 2 of 5 (except “other deer”). The value of “other deer” is taken as the mid-point between the “trophy market” values and the “meat market” values. National Average Market Values of Specified Livestock Determination 2024 This determination may be cited as “The National Average Market Values of Specified Livestock Determination, 2024”. This determination is made in terms of section EC 15 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and shall apply to specified livestock on hand at the end of the 2023-2024 income year. For the purposes of section EC 15 of the Income Tax Act 2007 the national average market values of specified livestock, for the 2023-2024 income year, are as set out in the following table.

ANNEX IV NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS: Second Protocol to the Agreement between New Zealand and the Republic of Austria with respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital 1.Executive summary 1.1On 12 September 2023 New Zealand signed the Second Protocol to the Agreement between New Zealand and the Republic of Austria with respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital (the Protocol). 1.2The Protocol is an amendment to New Zealand’s double tax agreement (DTA) with Austria, the Agreement between New Zealand and the Republic of Austria with respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital, and its first Protocol, signed in Vienna on 21 September 2006 (collectively, the Existing DTA). 1.3The Existing DTA is one of 40 New Zealand DTAs currently in force. DTAs are bilateral international treaties that are intended to encourage growth in economic ties between countries. They reduce or eliminate double taxation and other tax impediments to cross-border economic activity. In addition, DTAs ease some of the compliance costs and cash flow implications of such activity. They also provide a framework for greater certainty for businesses to make investment, and other cross-border decisions. 1.4New Zealand engaged in Protocol negotiations with Austria to honour a most-favoured nation (MFN) obligation in the Existing DTA relating to withholding tax rates on investment income. Under the MFN obligation, New Zealand was required to enter into negotiations with Austria with a view to providing lower withholding rates on such income. 1.5The Austrian MFN obligation was triggered back in 2010 when New Zealand agreed to reduce withholding rates with Australia and the United States. Since then, similar reductions have also been agreed in DTAs with Japan, Canada, Hong Kong and Singapore. 1.6The background to these developments is that New Zealand, being a net capital importer, has historically kept DTA withholding tax rates high relative to the standards A. 15A ANNEX IV of other countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). With dividends, however, the 15% withholding rate was offset by allowing tax credits for dividends paid out of fully taxed company profits (“fully imputed dividends”). In 2010, this regime was replaced for most fully imputed dividends by reducing our domestic withholding tax to 0%. 1.7 This followed a reduction in withholding rates in the DTAs mentioned above. Locking in lower DTA withholding rates provides foreign investors from these countries with greater certainty and secures reciprocity for New Zealand investors making foreign direct investments in those countries. 1.8 The withholding tax rate reduction agreed in the Protocol is that for dividends paid to an Austrian company that owns a substantial holding (at least 10%) in a New Zealand company (and vice-versa), and provided other conditions are met, the withholding tax rate will be reduced from 15% to either 5% or 0%. In all other cases the withholding rate of 15% on dividends in the Existing DTA will continue to apply. 1.9 The Protocol is not of itself expected to give rise to significant economic benefits of a general nature since Austria is not currently a key trading or investment partner. However, it is relevant to existing, substantial investment by Austria in the oil and gas exploration sector in New Zealand. 1.10 Another aspect of the Protocol relates to New Zealand’s broader international relations. It confirms that New Zealand will honour its international commitments that arise when MFN obligations are triggered – which happens from time to time. 1.11 The Protocol is not expected to give rise to material fiscal costs. This is because a 0% rate already applies under domestic law to fully imputed dividends paid to a non- resident shareholder with a substantial holding of at least 10%. The Protocol would therefore only reduce rates for unimputed or partially imputed dividends, which will only arise in limited circumstances. Also, there was no change to the Existing DTA in respect of the withholding tax on royalties and interest. 1.12 In addition to negotiating the new withholding tax rates during the Protocol negotiations with Austria, the opportunity was also taken to update the Existing DTA in several other respects. One of those extra updates was to insert a package of new international model ANNEX IV anti-treaty abuse provisions that have been developed as part of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) work undertaken by the OECD. These BEPS provisions are progressively being rolled out across New Zealand’s DTAs. Their inclusion in the Existing DTA will help ensure that the DTA is not used to reduce taxation in unintended ways. 1.13 The Protocol will also insert into the Existing DTA a new Assistance in the Collection of Taxes Article, which will enable the two sides to request administrative assistance from each other in the collection of taxes in default. New Zealand now seeks the inclusion of this Article in all DTA negotiations. 1.14 Further, the Protocol will narrow the scope of the MFN obligation going forward so that it only applies in respect of New Zealand’s DTAs with other European Union countries, rather than with other OECD countries. The other updates made by the Protocol are generally of a minor or administrative nature and for the most part will not affect taxpayers. 2. Nature and timing of the proposed treaty action 2.1 The Protocol was signed in Vienna on 12 September 2023, in the English and German languages, with both texts being equally authentic. In the case of divergence, the English text prevails. In accordance with the entry into force procedures specified in Article XVII of the Protocol, the date of entry into force will be the date of the later of the two diplomatic notes that will be exchanged. The Protocol will amend the Existing DTA once it enters into force. It is anticipated that this would occur in early February 2023. 2.2 The remaining preliminary steps required for New Zealand to be in a position to exchange diplomatic notes are (i) Parliamentary treaty examination of the Protocol and of this National Interest Analysis, under Standing Order 405, and (ii) giving the Protocol the force of law in New Zealand, which can be achieved by means of an Order in Council made under section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 2.3 As for the Existing DTA, and for DTAs generally, the Protocol will not apply to the Cook Islands, Niue, or Tokelau. ANNEX IV 3. Reasons for New Zealand becoming party to the treaty General background 3.1 DTAs are bilateral international treaties that establish a framework for cooperation on tax matters between the treaty partners, with a view to reducing tax impediments to, and thereby helping to stimulate, increased trade, investment and other cross-border economic activity. The framework includes allocating taxing rights according to agreed international principles, mechanisms for reducing or eliminating double taxation, and an agreed reciprocal reduction of withholding taxes on investment returns. 3.2 The allocation of taxing rights and reduction of withholding tax rates means that New Zealand loses the ability to impose some tax that it otherwise could, and DTAs therefore reduce tax revenue. However, this reduction is offset by the reciprocal reduction of taxing rights over New Zealand residents in the treaty partner country, reducing the need for New Zealand to allow foreign tax credits. 3.3 Whether the net effect on tax revenue is an increase or decrease under this offset depends on flows of trade and investment. However, the main objective is for a DTA to foster wider indirect benefits, particularly in the form of increased trade, investment and other economic benefits, but on occasion also taking into account broader foreign policy considerations. 3.4 New Zealand began entering into DTAs in 1947, and currently has a network of 40 DTAs in force. This includes the Existing DTA with Austria signed in 2006. DTAs can be updated, either by means of an amending protocol or by renegotiating the entire DTA. Honouring the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) Obligation 3.5 The main reason for agreeing the Protocol is to satisfy an MFN obligation applying to New Zealand in the Existing DTA. The MFN obligation provides that if New Zealand concludes a subsequent DTA with an OECD member country with withholding rates on dividends, interest or royalties that is less than the rates in the Existing DTA then New Zealand must negotiate with Austria - with a view to providing reduced rates to Austria. The primary focus of these negotiations was on the reduction of the withholding rate of 15% on dividends. ANNEX IV 3.6 The OECD Model Tax Convention (OECD Model) provides an international blueprint for DTAs. The general dividend withholding rate proposed in the OECD Model is 15% but is lowered to 5% for dividends paid to a company directly holding at least 25% of the shares in the company paying the dividends. Prior to 2010, New Zealand did not have a DTA with withholding rates for dividends below 15%. To maintain the 15% rate, New Zealand sometimes agreed to include MFN obligations in its DTAs. The MFN obligation was included in the Existing DTA for this reason. 3.7 Since 2010, New Zealand has reduced its withholding rates on dividends and royalties with significant economic partners. New DTAs with Australia and the United States triggered the MFN obligation in the Existing DTA. DTAs entered into since then include Canada, Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong – albeit with a range of different negotiated outcomes depending on country preferences. 3.8 Austria is not a key trade and investment partner for New Zealand at present. Applying the new DTA policy to Austria is therefore unlikely to give rise to significant economic benefits for New Zealand. However, there is a substantial Austrian investment in the oil and gas sector in New Zealand. 3.9 Negotiations with Austria were prioritised, at Austria’s request, to satisfy the MFN obligation that was triggered in 2010. Reducing the withholding rates in the Existing DTA is therefore a necessary consequence of agreeing the new low rates in DTAs with more significant economic partners. 3.10 Honouring the MFN obligation will enhance New Zealand’s credibility in future DTA negotiations as a country that honours its international commitments. It will also support bilateral relations with Austria and will reflect well on New Zealand’s general international reputation. This is particularly relevant at a time when New Zealand is seeking to expand its network of free trade agreements, which often include MFN clauses. New Zealand’s DTA policy on withholding tax on dividends 3.11 New Zealand’s DTA policy on lowering withholding tax rates on dividends occurred in conjunction with changes made to its domestic tax settings. ANNEX IV 3.12 Taxing dividends can result in double taxation because the company paying the dividend may have already paid income tax on its profits. New Zealand operates an imputation system, whereby companies receive imputation credits for tax paid at the company level. Companies can then attach imputation credits to dividends that they distribute, offsetting or reducing tax paid at the shareholder level. Fully imputed dividends are dividends paid out of profits that have been fully taxed at the company level. Withholding tax on dividends, particularly fully imputed dividends, can deter foreign investment and raise the cost of importing capital for New Zealand businesses. Due to concerns over difficulties in attracting foreign investment, in 2010, New Zealand reduced its domestic rate of non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) to 0% on fully imputed dividends from ‘direct’ investment, replacing the former tax credit regime for such investments. (Direct investment is where the shareholder owns at least 10% of the company paying the dividends.) 3.13 Around the same time, New Zealand renegotiated its treaties with its major trading partners, starting with the United States and Australia. The 15% dividend withholding rate was reduced to 5% or 0% in those treaties, provided certain conditions were met (for example, the shareholder must own a certain percentage of the company paying the dividend). The reduced dividend withholding rates had the following implications: 3.13.1 Reciprocity for New Zealanders investing offshore. As DTAs are bilateral, a reduced DTA withholding rate allows New Zealanders investing offshore to enjoy lower withholding rates in the other country. This also benefits New Zealand as it allows New Zealand to tax foreign dividends earned by New Zealand resident companies without having to provide tax credit for foreign tax paid in the other country. 3.13.2 Unimputed dividends. Under New Zealand’s domestic law, NRWT continues to be imposed on unimputed dividends. But the reduced dividend withholding rates in DTAs do not require dividends to be fully imputed. Unimputed dividends can arise in legitimate circumstances. For example, the dividends may be paid out of untaxed capital gains instead of fully taxed profits, or a change in shareholding may cause the company to lose all its imputation credits. New Zealand also has a broad definition of ‘dividend’ which can also include some returns of original share capital. The risk of withholding tax in such ANNEX IV circumstances can affect a foreign investor’s willingness to invest in New Zealand, so reduced DTA withholding rates may therefore increase investment into New Zealand. 3.13.3 Certainty. A reduced rate in a DTA also gives investors greater certainty as the rates cannot be raised without renegotiating the DTA. 3.14 Reducing the dividend withholding rate in a DTA to zero can have disadvantages. It means that withholding tax is not imposed where the lack of any underlying tax results from an unintended loophole in New Zealand’s domestic law. The increase in anti- avoidance rules following the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project described below provides some additional protection to address this concern. Inserting new BEPS model treaty provisions 3.15 The Protocol also includes model treaty provisions, which arose from the OECD’s BEPS project after the Existing DTA was concluded. The model provisions include anti-abuse rules to protect states against abusive practices such as treaty shopping and certain artificial arrangements. Since anti-abuse rules can reduce the certainty of tax treatment that DTAs are intended to give taxpayers, there are also model provisions to bolster DTA dispute resolution mechanisms. 3.16 Some of the new model provisions are ‘minimum standards’ which are mandatory for all jurisdictions committed to BEPS (which both New Zealand and Austria are). The OECD is leading an international peer review process that monitors countries’ compliance with those minimum standards. Other model provisions are recommended as ‘best practice’ but are not mandatory. 3.17 New Zealand’s DTAs are being updated to include BEPS model provisions through an overriding multilateral treaty, the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS (the MLI). However, the MLI will not update the Existing DTA as Austria did not nominate for it to be covered by the MLI, because of the MFN obligation. For this reason, the bilateral negotiations with Austria provided an opportunity to agree the specific BEPS model provisions to be included in the Existing DTA. Including the BEPS provisions through bilateral negotiations can be preferred as ANNEX IV it allows countries to carefully consider which of the non-mandatory rules would be most appropriate to the particular bilateral setting. 4. Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the Protocol entering into force and not entering into force for New Zealand Advantages of the treaty entering into force 4.1 The main advantage to New Zealand of the Protocol entering into force is that it would demonstrate that New Zealand is a country that honours its international obligations. There are other advantages of the Protocol entering into force, such as the advantages associated with reduced dividend withholding rates and updating the Existing DTA for BEPS and other changes. 4.2 The advantages to New Zealand can be summarised as follows: 4.2.1 Honouring international obligations. The Protocol with Austria will enable New Zealand to honour its MFN obligation in the Existing DTA, enhancing New Zealand’s credibility in future DTA negotiations as a country that honours its international commitments. Honouring its MFN commitments will also support positive bilateral relations with Austria and will reflect well on New Zealand’s general international reputation. The Protocol will also narrow the scope of the MFN obligation going forward so that it only applies in respect of New Zealand’s DTAs with other European Union countries, rather than with other OECD countries. 4.2.2 Reciprocity for New Zealanders investing in Austria. The key change in the Protocol is a reciprocal reduction in dividend withholding tax rates. Since New Zealand’s domestic withholding rate on most fully imputed dividends is already 0%, the DTA reduction benefits New Zealanders investing in Austria by allowing them to enjoy lower dividend withholding rates in Austria. The reciprocal reduction also benefits New Zealand by reducing the need to give foreign tax credits to such investors for Austrian tax paid. However, Austria is not a major economic partner for New Zealand and so these may not be significant benefits in practice. ANNEX IV 4.2.3 BEPS provisions. The inclusion of the new BEPS model anti-abuse provisions will strengthen New Zealand’s ability to counter treaty abuse and protect its tax base. In addition, it will position New Zealand well for facing international peer review of the BEPS minimum standards, as the Existing DTA will be fully compliant with the internationally imposed standards. 4.2.4 Other minor changes. The remaining changes made to the Existing DTA will collectively provide various marginal benefits. Of these, the inclusion of an Assistance in Collection provision is likely to prove the most advantageous, as it will improve Inland Revenue’s ability to recover unpaid tax debt from taxpayers who have migrated to Austria. Disadvantages of the treaty entering into force 4.3 The main disadvantage for New Zealand of the Protocol entering into force will be any fiscal cost arising from the reduced dividend withholding tax rates (see section 8 below). As noted above at paragraph \[3.12\], the domestic rate of NRWT is already 0% for fully imputed dividends from direct investment, so the Protocol would only reduce rates for unimputed dividends. The fiscal cost of the Protocol is therefore not expected to be significant. 4.4 There may also be a perceived disadvantage of the Protocol entering into force, as the only substantial investment between Austria and New Zealand is an Austrian investment into the oil and gas sector in New Zealand. The Austrian investor in that New Zealand petroleum miner will benefit from the reduced withholding rate in the Protocol for the foreseeable future, but only to the extent those dividends are not fully imputed (because New Zealand company tax has not been paid on the profits). 4.5 Given the Government’s current commitment to reduce New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions, this change to the Existing Treaty could be perceived as a disadvantage. However, the Protocol (and tax treaties generally) does not give entities in any sector benefits not available generally. The benefits in the Protocol are also available to Austrian investments in other sectors. For this reason, this change does not give any preferential treatment to the oil and gas sector. ANNEX IV 4.6 Inland Revenue may incur some additional administrative costs as a result of certain provisions in the Protocol. As explained below at paragraphs \[8.6.2\], these are expected to be minor. Advantages of the treaty not entering into force 4.7 It is an option not to bring the Protocol with Austria into force. In that case, the disadvantages identified above will not arise. Disadvantages of the treaty not entering into force 4.8 If the Protocol is not brought into force, New Zealand will fail to honour the MFN commitment it made to Austria in the Existing DTA. This would likely have negative repercussions for New Zealand’s international relations, both in terms of our bilateral relationship with Austria and our international reputation more generally. It may impact on New Zealand’s credibility in future treaty negotiations. 4.9 Without the Protocol, it is unlikely that the BEPS provisions could be incorporated into the Existing DTA in the short term. 4.10 Furthermore, the other advantages discussed above would not be secured. 5. Legal obligations which would be imposed on New Zealand by the treaty action, the position in respect of reservations to the treaty, and an outline of any dispute settlement mechanisms Overview of key legal obligations 5.1 DTAs do not impose requirements on taxpayers. The obligations DTAs impose only apply to the respective Governments. The principal changes to the obligations that will be imposed on New Zealand by the Protocol can be grouped as follows: 5.1.1 Reduced withholding tax rates on dividends. This is the main purpose of the Protocol and was triggered by the MFN obligation in the Existing DTA. 5.1.2 Inclusion of BEPS minimum standard provisions. Minimum standards are mandatory for all jurisdictions committed to BEPS, including New Zealand. ANNEX IV New Zealand is subject to an OECD peer review process under which our compliance with those minimum standards is monitored. 5.1.3 Inclusion of some BEPS ‘best practice’ provisions. The OECD’s ‘best practice’ provisions are not subject to peer review. A country may, however, request feedback from peers on how it has adopted best practices. 5.1.4 Other changes. The Protocol contains several other changes to update the Existing DTA as agreed. Reduced dividend withholding rates 5.2 Article VIII reduces withholding tax rates on dividends. The dividend withholding tax rate in the Existing DTA is 15%. 5.3 Under the Protocol, the dividend withholding rate would be: 5.3.1 0%, if the beneficial owner of the dividend is a company that owns, directly or indirectly, at least 80% of the company paying the dividend for at least 12 months before the dividend is declared, or 5.3.2 5%, if the company receiving the dividend directly owns at least 10% of the company paying the dividend for a period of at least 365 days that includes the date the dividend is paid, or 5.3.3 15% in all other cases. 5.4 To qualify for the 0% dividend withholding rate, certain additional requirements must be met. These are generally intended to ensure that the company paying the dividend is owned directly or indirectly by a listed company, or through a chain of companies where each company in the chain is entitled to a 0% rate under a DTA. If the requirements cannot be met, New Zealand and Austria’s competent authorities 1 may agree to allow a 0% rate as long as the arrangement is not considered abusive. BEPS minimum standards 1 New Zealand’s competent authority is the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or an authorised representative. Austria’s competent authority is the Federal Minister of Finance or an authorised representative. ANNEX IV 5.5 The Protocol would incorporate the following BEPS minimum standards: 5.5.1 Preamble. The preamble of the Existing DTA will be updated to include an explicit reference to ‘the prevention of tax evasion and avoidance’, to ensure that courts are able to take this purpose into account in interpreting the DTA. The Protocol will also update the title of the Existing DTA to reflect this change, although this is not actually required as a BEPS change. 5.5.2 Entitlement to Benefits. Article XV of the Protocol will insert a new Article in the Existing DTA, which will include in particular, a ‘principal purpose test’. The test can deny a treaty benefit if one of the principal purposes of an arrangement is to obtain that benefit, unless the granting of that benefit in the circumstances is in accordance with the object and purpose of the DTA. 5.5.3 Notification of MAP cases. Article XVI of the Protocol would amend paragraph 11 of the current protocol to the Existing DTA. The change would require the competent authorities of each State to notify the other if a taxpayer submits a case to it under Article 24(1) (Mutual Agreement Procedure) but the competent authority decides the case is not justified. BEPS ‘best practice’ provisions 5.6 The Protocol includes a range of best practice measures to protect against specific treaty abuse problems, including: 5.6.1 Confirming residence taxing rights. The Protocol would insert an explicit provision in Article 1 (Persons Covered) of the Existing DTA to clarify that, except in specified circumstances, a DTA cannot be construed as restricting the right of a State to tax its own residents. 5.6.2 Dual resident tiebreaker. The Existing DTA contains tiebreaker tests for establishing residence where a taxpayer is dual resident (that is, resident in both States under each State’s domestic laws). The update provides that, if it is unclear how the tiebreaker should be resolved in the case of a non-individual, treaty benefits will be denied unless the competent authorities of the States agree otherwise. ANNEX IV 5.6.3 Alienation of Property. Under the Existing DTA, the State in which land and other immovable property is situated (the source State) has the primary taxing right to gains from the sale of that property. Gains from the sale of shares, however, are only taxable in the State in which the seller is resident (the residence State). To prevent taxpayers from defeating a source State’s taxing rights by selling shares in a land-rich company instead of the land itself, the Existing DTA contains an anti-avoidance ‘land rich company’ rule in Article 13 (Alienation of Property). The update extends this principle to interests comparable to shares such as interests in a partnership or trust. It also inserts a holding period to ensure the provision would capture the sale of interests in an entity that was land-rich at any time during the 365 days preceding the sale. 5.6.4 Permanent establishment provisions. A permanent establishment (PE) is a substantial physical presence in a State. A PE is an important concept in DTAs, as source States will often be denied taxing rights unless there is a PE in that State. Taxpayers may therefore try to avoid source taxation by avoiding a PE in the source State. The Protocol contains several best practice provisions aimed at the artificial avoidance of PE status. These include: i. A range of changes intended to bolster the rules contained in Article 5 (Permanent Establishment), such as clearer rules for the exclusion in the Article for preparatory and auxiliary activities and for determining when the activities of a dependent agent and commissionaire arrangements will constitute a permanent establishment. ii. A specific rule to prevent treaty abuse through the use of PEs in a third state. This is to be included in the new Entitlement to Benefits Article (Article 26A). The new rule denies treaty benefits where the residence jurisdiction exempts profits attributable to a PE in a third jurisdiction but the profits are not taxed or receive preferential tax treatment in that third state. 5.6.5 Arbitration. The Protocol would include a provision in Article 24 (Mutual Agreement Procedure) of the Existing DTA to allow a taxpayer to take their case to independent arbitration. The taxpayer may do this when the competent ANNEX IV authorities of the two States disagree on how the case should be treated and cannot resolve that dispute by mutual agreement within three years. However, a case may not be submitted to arbitration if it involves the domestic anti- avoidance rules of either Austria or New Zealand. This update is intended to address the potential loss of certainty that taxpayers may face from the introduction of the BEPS treaty anti-abuse rules outlined above. Other changes 5.7 The Protocol makes other changes to the Existing DTA. These are: 5.7.1 A rule for undefined terms. Under the Existing DTA, terms not defined in the DTA have their domestic law meaning unless the context requires otherwise. Consistent with recent updates to the OECD Model, the Protocol introduces a new rule for undefined terms that allows the competent authorities of New Zealand and Austria to agree a different meaning under the mutual agreement procedure in Article 24. This change supports the ability of the tax authorities to resolve interpretative difficulties via mutual agreement. 5.7.2 Time limit on transfer pricing adjustments. The Protocol would insert a new rule in Article 9 (Associated Enterprises), which imposes a 10-year time limit on each side’s taxation authority for making transfer pricing adjustments. The limit would not apply in cases of fraud, gross negligence or wilful default. This change will have no practical effect in New Zealand as a more limited (7-year) time bar already applies under domestic law. 5.7.3 Sovereign immunity for interest. The Existing DTA includes a sovereign immunity provision that exempts from withholding tax interest paid to the Governments of New Zealand or Austria or a national credit office of either of the countries. The Protocol would update this exemption to apply to the central banks of New Zealand and Austria and to the subsidiary of Austria’s export credit agency (which itself is already listed in the DTA as Oesterreichische Kontrollbank Aktiengesellschaft). It also explicitly names New Zealand’s Export Credit Office whereas previously it just referred to an entity of a “similar nature” to Austria’s export credit agency. ANNEX IV 5.7.4 Definition of royalties. The Protocol would remove from the definition of ‘royalties’ in the Article 12 (Royalties) a reference to “payments for the use of industrial, commercial and scientific equipment”. This reference is from the United Nations Model Tax Convention rather than the OECD Model. New Zealand routinely seeks to include this in its DTAs but has, more recently, often been unsuccessful in securing it. Removing the reference was part of agreement to other elements of the package. 5.7.5 Exchange of information. The Protocol would make the following three changes relating to Article 25 (Exchange of Information): • Include a new standard international rule that allows exchanged information to be used for purposes other than those specified in the DTA provided (1) such use is consistent with the domestic laws of both States, and (2) the competent authority of the side providing the information authorises such use. • Include a long-standing international rule that ensures DTA exchange of information provisions override any domestic bank secrecy rules of either side. • Specify the information that a tax authority must provide when requesting information from the other tax authority and clarify the extent to which information may be requested. 5.7.6 Assistance in Collection of Taxes. This was a new Article introduced into the OECD Model in 2003. Under this Article, the two sides can request administrative assistance from each other in the collection of unpaid taxes owed by absconding taxpayers. 5.7.7 MFN obligation. As noted above, the Protocol would amend the wording of the MFN obligation in the Existing DTA so that it will only be triggered by future New Zealand DTAs with EU member countries instead of OECD countries. ANNEX IV 6. Measures which the Government could or should adopt to implement the treaty action, including specific reference to implementing legislation 6.1 Following the completion of the Parliamentary Treaty Examination process, the Protocol will be incorporated into New Zealand legislation by an Order in Council made pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section BH 1 gives overriding effect to all DTAs by Order in Council. The override relates only to tax matters, and only the Inland Revenue Acts, 2 the Official Information Act 1982 and the Privacy Act 1993 are overridden. 6.2 The override of the Inland Revenue Acts is necessary to give effect to the provisions of the Protocol, which may provide relief from tax obligations that would otherwise be imposed under those Acts. The override of the Official Information Act 1982 is necessary to ensure that confidential communications with Austria during and after the negotiations do not have to be disclosed. The override of the Privacy Act 1993 is necessary to ensure that information regarding natural persons can be exchanged according to the terms of the Protocol. 6.3 As an alternative to the Order in Council mechanism, the Protocol could be given the force of law by enactment of a dedicated statute. However, this option would unnecessarily increase the amount of primary tax legislation and is not preferred. 6.4 Article XVII of the Protocol provides for the agreement to be brought into force through an exchange of diplomatic notes between New Zealand and Austria. New Zealand will be able to notify Austria that all procedures required by domestic law have been completed once the Order in Council referred to in paragraph \[6.1\] has been made and is in force. Once Austria’s diplomatic note is received by New Zealand, the Protocol will enter into force on the date of the later of the two notes. 6.5 Article XVII also provides for the dates of effect that will apply once the Protocol is in force. 6.5.1 In relation to withholding taxes, the Protocol provisions will have effect on the first day of the second month next following the date of entry into force. 2 This includes the Income Tax Act 2007, Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) and other Acts specified in Schedule 1 of the TAA. ANNEX IV 6.5.2 The remaining Protocol provisions will generally have effect in New Zealand for income years beginning on or after 1 April next following the date of entry into force, and for Austria for income years beginning on or after 1 January next following the date of entry into force. 7. Economic, social, cultural, and environmental costs and effects of the treaty action 7.1 The overall impacts of the Protocol are expected to be favourable. 7.2 The economic impacts are mixed. The reduced withholding tax rates on dividends are consistent with New Zealand’s DTA policy, which has positive economic impacts such as incentivising direct investment between Austria and New Zealand and reducing the need for New Zealand to provide foreign tax credits to New Zealanders investing in Austria. However, reduced dividend withholding tax rates may have a fiscal cost to New Zealand. Although this cost is not expected to be significant, on balance, we expect the fiscal impacts of the Protocol may be slightly negative over the longer-term. This is largely because there is existing material investment from Austria into New Zealand but not in the other direction (see further section 8 below), and it is not expected that the Protocol will (by itself) significantly increase investment or trade between Austria and New Zealand in the short term. 7.3 Social impacts are expected to be positive. The Protocol will reinforce the existing relationship between New Zealand and Austria by honouring the MFN obligation. It will also reduce the scope for tax avoidance, which can erode social cohesion and trust, through the anti-abuse provisions. 7.4 The environmental impacts of the Protocol are expected to be neutral. As mentioned at paragraph \[4.4\], the only material investment between Austria and New Zealand currently is an existing Austrian investment in New Zealand’s oil and gas industry. However, the Protocol is not targeted at any industry and does not incentivise oil and gas over clean energy or other businesses. The Protocol does make it easier for capital gains earned in New Zealand to be more easily returned to the Austrian parent. But this is just as likely to reduce oil and gas investment in New Zealand (since those gains can then be invested elsewhere) as it is to increase it. ANNEX IV 7.5 It is not expected the Protocol will have any cultural impacts. 8. The costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty Costs of reduced dividend withholding rates 8.1 For outbound dividends paid by a New Zealand company to an Austrian shareholder, the Protocol reduces the dividend withholding tax that New Zealand can impose from 15% to either 0% or 5% in specified circumstances. 8.2 The overall fiscal costs of the withholding tax reductions were considered when making the original policy decisions to provide a zero rate in our treaties with major trading partners. Ordinarily, the cost of any rate reduction would be offset by a reciprocal reduction in Austrian tax from dividends paid by an Austrian company to New Zealand investors (for which New Zealand would otherwise have to give a foreign tax credit). In a DTA between countries with reciprocal levels of trade and investment, the offsets will be equal over time. 8.3 Currently, however, there is no material investment in Austria from New Zealand but we are aware of one material direct investment from Austria in New Zealand (in the oil and gas sector described above at paragraphs \[4.4\] and \[7.4\]). Despite this imbalance, there is not expected to be a significant fiscal cost to New Zealand from reducing the dividend withholding rate, as the reduction will only affect unimputed dividends. (As explained in paragraph \[3.12\], New Zealand already applies a 0% NRWT rate under its domestic law to fully imputed dividends paid to direct investors.) 8.4 Unimputed dividends often arise from untaxed capital gains. However, the likelihood of untaxed capital gains in the case of the Austrian investment is low, as the investment is primarily in the oil and gas sector. In that sector, assets are typically held on revenue account rather than capital account, which means that gains on sale are usually taxed in New Zealand. Another circumstance in which unimputed dividends can arise is where more than 34% of the company’s shareholding changes, in which case it loses all of its imputation credits. However, there is no evidence that this is likely to happen in this case. ANNEX IV 8.5 A fiscal cost is therefore only expected to arise if the New Zealand petroleum miner derives untaxed capital gains that it repatriates to its Austrian parent. It is not possible to estimate this cost because it will depend on future events and business decisions. Untaxed capital gains may not arise at all, and it is not possible to predict the size of such gains if they do. But as untaxed capital gains are uncommon in the oil and gas sector, the fiscal cost is not expected to be significant. Costs of other changes 8.6 Certain other changes made by the Protocol to the Existing DTA could also give rise to minor costs to the New Zealand Government: 8.6.1 The Protocol would extend sovereign immunity from interest withholding tax to Austria’s central bank and the subsidiary of its export credit agency. However, this new arrangement is reciprocal with sovereign immunity being extended to the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and the New Zealand Export Credit Office. 8.6.2 Inland Revenue may incur some additional administrative costs, as a result of certain provisions in the Protocol that require the competent authorities of both countries to mutually discuss issues or to provide assistance in collection of taxes. These costs are expected to be minor and no increase of baseline funding will be sought. Inland Revenue’s experience is that the main effect of such provisions is deterrence, as such provisions are rarely exercised in practice. For example, the arbitration facility incentivises the two sides to resolve issues before arbitration is invoked. The costs may also be offset by the improved revenue collection expected from the assistance in collection from Austria for New Zealand taxes and anti-abuse provisions. 8.6 Compliance costs borne by New Zealand taxpayers are not expected to change. There may be a small increase in compliance costs borne by investors to the extent that they are currently engaging in BEPS activities if they restructure to avoid the application of the anti-abuse provisions in the Protocol. ANNEX IV 9. Completed or proposed consultation with the community and parties interested in the treaty action 9.1 The Treasury and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade were consulted about the content of this extended NIA. There has also been consultation with Austrian stakeholders regarding their investment in the mining and petroleum sector. This is in line with the existing practice of consultation with stakeholders regarding specific issues with New Zealand’s existing DTAs as they arise. 9.2 Consistent with international practice, officials do not undertake public consultation on the negotiation of bilateral tax treaties. New Zealand’s negotiating model is based on the OECD Model. With the exception of a few countries, most jurisdictions do not make their negotiating models public and negotiations are therefore also confidential. 9.3 As issues are discussed and considered for inclusion in the update to the OECD Model, the OECD seeks public feedback, including from the OECD’s Business and Industry Advisory Committee, which consists of business representatives from around the world. The OECD also consulted extensively on its BEPS work. Feedback was provided (including by interested parties from New Zealand) while the OECD undertook work on the updated BEPS provisions. 10. Subsequent protocols and/or amendments to the treaty and their likely effects 10.1 There is no amendment clause in either the Protocol itself or the Existing DTA. Further amendments will be considered on a case-by-case basis as circumstances dictate, in accordance with the usual requirements of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and subject to New Zealand’s normal domestic approval procedures. No future amendments are currently anticipated. 10.2 No formal review is planned for the Protocol or the Existing DTA. However, the two sides, through their competent authorities, are authorised to remain in contact to resolve any interpretation and application issues. In addition, taxpayers and practitioners are able to raise issues with the competent authorities. In the case of New Zealand, competent authority contact details can be found on the Inland Revenue website. ANNEX IV 11. Withdrawal or denunciation provision in the treaty 11.1 The Protocol amends the Existing DTA and as such does not include a withdrawal or denunciation provision. 11.2 Article 28 of the Existing DTA sets out provisions for terminating the DTA itself. Either side may terminate by giving written notice through diplomatic channels on or before 30 June of any calendar year at least 5 years after its entry into force. Upon such notification, the DTA (including the provisions of the Protocol incorporated into it) would cease to apply: 11.2.1 for withholding taxes, on the first day of the third month following notice of termination; 11.2.2 for other New Zealand tax, for income years beginning on or after 1 April of the next calendar year following the notice of termination, and; 11.2.3 for other Austrian tax, for assessment years beginning on or after 1 January of the next calendar year following the notice of termination. 11.3 Article 28 generally follows the approach used in New Zealand’s other DTAs. 12. Agency Disclosure Statement 12.1 Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this extended National Interest Analysis, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice have been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet. 12.2 Inland Revenue has analysed the issue of implementing the Protocol between Austria and New Zealand, and the legislative and regulatory proposals arising from that implementation. As part of that process, Inland Revenue considered the option of not entering into the Protocol and therefore retaining the existing DTA unchanged as the status quo. A full renegotiation of the existing DTA was not considered necessary as the Existing DTA was still relatively recent. ANNEX IV 12.3 If the Protocol enters into force, officials expect compliance costs will broadly stay the same, administration costs will increase (but only at the margins), and any impact on bilateral trade and investment is expected to be small. Due to data limitations officials are unable to quantify the impacts, although they are likely to be minor or small. 12.4 The Treasury and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been consulted about the content of this extended NIA. However, consistent with standard international practice, no wider consultation was undertaken. 12.5 Inland Revenue’s view is that the policy options considered will not impose additional costs on business interests; nor impair private property rights, market competition, or the incentives for business to innovate and invest; nor override fundamental common law principles. 12.6 There are no areas of incompatibility with the Government’s “Expectations for the design of regulatory systems”.
