Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Assessment, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis The limitations around the analysis are the following: Simplified Rulings Various factors have been taken into account in trying to determine the number of ruling applications that could be expected under the preferred option (introducing a simplified rulings regime). However, it has been difficult to predict the possible number of ruling applications because of the difficulty in determining the elasticity of demand, and so how any changes in the price may affect the demand for rulings. Inland Revenue has consulted with a limited number of tax agents that represent small and medium-sized taxpayers. The consultation suggested that some small and medium-sized taxpayers would see significant value in applying for a ruling, while other submitters suggested that they would not see value in such rulings. Analysis was also undertaken of the Australian rulings regime. The Australian Tax Office (ATO) receives about 1,200 complex rulings applications per year . The complex rulings applications are of a nature similar to ruling applications under the current New Zealand regime. Of those received by the ATO, 400-500 relate to large corporate taxpayers. This would be similar given the relative sizes of the countries to the number of rulings applications received in New Zealand from large corporates under the current rulings regime (being approximately 80-100). Given the number of rulings for large corporates in Australia, it is estimated that 700-800 complex rulings per year relate to smaller taxpayers. Adjusting this to reflect the relative size of New Zealand would suggest that approximately 140- 160 rulings from small and medium-sized taxpayers could be expected in New Zealand. However, the ATO does not charge any fees for providing rulings so it is unclear how the proposal to charge a fee for simplified rulings in New Zealand would impact on demand. Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 1 Minor errors There is some uncertainty as to the number of taxpayers that are carrying forward errors into subsequent returns that are larger than the current s tatutory threshold. During consultation on the proposals, submitters suggested that it was common practice for taxpayers to carry forward larger errors, and that the current threshold was being largely ignored. As a result, there is some uncertainty about whether the proposed increased limit will change behaviour or simply endorse existing practice. Tax preparers There are currently 31 payroll service providers registered as PAYE intermediaries with Inland Revenue who would be eligible for extended service offerings under the preferred option. However, the total number of non-tax agents who would be eligible under the preferred option to register to receive extended service offerings for tax preparers is unknown, as no good data exists for the number of payroll bureaus and bookkeepers in New Zealand who offer tax preparation services. Responsible Manager (signature and date): Chris Gillion Policy Manager Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 15 February 2018 Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 2 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? Simplified Rulings The binding rulings regime is a fee-based service provided by Inland Revenue and governed by Part 5A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Binding rulings, in particular private rulings and product rulings, apply to a specific taxpayer or transaction. The problem with the current binding rulings regime is that, in practice, it is generally only available to large taxpayers as small and medium-sized taxpayers are priced-out due to the cost involved. The current rulings regime was set up to provide certainty to taxpayers on arrangements being carried out by them. This was seen as providing taxpayers with a private benefit, so the fees for rulings were determined on a full cost-recovery basis. Currently, private, product and status binding rulings all incur an application fee of $322 (GST inclusive) which covers the costs of receiving and reviewing the ruling application and a fee of $161 (GST inclusive) per hour spent by Inland Revenue considering the application and the issues it raises. This includes time spent consulting with the applicant. Inland Revenue’s costs in obtaining independent advice from external professionals are also passed on to the applicant (although this is rare). As the rulings bind the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner), Inland Revenue commits significant resources to each ruling to ensure that the correct position is taken. This resulted in the fees charged for rulings being higher than ori ginally estimated. In the year ended 30 June 2017, the average fee charged was $11,200. Further, taxpayers usually engage tax advisors to assist in the rulings process, which has added significant advisor costs to the process. The overall cost of the rulings process has meant that small and medium-sized taxpayers generally do not apply for rulings. This has meant that they have not been able to obtain the same level of certainty as larger taxpayers, and they are more likely to enter into a dispute with Inland Revenue as a result. 1 Justice Glazebrook suggested that the inability of small and medium-sized taxpayers to get binding rulings was inconsistent with the principle of equality before the law. 2 Further, participants at the Tax Administration in the 21 st Century conference in June 2014 commented that the lack of access to rulings meant that it was difficult to get certainty. Private sector tax advisors can provide a certain level of assurance as to the tax outcome of a particular transaction. However, under the Tax Administration Act 1994 only Inland Revenue can provide certainty as to the tax treatment by providing a binding ruling. Taxpayers can obtain certainty by taking a conservative tax position in a tax return, and then seeking to reduce the amount of tax payable through the disputes process. This process is referred to as a taxpayer-initiated notice of proposed adjustment. While this process does not have any fees, the costs for taxpayers and Inland Revenue is more than the rulings process 1 Figures from 2013, which are the most recent available, show that 75% of disputes commenced in that year related to amounts less than $100,000 suggesting they were initiated by small and medium-sized taxpayers. 2 Address to 2015 CA ANZ Tax Conference (November 2015). Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 3 because of the numerous stages and the time taken. As a result, it does not resolve the problem identified above. Minor errors Currently, genuine tax errors of less than $1,000 can be included in a subsequent return, rather than the original assessment having to be corrected. The process is intended to reduce compliance and administration costs for minor errors. The policy was intended to assist small and medium-sized taxpayers the most. However, the threshold is not limited to such taxpayers and can be used by larger taxpayers as well. Generally under accounting standards, material changes must be included in the latest financial statements as comparatives for the past periods, including, where relevant, cumulative adjustments to any balances brought forward. 3 Materiality in accounting standards means a change that could influence the economic decisions that users make on the basis of the financial statements. 4 Materiality depends on the size and nature of the omission or misstatement judged in the surrounding circumstances. The size or nature of the item, or a combination of both, could be the determining factor. Anecdotal evidence suggests most accounting corrections are made in the current period because they are considered not to satisfy the materiality threshold under accounting standards. This means that some minor errors can be included in the current set of accounts for accounting purposes, but must be included in the assessment for the original period for tax purposes. Having two different processes for minor errors adds compliance costs for taxpayers. Tax preparers and nominated persons As part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation 5 programme (and related to the Government’s wider Better Public Services initiative), Inland Revenue intends to offer more online services to tax agents as well as to other intermediaries. Given that these expanded services will include more self-service options and may potentially enable intermediaries to work more in real-time than at present, a concern is protecting the revenue base and the integrity of the tax system against any potential risks arising from intermediaries’ use of these services. Inland Revenue currently provides a range of services specifically for tax agents, including a dedicated phone service for tax agents to communicate with Inland Revenue and use of the E-File software package which allows tax agents to file their clients’ tax returns electronically. The statutory definition of a “tax agent” is used for determining who can access these services. This means that other tax service providers (such as those who only file GST returns and employer monthly schedules for their clients, or who provide budget advice and assist with tax return preparation and claiming social policy entitlements) are not at present given access these services, even though it would be desirable in many cases to do so. These providers can still look after their clients’ tax and social policy affairs as nominated 3 See NZ IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. 4 See NZ IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements. 5 Business Transformation is a multi-year, multi-stage programme to modernise New Zealand’s tax administration. Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 4 persons (with similar access to the client through online services in myIR, including return filing), but without the services specifically for tax agents. Restricting additional services to persons who are listed as tax agents is not required by law, but is an administrative decision by the Commissioner. The Commissioner can offer these services as widely or narrowly as she considers appropriate. However, revoking access to these services once granted can be difficult. Provided that the Commissioner had the ability to withdraw these services from a non-tax agent if necessary to protect the integrity of the tax system, there would be no good reason for restricting these online services (including the new online service offerings that will become available under Business Transformation) to only tax agents. In a number of cases, these services would make it easier and more efficient for other tax service providers to manage their filing and payment performance, compared with using the limited services available to them under the status quo. Inland Revenue’s view is that a person who is nominated by a taxpayer to act on their behalf is the agent of the taxpayer under common law. Therefore, even if the Commissioner has reasonable tax integrity concerns about allowing a person to act for other taxpayers (for instance, because the person has convictions for fraud), the Commissioner cannot refuse to recognise that person as a taxpayer’s nominated person because it is up to the taxpayer whether the nominee should act (or continue to act) on their behalf. However, there are concerns about the risk of persons who have been removed from the list of tax agents (due to tax integrity concerns) coming back into the system as nominated persons. 2.2 Who is affected and how? Simplified rulings Inland Revenue anticipates that most of those affected by the current cost barriers to getting a binding ruling are small and medium-sized taxpayers. The cost barrier prevents these taxpayers from obtaining greater certainty, which increases the likelihood of them entering into disputes with Inland Revenue. As noted above, the majority of tax disputes involve small and medium-sized taxpayers. Minor errors While the current threshold for including minor errors in a subsequent return affects taxpayers of all sizes, Inland Revenue anticipates that the major beneficiaries of the preferred option will be small and medium-sized taxpayers, as they are likely to have issues that fall within the relevant thresholds. However, the proposal is not limited to such enterprises and any taxpayer would be able to use the increased threshold. Taxpayers using the proposed increased threshold would not need to incur the cost of requesting a reopening of the original return and could instead include it in a subsequent return. Inland Revenue would benefit from reduced administrative costs in not having to reopen the relevant assessment. Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 5 Tax preparers Inland Revenue expects that the group of tax preparers who currently do not receive Inland Revenue’s services for tax agents consists mostly of boo kkeepers and payroll intermediaries. Hence it is expected that the major beneficiaries of the proposal to clarify the group of persons who are eligible for the services for tax preparers that will become available under Business Transformation would include bookkeepers, payroll intermediaries and their clients. Nominated persons The current inability for the Commissioner to refuse to recognise a person as a taxpayer’s nominated person may potentially advantage or disadvantage taxpayers that nominate a person to act for them. In some instances the exercise of a discretion to refuse to allow someone to be another taxpayer’s nominated person, if legislated, may help to protect taxpayers from fraudulent or unscrupulous behaviour; on the other hand, it is possible (especially if there are not sufficient constraints on the Commissioner’s ability to refuse to recognise a nominated person) that the taxpayer may be unfairly disadvantaged by the Commissioner’s exercise of the discretion. This is the reason for limiting the exercise of the proposed discretion to circumstances where the person is acting on behalf of a taxpayer for a fee or is otherwise acting in a professional capacity. Situations where a person is acting for a family member are not proposed to be covered by the discretion. 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? There are no constraints on the scope of options considered. Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 6 Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options have been considered? Assessment criteria The following criteria were used to assess the options: • Sustainability: the option should support the coherence and integrity of the tax system; • Compliance costs: the compliance cost for taxpayers and their agents should be minimised as far as possible; and • Administrative costs: the administrative costs to the Government should be minimised as far as possible. Options Two Government discussion documents in the Making Tax Simpler series on the Tax Administration Act were released in 2015 and 2016 (Towards a new Tax Administration Act and Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act). A number of the options discussed below were the subject of public consultation in the latter discussion document. Where the preferred options below differ from those consulted on in Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act, this is primarily as a result of the submissions received on the discussion document and of further consultation with stakeholders. Simplified rulings The main objective is to enable more small and medium-sized taxpayers to obtain rulings to increase the level of certainty they have. The sustainability criterion has greater weighting because it supports the integrity of the tax system. The following options were considered: • Option 1 – Status quo: The first option would be to retain the current rulings regime with the current fees and administrative requirements. As noted above at 2.1, the overall cost of the rulings regime has meant that small and medium-sized taxpayers have not been able to use the rulings regime, and this has raised questions about equality before the law. • Option 2 – Free rulings: Many similar jurisdictions, including Australia, offer free rulings for taxpayers. Accordingly, the second option would be to remove all fees for rulings. This would achieve the main objective of enabling more small and medium- sized taxpayers to obtain the certainty afforded by rulings. It would significantly reduce the compliance costs for taxpayers because they would be able to apply for rul ings for many more issues, and so they could ensure that they took the correct tax position. However, the extent to which this option would improve access to rulings is uncertain as taxpayers would still generally have to incur significant external advisor costs to satisfy the requirements of the current rulings regime. Also, this option could significantly increase the administrative cost for the Government because Inland Revenue would need the resources to deal with all the additional rulings applications. Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 7 Further, it would not reflect the private benefit that rulings applicants obtain through the rulings process. • Option 3 – Lower overall flat fee for all rulings: The third option would be a lower flat fee for all rulings based on a schedule of the size and type of taxpayer. This option was proposed in Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act. The proposal was to allow small and medium-sized taxpayers to use the current rulings regime but with lower fees. While this would reduce the compliance costs for taxpayers to some extent, they would still generally need to incur significant external advisor costs to satisfy the requirements of the current rulings regime. As a result, it is unlikely to significantly achieve the objective of making rulings more accessible for small and medium-sized taxpayers. Inland Revenue would also incur significant administrative costs in ruling for small and medium-sized taxpayers under the current regime given the current administrative process. However, using a schedule of fees based on the size of the entity may in most instances mean that the cost for a ruling roughly approximates the private benefit (being the economic value of the ruling) that the applicant received. 6 • Option 4 – Simplified rulings: The fourth option (the preferred option) would be to introduce a simplified rulings regime with reduced fees, which is focused on the needs of small and medium-sized taxpayers. Under this option, the simplified rulings regime would be available to entities whose annual g ross income was $5 million or less for the tax year before the current tax year (aligning it with the Accounting Income Method (AIM) threshold). AIM is a new method for paying provisional tax based on current year tax-adjusted income. The AIM threshold covers a significant number of taxpayers and excludes large corporates with complex tax adjustments. 7 Also, the new regime would only be able to rule on issues when the tax at stake was less than $1 million (if calculable). This amount would be close to the highest amounts subject to audit or dispute involving small and medium-sized taxpayers as determined from 2016 data. Also, this threshold would include approximately 99% of both voluntary and audit reassessments in the 2015 income year. The option would involve removing some of the requirements for a ruling application and would streamline the administrative process for obtaining a ruling. Specifically, the application would only need to identify the applicant and to disclose all the relevant facts and documents. The application would not be required to state the specific taxation laws or the propositions of law. Applications would also not need to specify a particular arrangement. However, the applicant would need to state the general tax outcome that was being ruled on; eg, that the income is not taxable, that the expenditure is deductible, or that the applicant is resident for tax purposes. This would significantly reduce the compliance costs for small and medium-sized taxpayers by reducing the fees and possibly external advisor costs involved in the process, and so would make rulings more accessible for small and medium-sized taxpayers. 6 While the private benefit of the ruling will be a function of the ruled transaction rather than the size of the applicant, the dollar value of the transaction in question and the size of the taxpayer will be correlated. 7 The estimated number of provisional taxpayers with annual turnover of $5 million or less in 2016 was around 149,000. Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 8 The Commissioner would retain the discretion to decline to rule under the simplified regime if the characteristics of the application were such that the Commissioner deemed it appropriate to be dealt with under the current rulings regime. Examples of when an appropriate simplified ruling would not be available may include when the application: • Raises issues where there is a significant absence, or perceived deficiency, in the relevant policy; • Directly challenges an existing Inland Revenue policy or technical position; or • Raises issues having significant national implications or a wide precedential effect. The option would increase Inland Revenue’s administrative costs of setting up the new process and dealing with any rulings under the process. To some extent Inland Revenue is currently providing advice in a less formal format, and only a small increase in resources will be needed to convert the advice into a ruling. Further, Inland Revenue anticipates that some of the simplified rulings will avoid the need for the taxpayer and Inland Revenue to enter into a dispute, so will divert resources from the disputes process to the rulings process. Minor errors The main objective is to better align the tax process for remedying minor amendments with the accounting treatment to reduce taxpayers’ compliance costs. The sustainability criterion has greater weighting because it supports the integrity of the tax system. The following options were considered: • Option 1 – Status quo: The first option would be to retain the current $1,000 threshold for carrying forward minor errors into a subsequent return. As noted above at 2.1, this means that some minor errors can be included in a subsequent set of accounts for accounting purposes, but must be included in the assessment for the original period for tax purposes. Having two different processes for minor errors adds compliance costs for taxpayers. • Option 2 – Raising the threshold to $5,000: The second option would be to raise the threshold for correcting minor errors in a subsequent return from a total tax discrepancy in a single return of $1,000 to $5,000. This would go some way to aligning the tax and accounting processes but it would have a relatively low limit. As a result, it would allow a better alignment than the status quo but it would not align as well as the other options. This option was suggested by one submitter on Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act. The option would reduce compliance costs for all taxpayers by allowing them to put errors up to $5,000 in a subsequent return rather than having to request to reopen the original assessment. Retaining a single monetary th reshold would retain the simplicity of the current approach, so it would make it easier for taxpayers to determine when they could include an error in the subsequent return compared with the other options. This option would, however, raise concerns about the integrity of the tax system. The flat threshold would allow relatively large errors for small taxpayers to be included in a Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 9 subsequent return without Inland Revenue becoming aware of the error. Taxpayers could include errors up to a maximum adjustment of income or deductions of $17,855 for a company, $15,150 for an individual on the top personal tax rate and $38,335 for GST. For small taxpayers these amounts are relatively significant, and may encourage them to be less careful about first time accuracy which may harm the integrity of the tax system. The option would reduce the administrative costs for Inland Revenue of reopening the original assessment for errors less than $5,000. • Option 3 – Introducing a supplementary threshold (up to 2% of taxable income or GST output tax if the error is $10,000 or less): The third option (the preferred option) would supplement the current $1,000 threshold with an optional additional threshold that relies to some extent on the significance of the error for the particular taxpayer. This would allow taxpayers to include any error in a subsequent return if the amount of the error was equal to or less than both $10,000 and 2% of their taxable income or output tax in the return in which the taxpayer sought to include the error. It would be optional for taxpayers, and they could still include errors up to $1,000 in a subsequent return. This would further align the tax and accounting processes for small and medium-sized taxpayers in line with the original intent of the threshold. 8 The option would not provide a significant alignment with the accounting treatment for large enterprises. The option would reduce the compliance costs for all taxpayers for errors up to $10,000 (subject to the 2% threshold) by allowing them to include such errors in a subsequent return. This would remove the need for taxpayers to request to reopen the original assessment. Data from the 2014 and 2015 income years suggests that a maximum adjustment threshold of $10,000 would include 97-98 percent of amendments by number and 84- 86 percent of adjustments by value. However, it is difficult to determine the additional number of errors that could be included in a subsequent return under this option. This is because it is unclear the extent to which taxpayers are complying with the current threshold. In addition, the data on the number of amendments made in the 2014 and 2015 did not link with the size of the taxpayer making the amendment. As noted above, the size of the error that a taxpayer would be able to carry forward into a subsequent return would be dependent on the amount of their taxable income or output tax. This option would continue to require larger errors to be included in the original return period, reflecting the lower compliance costs of amending previous assessments under the new computer system (START). For those more significant errors, the costs of reopening the original assessment under START would be less than the possible detrimental effects to the integrity of the tax system, which include: • Undermining the focus on taxpayers getting the original assessment right from the start; • Reducing the ability of Inland Revenue to identify the cause of the error, and 8 See the commentary to the Taxation (Consequential Rate Alignment and Remedial Matters) Bill 2009. Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 10 to assist taxpayers to prevent it from happening again; and • Creating opportunities for taxpayers to gain advantages from delaying the payment of tax. The supplemental threshold would cause a very small increase in compliance costs for taxpayers in having to determine whether a specific error wa s within the threshold. However, taxpayers could avoid the additional compliance costs because the supplementary threshold would be optional, and they could either seek to have the original assessment reopened or they could continue to rely on the existing $1,000 threshold. As such errors could be included in a subsequent return, the option would reduce the administrative costs for Inland Revenue. There may be a small increase in costs dealing with queries from taxpayers about whether an error comes within the threshold. • Option 4 – Introducing a larger supplementary threshold (up to 5% of taxable income or GST output tax if the error is $100,000 or less): The fourth option is essentially the same as option 3 but with higher thresholds. The option would supplement the current single monetary threshold with an approach that relies to a much greater extent on the significance of the error for the particular taxpayer. This would allow taxpayers to include any error in a subsequent return if the amount of the error was equal to or less than both $100,000 or 5% of their taxable income or output tax in the return in which the taxpayer sought to include the error. It would be optional for taxpayers. This option would best align with the tax and accounting processes for small, medium and large enterprises. This option was suggested by some submitters on Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act. The larger supplementary threshold would increase risks to the integrity of the tax system. It would reduce the incentives for taxpayers to get their assessments right from the start, and would create opportunities for taxpayers to gain advantages from delaying paying tax. The option would reduce Inland Revenue’s ability to ensure compliance with the relevant timing rules. These effects could undermine taxpayers’ perceptions of the integrity of the tax system. The option would reduce the compliance costs of taxpayers by allowing them to avoid having to request the original assessment be reopened. The size of the threshold would mean that nearly all errors could be included in a subsequent return. In other countries with high error correction thresholds, there is a requirement on taxpayers to declare any errors over a lower threshold. Such a declaration process is to protect the integrity of the tax system. A similar requirement is likely to be necessary in New Zealand for a high error correction threshold. However, Inland Revenue considers that the manual process of declaring an error through a separate process may outweigh the compliance benefits under START of reopening the previous assessment. The option would reduce the administrative costs of Inland Revenue in dealing with errors that are included in a subsequent return. However, there could be additional compliance costs in dealing with any manual declaration process. Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 11 Tax preparers The main objective is to reduce compliance costs for taxpayers and their agents (by expanding access to value-added services for tax preparers) while protecting the integrity of the tax system. The means via which this objective is to be achieved include providing transparency and clarity around the group of persons who are eligible for Inland Revenue’s service offerings for tax preparers; and improving Inland Revenue’s ability to refuse to allow a person to act on behalf of other taxpayers, where necessary, to protect the integrity of the tax system. The sustainability and compliance costs criteria therefore have greater weighting. On the basis that Inland Revenue will make its extended self-service options for tax preparers available to intermediaries who do not meet the current tax agent definition, overall, compliance costs under each of the options detailed below should decrease compared with the status quo. This is because use of the online self-service options by tax preparers who opt to receive them would allow these intermediaries to work more efficiently over the longer term, and may assist them to carry out tax compliance tasks to a higher standard (which, in turn, would yield benefits for their clients and Inland Revenue). Inland Revenue will also bear some administrative costs under each of the options, in the form of: • information technology systems costs associated with the implementation of the new online services and extending these to a wider group; • screening those applying to receive Inland Revenue’s extended service offerings and processing the relevant forms; • dealing with an initial increase in queries from tax preparers when the new service offerings are implemented in Stage 2 of Business Transformation 9 ; • on-going support with the use of online services. However, the increased take-up of online self-service options may lead to some reduction in administration costs for Inland Revenue over the longer term (for instance, as a result of a smaller volume of phone calls from tax preparers) . The following options were considered: • Option 1 – Status quo – non-tax agents continue to act as nominated persons: The first option would retain the current definition of ‘tax agent’ in the Tax Administration Act. Non-tax agents would continue to look after their clients’ tax and social policy affairs as nominated persons. Inland Revenue would still be able to offer the expanded online services for tax preparers to non-tax agents; however, maintenance of the status quo would not address the current uncertainty around the Commissioner’s ability to revoke these services, along with access to clients’ information, if necessary to protect the integrity of the tax system. On the other hand, if the proposed discretion for the Commissioner to not recognise a nominated person if doing so would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system 9 Stage 2 of Business Transformation involves streamlining personal and business income taxes. Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 12 (as discussed under the nominated persons heading below) is proceeded with, then this may provide sufficient clarity around the Commissioner’s ability to withdraw these services. Option 2 – Change the tax agent definition to include other intermediaries: The second option would expand the group of persons who are eligible to apply for listing as a tax agent beyond just those who prepare 10 or more income tax returns per year. It would not be compulsory for persons who meet the eligibility criteria to apply for listing, as nominated person access is likely to be sufficient for some people who act on behalf of other taxpayers. This would allow other tax preparers, such as bookkeepers and payroll intermediaries, to apply for listing as a tax agent to receive Inland Revenue’s extended service offerings. It would also mean that a person could be removed from the list of tax agents and have their access to client information and tax agent services withdrawn if they adversely affect the integrity of the tax system. 10 This option would impose some compliance costs on tax preparers (and on their clients) in the form of applying for listing, and gaining authorisation from their clients to act for them and to access the extended online services on their behalf. However, they would not be required to be listed as tax agents in order to act for their clients, but could instead continue to act as nominated persons without the additional services. Tax preparers would therefore only bear the compliance costs associated with becoming listed as a tax agent if they determine that doing so is worthwhile to receive the extended services. Bringing other persons within the scope of the tax agent definition would require a contingent provision to clarify the group of persons who are eligible for an extension of time (since the extension of time criteria, which are currently linked to the tax agent definition, are not proposed to change). Given the purpose of the tax agent list is to keep track of the persons who are eligible for an extension of time, it is unnecessary to impose a requirement on the Commissioner to maintain a list that would include a number of persons who are not eligible for the extension of time. To keep track of the subset of tax agents who are eligible for an extension of time, this option would in practice require the maintenance of two lists – the tax agent list, and a list of those who are eligible for an extension of time. This option would impose further administrative costs on Inland Revenue in the form of: processing an increased number of applications to be listed as a tax agent (including the associated screening processes); processing removals from the list of tax agents; and auditing authorities to act. 11 • Option 3 – Two-tier agency system: Under the third option (the preferred option), the current definition of ‘tax agent’ would be retained and another term would be separately defined in the Tax Administration Act to include other tax preparers. Like the existing section dealing with tax agents, the new provision would set out the 10 The existing discretion for the Commissioner to (if necessary) remove a person from the list of tax agents is subject to judicial review, which provides a check over the exercise of the discretion. 11 While a process exists for tax agents to obtain the “authority to act” on behalf of their clients client via electronic means, many tax agents still have their clients sign a written authority to act form, which the tax agent is required to hold on file. Inland Revenue audits each tax agent’s authorities to act by selecting 10 of the agent’s clients and requesting to see the completed and signed authority to act forms for those clients. Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 13 Commissioner’s ability to deregister the person if necessary to protect the integrity of the tax system. The Commissioner’s exercise of this discretion would be a judicially reviewable decision. This option would be more transparent and would provide more clarity for tax preparers and Inland Revenue than option 1. It would not only make the Commissioner’s discretion to revoke tax preparer service offerings from a person if necessary to protect the integrity of the tax system explicit in the legislation, but would also make it clear exactly who is entitled to receive these extended service offerings. Compared with option 2, this option would also better recognise the differing roles of tax agents and other tax preparers and would avoid conflating the two concepts. However, like option 2, this option would impose some compliance costs on tax preparers (and on their clients) in the form of registering with Inland Revenue to receive the extended services, and gaining authorisation from their clients to act for them. However, registration would not be compulsory; instead, they could continue to look after their clients’ tax and social policy affairs as nominated persons. Therefore, tax preparers would only bear the compliance costs of registering if they determined that doing so was worthwhile to receive the extended services. Eligibility to be registered as a tax preparer would be restricted to those who have 10 or more clients 12 and are in the business of acting on behalf of taxpayers in relation to their tax affairs or who carry on an occupation or professional public practice in which tax returns are prepared. This would also include those who perform pro-bono tax preparation services, provided that the requirement for at least 10 clients is met. 13 Compared with the status quo (option 1), this option would impose further administrative costs on Inland Revenue in the form of processing registrations and deregistrations and auditing authorities to act. Unlike option 2, the Commissioner would not be statutorily required to maintain a list of tax preparers (other than the list of tax agents which is already required by law). Nominated persons The following options were considered: • Option 1 – Status quo: The first option would maintain the status quo where a person who is nominated by a taxpayer to act on their behalf in dealing with Inland Revenue is viewed as the agent of the taxpayer under common law. Under this view, a nominated person’s authorisation to act for a taxpayer can only be revoked by the taxpayer notifying Inland Revenue that the person is not to act for them any longer. This means that the Commissioner cannot unilaterally refuse to recognise the person 12 This may include multiple entities within a group. 13 Those with less than 10 clients will be able to use the online services that will be made available to taxpayers and their nominated persons who have a myIR account. The services that taxpayers and nominated persons with ‘token access’ will be able to access include changing registration details, registering new accounts, filing returns, making payments, setting up instalment arrangements, accessing transactions summaries and GST returns summaries, and sending and viewing email. The main difference between token access and access for tax preparers is that tax preparers will be able to link and delink their own clients (whereas nominated persons will only be able to access their clients’ account information and return filing in myIR once the client has approved their access). There would also be some additional reporting which would likely only be useful for those with at least 10 clients. Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 14 as the taxpayer’s nominated person, even if the person has been convicted of fraud. The integrity risk of persons who have been removed from the list of tax agents (or deregistered as tax preparers) for tax integrity reasons coming back into the system as nominated persons, with no clear ability for the Commissioner to refuse to allow them access to taxpayers’ account information and online filing for these other taxpayers, would therefore remain. • Option 2 – Limited discretion for the Commissioner to not recognise a nominated person: The second option (the preferred option) would allow the Commissioner to choose not to recognise a person as a taxpayer’s nominated person if she has reasonable tax integrity concerns about giving the person access to taxpayers’ account information and online filing on behalf of that taxpayer. This would strengthen both the Commissioner’s existing power to remove a person from the list of tax agents and the proposed discretion to deregister a tax preparer if necessary to protect the integrity of the tax system. However, the circumstances in which the Commissioner could refuse to recognise a nominated person would be limited to where the person is acting for a fee or is otherwise acting in a professional capacity. “Acting for a fee or otherwise acting in a professional capacity” would not cover situations where the person is acting for a family member or friend. “Acting in a professional capacity” would however cover situations where a person is performing pro-bono work for a number of taxpayers. Ensuring that the Commissioner can refuse to recognise a person who would not be allowed to be a tax agent would help to safeguard the integrity of the tax system by reducing the likelihood of that person being able to commit fraud. However, there is a risk that this may give tax officials too much discretion, which could result in use of the rule in some instances where a refusal to deal with a person nominated by a taxpayer is undue. The proposal is not aimed at subjecting nominated persons to more stringent regulation than that faced by tax agents. The proposal is instead intended to ensure that, if a person would not be allowed to be listed as a tax agent for tax integrity reasons, the Commissioner can choose, if n ecessary to protect the integrity of the tax system, to refuse to allow them to act for other taxpayers under the nominated person regime in appropriately limited circumstances. This is the reason for the proposed restrictions on the discretion (that is, the discretion can only be exercised where the person is acting for a fee or is otherwise acting in a professional capacity), which should help to ensure that the Commissioner’s exercise of the discretion does not go too far. Further, the exercise of the discretion would be subject to judicial review. Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 15 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? Simplified rulings Inland Revenue prefers option 4 (simplified rulings regime) because it: • reduces the overall cost of rulings for small and medium-sized taxpayers, and should reduce the time to obtain a ruling; • protects the rulings regime from excess demand or a need for increased Inland Revenue resources (as opposed to free rulings or reduced fees for all rulings) • reflects the dual private and public benefit of the rulings regime for small and medium- sized taxpayers. Minor errors Inland Revenue prefers option 3 (introducing a supplementary threshold (lesser of $10,000 or 2%)) because it: • better aligns with the current practices and accounting treatment of small and medium-sized taxpayers; • produces a lower risk to the integrity of the tax system than option 4 (Introducing a larger supplementary threshold); • enables the Commissioner to allocate her limited resources to collecting over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law by better focusing on significant risks (as the data suggests the threshold will include the majority of amendments); and • reduces compliance costs for taxpayers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue. Tax preparers Inland Revenue prefers option 3 (two-tier agency system) because it: • reduces the potential harm to the integrity of the tax system (compared with option 1); and • allows for recognition of the differing roles of tax agents and other tax preparers (compared with option 2). Nominated persons Inland Revenue prefers option 2 (limited discretion for the Commissioner to not recognise a nominated person) because it reduces the harm to the integrity of the tax system.

Simplified rulings There is a possible fiscal risk from providing simplified rulings. The risk arises if taxpayers are given a ruling that later turns out to be incorrect (for instance, because not enough time was spent on the ruling), and that opens a fiscal risk for the Crown. The proposed thresholds under the preferred option reduce the monetary level of the risk. However, given the reduced scrutiny under the proposed option, as compared with the current rulings process, there is a greater risk of this occurring more frequently. The grounds for withdraw ing a simplified ruling would be the same as the existing grounds in the Tax Administration Act for withdrawing binding rulings. It is difficult to predict how much demand there would be for simplified rulings; hence there is some risk that there will be significantly higher demand for rulings than has been predicted, which may require further resourcing. Inland Revenue considers this risk would be mitigated to some extent by the fee charged for the simplified rulings, the entry requirements for when a simplified ruling can be applied for, and the application requirements for a ruling. The aim is to strike a balance between enabling small and medium-sized businesses to obtain simplified rulings to improve voluntary compliance without requiring significant additional resources for Inland Revenue to meet the demand. Minor errors There is a potential risk that increasing the threshold will encourage taxpayers to change their behaviour to include even larger errors (above the increased threshold) in subsequent returns. Submitters suggested that taxpayers may in practice be including errors larger than the current threshold in subsequent returns. Any increase in the threshold, therefore, may lead to an extension of this approach. This could have fiscal implications. Tax preparers There is a possible risk that a minority of tax preparers might use online services to carry out fraud which, due to the real-time nature of online services, would mean that fraudulent transactions would be quicker and easier to carry out. This is the reason for the proposed discretion for the Commissioner to deregister or to refuse to register a tax preparer if she has reasonable tax integrity concerns about allowing the person to access online services on behalf of other taxpayers. Nominated persons No other risks arising from this proposal (aside from the possible costs outlined in Section 4) have been identified. Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 20 Section 5: Stakeholder views 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? These proposals were foreshadowed in a green paper and a discussion document, Making Tax Simpler: A Government green paper on tax administration (released in March 2015) and Making Tax Simpler: Towards a new Tax Administration Act (November 2015). The specific proposals were included in the discussion document Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act (December 2016). An online forum was also provided at makingtaxsimpler.ird.govt.nz. There were 15 written submissions on the discussion document and 19 comments on the related online forum. The submissions are discussed below. Simplified rulings To make the binding rulings regime more accessible to small and medium-sized taxpayers, the discussion document included a proposal to reduce the fees for binding rulings. Submitters were generally in favour of the proposal, h owever, submissions disagreed over how fees should be decreased. Some submissions favoured retaining an hourly rate while others suggested flat or graduated fees. Supporters of a graduated fee suggested it would be fairer across different types of taxpayers. Others suggested that such an approach may discriminate between taxpayers. Three submissions also raised concerns that the time required for a ruling was a disincentive to their use. It was suggested that small and medium-sized taxpayers were often focussed on growth and needed to make quick decisions, while all taxpayers have business opportunities that develop unexpectedly and need rulings quickly. Submissions suggested that merely reducing the fees charged for rulings would not increase the use of them. The preparation costs with the current rulings regime would still be a barrier. Some submitters suggested that a simplified regime should be put in place to reduce the preparation costs of a binding ruling. Concerns were raised about whether the rulings team would be adequately resourced to cope with the increase demand for binding rulings that may come from reduced fees. It was noted that the rulings team currently provides a high standard of service and the standard and timeliness of rulings may suffer if further resourcing is not provided to the rulings team to cope with any increased demand. The above submissions were taken into account in designing the preferred option of a simplified rulings regime for small and medium-sized taxpayers. In particular, the simplified regime has been designed to be quicker and cheaper overall, and to complement the current rulings regime. Submitters also submitted that small and medium-sized taxpayers should be given greater access to less formal forms of advice, as they may be more suitable for the less complex tax issues raised by these taxpayers. As noted in Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act, Inland Revenue is in the process of designing its future organisational Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 21 structure which will be crucial in determining how it will balance its resources and provide more effective advice. This will include consideration of giving greater access to less formal advice. Questions were also raised as to why the proposal placed such a high priority on small and medium-sized taxpayers as opposed to the range of other taxpayers that may wish to access binding rulings. Other submitters noted that large taxpayers were well- serviced by the current rulings regime, and preferred no changes be made for those taxpayers. Inland Revenue considers that larger taxpayers are adequately serviced by the current rulings regime, and that the problem relates to the difficulty of small and medium-sized taxpayers obtaining the same certainty. Minor errors Submissions on the proposal to expand the current approach to minor errors were favourable of the concept. However, differing views emerged as to how minor errors should be approached. Submitters suggested options including: • A single threshold increased from $1,000 to $5,000 • A threshold with a significantly higher monetary threshold based on materiality to the taxpayer; for example, the lower of $100,000 or 5% (or 1% ) of the taxable income or output tax. • A threshold based on the use-of-money interest implications of the error rather than the amount of tax or income involved. The first two options suggested are reflected in the options discussed above. Inland Revenue considered: • the second and third options suggested above raised too many risks to the integrity of the tax system; and • the third submission would be too difficult to work in practice. A number of additional comments were also made on this proposal. It was submitted that a more useful remedy would be to extend the statutory response period in which a taxpayer may dispute their own assessment, as New Zealand currently has a uniquely brief period in which this may occur (within 4 months from the date of the return). Inland Revenue considers that the response period would need to be considered as part of a broader review of the disputes process. Tax preparers Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act consulted on a proposal to amend the statutory tax agent definition to include a wider group of “tax intermediaries”, such as those who may file only GST and/or PAYE returns (option 2 discussed in section 3.1) . However, submitters made a number of comments as to exactly how the definition of a tax agent should be amended. This included that there should be no fee earning criterion to be a tax agent as proposed in the discussion document. In particular, submitters said the proposed fee earning c riterion should not apply to agents or intermediaries performing pro bono work Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 22 for charities and not-for-profits, and that tax agents and other intermediaries who prepare tax returns on behalf of their employers should also remain eligible to be tax agents. 14 A few submissions stated that tax intermediaries and tax agents are distinct and the terminology should not be conflated. One submitter suggested that a better way to achieve both recognition and regulation of tax intermediaries who do not meet the current tax agent definition is to create a separate “tax intermediary” definition, as doing so would allow the retention of the current tax agent definition (which already sets out the eligibility criteria for an extension of filing time) and would recognise important differences between the two groups. It was further submitted that the majority of those currently meeting the definition of “tax agent” are subject to high levels of scrutiny and accountability and are required to have certain qualifications and meet continuing professional standards. As such, this will continue to justify the recognition of tax agents as distinct from intermediaries, despite the expansion of the role of tax intermediaries. Another submitter supported combining tax agents and intermediaries but submitted that, if the distinction between the two remains, then the distinction needs to be clear. These submissions are reflected in the discussion of the options above. Inland Revenue agrees with submitters that there should be no fee-earning criterion to be registered as either a tax agent or a tax preparer. Those who prepare income tax returns for their employers (such as in-house accountants preparing tax returns for multiple entities within a group) or who perform pro-bono income tax preparation services for 10 or more taxpayers are not currently excluded from being tax agents and Inland Revenue does not consider this should change. Further, there is no reason to exclude those preparing returns for other tax types (such as GST and PAYE) from accessing the new services for tax preparers on the basis that they do not earn a fee. In light of the submissions received on the differing roles of tax agents and other intermediaries, Inland Revenue considers it is appropriate to recognise these two groups as distinct. The boundary between how the two groups are defined should be clear, as the preferred option (option 3) would retain the current tax agent definition. Nominated persons Three written submissions and one online forum comment expressed support for the proposal to provide the Commissioner with a legislated discretion to not recognise someone as a nominated person, if doing so would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system. One submitter commented that the Commissioner’ s use of this discretion should be a reviewable decision. Two commentators on the online forum were opposed to the proposal, one stating that it is up to the taxpayer who represents them and should not be a matter for the 14 The intention behind the fee-earning criterion proposed in the discussion document was to differentiate between intermediaries who carry out a business or occupation that involves the preparation of tax returns, versus those who only act for other taxpayers in a small-time capacity. This is because the additional services would be of greater benefit to those in the former group, while the nominated person regime should be sufficient for those in the latter group. It was never intended that the likes of in-house accountants and those preparing GST and PAYE returns for multiple charities and non-profit bodies on a pro-bono basis be excluded from the scope of the proposal. Exceptions to the fee-earning criterion for these intermediaries were proposed in the discussion document, but it seems these were not as clearly explained as they could have been. Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 23 Commissioner. Inland Revenue recognises that the exercise of such a discretion, especially if it is drafted too widely, may in some instances unfairly disadvantage taxpayers that have nominated a person to act for them. This is the reason for limiting the exercise of the proposed discretion to circumstances where the person is acting on behalf of a taxpayer for a fee or is otherwise acting in a professional capacity. Inland Revenue therefore expects that the potential risk would be outweighed by the tax integrity benefit from not allowing clearly unfit persons (who are acting in a paid or professional capacity) to file returns on behalf of other taxpayers and access their information. Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 24 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? The preferred options will need to be implemented by legislative amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994. The legislative amendments could be included in the first omnibus tax Bill in 2018. The amendments would apply from the date of enactment. Explanation of the amendments and their effect would be contained in a Tax Information Bulletin, which would be released shortly after the bill received Royal assent. Simplified rulings The simplified rulings regime would need similar provisions to the current rulings regime to be enacted. The current requirements for a taxpayer to apply for a ruling would be tailored for the simplified regime. The thresholds would also be specified in the legislation. The fees for the simplified rulings regime would be specified in regulations (as is currently the case) or by the Commissioner at a later date and subject to the regulatory impact analysis requirements as necessary. The implementation of the preferred option would require an internal Inland Revenue process to issue the simplified rulings applications. The internal process would be developed in conjunction with the organisational design process that is currently being undertaken within Inland Revenue. There is a risk that there could be a significantly larger number of ruling applications than currently anticipated (being approximately 140-160 rulings per year). This would require Inland Revenue to commit significantly more resources to processing the rulings. Given the fees and likely advisor costs for applying for a ruling, the risk of a significantly larger number of rulings than anticipated is considered to be small. In any event, any further resources committed to the simplified rulings regime may be in substitution for other forms of advice currently provided or for disputes that would otherwise occur. As a result, if further resources are required for the simplified rulings regime these may to some extent come from a reduction in resources needed in other areas. Minor errors The proposed increase in the threshold for amending minor errors in a subsequent return would require an amendment to the Tax Administration Act 1994. Tax preparers and nominated persons The proposed provision to define the group of persons who are eligible to receive Inland Revenue’s extended services for tax preparers, along with the discretion for the Commissioner to deregister or refuse to register a tax preparer if necessary to protect the integrity of the tax system, would require an amendment to the Tax Administration Act 1994, as would the proposal to provide the Commissioner with a discretion to choose not Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 25 to recognise a nominated person if doing so would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system. The number of persons who would apply for registration as a tax preparer is unknown, so there is a risk that a large volume of applications may require Inland Revenue to commit more resources to processing the applications in the short term. However, given the compliance costs involved in registering and in getting authorisation from clients to access these services on their behalf, it is expected that a number of those eligible, particularly those who are less technologically savvy, may prefer to remain in the nominated person regime. The proposed restriction on eligibility to those who carry on a business or occupation in which tax returns are prepared, or who prepare tax returns for an employer, and who act on behalf of 10 or more taxpayers 15 , would also constrain the number of those eligible to apply for the services. 15 This may include several entities within a group. Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 26 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue will monitor the outcomes of the changes pursuant to the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process th at has been used to design tax policy (and subsequently social policy administered by Inland Revenue) in New Zealand since 1995. For the simplified rulings proposal, the monitoring would involve a review of the number of rulings made, and the types of taxpayers applying for rulings. Further indicators of the effectiveness of the policy may include the average time taken to make the rulings and the overall costs incurred by taxpayers in obtaining the rulings. For the proposal to increase the threshold to carry minor errors into a subsequent return, monitoring would more problematic. The fact that taxpayers would not be required to notify Inland Revenue when they had included a minor error in a subsequent return would make it difficult for Inland Revenue to monitor the effectiveness of the proposal. Two possible indicators of the effectiveness of the policy may be: • Feedback from taxpayers and representative groups that the amendment had reduced compliance costs for taxpayers; and • A reduction in taxpayers contacting Inland Revenue to remedy minor errors within the proposed threshold. For the proposal to introduce a new provision in the Tax Administration Act to clarify the persons who are eligible to register with Inland Revenue to receive the extended service offerings for tax preparers , the monitoring would involve feedback from tax preparers and representative groups on the extended service offerings, and may include a review of the number of tax preparer registrations processed and the number of deregistrations. For the proposed Commissioner discretion to refuse to recognise a nominated person (if allowing the person to act for other taxpayers would adversely affect the integrit y of the tax system), a possible indicator of whether the policy is appropriate may be the number of Commissioner-initiated revocations of access rights for nominated persons, as well as feedback from taxpayers, tax service providers and operational staff within Inland Revenue. Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 27 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The final step in the GTPP is the implementation and review stage, which involves post- implementation review of legislation and the identification of remedial issues. Post- implementation review is expected to occur around 12 months after implementation. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. Any necessary changes identified as a result of the review would be recommended for addition to the Government's tax policy work programme, and any resulting proposals would go through the GTPP.

Impact Summary: Modernising the correction of errors in PAYE information Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Impact Summary, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis The key limitations on the analysis that follows are: • Consultation and testing: Although there has been consultation with employers and payroll providers employers with small payrolls who do not use payroll software were underrepresented in submissions. • Quality of data used for impact analysis: We have been unable to accurately estimate the monetary value of expected changes in administrative costs for Inland Revenue and compliance costs for employers and payroll software developers. Neither limitation materially affects the analysis. Responsible Manager Mike Nutsford Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 1 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? PAYE error correction “PAYE error correction” describes the process by which employers advise Inland Revenue of changes to income, PAYE and other deductions, such as KiwiSaver when an error has been made in, or an adjustment is required to, the information originally filed with Inland Revenue. For many reasons, including human error and late receipt of information, payroll errors 1 are inevitable. There are three types of errors that require amendment to PAYE information: 1. Reporting errors arise when the employee(s) were paid and taxed correctly but reporting to Inland Revenue does not accurately reflect what was paid and/or withheld. 2. Payroll overpayment errors arise when an employee is overpaid, correcting the overpayment requires consequential change to the amounts withheld for PAYE and related deductions such as KiwiSaver. 3. Interpretation errors arise when the employee receives the correct pay but an incorrect tax treatment is applied, for example a benefit is treated as tax free when it should have been subject to PAYE. Because salary and wage earners are taxed when they are paid underpayments are taxed when they are paid and so there is no requirement to correct the information already provided to Inland Revenue. The current PAYE error correction process is set out in operational guidance from Inland Revenue and is largely manual. The current PAYE error correction guidelines require all errors to be corrected by filing an amendment to the original return. This requirement imposes considerable compliance costs on employers and administrative costs on Inland Revenue. The guidelines would need to be updated to reflect the changes proposed in the Taxation (Annual rates for 2017-18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Bill (The Bill). This Bill introduces “payday reporting” 2 . In general, payday reporting would require employers to file “employment income information” with Inland Revenue within 2 to 10 working days of payday. This information is currently provided to Inland Revenue on a 1 Payroll staff often distinguish between “errors” and “adjustments” with the latter category arising from timing events such as the late receipt of information. For simplicity these are all referred to in this document as errors. 2 This Bill is currently before the Finance and Expenditure Committee and the proposed changes are due to be mandatory from April 2019, employers can voluntarily adopt payday filing from April 2018.. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 2 monthly basis. Payday reporting will allow some errors to be identified and corrected more quickly but it will reduce the amount of time available to employers to correct information before it is sent to Inland Revenue and, when an error has continued for several pay periods, it will require more returns to be amended. Therefore, in the absence of any other changes, payday reporting will increase the overall number of errors reported to Inland Revenue. This is the status quo position. Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme provides an opportunity to reduce compliance costs for employers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue by modernising the PAYE error correction process using employers’ payroll software and taking advantage of the capabilities in Inland Revenue’s new computer system. This could be achieved by revising some of Inland Revenue’s requirements and coding PAYE error correction requirements into payroll software and Inland Revenue’s system. To achieve this outcome the requirements would need to provide certainty and must be accessible to employers and developers of payroll software. The requirements must also cater for those organisations which do not use payroll software. We note that the Bill proposes that the requirements for PAYE error correction can be set out in regulations. Other problems with PAYE error correction In addition, a matter affecting PAYE error correction has arisen which relates to the definition of PAYE income in the Income Tax Act 2007. The objective of providing certainty in relation to the requirements for PAYE error correction requires that this issue should be resolved as soon as possible so that it can be included in advice to providers of payroll software and employers. The problem concerns the taxable status of overpaid PAYE income which is not repaid. Inland Revenue’s legal position is that an overpayment which is not repaid is not taxable unless it has been obtained fraudulently or has become a debt remittance income. Consultation with employers suggests that at least some employers treat this income as taxable and that any change to their approach would incur additional compliance costs and could reduce the likelihood of the employee agreeing to repay the net amount overpaid. Some employers who treat overpaid income which is not repaid as subject to PAYE seek a refund of PAYE and other deductions, when they obtain agreement from the employee that the net amount will be repaid 3 , others wait until the net amount is fully repaid. 3 If the employee subsequently defaults on the repayment these employers submit a further error correction to reinstate the outstanding amount as income and pay PAYE on it. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 3 2.2 Who is affected and how? Employers would be most affected by the current situation and those who responded to consultation generally supported the proposed changes on the basis that they would help to reduce their compliance costs. Payroll software developers would also be affected by the proposals for PAYE error correction. They generally support the proposed changes because they would provide certainty and would simplify reporting. Employees could be potentially affected. If the requirements for PAYE error correction are unclear or too complex employers could ignore them and adopt approaches which could be unfair for employees whose records of income and deductions might be affected. Some tax professionals do not support the proposed change to the status of overpaid PAYE income which is not repaid because it would tax an amount which is not currently defined as PAYE income and denies the employer the refund of PAYE that is currently available. The individual employers who responded to consultation on this point nevertheless supported the proposed change. 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? The common law principle that wage and salary earners are taxed when they are paid is a constraint. This principle means that underpayments are taxed when they are paid; there is therefore no “error” from a tax perspective and no requirement on the employer to amend earlier tax returns. No change is proposed and t his issue is not analysed further in this impact summary. The Bill’s changes to PAYE reporting are a constraint as they require more frequent filing of PAYE information. These changes form part of Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme. One objective of this programme is to, as much as possible; integrate tax obligations with normal business processes by using business software to automate processes. Automation requires the rules to be set out clearly and centrally so that they can be coded. The proposed changes would be consistent with a largely automated approach to error correction. In most cases, this would allow an employer using payroll software to generate the information required by Inland Revenue as a consequence of updating their own records. Because a significant group of employers do not use payroll software the requirements for PAYE error correction should also cater for employers who would manually correct their PAYE information. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 4 Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options have been considered? Modernising PAYE error correction Criteria • Minimise compliance costs to the extent possible for employers and payroll software developers: • Minimise administrative costs for Inland Revenue, including consistency with the objectives of Inland Revenue’s business transformation. • Maintain the equity of the tax system. This means allowable approaches to PAYE error correction should not disadvantage employees to whom the income and deductions belong. • Maintain the integrity of the tax system. Options for error correction • Option 1: All corrections would be made by amending the original return (status quo). • Option 2: Employers would be able to make corrections by either; amending the original return or reporting the correction in a subsequent return. The ability to amend in a subsequent return would exist even if the error occurred in a previous tax year. Additional sub-options have been considered for interpretation errors and these are discussed below. Analysis of options for each error type against the stated criteria 1. Reporting errors Option 1 is preferred over option 2 for dealing with reporting errors. If reporting errors were not corrected in the original return there could be a mismatch in the reported information and the amount paid. This would give rise to reconciliation problems which give rise to compliance costs and administrative costs. Amending the original return would also ensure that employees would not be disadvantaged by the income or deductions actually received being reported in a later period. Option 2 does not address the problem. 2. Overpayment errors Option 1 would involve higher compliance costs for users of payroll software, compared with option 2. This is particularly true in the context of payday reporting - that is, if an error has continued for more than one payday, an employer who pays more often than monthly would have more returns to correct. Option 2 would involve a reduction in compliance costs for employers using payroll software, compared with option 1. These reductions would arise because employers would be able to report overpayment errors in a subsequent return which would Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 5 eliminate the requirement for a separate error correction return. Because it provides choices option 2 would also cater for employers who do not use payroll software and who prefer to make corrections by amending the original return. Option 2 would not give rise to integrity concerns. If the overpayment error occurred in a previous tax year option two would more often ensure that the reduction in an employee’s income feeds through into their annual assessment and social policy position. For this reason option 2 is also preferred on equity grounds as fewer employees would need to seek a reassessment to ensure the reduction in their income feeds through to an assessment. Option 2 would not be fully available to employers until Inland Revenue’s new computer system takes over the full processing of PAYE; this is not expected until 2020. Until then employers would only report overpayment errors in a subsequent return if the net amount reported were a positive number. 3. Interpretation errors Option 1 Requiring all interpretation errors to be corrected by amending the original return (the status quo) would impose higher compliance and administrative costs than option 2. There would not be equity or integrity of the tax system concerns with this option. Option 2 Allowing the employer to choose to correct the error either by amending the original return or by including the correction in a subsequent return would have lower compliance and administrative costs than option 1. However if the ability to correct interpretation errors in a subsequent return is unconstrained employees could be disadvantaged by having a significant increase in their income reported in a single payday return when they have not had an increase in available cash 4 . This concern led to consideration of sub option 2a below. In addition, concern for the integrity of the tax system led to consideration of a further sub option as set out in sub option 2b below. Option 2a This sub option would permit employers to choose to correct small interpretation errors in a subsequent return up to a threshold of PAYE on the error being less than 10% of the employee’s PAYE in the payday return. Larger interpretation errors would need to be corrected by amending the original return(s) . Option 2a would mitigate the risk of disadvantaging employees but it would impose higher compliance and administrative costs than option two. 4 This situation could arise if a taxable benefit such as subsidised accommodation had been treated as tax free, if the value of this benefit is all reported in one payday return the employee has higher income reported but no more cash. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 6 Option 2b In addition to the 10% threshold proposed in sub option 2a concern for the integrity of the tax system lead to a further proposal: that an employer could only correct interpretation errors in a subsequent return if they had made less than $10,000 of upward reassessments in that tax year. This sub option would have significantly higher compliance costs that options 2 and 2a but it has the advantage of reducing the likelihood that the correcting interpretation errors in a subsequent return could conceal widespread non-compliance. Options for amending definition of PAYE income Three options are considered using the criteria set out at the beginning of this section. • Option 1: no amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007. This is the status quo option. • Option 2: no amendment to the Income Tax Act and a significant investment by Inland Revenue in employer education in an effort to change employer behaviour. • Option 3: amend the Income Tax Act 2007 so that overpaid PAYE income that is not repaid remains subject to PAYE. Analysis of options Option 1 This option retains the current definition of PAYE income. Some employer submissions indicated that this option would be inconsistent with current employer practice and with how their payroll software is currently configured. Continuing with the status quo may undermine the objective of automating error correction through software and is likely to result in continuing non-compliance which undermines the integrity of the tax system. This option could also be seen as inequitable because it treats an employee who repays overpaid PAYE income as having the same income as an employee who does not repay it. Option 2 Under this option there would be no change to the definition of PAYE income in the Income Tax Act 2007 and Inland Revenue would widely publicise its view of the law in an effort to change employer practice and how payroll software is configured. The objective would be to enable payroll software to be used to report such errors to Inland Revenue and recover overpaid PAYE and other deductions as soon as an overpayment is identified and regardless of whether it is repaid or not. This option would have significant one-off educational costs for Inland Revenue and might not be successful. Those employers consulted view the status of overpaid PAYE income as wages or salary subject to PAYE. In addition, employers have reasons under employment law for not coding the amount as an overpayment in their Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 7 payroll system until agreement to repay has been reached. If this option resulted in a change in employer behaviour employers would benefit by being able to recover PAYE and other deductions from Inland Revenue regardless of whether they had recovered the net amount from the employee. Option 3 This option would expand the definition of PAYE income so that overpaid PAYE income not repaid would be subject to PAYE. This option would have lower compliance and administrative costs than the alternatives as it accords with how (some) employers currently treat such income and with how their software is configured. This option supports the integrity of the tax system as overpayments not repaid would generally become taxable as debt remittance income. However, because employees would be unlikely to be aware of this obligation it is unlikely that tax would be paid on such income. Option 3 would expand the definition of PAYE income and could be seen as unfair for employers because it denies employers refunds of PAYE and related deductions that they are currently entitled to. It could also be seen as unfair to employees who have been overpaid because that amount would be taxed before it becomes debt remittance income. As noted above, there are countervailing equity arguments that suggest that Option 3 is preferable on equity grounds because for social policy purposes it would recognise an employer who repaid overpaid income as on a lower income than someone who received an equivalent overpayment but did not repay it. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 8 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? Error Correction 1. Reporting errors: Option 1 (all corrections to be made by amending the original return) is the proposed approach as it is preferable on all criteria. 2. Overpayment errors: Option 2 (allowing the employer the choice between amending the original return and correcting in a subsequent period) is the proposed approach as it reduces compliance and administrative costs and is preferable on equity grounds. 3. Interpretation errors: Option 2a (allowing the employer the choice between amending the original return and correcting in a subsequent period subject to PAYE on the correction being less than 10 percent of the employee’s PAYE in the return) is the preferred approach. This option represents the best trade- off between reducing compliance costs for employers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue without the possibility of unfair impacts on employees. Definition of PAYE income The taxable status of overpaid PAYE income which is not repaid: Option 3 (amending the definition of PAYE income so that overpaid PAYE income which is not repaid remains subject to PAYE) is the preferred approach as it is preferable on all criteria. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 9 Section 4: Impact Analysis (Proposed approach) 4.1 Summary table of costs and benefits PAYE Error correction: the error correction items are considered together as costs are principally driven by the requirement to amend original returns. When there is a continuing requirement to correct errors by amending the original return employers who use software should experience reduced compliance costs owing to automation. Employers who do not use payroll software but who have internet connectivity would be able to access their already filed and processed returns through myIR and self- correct earlier returns; this should reduce costs for this segment. Employers who report PAYE on paper would continue to have access to a paper form for PAYE error corrections and for simple corrections should be able to make them over the telephone. Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties Providers of payroll software would need to up grade their products to support the electronic submission of error corrections in line with the proposed methods for error correction. Software providers could integrate this change into the regular update cycle. Work to create an automated channel for the status quo position is already underway in advance of the proposed regulations, as part of business transformation changes. These are transitional costs. Employers would have transitional costs of understanding the new approach in order to take advantage of it. Very low Very low Regulators Inland Revenue would need to ensure that employers and payroll providers are provided with appropriate education and support and that its new computer system is effectively set up and tested in order to receive negative values from 2020. These are transitional costs. Very low Wider government NA NA Other parties NA NA Total Monetised Cost NA NA Non-monetised costs Very low Expected benefits of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties Providers of payroll software: Have additional certainty that their payroll offerings are compliant with requirements.

The ability to correct small interpretation errors in a subsequent return should reduce costs of reporting these errors. These benefits are ongoing. Regulators Inland Revenue once the new system has bedded in and employers can use their payroll systems to correct overpayment errors and minor interpretation errors in a subsequent return, including those showing negative values the cost of administering the PAYE system should reduce. Low Wider government Government employers are expected to have the same experience as private sector employers. The changes are also expected to benefit the Ministry of Social Development and the Accident Compensation Corporation which pay PAYE income to beneficiaries and to recipients of New Zealand superannuation and accident compensation. Medium Other parties NA NA Total Monetised Benefit NA NA Non-monetised benefits . Low/medium Overpaid PAYE income subject to PAYE Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties Software providers would have no costs as we understand their systems currently support the proposed approach. Employers: we understand that what is proposed aligns with how (some) employers currently treat this income and reflects how their systems work. Even though the proposed change would preclude employers from receiving a refund of PAYE on the overpaid income (some) employers are not currently claiming this refund. Unless this practice changed the increased cost would be theoretical, rather than real. Further, employers argue that continuing to treat overpaid income as subject to PAYE would make it more likely that the employee would repay the employer because repayment would be the only way their record of income for social policy purposes is corrected. To the extent this view is valid the theoretical increase in costs Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 11 identified below would reduce. Employer costs have been estimated as very low; this reflects the fact that the situation is not a common one and assumes that some employers do seek a refund of PAYE on overpaid PAYE income that is not repaid. Very low Regulators Inland Revenue: the proposal reflects the way the system is currently operating so no additional costs would be incurred. No change Wider government NA NA Other parties NA NA Total Monetised Cost NA NA Non-monetised costs As noted above (some) employers have advised us that what is proposed is how they currently operate. For these employers there would be no increase in costs. The costs have been entered as very low on the assumption that some employers are recovering PAYE on overpaid income not repaid. Very low Expected benefits of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties Payroll providers will have certainty that their systems could be used as currently configured to seek a refund of overpaid income when repayment is agreed or made. Employers would have certainty that the widespread current approach, that treats this income as subject to PAYE, is consistent with the law. Employees would be freed of any obligation to pay tax on the overpaid PAYE income when and if it becomes debt remittance income. Low Regulators Inland Revenue would no longer have to deal with ambiguity around the current position. Low Wider government NA NA Other parties NA NA Total Monetised Benefit Non-monetised benefits The primary benefit is increased certainty around how this income should be treated for tax purposes. Low Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 12 4.2 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? The proposed legislative change to deem overpaid PAYE that is not repaid as subject to PAYE would improve equity between overpaid employees. Under existing law two employees who are overpaid the same amount of PAYE income should be treated as having the same income for social policy purposes (for example working for families payments, student loan repayments and child support payments) despite one employee having repaid the money and the other not having done so. Section 5: Stakeholder views 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? Inland Revenue consulted with a number of providers of payroll software and employers and with the Corporate Taxpayers Group and Chartered Accountants of Australia and New Zealand prior to releasing an official issues paper in August 2017. An officials’ issues paper, PAYE error correction and adjustment, was released through Inland Revenue’s normal channels and in addition was sent to the members of the Payroll Practitioner’s Association, to providers of payroll software and to representatives of more than thirty employers who had indicated interest in the subject. Thirteen submitters responded some representing more than one employer. Submitters generally agreed with the problem analysis and the proposed regulatory approach with the exception of the original proposal for an employer level threshold for interpretation errors. Submitters argued that the employer level threshold could not be automated and that manual tracking would involve disproportionate compliance costs. In response to feedback the employer level threshold has been dropped. Concern was also expressed by some respondents that the 10% threshold for interpretation errors at the employee level was unduly low. This threshold has been retained at 10% because the amount could be material for someone on a low income. One respondent felt that the proposals were unduly complex. However an employer who wishes to minimise complexity will have the option to correct all errors by amending the original returns. No change has been made in response to this submission. Most respondents agreed with the proposed amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007, deeming overpaid PAYE income not repaid as subject to PAYE. The Corporate Taxpayers Group and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand however disagreed. The Corporate Taxpayers Group considered that the proposal would disadvantage employers by taxing an amount that is not employment income. Chartered Accountants Australian and New Zealand submitted that whether the net amount was recovered or not was a private matter between the employer and employee and the amount should not be taxed unless it became debt remittance income. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 13 In addition one software provider submitted that if an employer had made an adjustment when agreement to repay the overpaid amount was repaid they should not be required to make a further adjustment if the employee subsequently defaulted on the repayment. No changes we made in response to the submissions received on the proposal to amend the definition of PAYE income so that overpaid income not repaid is subject to PAYE. A number of technical questions were raised by payroll software providers and these will be considered in the process of developing the technical specifications. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 14 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? The proposals related to reporting errors, overpayment errors and interpretation errors would be given effect through regulations. Clause 235C of the Taxation (Annual Rates 2017 -18, Employment and Investment Income and Remedial Matters) Bill proposes that the Governor General may, by Order-in- Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue and following appropriate consultation, make regulations for the correction of errors in employment income information. The proposed timing provides adequate time for employers to understand the proposed changes and become familiar with the new options. In general the proposed regulations introduce additional options, with continuing to file amendments on the current basis being one option. Having options provides a means of managing implementation risk including risks that arise from a relative lack of engagement with employers with small payrolls. Inland Revenue’s systems are being upgraded to accept automatic error correction schedules from 1 April 2018. Issues relating to the effectiveness of the automated process should be resolved by the time the regulations, which permit a greater number of errors to be correcting in a subsequent return, come into effect on 1 April 2019. The proposal related to the tax status of overpaid PAYE income not repaid will be managed through a proposed amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007. It is intended that the amendment will be included in the next available taxation omnibus bill with a proposed effective date of 1 April 2019. Consultation by select committee is expected to provide a further opportunity for interested parties to express their views on this proposed change. The proposed change to the legislation reflects how many employers are understood to currently treat such income, implementation risks are not therefore considered to be material. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 15 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Information on the number of errors and adjustments to employment income information that are corrected at the employer’s request is currently available. There is no way to decompose the totals into different error types. Once the systems changes are made and the regulations are in place Inland Revenue will know how many automated error correction schedules are filed and the number of changes made. If the system is working as intended the number of changes that are made by amending earlier returns should reduce after it becomes possible for employers to file returns which include negative values (estimated as 2020). Inland Revenue will not know how many employers exercise the option of correcting overpayment and small interpretation errors in a subsequent return as this option eliminates the need to separately file error correction information. Implementation and operational issues will be identified through feedback from payroll software providers and through our call centres, account managers and specialised units such as those established to support large enterprises. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The arrangements will be reviewed as part of the post implementation review of phases three and four of Inland Revenue’s business transformation. In addition if monitoring shows unanticipated spikes in the numbers of error corrections being made to employment income information Inland Revenue will investigate the reasons and consider whether the issue: • is insufficient education; • reflects a problem with the specifications for payroll software or with Inland Revenue’s processing of error correction information; • stems from the regulations. Employers will have the opportunity to raise any concerns with our call centres and account managers and payroll software providers can do so through Inland Revenue’s Software Liaison Unit. If employees consider that they are unfairly affected by the actions of employers pursuant to the proposed regulations or legislative change they will be able to make their concerns known through our call centres or by asking the Commissioner to reassess their income.

Coversheet: Taxation of non-bank securitisation vehicles Advising agencies Inland Revenue Decision sought The analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with policy changes to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet Proposing Ministers Steven Joyce (Finance) and Hon Judith Collins (Revenue) Summary: Problem and Proposed Approach Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? Securitisations can have several commercial benefits, compared with other funding mechanisms, such as risk management, balance sheet improvement, credit enhancement, lower cost of funding, and access to a wider pool of lenders. An important commercial objective of a securitisation is maintaining tax neutrality for the special purpose vehicle (SPV) used. There is a concern that the current tax rules may not allow for tax neutrality for the SPV to be achieved, and so may be discouraging securitisations. The Government wants to ensure that tax settings are not discouraging some businesses from realising the commercial benefits of securitisations. Proposed Approach How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option? There is currently a securitisation regime in the Income Tax Act 2007 which applies in respect of certain securitisations undertaken by financial institutions. The effect of the regime is that there are no tax consequences arising from the transactions between the financial institution and the SPV. Extending that regime to cover businesses that are not financial institutions would ensure that securitisations that meet the criteria of the regime are tax neutral. This would remove a tax disincentive to undertaking securitisations, which is likely to produce growth given the commercial benefits securitisations provide. Impact Statement Template | 1 Section B: Summary Impacts: Benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? The main expected beneficiaries of the proposal are New Zealand businesses with large books of trade credits or other receivables (Originators) that may wish to raise funding by using those receivables as security. The proposal should reduce compliance costs by removing the requirement for the SPV to return tax itself, and by removing the need for the Originator to calculate and return tax where the transferred receivables remain economically within the Originator’s group. In terms of equity and fairness, taxing securitisations in accordance with their economic substance, would ensure that tax does not penalise (or incentivise) securitisations compared with other forms of fund raising. This would mean that the benefits of securitisations can be enjoyed more broadly. Where do the costs fall? The fiscal cost of the proposal for the Government is expected to be minor, as securitisations are typically structured to prevent tax arising where possible. There could be a fiscal cost from not recognising the transfer of assets to the SPV, although this would be the same as if the securitisation had not occurred. It is not expected that implementation of the proposal would raise any administrative issues for Inland Revenue. The proposal would reduce compliance costs for taxpayers, and would reduce tax costs to the extent that securitisations are not currently structured to prevent tax arising. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? A potential risk that was identified is that expanding the securitisation rules could open up the possibility of those rules being used to avoid tax on what is in substance a true sale to a third party. However, it is proposed that the expanded rules include a requirement that the securitised assets are treated as held by the Originator or another company in the group in its consolidated accounts under the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). It is considered that this requirement should mitigate the risk that the new rules could be used to avoid tax on what is in substance a true sale to a third party. Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. There is no incompatibility between this regulatory proposal and the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. Impact Statement Template | 2 Section C: Evidence certainty and quality assurance Agency rating of evidence certainty? We are reasonably confident in terms of the evidence on which the proposal is based, given that we have undertaken targeted consultation with interested and affected parties involved in New Zealand’s securitisation market. To be completed by quality assurers: Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Taxation of non-bank securitisation vehicles Regulatory Impact Assessment prepared by Inland Revenue and associated supporting material and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Assessment meets the Quality Assurance criteria. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: The reviewer’s comments on earlier versions of the Regulatory Impact Assessment have been incorporated into the final version. Impact Statement Template | 3 Impact Statement: Taxation of non-bank securitisation vehicles Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Assessment, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis It is understood that the current tax settings could be discouraging some businesses from realising the commercial benefits of securitisations. We cannot be sure of the scope of the problem, but have gleaned from consultation that the current tax settings are a disincentive to many taxpayer’s undertaking securitisations. We also understand that currently securitisations are typically structured to prevent tax arising where possible. However, the extent to which tax is currently paid in respect of securitisation transactions is not known, so the potential revenue cost is not able to be quantified. That said, removing a tax barrier would be expected to result in more businesses being able to enjoy the commercial benefits of securitisations, and the tax neutrality of those transactions would be no different than if the securitisation had not occurred. Responsible Manager (signature and date): Peter Frawley Policy Manager Policy & Strategy Inland Revenue July 2017 Impact Statement Template | 4 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the context within which action is proposed? A securitisation is a funding mechanism that involves issuing marketable securities that are backed by the expected cash flows from specific assets. New Zealand businesses with large books of trade credits or other receivables (Originators) may wish to raise funding by using those receivables as security. To do this, the Originator of the receivables transfers them to a special purpose vehicle (SPV), and the SPV then issues securities (typically debt instruments) to lenders. The SPV is structured to be bankruptcy remote from the Originator, so that the SPV’s assets cannot be accessed by the Originator’s creditors. In New Zealand (and internationally, in most cases) this means that the SPV is typically a trust. A securitisation can have several commercial benefits compared with a regular loan, such as risk management, balance sheet improvement, credit enhancement, lower cost of funding, and access to a wider pool of lenders. An important commercial objective of a securitisation is maintaining tax neutrality while ensuring the SPV is bankruptcy remote from the Originator. It is particularly important to ensure that the SPV itself is not exposed to a tax liability, as this can affect its credit rating. 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place? There is currently a securitisation regime in the Income Tax Act, but it applies only in respect of certain securitisations undertaken by financial institutions. Those rules were introduced as a result of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s (the RBNZ’s) response to the global financial crisis. Broadly, the RBNZ agreed to provide additional liquidity support for banks, provided the bank offered collateral securitised AAA rated residential mortgages as securities. As part of the security arrangements for this funding, the RBNZ required these mortgages be held by a bankruptcy remote special purpose vehicle (SPV). In the absence of a specific regime, there would have been potential tax consequences arising from the use of SPVs, as required to access the RBNZ’s liquidity support. The government determined that the tax rules should not impede the RBNZ measures assisting the stability of the financial system at that time. As a result, new provisions were introduced into the Act in 2009 to achieve tax neutrality. Those provisions were extended in 2010, after the RBNZ introduced a new bank liquidity policy which included measures to require banks and certain finance companies to lengthen their funding to better match their lending terms. The provisions in the Act now apply to financial institutions generally (not just registered banks) and to covered bond programme SPVs (economically very similar to the residential mortgage-backed security SPVs). The tax effect of the provisions is that the SPV is treated as transparent. The SPV’s property, activities, status, intention and purpose are attributed instead to the financial institution. The financial institution is also treated as being party to any arrangement to which the SPV is a party, and the SPV is treated as not being that party to the arrangement. Practically, this means that there are no tax consequences arising from the transactions between the financial institution and the SPV, while the SPV remains qualifying. Also, all transactions between the SPV and third parties are included in the financial institution’s tax return. The restriction of the current rules to securitisations by financial institutions is a consequence of the rules being introduced to facilitate financial institutions accessing the RBNZ’s liquidity support during Impact Statement Template | 5 the global financial crisis. Wider application of the rules was not necessary for that purpose. However, there is no particular policy reason why the rules should not apply more broadly to corporate securitisations. 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? There is a concern that the current tax rules may not allow for tax neutrality for the SPV to be achieved, and so may be discouraging securitisations. The current rules can also trigger a tax liability on transfer of the receivables into the SPV. While potentially less serious than SPV taxation, this issue can create a large administrative burden, as all the receivables need to be valued for tax purposes. The concern in relation to the tax treatment of securitisations by businesses that are not financial institutions arises as a result of the application of the general trust rules and the financial arrangements rules. Trusts can derive non-cash income, and there is an issue about whether this can be distributed as beneficiary income (in which case the beneficiary pays the tax on the income) or whether it must remain as trustee income (in which case the trustee pays the tax). In 2012, Inland Revenue published Interpretation Statement IS 12/02 “Income Tax – whether income deemed to arise under tax law, but not trust law, can give rise to beneficiary income”. The Interpretation Statement concluded that non- cash income can only be distributed to a beneficiary where there is a cash amount available for distribution. This can be an issue for SPVs, as securitisations are typically structured so the SPV has no cash income. This means that any non-cash income derived could result in a tax liability at the trust level. There is also an issue arising because of the application of the financial arrangements rules, which require a “base price adjustment” to be carried out when any financial arrangement is transferred, which can trigger a tax liability. Although potentially less serious than SPV taxation, this issue can create a large compliance burden and result in compliance costs for taxpayers (the Originator and the SPV), as all the receivables need to be valued for tax purposes. New Zealand has a small but active securitisation market, although there has been reduced activity following the global financial crisis. If the problem is not addressed, then the current tax settings may discourage some businesses from realising the commercial benefits of securitisations. 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? There are no particular constraints on the scope for decision making. Impact Statement Template | 6 2.5 What do stakeholders think? As noted above, this issue was originally raised by the private sector, with the suggestion that the current securitisation regime in the Income Tax Act be extended to other corporate securitisations to remove the tax disincentive to undertaking securitisations. Inland Revenue has undertaken targeted consultation on the proposal with interested parties. Given that the proposed amendments would only be relevant to those involved in New Zealand’s securitisation market, officials considered that targeted consultation was sufficient. We consulted, by letter and subsequent discussions, with: • Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand; • the New Zealand Law Society (the NZLS); • the Corporate Taxpayers Group; • the Financial Services Council of New Zealand; • the Financial Services Federation; • Chapman Tripp on behalf of the Trustee Corporations Association and New Zealand Guardian Trust; • EY; • Bell Gully (who received the consultation proposed through the NZLS); and • PwC. Submitters were supportive of the proposal to extend the securitisation regime beyond financial institutions to other corporate securitisations. Submitters commented that widening the scope of the regime in this way would ensure a tax neutral outcome for securitisations undertaken by corporates that are not financial institutions. The issues raised at consultation are discussed in section 3 below. Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? Option 1 (status quo) Option 1 is to retain the status quo. Under the status quo, the tax settings may discourage some businesses from realising the commercial benefits of securitisations, as these arrangements can have higher tax costs and compliance costs than other funding arrangements. Option 2 (extension of current rules) Option 2 is to extend the current securitisation regime (in sections HR 9 to HR 10) beyond financial institutions to other corporate securitisations. Option 3 (extension of current rules with requirement of recourse to the Originator) Option 3 is to extend the current securitisation regime beyond financial institutions to other corporate securitisations, but with an additional requirement of the lenders having recourse to the Originator. Arguably there is a potential risk that just extending the current rules (option two) could provide opportunities for the rules to be used to avoid tax on what is in substance a true sale to a third party. Impact Statement Template | 7 Introducing an additional requirement (for non-financial institution securitisations) of recourse to the Originator is one possible way of reducing the risk of the provisions being used to avoid the tax consequences of a true sale to a third party. However, it would seem that this risk would be mitigated by the requirement in the current provisions that the financial arrangements (the receivables) held by the SPV are treated as held by the Originator in its consolidated accounts under IFRS. Option 4 (extension of current rules with additional modifications) Option 4 is to extend the current securitisation regime beyond financial institutions to other corporate securitisations, but with a number of modifications, as suggested by submitters during consultation (discussed further in section 5, below), namely: • The regime could be extended in scope for financial institutions, beyond the types of securitisations currently covered (those involving residential mortgage-backed securities and covered bond programmes). The regime would apply more broadly for non-financial institutions, so it makes sense for financial institutions to also be able to benefit from the regime for other securitisations they may undertake. • The regime could be extended to cover securitisations involving assets/receivables other than financial arrangements. For example, it is common for trade receivables and operating leases, which are excepted financial arrangements, to be securitised. • The requirement for the securitised assets to be recognised in the Originator’s consolidated IFRS financial statements could be amended so that recognition in the consolidated IFRS financial statements of a company in the same group would suffice. • The regime should be elective, given that it removes a tax barrier. This would ensure that existing arrangements are not adversely affected if they have been structured to achieve a different result than what would arise under the regime. 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? The generic tax policy process (GTPP) includes a framework for assessing key policy elements and trade-offs of proposals. This framework is consistent with the Government’s vision for the tax and social policy system, and is captured by the following criteria: • Efficiency and neutrality – the tax system should bias economic decisions as little as possible; • Fairness and equity – similar taxpayers in similar circumstances should be treated in a similar way; • Efficiency of compliance – compliance costs for taxpayers should be minimised as far as possible; • Efficiency of administration – administrative costs for Inland Revenue should be minimised as far as possible. Efficiency and fairness are the most important criteria. It is generally worth trading-off increased compliance costs or administration costs for gains in these two criteria. 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? No other options have been ruled out of scope.

We consider that option 4 is the best option to ensure that the commercial benefits of securitisations are achieved while maintaining the integrity of the tax rules. As noted, this option would extend the current securitisation regime beyond financial institutions to other corporate securitisations, but with a number of modifications (discussed below). The suggested modifications arose out of feedback received during consultation, so officials consider that these modifications would best ensure that the objectives of the proposal are met, while ensuring the regime does not provide tax incentives for securitisations, or facilitate tax avoidance. Option 1, retaining the status quo, would mean that the tax settings would continue to discourage some businesses from realising the commercial benefits of securitisations, which can have higher tax costs and compliance costs than other funding arrangements. The Government wants to remove a tax disincentive to undertaking securitisations, given the commercial benefits they provide. The status quo is not supported. Option 2 is to extend the current securitisation regime to non-financial institutions. The extended regime would apply to a broader class of securitisable assets than those currently covered for financial institutions, as the type of securitisations currently within the scope of the regime (residential mortgage-backed securities and covered bond programmes) are not typically undertaken by non-financial institutions. However, the current consolidation requirement may be too restrictive for securitisations other than those currently covered. The current consolidation requirement is that the securitised assets are treated as held by the Originator in its consolidated financial statements under IFRS. However, as discussed further below, submitters have commented that it is often the case in corporate securitisations that the securitised assets are de- recognised by the Originator but are recognised in the consolidated financial statements of another group company. Option 2 would be somewhat limited in terms of the securitisations it would apply to, which means the tax settings would continue to discourage some securitisations. As a consequence, option 2 is not supported. Option 3 is to extend the current securitisation regime to non-financial institutions to a broader class of securitisable assets than those currently covered for financial institutions, but with the additional requirement of the lenders (the investors in the SPV) having recourse to the Originator. The possibility of an additional requirement of recourse to the Originator was suggested as an option in consultation to ensure that the provisions could not be used to avoid tax on what is in substance a true sale of financial assets to a third party. However, we consider that a requirement of recourse to the Originator is less preferable to other options for mitigating that risk. In particular, as discussed further below, the additional requirement of recourse to the Originator would be inconsistent with the commercial objective of ensuring that the SPV is bankruptcy remote from the Originator, and so would undermine the benefits of a securitisation. Submitters commented that from a practical point of view the Originator would not want to guarantee the SPV’s obligations, and would just borrow itself if it were necessary for the investors to have recourse to the Originator. This would mean that from a practical point of view option 3 might be little utilised, which is contrary to the objective of removing a tax disincentive so that the benefits of securitisations can be enjoyed more broadly. Therefore option 3 is not supported. The modifications to the proposed extended securitisations regime under the preferred option (option 4), and the reasons for them, are discussed below. Extension to assets / receivables that are not financial arrangements The current regime is limited to certain financial arrangements – New Zealand residential Impact Statement Template | 10 mortgages or loans secured by such mortgages. Submitters noted that it is common for excepted financial arrangements such as trade receivables and operating leases to be securitised, and submitted that the regime should be extended to include the securitisation of such assets. The intention of this proposed amendment is to extend the current securitisation regime so that New Zealand businesses with large books of trade credits or other receivables can securitise those assets in a tax neutral way. It was always intended that the amended securitisation regime (whether option 2, option 3 or option 4) should apply to a broader class of securitisable assets than those currently covered for financial institutions. These submissions are, therefore, consistent with the proposed amendments. Extension to all securitisations by financial institutions The current regime applies only to certain types of securitisations undertaken by financial institutions. Submitters have commented that if the regime is extended to non-financial institutions (who would typically not undertake the types of securitisations that are currently within the scope of the regime), then it should also be extended to other types of securitisations undertaken by financial institutions. Officials agree with this submission, and consider that financial institutions should be able to use the regime for the same transactions as other corporates, in addition to the residential mortgage- back securities and covered bond programme transactions currently covered. Amended consolidation requirement The current rules require that the securitised assets are treated as held by the Originator in its consolidated financial statements under IFRS. Submitters have observed that this requirement is suitable for residential mortgage-backed securities and covered bond programmes, but might be too restrictive for other securitisations. Submitters have commented that it is often the case in corporate securitisations that the securitised assets are de-recognised by the Originator but are recognised in the consolidated financial statements of another group company. It has been submitted that the consolidation requirement should be amended to accommodate such situations, and that if the group entity that recognises the securitised assets in its consolidated financial statements is separate from the Originator, the transfer of the receivables by the Originator should also be disregarded. One submitter suggested that it should be sufficient for the consolidation requirement if the SPV 1 is included in the IFRS consolidated accounts of the Originator, or a group that includes the Originator, the Originator’s parent company, or the beneficiary of the SPV. Officials agree with the submitters who suggested that the consolidation requirement could be amended so that it is sufficient if the securitised assets are recognised in the consolidated financial statements of the Originator or another group company. This would mean the benefits of the regime can apply more broadly. In addition, officials consider that such an amended consolidation requirement would be sufficient to ensure that the provisions do not apply where there is a true sale to a third party. Officials do not think it would be appropriate for it to be sufficient that the SPV or the securitised assets are included in the consolidated financial statements of the beneficiary of the SPV, if the beneficiary is not in the same group. It is considered that this could open up the possibility of the 1 As opposed to the securitised assets. Impact Statement Template | 11 provisions being used in a situation where there is in fact a true sale of the assets to a third party. Requirement of recourse to the Originator One of the proposed options, raised as a possibility as part of consultation, was for the extension of sections HR 9 to HR 10, with the additional requirement of the lenders (the investors in the SPV) having recourse to the Originator. This was suggested as a way of ensuring that the provisions could not be used to avoid tax on what is in substance a true sale of financial assets to a third party. Submitters commented that the additional requirement of recourse to the Originator would be inconsistent with the commercial objective of ensuring that the SPV is bankruptcy remote from the Originator. Submitters commented that this would undermine the benefits of a securitisation, and from a practical point of view the Originator would not want to guarantee the SPV’s obligations, and would just borrow itself if it were necessary for the investors to have recourse to the Originator. Officials agree. However, as noted in section 4, officials consider that the risk that the regime could be used to avoid tax on what is in substance a true sale of the assets to a third party could be appropriately mitigated by the requirement that the receivables held by the SPV be treated as held by the Originator or another group company in its consolidated accounts under IFRS. As such, it is not considered necessary to include an additional requirement of recourse to the Originator. Elective regime / application only to future securitisations Submitters suggested that the proposed extended regime should be elective, or otherwise apply only to future securitisations, to ensure that existing arrangements are not adversely impacted if they have been structured to achieve a different result than that arising under the extended regime. Officials agree with this submission. The regime is less burdensome than the current rules – ensuring tax neutrality for securitisations, so there is no issue with the regime being applied electively. The current regime is not framed as being elective. However, there is no particular policy reason why it should not be, given that it removes a tax barrier. Officials therefore recommend that the regime be explicitly elective for financial institutions and other corporates alike. Explicit tax neutrality One submitter commented that the legislation, or associated commentary, should make it clear that transactions within the scope of the extended regime do not give rise to tax consequences (such as a disposal for tax purposes). There was concern that the recent debt remission reforms indicate that loans made by the sole shareholder of a look-through company (LTC) to the LTC are not disregarded and that the shareholder would be required to account for the tax consequences of the loan essentially as both a deemed lender and borrower. It was suggested that this might indicate that the Originator in a securitisation would be treated as both disposing of and acquiring the securitised assets, given that section HR 9 shares similar statutory language to the transparency provisions in the LTC rules. It was also noted that there is uncertainty around the tax effects of a contribution of property to an LTC or partnership by a shareholder/partner. The submitter commented that general transparency principles would suggest that no disposal occurs, however alternative views had been put forward, and it was noted that this issue would be of particular importance in terms of the proposed expanded securitisation regime. Officials will ensure that the legislation and associated commentary make it clear that the intention is for there to be no tax consequences for transactions within the scope of the regime.

Non-monetised benefits Removes tax disincentives and reduces compliance costs. Medium Medium Impact Statement Template | 13 5.3 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? As noted in Section 1, the extent to which tax is currently paid in respect of securitisation transactions is not known, so the potential revenue cost is not able to be quantified. However, we understand that currently securitisations are typically structured to prevent tax arising where possible, so any revenue cost is expected to be minimal. Further, removing a tax barrier would be expected to result in more businesses being able to enjoy the commercial benefits of securitisations, and the tax neutrality of those transactions would be no different than if the securitisation had not occurred. In terms of the fiscal impacts of all of the options considered, as noted in Section 3, arguably there is a potential risk that expanding the regime could result in the rules being used to avoid tax on what is in substance a true sale to a third party. Introducing an additional requirement (for non- financial institution securitisations) of recourse to the Originator is one possible way of reducing the risk of the provisions being used to avoid the tax consequences of a true sale to a third party (Option 3). However, it would seem that this risk could be adequately mitigated by the requirement in the current provisions that the receivables held by the SPV are treated as held by the Originator in its consolidated accounts under IFRS (Option 2). Inland Revenue considers that the risk would be similarly mitigated by a requirement that the securitised assets are treated as held by the Originator or another company in the group in its consolidated accounts under IFRS (Option 4). 5.4 Is the preferred option compatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’? Yes. Impact Statement Template | 14 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? If approved, these proposals, which require legislative change, would be included in the next available taxation bill after the general election and would apply from the 2018/2019 income year. Given that the ability to use the regime for corporate securitisations would be optional, there is no need for any transitional arrangements. Taxpayers could simply file their returns on the basis of their decision to use the regime or not. We do not see any need for an election to use the regime to be specifically brought to Inland Revenue’s attention. When introduced to Parliament, commentary would be released explaining the amendments, and further explanation of their effect would be contained in a Tax Information Bulletin, which would be released shortly after the bill receives Royal assent. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? The proposals would have no system implications for Inland Revenue, and implementation would not incur additional administrative costs. No issues concerning implementation have been raised through consultation. Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? In general, Inland Revenue’s monitoring, evaluation and review of new legislation takes place under the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage tax policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The final stage in the GTPP is the implementation and review stage, which involves post- implementation review of the legislation, and the identification of any remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are also built into this stage. Inland Revenue’s Policy & Strategy unit monitors the first year of operation of new legislation. If there is a need to make remedial amendments to the new rules these will be prioritised for inclusion on the Tax Policy Work Programme, and the proposal would go through the GTPP.

This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be undertaken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Quality of data used for impact analysis Inland Revenue does not possess information on how much FBT paid by banks and other money lenders relates to employment related loans. Therefore, stakeholders were asked to self-report how much FBT they pay on employment related loans and this information was used to estimate the amount of FBT currently collected on employment related loans from banks and other money lenders. Cons ultation and testing Although there was only a short consultation period, by targeting consultation to relevant stakeholders, Inland Revenue is confident that it got the input it needed to inform the analysis. Responsible Manager (signature and date): Chris Gillion Policy Manager Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 27 March 2018 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 1 1. Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? FBT rules A fringe benefit arises when an employer provides a loan to an employee. There are two ways in which the benefit of an employment related loan can be valued. Most employers are required to use a prescribed rate of interest as defined in section RD 34 on the Income Tax Act 2007 (the Act). The prescribed interest rate is adjusted from time to time by Order in Council and is based on the floating first mortgage new customer housing rate published by the Reserve Bank. However, employers that are in the business of lending money, or are a member of a group of companies with at least one member in the business of lending money, may instead elect to use the market interest rate as defined in section RD 35 of the Act. If they have elected to use the market rate, banks and other employers in the business of lending money are required to pay fringe benefit tax (FBT) when they provide a loan to an employee at a rate below the market interest rate. The market interest rate for a group of employees is currently defined as the rate their employer would offer to an arm’s length group of persons with a comparable credit risk to the group of employees. Different money lenders will therefore have different market rates as the market rate is based on the rates a given lender offers to a group of its customers with a common risk profile. The market interest rate rules were based on the practices banks and other lenders were using at the time the rules were developed. Money lenders would advertise rates and, in general, customers would receive these rates if they met the necessary conditions for a loan. However, some lenders would also offer discounts to certain groups of customers. For example a bank may have offered employees of a local respected employer a discount of 0.3 percentage points below the advertised rates. The market interest rate rules allow either a money lender’s advertised rates or any group discount rates the money lender offers to be offered to employees as the market interest rate without banks and other similar lenders incurring FBT. FBT should only be payable on employment related loans when a discount is genuinely provided to an employee. Problem The method for calculating the market rate is out-dated and no longer reflects the lending practices of banks and other money lenders. It is now common practice for banks and other similar lenders to individually negotiate loan rates with customers. Banks and other money lenders now also consider a broader range of criteria than just credit risk when determining interest rates. Individually negotiated loans cannot be used for determining the market rate as the rates received by customers through this process have not been offered to a group. As such, the true market rate, being the interest rate an arm’s length customer receives, is often lower than the market rate calculated under the current legislation. This can result in the over-taxation of employment related loans and fairness concerns. Furthermore, because Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 2 of this over-taxation many employees of banks and other money lenders may be able to receive better loan rates from competitors to their employer. The rules around the market interest rate were introduced to rectify the problem of FBT ari sing even when the employer is charging an employee the true market rate. As such, changing the method for calculating the market rate to more appropriately reflect the true market rate would be consistent with the original policy intent and the broader FBT policy framework. 2.2 Who is affected and how? The affected parties are banks and other employers in the business of lending money as well as the employees of money lenders. Banks and other money lenders are affected as they are currently paying too much FBT on loans made to employees. Employees are affected as the interest rates they receive from their employer may in some cases not be as low as if the over-taxation of employment related loans did not occur. 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? There are no constraints on the scope for decision making. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 3 Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options have been considered? The following criteria have been used to assess the options: • Effectiveness: the option should only result in FBT being payable when a discount is genuinely provided to an employee in order to ensure fairness. • Compliance: compliance costs for banks and other employers in the business of lending money should be minimised. • Administration: implementation and administration costs for Government departments should be minimised. • Certainty: the option should provide certainty as to how to calculate the market rate. Option one: Status quo Under the status quo the market interest rate for a given employee is defined as the rate a bank (or other money lender) would offer to a group of persons when: • The group has a comparable credit risk to the group which the employee belongs to; and • Membership of the group arises from a factor or factors that do not include a connection between a member and the employer; and • The group is sufficient in number to ensure a transaction on an arm’s length basis. The main issue with the status quo is its effectiveness. Under the status quo, FBT is often payable even when an employee is receiving the same interest rate they would have received as an arm’s length customer and this leads to fairness concerns. Under the status quo, compliance and administration costs are relatively low and money lenders do have certainty around how to calculate the market rate. Option two: The market rate is the lowest rate given to an arm’s length customer The option is that the market interest rate for a given employee and loan type would be defined as the lowest rate given around the same time in the ordinary course of business to an arm’s length customer with a similar profile (based on the lending criteria used by the employer) to the employee. Under this option, banks and other money lenders would have a choice about what time period they calculate the market rate from. Ideally, money lenders would calculate the market rate based on loans given to arm’s length customers in the same FBT quarter as loans made to employees. However, money lenders that do not have readily available data from the current FBT quarter may instead elect to calculate the market rate using data from the FBT quarter immediately prior to the FBT quarter in which an employee received a loan. This option has been consulted on with the New Zealand Banker’s Association, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand and the Financial Services Council. All Submissions received were supportive of updating how the market rate is calculated and this option. Effectiveness This option would prevent the over-taxation of employment related loans that occurs under the status quo. Instead, loans made to employees would only be subject to FBT if a genuine Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 4 discount compared to the rates received by arm’s length customers has been provided. Compliance Consultation has indicated that this option would have relatively low compliance costs that are comparable to the status quo. This option would simply require them to identify the lowest rate offered over the relevant time period and apply this as the market rate. Administration This option would have administration costs for Inland Revenue that are comparable to the status quo. Certainty This option would provide certainty for money lenders on how to calculate the market rate. However, submissions did ask for further guidance on when a loan made to a customer was made in the ordinary course of business. This will be provided as part of the bill commentary and in a Tax Information Bulletin following enactment. Option three: Employers using the market rate can make an election between using the either the status quo or option two for calculating the market rate (proposed option) This option is that option two would be introduced alongside the status quo. Banks and other money lenders would be given the choice to use either method for calculating the market rate. The method proposed under option two for calculating the market rate will be more taxpayer favourable than the status quo, so we expect most banks and other money lenders to use this method. However, it is possible that some money lenders may not have the data capabilities available to readily determine the lowest rate given to arm’s length customers in either the current or previous FBT quarter. Allowing these employers to still use the status quo method for calculating the market interest rate would ensure they would not be disadvantaged by the introduction of the method proposed under option two. Effectiveness As stated above, for employers that choose to use the new method this option would prevent the over-taxation of employment related loans that occurs under the status quo. Compliance As above. Administration As above. Certainty As above. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 5 Option four: Market rate is the average rate given to arm’s length customers This option is that the market interest rate for a given employee and loan type would be defined as the average rate given around the same time to arm’s length customers with a similar risk profile to the employee. This option has been consulted on; however submitters were overwhelmingly opposed to this option. This is because this option would still result in some over-taxation of employment related loans. Other options A number of other options were considered but were not consulted on as they would not be feasible and would not provide certainty around how to calculate the market rate. 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? The proposed approach is option three which introduces an additional option for calculating the market rate along with the status quo calculation. The additional option defines the market rate for a given employee and loan type as the lowest rate given around the same time in the ordinary course of business to an arm’s length customer with a similar profile to the employee. This is the preferred approach as it would effectively address the over-taxation that occurs under the status quo without increasing compliance or administration costs. This option would also provide certainty to money lenders on how to calculate the market interest rate, while leaving them the choice of still using the status quo calculation if they wish. The proposed approach has no areas of incompatibility with the Government’s expectations for the design of regulatory systems.

Low Total Monetised Benefit $3m per annum Non-monetised benefits Low Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 7 4.2 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? It is assumed that the entirety of the $3 million in FBT currently paid by banks and other money lenders for employment related loans will be foregone if the issue is effectively addressed. This is based on discussions with stakeholders in which they have claimed they generally treat employees no different from arm’s length customers when offering loans. We do not anticipate the proposed approach would have any other impacts. Section 5: Stakeholder views 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? This problem was initially brought to Inland Revenue’s attention by members of the New Zealand Bankers’ Association (NZBA) and they have been consulted throughout the policy development process. A targeted consultation letter was recently sent to the NZBA as well as Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ), the Corporate Taxpayers Group (CTG) and the Financial Services Council. The consultation letter asked for their views on options two (the lowest rate) and four (the average rate). The letter also asked for views on whether any new method for calculating the market rate should replace the status quo or be in addition to it. Submissions from CA ANZ, CTG and a number of banks were received. All submissions received were supportive of updating the market interest rate definition and the approach proposed under option two. Submissions were not supportive of option four as it would not fully address the problem and would be difficult to comply with. Most submissions were also supportive of the new option being introduced as an addition the status quo. As such, it was decided to introduce option two as an option alongside the status quo. As a result of stakeholder feedback the proposed approach has been modified. The original option two was that the market interest rate for a given employee and loan type would be defined as the lowest rate given around the same time in the ordinary course of business to an arm’s length customer with a similar risk profile to the employee. Banks pointed out that risk profile is only one factor out of many they consider in offering loans and determining interest rates. Therefore, using similar profile as opposed to similar risk profile for comparing employees to arm’s length customers is more likely to provide the correct result. The Treasury has also been consulted on the proposed approach and supports the proposed changes subject to consideration of how to prioritise this issue alongside other issues. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 8 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? The proposal will require amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007. Amendments would be included in the next available omnibus tax bill, currently scheduled for introduction in May 2018. The changes would come into effect from the start of the first FBT quarter after the bill is passed into law. It is anticipated this would be 1 April 2019. Inland Revenue will be responsible for the on-going administration of the new arrangements. Inland Revenue officials have assessed the magnitude of these administrative impacts, and consider that they would be manageable to implement in the proposed timeframe. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 9 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue will monitor the outcomes pursuant to the Generic Tax Policy Process ("GTTP") to confirm that they match the policy objectives. The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. Monitoring the impact of the new arrangements will be done through consultation with the New Zealand Bankers’ Association and other relevant stakeholders. Given the relationships Inland Revenue has with relevant stakeholders we would also expect stakeholders to raise any issues they experience directly with us. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? Post-implementation review is expected to occur around 12 months after implementation. If the post-implementation review identifies any need for remedial action it would be recommended for addition to the Government's tax policy work programme and could potentially be included in future taxation bills. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 10 Impact Summary: KiwiSaver enhancements resulting from the Retirement Commissioner’s review Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Assessment, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with changes to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Scoping of the problems The problems were identified as part of the Retirement Commissioner’s December 2016 review of retirement income policies (the Review) – which wa s prepared by the Commission for Financial Capability. Therefore, the problems were effectively already identified before Inland Revenue began work on the proposed regulatory approaches. Ra nge of options considered As the problems were identified as part of the Review, the options considered were also based on the recommendations made in the Review. The Retirement Commissioner has a legislative mandate to review retirement income policies every three years, as a result the Commission for Financial Capability is experienced in considering ways to improve the effectiveness of retirement income policies (including KiwiSaver). The recommendations in the Review were made after problem definitions and solutions had been tested with the public, the private sector and Government agencies during 2016. (This consultation involved interviews with the public, a range of online surveys taken by approximately 11,200 members of the public and consideration of substantive written submissions). 1 The nature of the Commission for Financial Capability’s expertise and the significant scoping done as part of the Review indicates that the recommendation s it proposed are likely to be the most viable options to address the problems it had identified. Qua lity of data used for impact analysis It is not possible to accurately determine how many KiwiSaver members will be encouraged by the proposed approaches to increase their contributions and therefore their long-term 1 Surveys were available on the Commission for Financial Capability’s website. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary: KiwiSaver enhancements resulting from the Retirement Commissioner’s review | 1 2. KiwiSaver savings. However, results of a public survey undertaken as part of the Review generally signalled support for the recommendations. 2 The estimated impacts of the proposed options are dependent on the behavioural response of KiwiSaver members. Previous changes to the scheme have been more restrictive in nature, so cannot be used as a basis for predicting responses to the proposals. Assumptions underpinning impact analysis Both proposals assume KiwiSaver members would be responsive when presented with voluntary (rather than compulsory) options that increase their long-term savings. Responsible Manager: Peter Frawley Policy Manager Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 1 March 2018 2 Out of 1,830 survey responses, 85.4 percent of respondents were in support of more flexible contribution rates while 51.6 percent of respondents supported reducing the maximum period of a contributions holiday from five years to one year. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary: KiwiSaver enhancements resulting from the Retirement Commissioner’s review | 2 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? The KiwiSaver Act 2006 sets out the requirements for KiwiSaver members and their employers. Under the KiwiSaver policy framework, although KiwiSaver remains voluntary, contributions are encouraged in several ways. For example, employees’ contributions are facilitated by being deducted directly from their pay (if the employer receives a deduction notice from the member or Inland Revenue), and members are incentivised to make contributions to their KiwiSaver account so they receive the Government subsidised member tax credit (an annual maximum payment of $521.43, to members who contribute upwards of $1,042.86). This regulatory impact analysis deals with two specific problems: Part A problem – low employee contribution rates Currently, KiwiSaver members have contributions deducted at a rate of 3% (the minimum default rate), 4% or 8% from their salary and wages. Approximately 90 percent of members were contributing at the lowest 3% or 4% employee contribution rates in the 2016-17 year. Population demographics are changing, with New Zealander’s living longer into retirement. Life expectancy for New Zealand females is 83.2 years and 79.5 years for males, 3 with these numbers expected to continue to rise. The Review signalled that KiwiSaver members contributing at a low rate, may not have accumulated sufficient savings to financially support themselves during the entire duration of their retirement, in a way that meets their individual retirement needs and preferences. Part B problem – long contributions holidays For the year ending 31 June 2017 131,710 members were on a contributions holiday, with 84 percent of these contribution holidays being five years in duration (contribution holidays can be for any period between three months and five years, five years is the default period). This means these members were not making contributions, or were only making minimal voluntary lump sum contributions during this period (voluntary contributions are generally not at the level the member would have saved were they not on a contributions holiday). Stopping contributions for five years has a significant impact on members’ savings, and also means members generally do not receive the member tax credit or employer contributions during this period. The purpose of the contributions holiday is to ensure members can take a break from making contributions when they are not in a financial position to do so. However, having a default five year contributions holiday period is likely to be longer than necessary for many members (whose financial position is likely to improve in the interim period). 3 Statistics New Zealand ‘New Zealand Period Life Tables: 2012-14’ Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary: KiwiSaver enhancements resulting from the Retirement Commissioner’s review | 3 Who should address the problems and when? KiwiSaver is the only Government subsided retirement savings scheme offered to the public. Therefore, the Government has a responsibility to ensure it is fit for purpose. This should include making sure members are given as many options as possible to effectively save. These problems should be addressed now. They were identified as part of the December 2016 Review. It would be prudent for the Government to respond to problems identified in the Review within a reasonable timeframe, because the longer that nothing is done to address the problems, the more savings KiwiSaver members potentially lose out on. The problem definitions and recommendations in the Review were formed after consultation with the public, the private sector and Government agencies, meaning there is agreement across a variety of sectors that the problems are an issue. 2.2 Who is affected and how? Part A problem – low employee contribution rates KiwiSaver members (who are salary and wage earners) who are not contributing enough to their KiwiSaver account to meet their specific retirement preferences would be affected. The aim of this change is to get these members to start contributing at a higher rate, in a manner that is still flexible enough to respond to changes in their financial circumstances . The purpose of this is to increase KiwiSaver members’ retirement savings, so that they can achieve retirement outcomes aligned with their specific retirement needs. The proposed option would address this problem by introducing additional 6% and 10% employee contribution rates. KiwiSaver scheme providers and other Government agencies jointly responsible for KiwiSaver (MBIE and the Treasury) support this option. This approach should not have financial implications for the Government. Part B problem – long contributions holidays KiwiSaver members (who are salary and wage earners) who are taking breaks due to contributions holidays would be affected. The aim of this change being to prompt members to resume making contributions sooner, so that they increase their savings and maximise their member tax credit entitlement (which they would not receive while contributions are paused). The proposed option would reduce the maximum period of the contributions holiday from five years to one year. This would limit the time during which members make no contributions (it would still be possible for members to indefinitely renew contributions holidays, but they will have to do so more frequently, ensuring they actively consider the matter). KiwiSaver scheme providers and other Government agencies jointly responsible for KiwiSaver also support this option. There may be some cost to the Government. If reducing the contributions holiday has the desired effect and results in members resuming contributions earlier, this would result in an increase in the aggregate amount of member tax credits payable. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary: KiwiSaver enhancements resulting from the Retirement Commissioner’s review | 4 The majority of the administrative costs for implementing the proposed approaches to address the problems would be borne by Inland Revenue and could be accommodated in existing baselines. There would not be any significant compliance cost for scheme providers or employers. There is not known to be any group that does not support the proposed approaches. 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? Constraints As the problems were identified by the Review, the options in scope to address them have been limited to the recommendations made in the Review. However, t he Retirement Commissioner’s experience in considering the effectiveness of retirement income policies, as well as the consultation process undertaken as part of the Review to identify problems and solutions (as outlined in more detail above), suggest the recommendations made in the Review are likely to be the most appropriate options to address the problems. The previous Government approved its letter of response to the Review for public release in May 2017. As part of the process of inputting into this letter of response Inland Revenue officials considered how effectively the options outlined below would address the problems. When it approved the release of the letter of response to the Review, the previous Government also invited the Minister of Revenue to report back to Cabinet specifically on implementation details for: • providing additional optional employee contribution rates; • reducing the maximum permitted renewal time of the contributions holiday; and • changing the name of the “contributions holiday” to “savings suspension”. Connections to other existing issues At the time of writing this regulatory impact analysis Cabinet were also considering: • a change to the name of the contributions holiday; • a change to the name of the member tax credit; and • consequential issues related to the previous Government’s decision that over 65 year olds should be eligible to join KiwiSaver. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary: KiwiSaver enhancements resulting from the Retirement Commissioner’s review | 5 Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options have been considered? Part A deals with low employee contribution rates and aims to get these members to start contributing at a higher rate, in a manner that is still flexible enough to respond to changes in their financial circumstances. Part B aims to prompt members to resume making contributions sooner, so that they increase their savings. In contributing to the Government response to the 2016 Review Inland Revenue conducted a high-level assessment of the options to the two problems using the following criteria: • Effectiveness: the option must address the problems in a manner that is appropriate within wider KiwiSaver policy settings. • Compliance: compliance cost for employers and KiwiSaver members should be minimised. • Administration: implementation and administration costs for Government departments should be minimised. • Equity: as far as practical the option should be available to all KiwiSaver members. Part A problem Four options are considered for dealing with low employee contribution rates. Option one: Add additional employee contribution rates of 6% and 10% Effectiveness Additional 6% and 10% employee contribution rates are likely to have a positive impact on savings, and would give members greater flexibility to achieve retirement outcomes aligned with their specific retirement savings needs and to adjust their contribution rate to suit their current financial circumstances. The additional 6% rate would also address the gap between the current 4% and 8% contribution rates, which the Review indicated many members think is too large. This view is supported by the fact that 24 percent of members contribute at the 4% rate, but only 9 percent of members contribute at the 8% rate. 4 Compliance Members would have to self-select onto one of the new employee contribution rates (as members wanting to contribute at 4% or 8% currently have to). Employee deductions would continue to be made out of members’ salary or wages, meaning there would be no on-going additional compliance costs for employees. The range of rates at which employers would be required to deduct contributions from employees’ salary or wages would increase. This could result in a small increase in compliance costs for employers not using a commercial payroll system. Administration This option would require building additional employee contribution rates into Inland 4 The other 67 percent of members contribute at the minimum 3% rate. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary: KiwiSaver enhancements resulting from the Retirement Commissioner’s review | 6 Revenue’s administrative system. However, this impact would be a one-off cost. Equity Members on a higher salary or wage are more likely to be in a financial position to self-select onto a high rate than lower salary and wage earners. As the additional contribution rates are voluntary their introduction would not result in lower income earners being financially worse off as a result of them. Option two: Add automated option to allow members to increase their contribution rate over time Under this option members would choose an automated annual increase in their contribution rate of 0.25%, 0.5% or 1% up to a capped maximum rate. Effectiveness This option would provide more flexible contribution rates. This could have a positive impact on savings, as well as allowing members to personalise their contribution rate more specifically to their retirement savings needs. Compliance As contribution rates would automatically increase members would not be required to self- select onto a higher contributions rate which could be seen as a reduction in compliance costs. However, this option would significantly increase compliance costs for employers, and could require them to modify their payroll systems. The automated contribution rates could also be complex for payroll and software providers to implement in the first instance. The automated rates would also add complexity to KiwiSaver rules, which could be difficult for scheme providers to explain to members. Administration Introducing increasing contribution rates which are not whole numbers would require changes to Inland Revenue systems and could be difficult to administer. Equity There is a possible inequity, in that members on a higher salary or wage are more likely to be in a financial position to choose to annually increase their contribution rate. However, as the automated annual increases would be voluntary their introduction would not result in lower income earners being financially worse off. Option three: Increase the minimum employer and employee contribution rate from 3% to 4% Effectiveness This option would result in a compulsory increase in costs for KiwiSaver members and employers contributing to KiwiSaver. This could detrimentally impact on members and employers’ current financial position and short-term savings. We note there is limited evidence this recommendation would raise savings rates (as it may result in KiwiSaver Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary: KiwiSaver enhancements resulting from the Retirement Commissioner’s review | 7 members substituting away from other savings). Compliance Employee deductions would continue to be made out of members’ salary or wages, meaning there would be no additional compliance costs for employees. The minimum rate employers would be required to deduct contributions from employees’ salary and wages would increase. This could result in a one-off increase in compliance costs for employers not using a commercial payroll system. Administrative This option would require changes to Inland Revenue’s administrative processes for validating minimum contribution rates. However, these impacts are likely to be small and one-off in nature. Equity This option would make it more difficult for low-income earners to contribute to KiwiSaver. This could adversely impact whether they are in a financial position to adequately support themselves in the short term or alternatively it could force members to go on a contributions holiday (and therefore negatively impact on their long-term savings). Option four: Status quo Effectiveness The status quo does not address the problem, as it does not give members the opportunity to self-select onto new higher contributions rates and therefore it is unlikely to have any positive impact on members’ long term savings. It also does not give members more flexibility to personalise the amount they contribute to align with their retirement savings needs. Compliance There would be no additional compliance costs. Administration There would be no additional administrative costs. Equity Members on a higher salary or wage are more likely to be in a financial position to self-select onto a high rate than lower salary and wage earners. Notably the gap in affordability between the 4% and 8% rate is a financial obstacle preventing many members from contributing at a higher rate. If members are not in a financial position to opt onto a higher contribution rate, it would mean these members would not have the opportunity to save more for their retirement. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary: KiwiSaver enhancements resulting from the Retirement Commissioner’s review | 8 Part B problem Two options are considered for dealing with long contributions holidays. Option One: Reduce the maximum contributions holiday period from five years to one year Under this option the maximum length of a contributions holiday would be one year. Contributions would automatically resume after the one year, unless the member renewed their contributions holiday for another year. Effectiveness Although some members on a contribution holiday continue to make lump sum contributions, stopping regular contributions for five years is likely to significantly impact on members’ long- term savings. Reducing the maximum period from five years to one year encourages members to more frequently re-engage with KiwiSaver and to assess whether they are in a position to resume making contributions. Compliance Members wanting to remain on a contribution holiday would have to renew their holiday each year rather than every five years, resulting in a small increase in compliance costs. Administration This option would require Inland Revenue to contact members on a contributions holiday more frequently. This would result in an on-going increase in the resources Inland Revenue would need to allocate to processing contribution holiday renewals. This impact would be manageable, and the on-going administrative cost of renewing contributions holidays could be reduced once KiwiSaver is transferred into the new START system, as part of Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme. Equity Members on a contributions holiday because of financial hardship are unlikely to be in a position to resume contributions after a year. Therefore, this option would only benefit members whose financial position had improved since going on a contributions holiday. If, at the expiry of the shortened holiday period the member’s financial situation has not improved they could still renew their holiday, but this option would ensure that they actively consider their financial position on a more regular basis. As part of the detailed design of this option, transitional arrangements would be put in place for members on a contributions holiday longer than a year when the reduced period comes into effect. This would ensure these members would be entitled to complete the duration of their existing contributions holiday under the rules that applied when they opted to go on a holiday. The proposal potentially creates an equity issue between members (in otherwise identical situations) applying for a contributions holiday prior to this change being enacted and those applying after this change is enacted. However, as transitional arrangements would only apply until members completed an existing contributions holiday there would not be an on- Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary: KiwiSaver enhancements resulting from the Retirement Commissioner’s review | 9 going equity concern (beyond five years). Option two: Status quo Effectiveness The status quo does not address the problem. Going on a five year contributions holiday is likely to significantly impact on members’ savings. As members are not prompted to reconsider the length of their holiday during the five year period, it also means they could stay on a contributions holiday for longer than is financially necessary. Compliance There would be no additional compliance costs. Administration There would be no additional administrative impacts. Equity If members do not select a duration end date for their contributions holiday, the default five year period applies. As they are not prompted to reconsider whether they are in a financial position to resume making contributions during the five year period, they could continue to be on a contributions holiday when their current circumstances do not require it. Therefore, the long term savings of a member on a five year contributions holiday are more likely to be negatively impacted, than members on a contributions holiday who select a (shorter) duration end date. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary: KiwiSaver enhancements resulting from the Retirement Commissioner’s review | 10 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? Part A problem The proposed approach to address the problem of low contribution rates is to introduce additional 6% and 10% optional employee contribution rates. These additional rates would give members more flexibility to meet their specific retirement savings needs and have the potential to positively impact KiwiSaver members’ long term savings. A member with an annual gross income of $50,000 gains an additional $1,000 in savings by increasing their contribution rate from 4% to 6% or from 8% to 10% each year. As the additional rates are voluntary the current financial needs of low-income earners will not be adversely affected. Part B problem The proposed approach to address the problem of long contributions holidays is to reduce the maximum period of the contributions holiday from five years to one year. This approach would prompt members to reassess whether they were in a position to resume making contributions after one year rather than five years. For every additional year a member contributing at the default 3% rate with an annual gross income of $50,000 resumes contributions, they gain up to $3,258.93 in savings (including the full member tax credit and compulsory employer contributions). Members would still be able to renew their holiday if their financial circumstances continue to require it and members who do not use KiwiSaver as their primary retirement savings vehicle would not have to substitute away from their other savings. The proposed approaches are not incompatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary: KiwiSaver enhancements resulting from the Retirement Commissioner’s review | 11 Section 4: Impact Analysis (Proposed approach) 4.1 Summary table of costs and benefits 5 Based on the 198,000 employers who filed with Inland Revenue in 2016. The 38 percent using a file transfer filing method use commercial payroll software, it is anticipated over half of the 34 percent of employers using an onscreen filing method also use commercial payroll software. Affected parties Comment: Impact Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties (KiwiSaver members, employers) Part A Employers could see a marginal rise in compliance costs, as there would be additional rates at which employee contributions are made. It is estimated between 38 percent to 55 percent of employers use commercial payroll systems, 5 therefore it is anticipated these employers should not have difficulty with this. The additional rates would be a low level change for payroll system providers and should not be difficult for them to implement. Previous changes in contribution rates (such as the movement in the minimum rate from 4% to 2% and then 3%) have not caused significant issues for employers or payroll system providers. Part B Additional on-going compliance costs for members wanting to renew a contributions holiday, as they would have to actively consider renewal of their holiday each year, rather than every five years. Low Low Regulators (Inland Revenue) Communicating the proposed approaches to the public, employers and scheme providers would have an estimated one-off cost of up to $300,000. Part A Changes to Inland Revenue’s operational systems would have an estimated one-off cost of up to $90,000. Part B Changes to Inland Revenue’s operational systems would have an estimated one-off cost of up to $18,000. Having to renew members’ contributions holidays each year, rather than every five years, would also result in an increase in estimated on-going administrative cost One-off communication cost of up to $300,000. One-off implementation cost of up to $90,000. One-off implementation cost of up to $18,000. Administrative cost of up to $71,000 for 2019-20 and $184,000 for 2020-21. KiwiSaver is scheduled to Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary: KiwiSaver enhancements resulting from the Retirement Commissioner’s review | 12 6 Based on number of people on a contributions holiday at 30 June 2017 and assumes each person would receive a member tax credit payment of $380.00 – the average member tax credit amount claimed by members on a contributions holiday (who were making voluntary contributions). for Inland Revenue of up to $71,000 for 2019-20 and $184,000 for 2020-21. be transferred into Inland Revenue’s new computer system (START) in 2020, which may reduce on- going delivery costs. Wider government Part A The additional rates should not have a fiscal impact (members earning an annual gross income of $26,071.50 contributing at the existing 4% rate contribute enough to receive the full member tax credit). Part B Assuming the proposed approach encourages members to come off contributions holidays earlier more members would be entitled to the member tax credit. Low If all members currently on a contributions holiday resumed making contributions the fiscal cost would be approximately $30 million. If only members on a five year holiday resumed contributions the fiscal cost would be approximately $23million. 6 Actual fiscal costs are likely to be significantly less, as costs would consistently decline based on the members on a contributions holiday that decided to renew their holiday. Other parties No other parties are impacted. No impact. Total Monetised Cost Administrative costs for Inland Revenue. One-off cost of $408,000, on-going cost of up to $71,000 for 2019-20 and $184,000 for 2020-21 period. Non-monetised costs Compliance costs on KiwiSaver members and employers and increase in member tax credit payable by the Government. Low Expected benefits of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties (KiwiSaver members) Part A Additional 6% and 10% employee contribution rates could encourage members to self-select a higher rate and increase their savings. Low (as both Part A and Part B would be voluntary, the aggregate increase in members’ savings is difficult to predict). Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary: KiwiSaver enhancements resulting from the Retirement Commissioner’s review | 13 Part B Reducing the maximum contributions holiday period to one year prompts members to reassess whether they are in a financial position to resume contributions. Resuming contributions earlier would increase members’ savings. Regulators (Inland Revenue) N/A N/A Wider government N/A N/A Other parties N/A N/A Total Monetised Benefit N/A N/A Non-monetised benefits Increase in KiwiSaver members long- term retirement savings. Low Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary: KiwiSaver enhancements resulting from the Retirement Commissioner’s review | 14 4.2 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? The exact impact the proposed approaches would have on KiwiSaver member’s contribution behaviour cannot be anticipated. As the proposed changes are voluntary there is the risk they might not have the desired effect of increasing the amount KiwiSaver members are contributing. However, consultation and surveys undertaken as part of the Review suggested there was public support for the proposed approaches: • 85.6 percent of respondents were in support of more flexible contribution rates (the proposed approach to address low employee contribution rates); and • 51.6 percent of respondents supported reducing the maximum contributions holiday period (the proposed approach to address long contributions holidays). This suggests there should be a notable group of KiwiSaver members who would be responsive to the proposed approaches (particularly in respect of the approach to address low employee contribution rates). Section 5: Stakeholder views 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? As part of the previous Government’s response to the Review (which was co-ordinated by MBIE) the Treasury, MBIE, and MSD had the opportunity to express their views on the proposed approaches. Inland Revenue has also separately consulted with the agencies jointly responsible for KiwiSaver – MBIE and the Treasury, who agreed with the proposed approaches. Inland Revenue has consulted with KiwiSaver scheme providers, and they generally support the proposed approaches. A working group made up of representatives from 11 KiwiSaver scheme providers also made a written submission as part of the Review consultation process. Inland Revenue have not consulted further with employers or KiwiSaver members, relying instead on the public consultation which was undertaken as part of the Review - in the form of interviews, written submissions and surveys (approximately 11,200 surveys were completed on retirement income policy, with 1,830 of those being specifically on KiwiSaver). Members and employers would also have had the opportunity to provide feedback on the proposed changes after the Government’s letter of response to the Review was released publicly. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary: KiwiSaver enhancements resulting from the Retirement Commissioner’s review | 15 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? The proposals will require amendment to the KiwiSaver Act 2006. Amendments would be included in the next available omnibus tax bill, currently scheduled for introduction in May 2018. The changes would come into effect onc e this bill has been enacted into law. It is anticipated this would be in early 2019. We are proposing that transitional arrangements be put in place for KiwiSaver members on contributions holidays of longer than a year, when the changes are enacted. These members would not be subject to the reduced maximum contribution holiday period, until their current contribution holiday expires. Inland Revenue would be responsible for the on-going administration of the new arrangements. Inland Revenue officials have assessed the magnitude of these administrative impacts, and consider that they would be manageable to implement in the proposed timeframe. The Minister of Revenue would make an announcement, on the contents of the proposed omnibus tax bill (including these proposals) when it is introduced in the House. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary: KiwiSaver enhancements resulting from the Retirement Commissioner’s review | 16 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue would monitor the outcomes pursuant to the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTTP) to confirm that they match the policy objectives. The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. Inland Revenue also currently collects data on members’ employee contribution rates and contributions holiday duration periods. This data could help inform an assessment of how many members’ contributions behaviour has changed as a result of the proposed approaches. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The final step in the GTPP is the implementation and review stage, which involves post- implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues. Post- implementation review is expected to occur around 12 months after implementation. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. Any necessary changes identified as a result of the review would be recommended for addition to the Government's tax policy work programme. As the Retirement Commissioner’s review of retirement income policies is conducted every three years, the next review in 2019 would also provide an opportunity to reflect on the level of support for the proposed approaches. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary: KiwiSaver enhancements resulting from the Retirement Commissioner’s review | 17 Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler – Improvements to the administration of tax for individuals. Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue and Treasury are solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA), except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis The proposals were developed as part of the overall business transformation programme that Inland Revenue is currently working through; they build on other changes being made within that programme with a view to improving the overall administration of the New Zealand tax system by reducing compliance and administrative costs as well as looking to simplify the system for taxpayers and give them certainty about their obligations. As a result of the extensive public consultation there are few limitations or constraints on the analysis of the final proposals as there was a high level of engagement from stakeholders in the policy development process. There were, however, two constraints to the analysis of the financial impacts of the proposal: •For those taxpayers who have treated themselves as not being required to file tax returns under current law it has been assumed those individuals do not have other income that should have been separately returned to Inland Revenue. This may include rental income, dividend income or other non-source deducted income. It may be that those taxpayers should have been filing a tax return; and •For those who have used the correct tax code/rate and would therefore not be required to pay any resulting tax liability the analysis has been constrained by the frequency on which Inland Revenue currently receives that tax deduction data. It is currently received on a monthly or twice monthly basis whereas in the future this will be on a payday basis which should enable correct tax rates to be more accurately monitored. This limitation may suggest that tax rates are more or less correct than they actually are if more frequent information was used in the analysis. Responsible Manager (signature and date): Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 1 3. Mike Nutsford Policy Manager Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 14 March 2018 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 2 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? The current law generally allows those taxpayers who derive only source deducted income (reportable income 1 ) not to file a tax return. However, the rules around when a person should file a return are not well understood by taxpayers. In addition, the current “non-filing” regime incentivises taxpayers to actively seek out tax refunds by filing a return and not returning when a debit arises, requiring them to determine if they are in an over-withheld or under-withheld position. The filing of a tax return can be difficult for individuals; many find it difficult to obtain and retain records relating to their income and the process of filing the return is seen as complex. Although Inland Revenue automatically releases refunds of less than $600 after a personal tax summary has been issued many taxpayers continue to engage intermediaries to determine whether they are due a tax refund. The more timely information that will shortly be received by Inland Revenue 2 from those who deduct tax at source will allow Inland Revenue to undertake more proactive actions to ensure that the level of withholding during the year is more accurate which should reduce the number and level of tax “square-ups” required at the end of the year. The changes proposed in this RIA build on this increased provision of information to, for most taxpayers, automatically calculate their year-end square up. This will either automatically send them a refund or a notice to pay under limited situations 3 . These changes will mean that approximately three million taxpayers will have their tax position automatically dealt with and save these people either having to file a return, engage with a tax agent to receive a refund or interact with Inland Revenue to determine their own tax position (either through MyIR 4 or by phone). The proposals will also simplify the claiming of donation tax credits 5 by moving these into the income tax return process and allowing taxpayers to supply receipts during the year through an on-line portal rather than at the end of the year when receipts may have been misplaced. The counterfactual to the proposal is to leave the current rules in place and although Inland Revenue could still be more pro-active during the year to reduce any over or under payments there will be no corresponding reduction in compliance costs for taxpayers at the end of the year to determine whether they are due a tax refund or there is a balance to pay. The proposal will decrease these compliance costs and deliver any refunds directly to taxpayers without any cost to them. 1 Reportable income is income that has tax deducted at source. This includes income from employment, interest, dividends, Mãori Authority distributions and employee share scheme benefits. 2 Due to changes to information gathering contained in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017-18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Bill 3 These will only be issued where the tax liability is over a $20 threshold or where the person has advised their correct tax code or rate but that tax has not been deducted correctly. 4 MyIR – is Inland Revenue’s web based platform. 5 A tax credit against taxable income is available for donations of $5 or more to approved organisations. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 3 The proposals in this RIA align with the information gathering changes contained in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017- 18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Bill and as a consequence to obtain full benefit of the proposals they need to be implemented at the same time, starting 1 April 2019 for the 2018-19 tax year. In addition the timing of the introduction of these new rules is aligned to release three of the business transformation programme which will enable these changes to be implemented at the same time individuals’ income tax is brought within the new START 6 computer system. This release is scheduled for April 2019. 2.2 Who is affected and how? The proposals will affect the approximately three million taxpayers who currently only derive reported income. It will enable those taxpayers who are overtaxed for some reason to directly receive their refund without having to engage with Inland Revenue or an intermediary no matter what the level of that refund rather than being restricted to refunds less than $600. For those who have an underpayment in certain, limited, circumstances they will receive a notification of any debt. However, those taxpayers who have had tax withheld in accordance with the deduction rules will not have to pay any resulting shortfall. The proposal will reduce taxpayer compliance costs in having to determine their final tax position and obtain any associated refund. It will be paid in full to them automatically notwithstanding the level of that refund. It will also simplify the claiming of donation tax credits and allow taxpayers to supply receipts during the year instead of having to retain these and claim them at the end of the year. Again this will assist people in claiming tax credits for donations and bring these within the automatic square up process for year-end for most taxpayers. Officials consider these proposals, in conjunction with the increased levels of proactive actions Inland Revenue will take based on more frequent income information, very beneficial for the affected taxpayers. 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? There have been no constraints on the scope for decision making. The proposals consider in this RIA have been subject to public consultation with some changes being made to the final proposals as a result of that consultation. These proposals are dependent on the more timely information reporting of payroll and investment income that is included in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017- 18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Bill as this provides the platform to enable Inland Revenue to more proactively ensure that taxpayers have the correct rate and tax code 6 START - Simplified Tax and Revenue Technology – the new information technology platform being introduced by Inland Revenue as part of its business transformation programme. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 4 during the year to minimise the amount of any end of year square up. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 5 Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options have been considered? The overarching objective is to minimise the interaction required by individual taxpayers. This has been assessed against the following criteria: • Compliance costs – Compliance costs are minimised as far as possible • Administration costs – Administration costs are minimised as far as possible • Sustainability – The options should collect the revenue required in a transparent and timely manner while not leading to tax driven outcomes and enable the efficient administration of the social policies administered by Inland Revenue Year End Process Three options were considered: • Option 1: The status quo • Option 2: An improved status quo • Option 3: An automatic square-up process Option 1: status quo Taxpayers who derive only source deducted income (reportable income 7 ) are not required to file a tax return. At the end of the year those taxpayers who have only reportable income and have a refund owing because of over taxation of under $600 have that refund automatically issued along with a personal tax summary. Those taxpayers who have over $200 of non-reportable income must file either a personal tax summary or a tax return to claim any refund, or square up any liability. Option 2: an improved status quo Under an improved status quo Inland Revenue would use the information provided by the more timely reporting of payroll and investment income to issue more personal tax summaries to taxpayers where under or over payments were identified. This would require taxpayers to confirm or otherwise complete the personal tax summary (unless any refund arising was less than $600 in which case it would continue to be automatically released along with a personal tax summary). Once that had been done a resulting refund would be issued, alternatively a debt would be issued. This option has the benefit of a taxpayer turning their mind to their tax position and confirming that position before a refund is issued which can increase the integrity of the system where a taxpayer earns other non-source deducted income. The downside of this is the increased interaction for the majority of taxpayers who only have reportable income. It also has the disadvantage where a taxpayer does not automatically receive a personal tax 7 Reportable income is income that has tax deducted at source. This includes income from employment, interest, dividends, Mãori Authority distributions and employee share scheme benefits. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 6 summary they have to assess whether they need to request one. Option 3: automatic square-up process (preferred option) This option is based on the premise that for the majority of taxpayers Inland Revenue will hold all the information required to enable it to calculate an end of year tax position for a taxpayer and the step of having a person confirm through the compilation of a personal tax summary is unnecessary. The advantage of this proposal is that it is much easier for taxpayers to understand, offers a better balance between compliance costs and accuracy than option 2, better utilises the increased information available to Inland Revenue from third parties and reduces the number of taxpayers who will have to provide information to Inland Revenue. The disadvantage to this option is that some taxpayers who do not currently interact with the tax system (on the assumption that their reported income has been accurately withheld from) may now have to interact. In the majority this will be receiving a refund where previously they may not have claimed one but the interaction may cause taxpayers some concern. Flow-on effects In addition to these overriding options, a number of other flow-on effects of the year-end process were considered under two headings: • Who has to “square-up” at year end ?; and • How should donation tax credits be dealt with in the future? Who has to square-up at year end? Three options were canvassed in respect of who should have to square up at year end: • Option 1: The status quo – taxpayers are required to obtain a personal tax summary where they have more than $200 of reportable income taxed at the incorrect rate and have to square up any tax shortfall. Those who have a refund of greater than $600 are required to confirm a personal tax summary and automatic refunds for those less than $600; • Option 2: A monetary threshold – taxpayers who have tax to pay or a refund under a certain level would not receive notification for payment or a refund; or • Option 3: The notification model – taxpayers who have advised the payers of their reportable income their correct tax code or rate and the payers are correctly using that code but have still ended up with a shortfall should not have to square up any shortfall as they have met their obligations in respect of their tax affairs. Any refunds ari sing would be automatically refunded. How should donation tax credits be dealt with under the new proposal? Donation tax credits are currently claimed annually using a specific form issued by Inland Revenue. There were a number of options considered to improve this process given the proposed changes to the way the end of year square up was undertaken. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 7 Three options were considered: • Option 1: The status quo with taxpayers either supplying receipts during the year or saving their receipts until the end of the year and then filing a rebate claim form at the end of the tax year to claim the credit; • Option 2: Remove the need for a separate rebate claim form and have taxpayers complete the claim as part of an end of year square up process either through filing a tax return or a personal tax summary; and • Option 3: Allow taxpayers to submit their donation receipts to Inland Revenue during the year which could then form part of their year-end square-up process through either an automatic square-up or tax return process. 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? Year End Process Officials consider that option 3, an automatic square-up process for taxpayers who only derive reportable income, is the preferred option. Essentially these proposals will result in only those taxpayers who derive more than $200 of non-reportable income 8 , are a non- resident, have tax losses, are subject to the financial arrangement regime or pay provisional tax will need to file a tax return or personal tax summary. It provides taxpayers with a large reduction in compliance costs while not adversely affecting those taxpayers who are using the correct tax codes and rates and who do not currently interact with Inland Revenue (as option 2 might have, depending on the level of the tax to pay threshold). Option 3 also better utilises the more timely information provided to Inland Revenue by third parties in respect of reportable income than the other options. Although all options would allow Inland Revenue to closely monitor and correct any tax code or rate issues which should result in a more accurate tax position for taxpayers, option 3 uses those pro-active actions more fully for taxpayers. In the majority of cases option 3 will ensure that taxpayers receive a refund automatically and not receive a bill where they have ensured that their rate and tax code are correct. This has the benefit of no interaction with Inland Revenue for those taxpayers where option 1 required an interaction prior to the issue of a refund (except for those less than $600). It also provides taxpayers with the certainty that unless they earn non-reportable income they don’t need to consider if they need to file a return or personal tax summary as it will all be completed for them automatically. Who has to square-up any underpayments? 8 Non-reportable income will include amounts not subject to tax at source this would include contracting income or other income not subject to withholding taxes. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 8 The status quo did not ultimately fit with the objective of attempting to minimise the interaction required by taxpayers and, in fact, may have had the opposite effect and was discarded. After consultation it was decided that a combination of the latter two options provided the best outcome for taxpayers and Inland Revenue. Two monetary thresholds will apply, one for refunds paid by cheque where only refunds above $5 will be issued by cheque (there is no threshold for electronic payments) and the other for debts less than $20 which will not be assessed/collected from taxpayers. The $5 limit recognises the cost of processing a manual payment. The $20 limit reflects the approximate cost of collection of the small balance. Any credits not refunded under that threshold may be carried forward to future periods any debits under the threshold will be extinguished, rather than being carried forward. In addition, there is an overriding assumption the correct tax code/rate has been used on reportable income. In that case no square-up will be required no matter what the level of the liability. Further, even where an incorrect rate has been used, a square-up will only be required if the incorrect rate was applied to more than $200 of income. Officials consider this combination of the two options provides the best outcome for taxpayers who only derive reportable income, in that, as long as they have ensured that the correct rate or code has been supplied to the payer they have discharged their obligation to ensure their tax position is correct. How should donation tax credits be dealt with under the new proposal? Because donation tax credits could be claimed by a taxpayers who follow differing year-end square up processes it is necessary to have multiple options for taxpayers to use. In addition, there may be a number of options that taxpayers want to enable them to claim their tax rebates. Some maybe comfortable with saving their receipts and claiming these at the end of the year as they already do, others may want to supply receipts when they get them and those who are still required to file a tax return because they have other non-reportable income may want the convenience of claiming their rebate as part of that tax return process. Ultimately officials’ preference is to proceed with all these options as each option has merits for taxpayers dependent on their year-end square up process but also allowing flexibility for taxpayers as to the best way for them to claim their donation tax credits. The proposal is that taxpayers have three ways to claim their donation rebate: 1. They can continue with the current process of filing a separate rebate claim form and either save the receipts until the end of the year or provide these during the year. They could do this whether or not they are required to file a tax return or are part of the automatic square-up process; or 2. For those who are required to file a tax return because of non-reportable income they can choose to include the donation tax credit claim on their tax return for the year supplying the receipts at that time; or 3. A taxpayer could upload their donation receipts to Inland Revenue during the year and these could be automatically refunded at the end of the year (or potentially prepopulated on their tax return should they be required to file one). Officials consider this reduces taxpayer compliance costs and also provides taxpayers with flexibility for the particular system that they are comfortable with to make their donation tax Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 9 credit claim. The preferred options are not incompatible with the Government’s “Expectations for the design of regulatory systems”. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 10 Section 4: Impact Analysis (Proposed approach) 4.1 Summary table of costs and benefits 9 Business transformation has committed to deliver additional Crown revenue of $2,880m - $6,175 million (including inflation) by 2023/24 as a result of improved voluntary compliance and better use of information and analytics to identify and address non-compliance. The Government has already accounted for the lower end of this range in its fiscal forecasts. These numbers took into account the broad direction of policy intent, as signalled through the Government’s discussion document, Making Tax Simpler: A Government Green Paper on Tax Administration (including early thinking on individuals’ income tax returns), in addition to the further changes that will be delivered as part of Business Transformation. 10 The data is based on a sample of taxpayers and has been scaled up to population estimates. This data only looks at non-filing individuals earning employment income which is reported on Employee Monthly Schedules, and calculates their likely refund or tax to pay by comparing the actual tax withheld on this income with the amount of tax that should have been withheld. 11 Inland Revenue will be taking proactive action during the year to reduce the number and size of end-of-year discrepancies by moving people to better tax rates and codes so that they only pay what they need to during the year. Accordingly, total year-end refunds issued and total year-end tax to pay will not reflect this static analysis of the quantum of unclaimed refunds or amounts of tax to pay, as year end refunds/amounts to pay will reduce over tim e. Affected parties (identify) Comment: nature of cost or benefit (eg ongoing, one-off), evidence and assumption (eg compliance rates), risks Impact $m present value, for monetised impacts; high, medium or low for non- monetised impacts Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action 9 Regulated parties Monetary costs for non-filing taxpayers who will be required to pay tax Up to $50m 10 in tax to pay. This is not a forecast, but rather a static analysis of unpaid sums larger than $20 in the 2016 tax year. The $50m does not take account of the amounts that would not have to be paid (because they were withheld in accordance with the rules) suggesting that the total will be lower than $50m. Inland Revenue is not able to quantify what proportion of the $50 million would not be payable. Regulators Administrative costs for Inland Revenue of dealing with customer enquiries or contacts, these are likely to be transitional as people get used to the new rules. These will be accommodated within the Business Transformation programme funding allocated to Inland Revenue. Wider government Reduction in Government revenue through issuing refunds which are not currently issued. $150m 11 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 11 Other parties Total Monetised Cost $200m Non-monetised costs Negative impact on business models of agents or intermediaries who currently file personal tax summaries for customers Expected benefits of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties Monetary benefits for current non-filing taxpayers who will automatically receive refunds Cost saving for taxpayers who currently prepare and file personal tax summaries $150m Regulators Reduced administrative costs for Inland Revenue over time These will be accommodated within the Business Transformation programme funding allocated to Inland Revenue. Wider government Increase in Government revenue through collecting amounts of tax which are not currently collected Up to $50m Other parties Total Monetised Benefit $200m Non-monetised benefits The macroeconomic impacts of the flow-on effects from private individuals consuming, investing and/or saving their refunds and, conversely, the private economic activity forgone by individuals who have more tax to pay have not been quantified. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 12 4.2 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? The associated simplification of the year-end system and perceived fairness to those who are over taxed during the year should have a positive benefit on the way taxpayers view Inland Revenue and the tax system as whole. It also provides a clear tangible benefit to taxpayers from the business transformation programme. The automatic year-end square-up of most taxpayer tax affairs may mean a significant number of clients will no longer need to use an intermediary to file a tax return or personal tax summary on their behalf. Section 5: Stakeholder views 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? The proposals and preferred options outlined in this RIA were subject to public consultation in the discussion document Making Tax Simpler – Better Administration of Individuals’ Income Tax released by the Minister of Revenue in June 2017. There was also an online forum for the public to make comment on the proposals and a survey was undertaken to gain insights to the final proposals. The submissions on the options were evenly split between supporting the preferred option and proposing a variation on the preferred option which would require individuals to confirm their tax position before an assessment was finalised and a refund issued. This latter approach had been previously ruled out by the Government. A further approach was proposed by two submitters and this was incorporated into the final proposals. This approach was to eliminate a year-end square up for underpayments where the taxpayer had met all their obligations to advise payers of reported income their correct tax code or rate. The other proposals were supported by submitters, including those relating to small balance square-up amounts and claims for donation tax credits. None of the proposals specifically affect iwi and although they had an opportunity to submit on the proposals through the public consultation process it was not considered necessary to separately consult on the proposals with them. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 13 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? The proposed changes are expected to be included in a tax bill to be introduced in early 2018 with application from 1 April 2019 for the 2018-19 income year as this is when the associated changes to the provision of information by payers of reportable income will become mandatory. This date will allow Inland Revenue to commence its proactive actions to ensure that taxpayers are using the correct tax rates and codes and suggest alternatives when that is not the case. The first returns that will be subject to the new year-end square-up process will be for the tax year ended 31 March 2019. Inland Revenue will have responsibility for the implementation and ongoing operation and enforcement of the proposals and will have a communications programme for educating taxpayers of these changes at the time they are implemented. Inland Revenue has extensive experience in implementing, operating and enforcement of these types of changes. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 14 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? As part of the implementation and operation, Inland Revenue will be continuously monitoring the effectiveness of the proposals. This is a normal part of the work Inland Revenue does in respect of the tax system to ensure that the rules and processes are fit for purpose. Monitoring and enforcement can only be effective once Inland Revenue is receiving the additional and more timely information from payers of reportable income as it is only at this time that Inland Revenue can increase its proactive actions to ensure taxpayers are using the correct tax code and rates. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? As part of the ongoing monitoring and evaluation, Inland Revenue will be constantly reviewing the outcomes of the proposals with a view to assessing the effectiveness of the changes. As with all aspects of the tax system Inland Revenue is constantly reviewing the outcomes to identify any issues that may need remediation. Inland Revenue also has a number of channels for taxpayers and the public in general to raise any specific concerns with the tax system and it has appropriate pathways to address those concerns. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 15 Coversheet: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information Advising agencies Inland Revenue Decision sought Update aspects of the legislative frameworks in the Tax Administration Act dealing with collection, use and disclosure of information Proposing Ministers Minister of Revenue Summary: Problem and Proposed Approach Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? Information flows are key to Inland Revenue’s ability to carry out its functions and to fulfil its role in wider government. Business Transformation provides both a need and an opportunity to examine the rules regarding information to ensure they are fit for purpose for a modern tax administration. The current rules, particularly in relation to information disclosure, have developed in an ad hoc fashion and are complex, inflexible and lacking transparency. While the information collection rules generally work well, there is an opportunity to improve transparency with two minor enhancements. Proposed Approach How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option? The proposals aim to make the information disclosure and use provisions clearer and more principled and to provide greater flexibility and transparency. A new, more targeted confidentiality rule will better focus the rule on protecting what should be protected, namely taxpayer-s pecific information, while allowing disclosure of a wider range of non-taxpayer information. A clearer, more principled exceptions framework will provide greater transparency. The proposed enhancements to the information collection rules will also provide greater certainty and transparency regarding Inland Revenue’s regular collection and use of certain third party information. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 1 4. Section B: Summary Impacts: Benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? In relation to information sharing the main expected benefits will fall to other agencies who are able to more easily access Inland Revenue’s information for service provision or enforcement. This will also have benefits for customers where it reduces the need to provide the same information to multiple agencies and/or ensures they receive more accurate, up-to-date entitlements. For information collection the main expected benefits will be administrative for Inland Revenue in having regular access to datasets that can be used for compliance, service delivery and education purposes. There may also be compliance cost reductions to taxpayers from improved service, including from increased pre-population of returns. Where do the costs fall? There may be increased administrative costs to Inland Revenue in developing and administering increased numbers of information shares, however Business Transformation provides the opportunity to do this in a more efficient manner. New regulations for repeated collection of datasets may impose costs on the entity from which the information is collected. When considering proposed new collection regulations these potential costs will be taken into account. It is not possible to quantify the costs at this time, as the changes that may result in additional costs will occur when regulations are made under the new information sharing and collection empowering provisions. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? With all information sharing there is a risk of privacy breaches. This also raises a concern that increased sharing or any breaches might reduce the willingness of customers to provide their information to Inland Revenue. Consideration of privacy impacts (including consultation with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner) and potential impacts on the integrity of the tax system are built into the proposed information sharing rules. Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. There is no significant incompatibility with the Government’s “Expectations for the design of regulatory systems”. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 2 Section C: Evidence certainty and quality assurance Agency rating of evidence certainty? Inland Revenue is confident that the evidence supports the proposal. Inland Revenue has extensive experience working with the confidentiality rules and the issues that arise with the current framework. While the total costs and benefits cannot be quantified at this time as they primarily arise from regulations that would be made under proposed empowering provisions, past experience with both ad hoc large dataset collection and with information sharing arrangements entered into under current provisions has seen the generation of significant benefits. To be completed by quality assurers: Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – information collection, use and disclosure Regulatory Impact Analysis and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Analysis meets the Quality Assurance criteria. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: The reviewer’s comments on earlier versions of the Regulatory Impact Assessment have been incorporated into the final version. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 3 Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Statement, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by Cabinet. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 4 Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis The impact analysis is limited because there is some uncertainty about: • The number of new information sharing arrangements that may be sought by other agencies; • The timeframe and resource that might be involved in moving existing sharing arrangements from the current rules into the proposed new framework; and • The scope of datasets to which regular access might be sought under the proposed regulatory framework. Number of information sharing arrangements that may be sought by other agencies At any given time Inland Revenue has several proposals from other agencies for information sharing under consideration or development. These are assessed using a set of internally developed principles and prioritised accordingly. Inland Revenue has a dedicated team and governance structure that monitors and prioritises these requests. The number of requests in train at any one time can vary, as can the complexity of the requests. At the time of this analysis there were nine new information sharing proposals at various stages of being considered or progressed. The current framework means that some of these proposed arrangements can be dealt with by way of regulation; however, others involve statutory amendment. This can be a time consuming process. The proposed new rules will mean arrangements can be more flexible and completed more quickly. However there is some uncertainty about how many new or amended arrangements may be sought and therefore the extent of any administrative impacts. In general this will be able to be managed by the prioritisation process; however, at times agencies or Ministers may not have aligned priorities, placing pressure on resources. Timeframe and resource for moving existing arrangements to the new framework Alongside new requests for sharing, Inland Revenue and partner agencies also review and consider potential changes to existing arrangements. For example, changes have recently been made to information sharing with the Ministry of Social Development, moving the arrangements into the Approved Information Sharing Agreement framework rather than the previous information matching rules which required very specific legislative exceptions. It is proposed that existing legislative provisions will be grand-parented into the new rules and then gradually replaced by arrangements under the new framework as and when they are updated. Again, while there is some uncertainty about the timeframe and resource requirements for this work, and when other agencies will look to alter their arrangements, this can generally be prioritised using established procedures. At the time of this analysis, there were nine existing agreements under review, or where alterations have been proposed. Scope of datasets Inland Revenue already has the ability to collect and work with large datasets; however, these datasets are generally obtained on an ad hoc basis. The availability and usefulness of ‘big data’ is an area that is evolving rapidly. Business Transformation will provide Inland Revenue with increased capability to work with such datasets. There is currently scope to obtain and use certain datasets for compliance, educative and pre-population purposes – this is occurring for example in Australia and the United Kingdom. However the benefits of any given dataset will vary and the identification of potentially useful datasets will be an iterative process. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 5 As a general rule, Inland Revenue would have previously trialled the collection of data (or data of a similar type) using its general collection power before seeking a regulation. Previous collection and analysis of the dataset will assist to demonstrate the benefits of collecting the data regularly. Prior collection will also enable prioritisation of datasets for regular collection. While overseas experience indicates certain areas where repeat dataset collection would be valuable, the number or scope of datasets that might be sought under the proposed new rule is unclear at this time, which constrains the analysis of the benefits. Responsible Manager (signature and date): Chris Gillion Policy Manager Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 15 February 2018 Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 6 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the context within which action is proposed? For most public sector agencies the primary rules governing collection and disclosure of information are found in the Privacy Act 1993 and the Official Information Act 1982. For Inland Revenue, however, the primary rules are contained in Part 4 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The efficient and effective administration of the tax system depends on taxpayers disclosing often significant amounts of information to Inland Revenue. Information is provided by both individuals and corporates and may be about themselves or about others, for example, employers provide information both about their own affairs and abut their employees. The types of information collected covers a considerable range, including identity and contact information, income details, for social policy customers information about relationships and household income, for businesses detailed commercial information. This need for information and the broad powers Inland Revenue is granted to obtain it are seen as balanced by a strict rule of confidentiality, often referred to as the “tax secrecy” rule. The right of taxpayers to have their information kept confidential is also specifically recognised in section 6 of the Tax Administration Act in defining the integrity of the tax system. Over time, increasing numbers of ad hoc exceptions have been added to the tax secrecy rule. The primary exception, in place since the inception of the rule, permits Inland Revenue to disclose information in order to carry out its functions. Many other exceptions, however, relate to disclosure to other agencies for purposes not related, or not directly related, to Inland Revenue’s functions (for example to administer the accident compensation scheme, or the benefits system). Inland Revenue already shares a significant amount of information, primarily with other government agencies; therefore the proposed changes are not a new concept. The proposals are intended to clarify and update the confidentiality and sharing rules. A key aim is to more clearly balance the trade-offs inherent in decisions about whether to share. The current rules, due to the ad hoc nature of amendments over time, could be seen to lack cohesion, transparency and clear unifying principles. In addition, the breadth of the core rule itself (protecting all matters relating to the legislation administered by Inland Revenue) appears much wider than the rationale for the rule would suggest is necessary. The previous Government, through initiatives such as Better Public Services, has been focused on improving the use of information within and across agencies. Achieving better outcomes for New Zealanders through wider and smarter use of data is a key focus. The Data Futures Forum, and subsequent Data Futures Partnership have been considering how to get the best value from data in a rapidly changing environment. Rather than taking a siloed approach, agencies are encouraged to work together to provide services. Other related work includes reviewing the settings in the Privacy Act and the Statistics Act, and a focus on the social investment approach which is strongly data-driven. Draft Customs and Excise legislation before Parliament also contains modernised information sharing rules. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 7 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place? The information and confidentiality (“tax secrecy”) rules form a key aspect of the Tax Administration Act framework, with confidentiality of taxpayer information specified as an important aspect of the integrity of the tax system. Inland Revenue has broad powers to obtain the information it needs to fulfil its function of managing the tax system. These powers are balanced with a requirement to keep information confidential. Inland Revenue has a Regulatory Stewardship Strategy published in August 2017 (EGI-17- MIN-0210) that has assessed the fitness for purpose of Inland Revenue’s regulatory systems. The Tax Administration Act generally falls within the revenue raising and collection regulatory system and the strategy also includes a specific information sharing regulatory system. As noted in the Regulatory Stewardship Strategy, information sharing arrangements aim at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of government and to provide better services and outcomes to customers. This is balanced against the need to maintain taxpayer trust that their information is not disclosed inappropriately. The strategy notes that the rules are constantly being looked at and that this review has been carried out to modernise and clarify the rules to better balance the inherent trade-offs and provide for confidentiality and sharing in a customer centric and intelligence led environment. 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? The Business Transformation programme provides both a need and an opportunity to consider the regulatory settings relating to Inland Revenue’s information. Increasing digitisation of information and processes provides opportunities to better utilise data, both within Inland Revenue to assist taxpayers, and, where appropriate, across government to improve the provision of public services. The current rules regarding information collection, use and disclosure were developed in a paper-based environment, and while many of the underlying principles remain applicable, Business Transformation provides the opportunity to ensure the rules continue to be fit for purpose and make the most of the improved technology. The confidentiality of taxpayer information is a key component of the integrity of the tax system and remains the norm among international revenue agencies. Information flows are crucial to the efficient and effective administration of the tax system. Confidentiality rules are seen as facilitating this in three ways: • encouraging people to provide information with the confidence it will be used and protected appropriately; • acting as a balance for the broad information collection powers of Inland Revenue; and • acting to protect taxpayer privacy. The current confidentiality or “tax secrecy” rule is extremely broad and covers all matters relating to the legislation administered by Inland Revenue. However, the reasons for the rule indicate the primary concern is information about taxpayers. The existing rule can lead to tensions between confidentiality and the Official Information Act’s principle of open access to government information. The current rule can also give rise to tensions between confidentiality and wider government objectives that can be achieved through increased Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 8 information sharing. Inland Revenue deals with large numbers of documents, forms, letters and tax returns that contain information about matters such as taxpayers’ circumstances, income or assets. Outside of the tax return process, Inland Revenue can require a person to provide any information considered “necessary or relevant” to Inland Revenue’s functions. The information collection powers work well and no significant change is recommended. However, two areas have been identified where change is considered of benefit - the regular collection of large datasets and the re-use of information within Inland Revenue. In both cases a key benefit is increased transparency for taxpayers regarding the collection of information about them and the possible uses of this information. The proposed empowering provision for regulations governing repeat collection of large datasets would provide a more efficient mechanism for Inland Revenue to regularly obtain necessary or relevant information for compliance, analytical and educative purposes. 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? There were no particular constraints on the options considered. In considering the wide spectrum of options the importance of confidentiality rules to robust international tax information exchange (countries can choose not to exchange information with jurisdictions if they are not satisfied with their confidentiality laws) and to the concept of tax system integrity, narrowed the analysis to looking at options which maintained some form of confidentiality rules. The analysis then focused on the degree to which the confidentiality rules might be updated. Another relevant consideration was ensuring, insofar as appropriate, that the rules are aligned with other government frameworks for information – in particular, the Approved Information Sharing Agreement framework in the Privacy Act, the Official Information Act, and reviews being carried out in relation to bespoke legislation such as the Statistics Act and the Customs and Excise Act. Work relating to the social investment approach, in particular data frameworks to support this approach, and the Data Futures programme were also relevant considerations. 2.5 What do stakeholders think? The treatment of taxpayer information affects all taxpayers and there are various stakeholders that have an interest. The issue will not affect Māori in particular. Formal public consultation has been undertaken via two Government discussion documents: Making Tax Simpler: Towards a new Tax Administration Act released in November 2015 and Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act released in December 2016. Both discussion documents had an accompanying online forum. Towards a new Tax Administration Act generated 18 written submissions and 34 comments on the online forum. In relation to information the key themes were: • Mixed reactions to the proposal to narrow tax secrecy, coupled with particular Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 9 concern about the need to protect commercial information and the need for adequate confidentiality protections. • A mixed response to greater information sharing within government – some submitters were supportive but others felt information sharing should be confined to tax-related purposes only. Concern was expressed about agencies being able to obtain information they would not be entitled to collect in their own right. The importance of transparency around sharing was emphasised. • Consent-based disclosure of information was favoured by a narrow majority, so long as it was confined to within government. Some submitters considered that a taxpayer’s ability to access their information themselves (or have an agent access it) was sufficient. • There was general support for clarification regarding collection of large datasets and remote access searching. Some submitters were in support of new rules that would provide more transparency but not of expanding the search powers. Towards a new Tax Administration Act provided a high-level framework for key areas of tax administration. The consultation process indicated that the issues were wide-ranging and complex and would benefit from further, more detailed consultation. Therefore a second discussion document Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act was released in December 2016. The more detailed proposals in this document took into account the feedback received on Towards a new Tax Administration Act. There were 15 written submissions and 19 online comments of Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act. Submissions were generally supportive of the proposals relating to information, provided appropriate safeguards were in place. Key themes were: • General support for limiting the coverage of the secrecy rule so long as commercial information was protected. • Support for clarifying the framework of exceptions and for the proposed cross- government information-sharing framework, so long as other agencies cannot obtain information they are otherwise not entitled to. Consultation was seen as an important component of the framework. • Support for maintaining and clarifying the rules regarding improper disclosure. • Submitters generally favoured the proposed regulation-making power for repeat dataset collection and the additional transparency this would provide. Submitters on both discussion documents comprised a mixture of professional services firms, business, citizen and professional representative bodies, accounting and digital technology businesses, and some private individuals. Inland Revenue has also recently carried out a statutory review of section 81BA of the Tax Administration Act. This provision enables regulations to be made to authorise sharing with other government agencies and is the basis for the proposals regarding enhanced cross- government sharing. The review 1 included consultation with the two departments with whom agreements have been entered into (ACC and the Ministry of Social Development) and with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, The Treasury, and the Ministry of Justice. In general there was support for retaining the provision, preferably with some guidance regarding when it would be more appropriate to use section 81BA than the Approved Information Sharing 1 http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2017-other-report-review-s81b-taa.pdf Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 10 Agreement framework in the Privacy Act. The review concluded that section 81BA should be retained pending the outcome of the wider consultation regarding the confidentiality and information sharing rules addressed in this regulatory impact analysis. Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? The options for analysis fall into three broad categories – collection, use and disclosure of information and have been analysed within these categories. The three categories can be viewed as stand-alone, and are not interdependent. The recommended package of options (summarised at 5.1) contains options from all three categories. The most significant parts of the package are the proposals that will make it easier for Inland Revenue to undertake repeat collection of large datasets from external sources and for Inland Revenue to share its information with other agencies. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION The status quo information collection rules broadly work well. One aspect has been identified where there is an opportunity to make the rules more efficient and to improve transparency. This relates to the repeat collection of large datasets – under the status quo this can be done on an ad hoc basis by issuing a section 17 request, but this process is not well suited to situations where the information is sought on a repeating, regular basis. There are two alternative options: Collection option 1: Amend the information collection power to provide specifically for repeat collection of large datasets This option would see an amendment to the existing information collection power to specifically cover repeated collection of large external datasets. Such collection can already be carried out on an ad hoc basis, however for regular collection of the same datasets it is considered that more specific rules are required. Such collection would continue to be based on the existing “necessary or relevant” standard. Submitters on Towards a new Tax Administration Act generally agreed that a more explicit collection power was appropriate, but did not consider there should be expanded powers as Inland Revenue already has broad collection powers. There was unanimous support for retaining the “necessary or relevant” standard. Several submitters considered that if there were to be more explicit powers in relation to bulk data (external datasets) there should be greater transparency about this collection. Some suggested a process similar to the Australian Tax Office publication of data matching protocols should be followed. These protocols set out the bulk datasets collected and broadly the uses to which this information is put. Collection option 2: Introduce a regulation-making power governing repeat collection of large datasets (part of recommended package) Under this option, a specific regulation-making power would be introduced, allowing regulations to be made governing repeat collection of large external datasets. This option responds to submissions seeking greater transparency about this form of collection and was Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 11 detailed in the second consultation document Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act. Submitters generally favoured this option, with the attendant increased transparency, provided there was consultation on the development of regulations and consideration of compliance costs. USE OF INFORMATION In many cases interactions with a customer are related to a particular purpose, or relate to a particular product type – for example personal income tax or Working for Families tax credits. However the information obtained may also be relevant for other purposes, for example the customer’s student loan or child support accounts. In many cases customers, both business and individual have a range of different interaction needs with Inland Revenue and therefore information can be relevant for a range of purposes related to Inland Revenue’s various functions. Under the status quo there is no express statement about the use of information in the Tax Administration Act. However, the Kiwisaver Act 2006 does contain a rule that information collected under that Act can be used for the purposes of any other Inland Revenue Act (and vice versa) 2 . Information use option 1: Express clarification that information gathered for one purpose can be used for other purposes within Inland Revenue (part of recommended package) Under this option, the legislation would expressly state the principle that information collection for the purpose of one of Inland Revenue’s functions can be used for any of its other functions. This is consistent with the approach in the equivalent UK legislation which states “information acquired by the Revenue and Customs in connection with a function may be used by them in connection with any other function.” Submitters were supportive of this option and emphasised the importance of clarity for taxpayers regarding the circumstances in which their information could be used. DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION There are two key areas regarding disclosure for which options have been considered – the scope of the confidentiality rule (that is, what should be the starting point for what can and cannot be disclosed) and the rules regarding sharing information across government. Two additional options for improvements to the rules are also considered. A: Scope of confidentiality rule We have identified a single alternative to the status quo for the scope of the confidentiality rule. This option has been broadened in scope from the original proposal as a result of consultation. Disclosure option 1: Better target the confidentiality rule (part of recommended package) The initial proposal set out in Towards a new Tax Administration Act was to narrow the “tax secrecy” rule to a “taxpayer confidentiality” rule, namely one that was limited to information 2 Kiwisaver Act 2006, section 223. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 12 that would identify (directly or indirectly) a taxpayer. Narrowing the rule in this way would continue to protect taxpayer information, the core reason for the confidentiality rules, but more easily allow the release of anonymised, aggregated information, together with information that did not identify taxpayers – for example, policy information, procurement information, training information and finance and planning information. A more targeted rule is consistent with the confidentiality rules in jurisdictions such as Australia, Canada and the United States. In the United Kingdom the rule extends to information held in connection with the functions of Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, however only information that identifies, or could identify, a taxpayer is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information laws. Submitters expressed concerns about information that, while it might not identify a taxpayer, could still be very sensitive, in particular commercially sensitive information. Several submissions also highlighted the need for safeguards, and for protections to remain in place for commercially sensitive information. A narrowly drafted rule focused on information that identifies a taxpayer would provide a clear boundary but would risk narrowing the protection too far. In order to adequately protect sensitive taxpayer information, the rule should extend past information that is identifying to a rule such as that in Australia, where the protection protects information “that relates to the affairs of, or identifies an entity”. 3 This means that information that does not directly identify a taxpayer will also be protected, as will information that may not even indirectly identify the taxpayer but relates to their affairs – for example, information about a commercially sensitive process that would not identify the taxpayer but is intellectual property that relates to that taxpayer. The new targeted confidentiality rule should also retain protection for certain sensitive non- taxpayer information. Inland Revenue holds certain very sensitive information, besides that relating to taxpayers, the release of which could damage the integrity of the tax system. Such information would include audit and investigative techniques or strategies, compliance information, thresholds and analytical approaches. Releasing this information could affect the Crown’s ability to collect revenue, for example by enabling taxpayers to defraud the system. The Official Information Act allows information to be withheld if the release would prejudice the maintenance of the law, but there is no specific protection for public revenue. In contrast, the Australian Freedom of Information Act 1982 contains a number of protections that are used as grounds by the Australian Tax Office to withhold sensitive non-taxpayer information. Similarly, the United Kingdom freedom of information legislation also contains broader protection for non-taxpayer, sensitive revenue information. The “maintenance of the law” protection may cover some of the sensitive non-taxpayer information outlined above, but it is not clear this would always be the case. The protection of public revenue is considered of sufficient importance that a residual protection should be retained in the confidentiality rule in the Tax Administration Act. 3 Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Commonwealth) Schedule 1, Chapter 5, Division 355. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 13 B: Information sharing The status quo is a combination of specific legislative provisions for each information sharing arrangement and utilising regulatory frameworks set out in section 81BA of the Tax Administration Act and Part 9A of the Privacy Act 1993. The regulatory frameworks provide greater flexibility than specific legislative provisions, however, there is an opportunity to improve the flexibility and usefulness of these rules. Disclosure option 2: Retain a regulatory sharing model with broader principles and extend to “public service provision” (part of recommended package) Section 81BA was put in place prior to the Approved Information Sharing Agreement rules in the Privacy Act. Sharing under 81BA is limited to government agencies, where that agency is lawfully able to collect the information but the provision, collection and verification by that agency is inefficient. While this is, and has been, a useful provision, the criteria are not as flexible as they could be, in particular as regards the limitation to “government agency” and the requirement that it be inefficient for the requesting agency to carry out the collection itself. Under this option, the basic model of section 81BA (information-sharing authorised by regulation) is retained but some greater flexibility would be introduced to allow sharing for “public service provision” rather than only with government agencies. Under this option the criteria would be modernised to permit sharing where: • providing the information will improve the ability of the government to efficiently and effectively deliver services or enforce laws; and • the information is more easily or more efficiently obtained from or verified by Inland Revenue than from other sources; and • the amount and type of information provided is proportionate given the purpose for which it is being shared; and • the information will be adequately protected by the receiving agency; and • sharing the information will not unduly inhibit the provision of information to the Inland Revenue Department in the future. These criteria are similar to those in 81BA, the key differences being a relaxation in the requirement that information sharing occur only when direct collection/verification is inefficient, to permitting sharing where it is more easily or efficiently obtained from, or verified by, Inland Revenue, and the introduction of an express proportionality consideration. Consideration of any impacts on future information provision to Inland Revenue, and requirements for adequate protection by the receiving agency are similar to those in section 81BA. Extending the provision to sharing for “provision of public services” rather than limiting to government agencies makes this option more consistent with the Privacy Act Approved Information Sharing Agreement rules. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner has expressed concern about the proliferation of information sharing frameworks, and expressed a preference for agencies to use the rules in the Privacy Act. Inland Revenue does utilise these rules where appropriate, however they primarily focus on sharing personal information, and are therefore not appropriate for information shares that primarily concern non-personal (business) information. This option provides rules, similar to those in the Privacy Act, to deal with situations where the information to be shared is mainly of a non-personal nature. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 14 Disclosure option 3: Authorise all sharing by agreement between Chief Executives Under this option, a legislative provision would authorise the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to enter into agreements with other Chief Executives regarding the sharing of Inland Revenue’s information, without any requirement for regulations. A similar model was proposed by the New Zealand Customs Service, however has been modified during the legislative process to now propose requiring Ministerial authorisation. While this would provide a highly flexible model, the importance of taxpayer confidentiality is considered to be such that a regulatory model, with Cabinet and Regulations Review Committee oversight was more appropriate. A regulatory model is also more consistent with the Approved Information Sharing Agreement model in the Privacy Act, which Inland Revenue will continue to utilise where appropriate, namely where the agreement primarily involves sharing personal information. Disclosure option 4: Authorise consent-based sharing for public service provision by agreement between Chief Executives (part of recommended package) While an agreement-based model was not considered appropriate for all information sharing (in particular sharing that is done without need to seek consent or advise those whose information is shared), under this option information sharing done with the consent of the taxpayer concerned could be governed by agreement, without need to seek a regulation. This option is intended to facilitate more flexible information sharing for public service provision, carried out with the informed consent of the taxpayer concerned. This option would cover situations such as, for example, where a regional non-governmental agency (NGO) has a service agreement with the Ministry of Social Development to assist people to find affordable housing and access their housing-related (or other) government entitlements. To provide the best service, the NGO needs access to up-to-date information about the customer, including their income and other social policy entitlements and obligations. The NGO obtains the informed consent of the customer to access this information. Under this option Inland Revenue, the Ministry of Social Development and the NGO (and potentially other NGOs offering the same service) would sign an agreement. Inland Revenue could then provide the information to the Ministry and/or the NGO in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Consent-based sharing was raised in Towards a new Tax Administration Act, noting the risk of coerced consent. It was therefore suggested that limiting consent-based sharing government agencies might be appropriate in the first instance. This was a position supported by submitters, and reiterated in Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act, with the modification of permitting this form of sharing for the provision of public services (consistent with the regulatory government information sharing proposal and the Approved Information Sharing Agreement framework). Also noted in Towards a new Tax Administration Act was the possibility that the eventual development of integrated online services might largely remove the need for this form of consented sharing as the customer would be to access the information themselves and forward it in a digital format to the agency or agencies with whom they wished to share it. However, this option is not yet available, and while some submitters considered that the existing ability to access one’s own information and pass it on (in a non-digital format) sufficient, enabling a consent-based system for sharing information for public service Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 15 provision will provide for a more flexible and responsive approach to be taken to improving services for customers seeking optional cross-government services. C: Other options for improvements We have identified two additional options to improve the rules relating to information disclosure, primarily focused on providing additional clarity. Additional option 1: Provide a more cohesive and transparent framework of exceptions to the confidentiality rule (part of recommended package) The current legislative set of exceptions has developed in an ad hoc matter over a long period of time. This has led to a framework that could be seen as lacking in transparency and clear unifying principles. Under this option the legislation would set out four clear categories of exceptions: disclosures for purposes related to the tax system; disclosures to taxpayers and their agents; international disclosures; and disclosures to other government agencies for non-tax-related purposes. Setting out clear categories of exceptions would provide greater transparency and clarity to the legislation. Additional option 2: Retain the existing penalties for knowing breach of confidentiality and clarify their application to third parties with access to Inland Revenue’s information (part of recommended package) This option is largely a reflection of the status quo, updated to take account of changes proposed by disclosure option 1. There are existing penalties for Inland Revenue officers and certain other persons who knowingly fail to maintain secrecy. This option proposes to carry over those penalties to the new confidentiality rules proposed in option 1. This option also proposes clarification/modernisation to the penalty as it applies to persons other than Inland Revenue officers. As the exceptions to the confidentiality rule have been updated in an ad hoc manner over time, the attendant penalty rules have not always received the corresponding updates. Under this option the penalty rule will be updated to clearly apply to all situations where someone with access to confidential Inland Revenue information knowingly improperly discloses that information. The penalty – imprisonment for a maximum of 6 months, or maximum fine of $15,000, or both – would remain the same as currently. 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? The criteria used to assess the likely impacts are: • Transparency; • Efficiency – of both administration and compliance, so options should both reduce compliance costs and administrative effort; • Flexibility – options should provide a level of flexibility or future-proofing for ongoing changes in information collection and sharing; • Integrity of the tax system – information is critical to the functioning of Inland Revenue and therefore any impacts on integrity, or perceptions of integrity, that might in some way affect the quality of information Inland Revenue is able to obtain are key considerations. In general these criteria work together and do not require significant trade-offs. However the Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 16 criterion of integrity, as defined in section 6 of the Tax Administration Act, includes the “rights of taxpayers to have their affairs kept confidential”. When it comes to exceptions to confidentiality, including information sharing, there is an inherent trade-off between confidentiality and efficiency or, in some cases, transparency. It should be noted however, particularly in relation to disclosures for tax-related purposes, that the statutory concept of integrity also includes the responsibility of taxpayers to comply with the law. 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? An option that was ruled out of scope early in the analysis was removing the specific tax secrecy rules and instead relying on the Privacy Act. The key issue with this approach is that a considerable amount of taxpayer information held by Inland Revenue relates to companies, trusts and other entities, and would therefore not be covered by the Privacy Act. Therefore, rules for the non-personal information would still be required. There are also potentially issues with the boundary between personal and non-personal information – for example, when considering company information that includes information about the directors. Other factors that saw this option ruled out of scope early were the importance of confidentiality rules to robust international tax information exchange (noting that countries can choose not to exchange information with jurisdictions if they are not satisfied with their confidentiality laws) and to tax system integrity more broadly. As a result, the analysis was confined to looking at options which maintained some form of confidentiality rules.

The proposed package of options considered to best address the problem, meet the policy objectives and deliver the highest net benefits is: • Collection – collection option two: regulation-making power for repeat collection of external datasets. • Use – use option one: express clarification that information gathered for one purpose can be used for other purposes within Inland Revenue. • Disclosure: o Scope – disclosure option one: a better targeted confidentiality rule focused on protecting information about taxpayers and sensitive non-taxpayer information. o Information sharing – disclosure options two and four: an enhanced regulatory sharing model together with consent based sharing governed by agreements. Both options are limited to information sharing for public service provision. o Other enhancements – additional options one and two: a more cohesive and transparent framework of exceptions and clarification of the penalty rules, namely retaining the existing penalties for knowing breach of confidentiality and clarifying their application to third parties with access to Inland Revenue’s information. This package of options has been assessed as providing improved transparency, efficiency and flexibility, while maintaining or improving the integrity of the tax system. In general, stakeholders expressed support for the proposed package, provided sufficient safeguards were in place for commercial information and to ensure that information sharing did not allow other agencies to access information they were not entitled to. The proposals have been designed to ensure these concerns are addressed. Stakeholders were keen to see enhanced transparency around Inland Revenue’s collection, use and disclosure of information and this package of proposals will ensure improvements in this respect. Inland Revenue has extensive experience with the application of its information collection, use and disclosure rules and therefore has a good understanding of the areas that work well and not so well. This package of reforms has been designed to improve the rules without undermining the fundamental areas that continue to work well, primarily confidentiality of taxpayer information and collection rules based on a ‘necessary or relevant’ standard. As shown in 5.2 below, the main impacts of the package relate to the proposals that will make it easier for Inland Revenue to undertake repeat collection of large datasets from external parties and for Inland Revenue to share its information with other agencies. The other proposals have limited impacts.

These costs will vary depending on the information sought and the systems of the information holder.

Low Medium Regulators – Inland Revenue There may be increased costs for Inland Revenue associated with increased information sharing. Low High Wider government Other parties Total Monetised Cost It is not possible to quantify the costs at this time, as the changes that may result in additional costs will occur when regulations are made under the new information sharing and collection empowering provisions. Non-monetised costs Low Medium Expected benefits of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties - customers Information sharing can provide compliance cost savings to customers where it reduces the need for them to provide their information to multiple agencies.

High High Wider government – departments and NGO service providers Improved ability to share information and more flexibility to make changes to existing arrangements. This should lead to improved efficiency across government. By way of example from some of the existing information sharing arrangements in the year ending 30 June 2017: • The proactive share with MSD to prevent benefit fraud identified an estimated $46.3 million in overpayments; • Information Inland Revenue shared with the Ministry of Justice enabled it to collect more than $11.2 million in overdue fines; • Inland Revenue shared information 39 times in response to 45 valid requests for information from WorkSafe New Zealand and the Labour Inspectorate, which is part of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. This is helping them to investigate breaches in workplace legislation. High High Other parties Total Monetised Benefit It is not possible to quantify the benefits at this time, as the specific changes will occur when regulations are made under the new information sharing and collection empowering provisions.

Nothing not already covered elsewhere in this analysis. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 24 5.4 Is the preferred option compatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’? The preferred options are consistent with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. The preferred options should deliver a more appropriately targeted, transparent set of rules for the collection, use and disclosure of information by Inland Revenue. The preferred options aim to minimise cost across the system, better align with related requirements in the Privacy Act and Official Information Act, conform with established legal and constitutional principles and are generally similar in nature to rules in place in the United Kingdom and Australia. The preferred options have the scope to evolve in response to changing circumstances or new information on the regulatory system’s performance. Regulations provide a more flexible and adaptive approach to managing information sharing, and the proposed regulatory approach to repeat dataset collection provides a more transparent and certain process for both data holders, and those whose information is being collected. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 25 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? The preferred options will need to be implemented by legislative amendment to the Tax Administration Act 1994. For the most part the preferred options will require amendment to, and consolidation of, existing provisions. It is intended that Part 4 of the Act will be substantially redrafted to give effect to the preferred options. A new empowering provision will be required to enable the making of regulations governing repeat collection of data. The empowering provision for information sharing regulations will require amendments to an existing provision (section 81BA). Transitional provisions will be required to grandparent existing information sharing arrangements. Over time these can be moved within the new regulatory framework and the provisions removed. The amendments could be included in the first omnibus taxation bill of 2018. The amendments could apply from date of enactment. Explanation of the amendments and their effect would be contained in a Tax Information Bulletin released shortly after the Bill received Royal assent. Inland Revenue’s internal and external guidance will be updated and where necessary, new guidance developed, to assist staff and taxpayers with the application of the new rules. Once implemented, Inland Revenue will be responsible for the ongoing operation and enforcement of the rules. Other agencies with an interest, in particular those with whom information is shared, will, as now, be involved in an ongoing relationship with Inland Revenue relating to the operation of that information sharing. Relevant stakeholders will be involved in consultation where any new information sharing or information collection regulations are proposed. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? There is a risk there could be a large number of agencies that seek new or amended information sharing arrangements following the enactment of the proposed information sharing rules. Inland Revenue has a set of principles that are applied to the prioritisation of information sharing proposals that can be used to help deal with this situation should it arise. As the proposed new rules are an extension of existing rules, rather than a completely new regime, this risk is considered relatively low. With use and disclosure of information, in particular information sharing, there is always a risk of a privacy or information breach. Consideration of these risks and protections that should be put in place will be built into the proposed rules. Information sharing agreements will also deal with agreed uses and disclosure of information provided by Inland Revenue. The preferred options also include proposals to maintain the obligation for staff to keep Inland Revenue information confidential and to clarify the corresponding Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 26 obligation on those in receipt of Inland Revenue information. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 27 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue would monitor the effectiveness of the proposed changes in the first 12 months of operation. The monitoring would involve a review of regulations made under the proposed information sharing and dataset collection enabling provisions within that period to ensure they were consistent with the intended policy. The empowering provision for dataset collection regulations will contain a requirement that the operation of the provision is reviewed after 5 years. This will include consultation with external parties and reviewing the costs and benefits of regulations made under the empowering provision. In general, Inland Revenue monitoring, evaluation and review of new legislation takes place under the generic tax policy process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy (and subsequently social policy administered by Inland Revenue) in New Zealand since 1995. The final step in the process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. In practice, any changes identified as necessary following enactment would be added to the tax policy work programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. The Regulations Review Committee would also have a role in monitoring and reviewing any regulations made. The Committee examines all regulations, investigates complaints about regulations, and examines proposed regulation-making powers in bills for consistency and good legislative practice. The Committee reports to the House and other committees on any issue it identifies. The House can “disallow” a regulation, meaning it no longer has force. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The proposals relating to both information sharing and repeat information collection are to be governed by regulations. As part of the regulation making process consultation will be required. This will give stakeholders an opportunity to make comment and raise any concerns about the proposed sharing or collection. The proposals also require regulations and underlying agreements to be published, making available a greater level of information about information shared and collected than is currently the case. Greater awareness of these matters provides greater opportunity for people to raise any concerns they may have, either with Inland Revenue, or with a relevant regulator, such as the Privacy Commissioner. As above, the Regulations Review Committee also has a role in this regard. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 28 Coversheet: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act - flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies Advising agencies Inland Revenue Decision sought How best to reduce compliance costs and administrative costs by providing earlier certainty to taxpayers and Inland Revenue about the application of tax law when there is a legislative anomaly that results in an inconsistency with policy intent and practice. Proposing Ministers Minister of Revenue Summary: Problem and Proposed Approach Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) has limited ability to deal with situations when a provision is not consistent with the intended policy (legislative anomalies). This ties up taxpayer and Commissioner resources in outcomes that are inconsistent with both parties’ practice and/or expectations. Taxation laws are public goods provided by the government. Only government action can remedy uncertainty caused by a legislative anomaly. Proposed Approach How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option? The proposed approach would enable regulations or determinations to be made, or administrative action to be taken, to address legislative anomalies. The power would be subject to safeguards including consistency with the existing policy and the principles supporting the integrity of the tax system; the outcomes would be optional for taxpayers to apply and would expire in three years. Im pact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 1 5. Section B: Summary Impacts: Benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? The proposed approach would have no direct impact because it would only enact an empowering provision. The main expected beneficiaries of any regulations or determinations made under the power would be the full range of taxpayers, including individual taxpayers through to large corporates. The expected benefit would be increased certainty for taxpayers and reduced compliance costs. Where do the costs fall? The main costs of the proposal would fall on Inland Revenue in having to administer the system. Some minor costs would fall on taxpayers in having to maintain awareness of any regulations or determinations made, or administrative action taken. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? The introduction of the power could raise risks for the rule of law. However, there are various elements of the proposed approach that would mitigate the risks to the rule of law including the limited scope of the power, the procedural safeguards (including parliamentary oversight), and the temporary nature of any exemptions. Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. There is no significant incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. Section C: Evidence certainty and quality assurance Agency rating of evidence certainty? Inland Revenue is confident that the evidence supports the policy proposal. Analysis has been undertaken to determine the impact of the current problem, including the length of time taken to remedy anomalies under the current system. Analysis has also been undertaken of comparative regimes overseas, including the recently enacted Australian regime.

This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 4 Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis There are two limitations on the analysis because there is some uncertainty about: • the number of suggested applications of the exemption power that could be proposed by taxpayers, and so the resource impact on Inland Revenue in having to deal with the proposed applications; and • any possible increase in judicial review applications. Level of suggestions Taxpayers would be able to suggest instances when the proposed power could be used. There is some uncertainty about the number of suggested applications that might be submitted by taxpayers, so there is some uncertainty about the resources Inland Revenue would need to process them. There is only a small risk that there would be a significant number of suggestions because there is evidence of the number of legislative anomalies that are discovered each year and the number suitable for the remedial power is likely to be a subset of those issues. 1 Inland Revenue received 140 referrals from all sources for remedial amendments between October 2015 and October 2017. Only a small subset of those referrals is likely to be appropriate for the proposed option. Furthermore, under the similar Australian provision only 22 applications were received in the first six months. Of those only two were considered appropriate for the remedial power. It is acknowledged that although the Australian provision is similar to the preferred option discussed below, the differences in the tax systems might lead to a different number of suggestions being made. Overall, the evidence suggests that the proposed option is unlikely to require a significant amount of resource for Inland Revenue to manage the process, and the analysis proceeds on that basis. Increase in judicial review applications There is some uncertainty about the impact of any possible judicial review of the use, or failure to use, the proposed power. However, Inland Revenue considers the risk to be small because the application of any exemption is optional so taxpayers are unlikely to judicially review the application of the exemption power and the courts have been reluctant to allow judicial review challenges that are seen as collateral attacks on a tax assessment. 2 . Inland Revenue considers the risk is so small that it will not have any meaningful impact on the analysis. 1 The number of remedial referrals is contained in an internal database. 2 Tannadyce Investments Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2011\] NZSC 158. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 5 Responsible Manager (signature and date): Chris Gillion Policy Manager Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 15 February 2018 Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 6 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the context within which action is proposed? Taxation laws are public goods provided by the government. Only government action can remedy uncertainty caused by a legislative anomaly. If the government does not remedy the anomaly, then the taxpayer bears the risk of being found not to have complied with the law, or they must bear the unintended costs. New Zealand’s tax system is very complex, and it undergoes significant change regularly. The nature and volume of the tax law changes mean that unforeseen or unintended outcomes (legislative anomalies) arise often. This is likely to continue to be the case into the future given the increasing complexity of tax law and rapidly evolving business practices. Ideally, any such anomalies would be remedied by an amending Act, given the constitutional importance of tax and the certainty that primary legislation gives to both taxpayers and Inland Revenue. In some cases this will be both necessary and achievable. However, under the current approach, it takes on average 670 days to remedy a legislative anomaly through primary legislation once it has been identified as needing legislative change. During that time, taxpayers are required to file different returns in different periods. For example, GST returns often need to be filed every two months and income tax returns every year. Taxpayers, therefore, might need to file several returns in the period during which an anomaly is being remedied. It is noted that similar problems arise in Inland Revenue’s non-tax functions (such as the administration of social policies). Clarifying that the care and management provision applies to the Commissioner’s non-tax functions is intended to be progressed as part of the Making Tax Simpler project to modernise the administration of social policy. 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place? The elements of the current regulatory system that are relevant for dealing with legislative anomalies are set out below: • In some situations, a purposive approach to interpreting the relevant legislation will mean that an anomaly that may arise on the plain reading of the relevant provision does not arise. However, sometimes the legislation cannot be interpreted in a way that is consistent with the policy intent. • Some anomalies can be remedied quickly through the legislative process if their discovery aligns with an existing bill. However, this does not often happen and so the average time to remedy a remedial issue is approximately 670 days. • The Commissioner also has some administrative flexibility under the existing care and management provision. The current provision does not allow the Commissioner to administratively remedy legislative anomalies. 3 Instead, the flexibility allows the 3 Interpretation statement “Care and management of the taxes covered by the Inland Revenue Acts – section 6A(2) and (3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 10 (November 2010). Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 7 Commissioner to decide not to allocate her resources to investigate situations when there is a known anomaly. This does not provide certainty for a taxpayer when Inland Revenue becomes aware of an issue because the Commissioner does not have a general power to suspend the application of the law. As it is only an administrative undertaking by the Commissioner, it provides limited protection for taxpayers who rely on it and so do not comply with the law. In those circumstances, the Commissioner would continue to have a duty to apply the law, even when it would produce outcomes that are not consistent with the purpose or object of the law. 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? The existing approach to resolving legislative anomalies in tax law can create uncertainties and is costly for taxpayers and Inland Revenue. The process creates uncertainties because when the legislation does not align with the intended policy, then taxpayers are unsure how to apply the law. To a limited extent this uncertainty can be resolved by binding rulings and other forms of advice. However, such advice can only clarify the meaning of the legislation and cannot resolve issues when the legislation cannot be interpreted consistently with the intended policy. Taxpayers either have to comply with the legislation as interpreted either by themselves or the Commissioner, so incurring unintended costs or compliance requirements; or comply with the intended policy and risk being penalised for not complying with the law. The uncertainty makes it harder for taxpayers to organise their affairs, invest or plan for the future. The uncertainty can also undermine the integrity of the tax system, by encouraging taxpayers to ignore the relevant tax law and comply with the policy. It can also be seen to undermine the rule of law when there is uncertainty about whether the law is intended to be complied with. The rule of law has been described as an elusive constitutional principle that includes at its heart the requirement that all persons (including the State) should be bound by the laws publicly made. 4 This has been developed further to suggest that the law should be clear, predictable, accessible and not made arbitrarily. When the only avenue to resolve the issue is through legislative amendment, then there can be a substantial period of uncertainty. This can create compliance costs for taxpayers by requiring them to seek advice either from an external advisor or Inland Revenue as to the correct approach to the relevant provision in the interim period. This also increases the administrative costs for Inland Revenue in dealing with the issue. 4 Ross Carter et al Subordinate Legislation in New Zealand (LexisNexis, Wellington, 2013) 26. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 8 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? There were no particular constraints on the scope of options considered. The options tie in with the broader work that is being undertaken to modernise the Tax Administration Act 1994. Specifically, the work on updating the type of advice provided by Inland Revenue deals with situations when the legislation can be interpreted in a way that aligns with the policy intent. The work on advice is aimed at better communicating the Commissioner’s position to taxpayers through different forms of advice tailored to the needs of different taxpayers. The current issue deals with situations when the legislation cannot be interpreted consistently with the policy intent. 2.5 What do stakeholders think? The problem affects all taxpayers and there are various stakeholders that have an interest. Significant consultation has been undertaken which has resulted in four options being developed. The consultation process is set out below. Problem identification Taxpayers highlighted the lack of speed and certainty in rectifying legislative anomalies in the Tax Administration for the 21 st century conference in June 2014. The conference’s purpose was to explore options for making tax easier (by reducing both compliance and administration costs) and increasing voluntary compliance balanced against core tax policy objectives such as raising revenue, and ensuring fairness and efficiency. First discussion document proposed options In response to the identified problem (and other problems), the Government released a discussion document Making Tax Simpler: Towards a new Tax Administration Act in 2015 which suggested two possible options: • extend the Commissioner’s current discretionary or determination-making powers that attach to specific provisions (referred to as “option 3” in this RIA); or • a clarification to the care and management provision to deal with some legislative anomalies (referred to as “option 4” in this RIA). The consultation included an online forum and presentations to submitters. The proposal to clarify the care and management provision was based on some criteria set out in R v Inland Revenue Commissioners; Ex parte Wilkinson \[2005\] UKHL 30, which discussed the scope of the Commissioners’ discretionary powers under the similarly worded United Kingdom care and management power. The option would allow the Commissioner to use her discretion in relation to: • minor legislative anomalies; • transitory legislative anomalies; Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 9 • cases when the relevant legislation has failed to adequately deal with the particular situation because a statutory rule is difficult to formulate; • a long-standing established practice of both the Commissioner and taxpayers; • cases of unfairness at the margins. The discretion would only be exercised consistently with policy intent, and not allow for a policy-making ability. The exercise of the discretion would be time-limited and could not exceed three years. After this time, if the issue was on-going, an amendment to the primary legislation would be required. Consultation prior to the exercise of the discretion would be required, and any exercise of the discretion would be published to ensure transparency. The discretion would also be exercised only by Inland Revenue officers with an appropriate level of expertise. Submissions on the care and management proposal suggested various safeguards Submissions were generally supportive of the proposal to clarify the care and management provision. They commented that it should be a positive step for taxpayers and ensure the Commissioner had the ability to direct her resources where they were most needed. It was also noted that the proposal needed to be supported by a change in mind-set within Inland Revenue to support use of the care and management provision. Submissions suggested: • Any enhanced administrative flexibility should only be exercised in favour of the taxpayer, and the amendment should expressly state this rule to avoid any doubt. • Any care and management power should be guided by a set of principles – including those in sections 6 and 6A of the Tax Administration Act. • There needed to be a principle which establishes whether the policy is clear enough such that the Commissioner could depart from the ordinary meaning of the words – for example, “persons reading the relevant legislation would in most cases agree what the policy intent of the legislation is”. • A balancing of a collection of factors was suggested, including: cost to the taxpayer; cost to the Commissioner; a ceiling of an amount of tax at issue if the legislation is applied as written (compared to if the Commissioner has the flexibility to take another approach); and perhaps a time period. Submissions reflected in proposed safeguards and options The submissions were taken into account in developing a refined proposal that was consulted on in a subsequent Government discussion document, Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act (December 2016). The consultation included an online forum and workshops with submitters. The revised proposal retained the listed criteria and set out the relevant safeguards that would apply, including that it would be optional for taxpayers. The submissions on the specific criteria and safeguards suggested: • While there was support for each of the listed criteria for when the discretion could be exercised, there was some uncertainty about the scope of the criteria. • There were differing views on whether the exercise of the discretion should be limited to taxpayer-friendly situations or whether it should be optional for taxpayers to apply. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 10 • The discretion should be applied consistently and only in appropriate circumstances, but that these safeguards should not impede the exercise of the discretion in an effective manner. • Guidance was needed to ensure taxpayers had a clear understanding of how the provision would apply. • The power should not be exercised if it would not be in the public interest to do so. • The exercise or non-exercise of the discretion should be a reviewable decision. • There should be some flexibility around the requirement to consult as whilst consultation might be beneficial in some cases, in many cases it would result in significant delay of the effective exercise of the discretion. • The requirement to publish the exercise of the discretion should be subject to a public interest requirement. Submitters proposed other options A concern was raised that not all taxpayers would have access to decisions made by the Commissioner under an extended care and management power, which would result in a body of private law. Some submitters suggested exploring further the option of granting the Commissioner a regulation-making power in the form of disallowable legislative instruments like those proposed in Australia. Alternatively, it was suggested that the Commissioner should be allowed to anticipate legislative changes by issuing interpretation statements that then apply as binding interpretations. Submitters, and the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee, supported having a range of options by which the discretion could be exercised (a “tool box approach”). This approach is similar to the suite of powers available to the Financial Markets Authority under the Financial Markets Authority Act 2011 and Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013. The Crown Law Office was concerned about the implications for the rule of law of the proposed extension to the Commissioner’s care and management power, but noted that those concerns were, to a limited extent, addressed by the specific safeguards. The Crown Law Office considered that it would be preferable if the power could be exercised only by Order in Council. These concerns and comments led to the development of the proposal referred to as “option 5” in this RIA. Workshop with submitters Following the submissions on the discussion document, and the comments above, Inland Revenue organised a workshop with submitters (including Crown Law) on the various proposals. The discussion focused on option 5. During the workshop, submitters suggested: • The proposal should adopt a principle-based approach. This would allow the discretion to be used when the legislation did not align with the intended policy Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 11 without being limited by any specific criteria. • There should be a tool-box of options by which legislative anomalies could be dealt with, including Orders in Council, Commissioner-made determinations, and administrative action. • Any exercise of the discretion should be optional for taxpayers to apply. Summary The consultation comments were taken into account in developing the options discussed below. Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? There are five options considered in this analysis: • Option 1: Address legislative anomalies using existing processes (status quo). • Option 2: Increase resources to address legislative anomalies using existing processes. Increasing the resources directed at remedying legislative anomalies would involve redirecting existing resources or increasing the resources directed to law development. This option does not require legislation and could be used in conjunction with any of the other options. • Option 3: Provide for more discretionary provisions in legislation. This option would extend the Commissioner’s current discretionary or determination-making powers that attach to specific provisions. It would provide the Commissioner with increased administrative flexibility to deal with legislative anomalies in specific situations. • Option 4: Administrative flexibility in limited circumstances. This option would extend the Commissioner’s care and management provision to provide some more administrative flexibility in limited circumstances. • Option 5: Determinations and regulations to temporarily remedy anomalies (preferred option). This option would provide a power to make regulations, determinations or take administrative action to remedy a legislative anomaly. 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? The overarching objective is to reduce compliance costs and administrative costs by providing earlier certainty to taxpayers and Inland Revenue about the application of tax law when there is a legislative anomaly that results in an inconsistency with policy intent and practice. The options have been assessed against the objective and the following criteria: • Sustainability: The options should support the rule of law and maintain the integrity Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 12 of the tax system. • Compliance costs: Compliance costs for taxpayers should be minimised as far as practicable. • Administrative costs: Administrative costs for Inland Revenue should be minimised as far as practicable. The objective of the proposal is to balance the compliance cost and administrative cost reduction objective against the sustainability objective. This would be achieved through the limitations included in the options considered. Overlaps between criteria There is likely to be an overlap between reductions in compliance costs for taxpayers and reductions in administrative costs for Inland Revenue, in that a reduction in the former is likely to cause a reduction in the later under the relevant options. This is because the simpler the option for taxpayers the less likely they will need advice from Inland Revenue. 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? Some submitters suggested that one option could be to re-interpret the current care and management provision, so as to provide the Commissioner with greater administrative flexibility without the need for a legislative amendment. The current proposal suggests retaining the current care and management provision but supplementing it with further flexibility in certain circumstances. As a result, the proposal does not prevent a broader interpretation being taken of the scope of the current provision. However, it is considered that while the current provision does provide the Commissioner with flexibility about the allocation of her resources, it does not provide her with the flexibility to administratively remedy legislative anomalies. Further, it is considered that the scope of any such power, and the safeguards that would apply, should be specified in the legislation to protect the integrity of the tax system and the rule of law. As a result, the option of re- interpreting the current provision was ruled out because it would risk the integrity of the tax system and the rule of law.

No action Option 1 Option 2 (Providing greater resources) Option 3 (Enact more discretionary provisions) Option 4 (Administrative flexibility in limited circumstances) Option 5 (Determinations, regulations, and admin action) (Preferred option) Criterion (Sustainability) 0 0 Although remedying all issues through legislative amendment would seem to support this criterion, the lengthy legislative process would mean taxpayers would be required to follow either the policy or the law for a substantial time . This would harm the integrity of the tax system and the rule of law. + This option would support the integrity of the tax system and the rule of law, but it would be difficult to predict any issues so the problem is likely to still arise in many cases. As a result, in most cases taxpayers would be required to follow either the policy or the law, harming the integrity of the tax system and the rule of law. - This option would support sustainability by remedying anomalies quicker. However, it would be at the discretion of the Commissioner and it would not be subject to Parliamentary oversight. + This option would remedy the anomalies and would be subject to parliamentary scrutiny, thereby supporting the rule of law. This option would mean taxpayers could choose the best option so supporting the integrity of the tax system. Criterion (Compliance costs) 0 + It would reduce taxpayers’ compliance costs because more attention woul d be paid to problematic issues but it would still take time to resolve, so taxpayers would incur costs working out what to do in the interim. 0 – It would only be effective when the problem could be anticipated so taxpayers would still likely have significant compliance costs in most cases. Relying on discretions would involve moving away from the efficiency objective of self- assessment, and so would incur further compliance costs for taxpayers than the status quo. + The speed by which the issues could be resolved would reduce taxpayers’ compliance costs. However, the remedy would not provide legal certainty so taxpayers might still need to seek advice as to the consequences. + Anomalies could be resolved quickly, and this would reduce taxpayers’ compliance costs. However, taxpayers would incur som e costs associated with understanding the process and choosing whether to apply the remedy or the black letter of the law. Criterion (Administrative costs) 0 - Devoting more resources to the policy development process would divert resources from elsewhere, or require more funding. - Additional administrative costs in determining on a case-by-case basis whether the issue is within a discretionary power. + The ease of remedying anomalies would reduce administrative costs but there would be risks of challenges to the use of the discretion. + This option would reduce administration costs by quickly remedying anomalies. However, there would be some increased costs for Inland Revenue in deciding whether the discretion should be exercised.

However, under the current approach it takes on average 670 days to remedy a legislative anomaly through primary legislation once it has been identified as needing legislative change. It is not clear that increasing the policy resources would substantially reduce this time period, as it is mainly driven by the legislative process. The time period involves the lead-in time to get a remedial item added to a bill (including the relevant reporting requirements) and the passage of the bill through the House. As a result, it is likely that even with more policy resources it might still take a similar time to resolve the relevant legislative anomalies. The substantial time taken by the legislative process would mean taxpayers either comply with the legislation as interpreted, so incurring unintended costs or compliance requirements; or comply with the intended policy and risk being penalised for not complying with the law. This would result in no change from the status quo for the integrity of the tax system and the rule of law. The uncertainty makes it harder for taxpayers to organise their affairs, invest or plan for the future. Compliance costs Under this option there would be some reduction in taxpayers’ compliance costs because more attention would be paid to problematic issues, and so taxpayers could be better informed about the correct approach. However, the Commissioner could only provide administrative guidance prior to the legislation being enacted and so taxpayers would not have any certainty about the outcome in that period. Taxpayers would still need to decide during the time taken to remedy the problem whether they would follow the existing law or the policy. Often this would require taxpayers to consult a professional advisor or Inland Revenue to work out what to do in the interim. In some circumstances, taxpayers and Inland Revenue might still end up in disputes that are inconsistent with both parties’ expectations. This would impose compliance costs on taxpayers. Administrative costs Increasing resources, or directing existing resources towards fixing anomalies, both come with an opportunity cost for Inland Revenue for other functions those resources could have been directed towards. As a result, this option would increase administrative costs for Inland Revenue. Overall assessment Increasing resources to policy development to fix more anomalies would result in some compliance gains for taxpayers while maintaining the sustainability under the status quo. However, the option would increase administrative costs for Inland Revenue. Option 3 (Provide for more discretionary provisions) Sustainability Enacting the discretionary provisions as part of the primary legislation would support the integrity of the tax system and the rule of law. However, if an issue can be foreseen then they are currently addressed in the primary legislation. This might be through a specific discretion or by allowing determinations to be made on the relevant issue. As a result, it is Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 16 considered that the current problem is unlikely to be one that can be foreseen. Taxpayers, therefore, would still be required to follow either the policy or the law in most cases, so harming the integrity of the tax system and the rule of law. Compliance costs Given that the problem really relates to those situations when it is not possible to anticipate the likely issue, adopting this option is unlikely to reduce compliance costs for taxpayers compared with the status quo. In addition, relying on Commissioner discretions would mean that taxpayers would not have certainty from the legislation and would need to consider when the Commissioner would exercise her discretion. There may also be compliance costs in applying to the Commissioner to exercise her discretion or make a determination and the approach could in any case be inconsistent with a tax system based on self-assessment. Administrative costs This option would impose additional administrative costs on the Commissioner because she would be required to consider whether to exercise a particular discretion in a situation. The consideration of the use of the discretion would require resources. The amount of resources would depend on the number of discretionary provisions and the number of possible situations when the discretion could apply. As a result, the more discretionary provisions included in the Revenue Acts to deal with anticipated anomalies, the more resources the Commissioner would potentially have to commit to the various issues. Overall assessment This option would meet the criteria for the issues that could be identified in advance. However, Inland Revenue considers that the majority of anomalies could not be foreseen, and this option would not satisfy the criteria for those issues. Option 4 (Administrative flexibility in limited circumstances) Sustainability Option 4 would reduce sustainability because it would be subject to challenge and would raise rule of law concerns that the Commissioner was not bound to the published law. The proposed safeguards would limit the concerns to some extent. Specifically: • The limited criteria, and the requirement that any exercise of the discretion must be consistent with existing policy, would mean that the scope of the discretion is very limited; • The requirement to consult on any exercise of the discretion would reduce the risk of challenge because concerns could be dealt with before any exercise of the discretion; and • The time limitation would mean any exemptions would only be temporary, which would reduce rule of law concerns. Compliance costs Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 17 This option would allow anomalies to be remedied quickly. This would reduce compliance costs for taxpayers by providing them guidance on the intended policy outcome. However, as the remedy would not be legislative and would only be administrative, it would not provide legal certainty for taxpayers. This would mean that taxpayers might still need to seek advice as to the likelihood of the remedy being overturned. There would also be a small increase in compliance costs in having to become familiar with the new process, and having to keep up- to-date with any exercise of the discretion. Taxpayers would also have to monitor any challenges to the exercise of the discretion. Administrative costs The ease of remedying anomalies would reduce administrative costs for Inland Revenue in having to provide less advice about the anomaly, and having less disputes about outcomes that were not intended. However, there would be some increase in administrative costs in having to set-up and administer the new process. This would include providing guidance to taxpayers about how the new process would work, although this is expected to taper over time. There might also be additional costs from any challenges to the exercise of the administrative power. Even so, it would be optional for taxpayers to apply, and so the risk would be small. Overall assessment This option would reduce compliance and administrative costs but could undermine the sustainability of the tax system. The lack of any parliamentary oversight of the process might raise rule of law issues. Option 5 (Determinations, regulations, and administrative action) Sustainability Using Orders in Council or disallowable determinations to remedy anomalies would support the sustainability of the process of remedying the anomalies by enabling parliamentary oversight of the process. Parliamentary oversight would be provided by the disallowance process and the oversight of the Regulations Review Committee. In many cases, the issue would still need to be resolved through the normal legislative process, with the new process providing a temporary bridge until that could occur. This option would support the rule of law by enabling Parliament to disallow any remedies that were considered to be the proper domain of Parliament. The temporary nature of the remedies and the fact that they do not override the primary law also support the sustainability of the system. The optionality of the remedies would mean taxpayers could choose the best option so supporting self-assessment and the integrity of the tax system. Compliance costs This option would reduce compliance costs for taxpayers by providing them with faster remedies for legislative anomalies. As noted previously, this would overcome a specific issue raised by taxpayers. It would reduce the need for taxpayers to seek advice either from professional advisors or Inland Revenue on the operation of the relevant provision (when it seems to be inconsistent with the intended policy). It reduces the risks for taxpayers of getting it wrong, and so encourages investment and planning for the future. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 18 The option would increase compliance costs for taxpayers to a limited extent. There would be a small increase in compliance costs in having to become familiar with the new process, and having to keep up-to-date with any exercise of the discretion. It would increase the overall complexity of the tax system. This option would be more complicated than Option 4 given the three possible remedies. However, the use of regulations and disallowable determinations under Option 5 would make it easier to keep track of any remedies, so reducing the increased compliance costs to some extent. Some compliance costs may be incurred by taxpayers in having to submit on the draft remedies during the process. Finally, taxpayers would need to determine whether any remedy would be favourable for them in their own circumstances, which would increase compliance costs for them. Inland Revenue considers the reduction in compliance costs from providing certainty for taxpayers more quickly under this option would significantly outweigh the increased compliance costs. Administrative costs The option would reduce the overall administrative costs for Inland Revenue. Providing greater certainty for taxpayers more quickly would reduce the need for them to contact Inland Revenue seeking advice and would prevent disputes arising when the legislation does not align with the policy. This would reduce the resources Inland Revenue needed to commit to such issues. As previously noted, the average time taken to remedy an anomaly spans several return periods so providing certainty to taxpayers sooner could reduce the resources Inland Revenue needs to assist to amend previous tax positions. There will be an increase in administrative costs for Inland Revenue in establishing the process and processing any suggested applications of the power from Inland Revenue staff or taxpayers. The Australian experience would suggest there would not be a large number of applications so this cost is not expected to be large. When the anomaly needed to be fixed subsequently through the normal legislative process, the costs incurred in providing a temporary solution could be seen as a duplication, but many of the subsequent elements of the process would not need to be repeated. For example, if the problem had been identified and a remedy consulted on before the making of a regulation, then it may not need to be repeated to the full extent when the permanent legislative amendment is being subsequently proposed. Overall assessment Inland Revenue prefers this option. It would support the sustainability of the tax system by incorporating Parliamentary oversight through the disallowance process and the Regulations Review Committee. The option would also reduce compliance and administrative costs. As a result, this option best meets the stated criteria. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 19 Section 5: Conclusions 5.1 What option, or combination of options, is likely best to address the problem, meet the policy objectives and deliver the highest net benefits? Inland Revenue prefers option 5 for the following reasons: • It provides a process by which legislative anomalies could be quickly dealt with, while supporting the integrity of the tax system and the rule of law. • It would reduce taxpayers’ compliance costs in dealing with legislative anomalies, while aligning with the self-assessment system. • It would reduce the administrative costs for Inland Revenue in dealing with anomalies. Although there would be some increased costs in identifying and providing a remedy for the relevant issues, the current number of remedial issues and the Australian experience with their similar provision, suggest these costs would be relatively small. • It is the option most favoured by submitters because it has sufficiently broad scope, it is optional for taxpayers to apply, and because it has appropriate safeguards in place. 5.2 Summary table of costs and benefits of the preferred approach Affected parties (identify) Comment: nature of cost or benefit (eg ongoing, one-off), evidence and assumption (eg compliance rates), risks Impact $m present value, for monetised impacts; high, medium or low for non-monetised impacts Evidence certainty (High, medium or low) Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties (taxpayers) Cost of gaining an initial understanding of how the new process would operate.

There is a risk of adverse public perception that tax laws are being changed through Order in Council, through a determination made by the Commissioner or by administrative action. Such a perception could undermine the integrity of the tax system and the perception of the rule of law. This risk would be mitigated by several elements. The most important element would be the fact that the tax laws would not be overridden, and it would be optional for taxpayers to apply any remedial actions. Further, any substantive issues would be subject to parliamentary disallowance, so protecting the role of parliament in the process. In addition, any remedial actions would be only temporary and would expire in three years. Another risk could be that the public perceive that lobby groups influence issues which are considered. The consultation and publication requirements would mitigate this risk to some extent. Further, the fact that any regulations or determination made under the power would be subject to disallowance would add to the transparency. 5.4 Is the preferred option compatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’? The preferred option is compatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. The preferred option should deliver, over time, a stream of benefits in terms of lower compliance and administrative costs that are in excess of its costs or negative outcomes. The optional nature of the preferred option means that it has the least adverse impact on property rights and individual autonomy. It conforms to established legal and constitutional principles and is similar in nature to the statutory remedial power recently enacted in Australia. The empowering provision under the preferred option would have scope to evolve in response to changing circumstances or new information on the system’s performance. The three methods of exercising the remedial power in the preferred option provide that flexibility to evolve. Non-monetised benefits - Medium High Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 22 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? The preferred option will need to be implemented by a legislative amendment to the Tax Administration Act 1994. Specifically, an empowering provision would need to be enacted to allow regulations or determinations to be made. The amendment could be included in the next available tax bill. The amendment could apply from the date of enactment. Explanation of the amendment and its effect could be contained in a Tax Information Bulletin, which would be released shortly after the bill received Royal assent. The implementation of the preferred option would require an internal Inland Revenue process to determine if a recommendation should be made to use the power, a determination made, or administration action taken. The internal process will be developed in conjunction with the organisational design process that is currently being undertaken within Inland Revenue. Taxpayers and agents will be able to suggest cases when it could be appropriate to use the power. They will also be involved during the consultation process examining any proposed use of the power. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? There is a risk that there could be a large number of issues raised by taxpayers with Inland Revenue that need to be considered under the proposed power. However, as noted above, this risk is considered to be low because there is evidence of the number of legislative anomalies that are discovered each year and the number suitable for the remedial power is likely to be a subset of those issues. Inland Revenue received 140 referrals from all sources for remedial amendments between October 2015 and October 2017. Only a small subset of those referrals is likely to be appropriate for the proposed option. Furthermore, under the similar Australian provision only approximately 22 applications were received in the first six months. Of those only two were considered appropriate for the remedial power. It is acknowledged that while the Australian provision is similar to the preferred option discussed below, the differences in the tax systems might lead to a different number of suggestions being made. Overall, the evidence suggests that the proposed option is unlikely to require a significant amount of the resources for Inland Revenue to manage the process, and the analysis proceeds on that basis. There is a small risk of an increase in judicial review but as discussed above this risk is considered to be small. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 23 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue would monitor the effectiveness of the proposed changes in the first 12 months of operation. The monitoring would involve a review of any regulations and determinations made, and administrative action taken, under the empowering provision within that period to see whether they were consistent with the intended policy. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? In general, Inland Revenue monitoring, evaluation and review of new legislation takes place under the generic tax policy process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy (and subsequently social policy administered by Inland Revenue) in New Zealand since 1995. The final step in the process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. In practice, any changes identified as necessary following enactment would be added to the tax policy work programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. The Regulations Review Committee would have a role in monitoring and reviewing any regulations or determinations (being disallowable instruments) made. The committee examines all regulations, investigates complaints about regulations, and examines proposed regulation-making powers in bills for consistency with good legislative practice. The committee reports to the House and other committees on any issues it identifies. The House can “disallow” a regulation, meaning it no longer has force. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 24 Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Assessment, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis The limitations around the analysis are the following: Simplified Rulings Various factors have been taken into account in trying to determine the number of ruling applications that could be expected under the preferred option (introducing a simplified rulings regime). However, it has been difficult to predict the possible number of ruling applications because of the difficulty in determining the elasticity of demand, and so how any changes in the price may affect the demand for rulings. Inland Revenue has consulted with a limited number of tax agents that represent small and medium-sized taxpayers. The consultation suggested that some small and medium-sized taxpayers would see significant value in applying for a ruling, while other submitters suggested that they would not see value in such rulings. Analysis was also undertaken of the Australian rulings regime. The Australian Tax Office (ATO) receives about 1,200 complex rulings applications per year . The complex rulings applications are of a nature similar to ruling applications under the current New Zealand regime. Of those received by the ATO, 400-500 relate to large corporate taxpayers. This would be similar given the relative sizes of the countries to the number of rulings applications received in New Zealand from large corporates under the current rulings regime (being approximately 80-100). Given the number of rulings for large corporates in Australia, it is estimated that 700-800 complex rulings per year relate to smaller taxpayers. Adjusting this to reflect the relative size of New Zealand would suggest that approximately 140- 160 rulings from small and medium-sized taxpayers could be expected in New Zealand. However, the ATO does not charge any fees for providing rulings so it is unclear how the proposal to charge a fee for simplified rulings in New Zealand would impact on demand. Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 1 6. Minor errors There is some uncertainty as to the number of taxpayers that are carrying forward errors into subsequent returns that are larger than the current s tatutory threshold. During consultation on the proposals, submitters suggested that it was common practice for taxpayers to carry forward larger errors, and that the current threshold was being largely ignored. As a result, there is some uncertainty about whether the proposed increased limit will change behaviour or simply endorse existing practice. Tax preparers There are currently 31 payroll service providers registered as PAYE intermediaries with Inland Revenue who would be eligible for extended service offerings under the preferred option. However, the total number of non-tax agents who would be eligible under the preferred option to register to receive extended service offerings for tax preparers is unknown, as no good data exists for the number of payroll bureaus and bookkeepers in New Zealand who offer tax preparation services. Responsible Manager (signature and date): Chris Gillion Policy Manager Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 15 February 2018 Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 2 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? Simplified Rulings The binding rulings regime is a fee-based service provided by Inland Revenue and governed by Part 5A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Binding rulings, in particular private rulings and product rulings, apply to a specific taxpayer or transaction. The problem with the current binding rulings regime is that, in practice, it is generally only available to large taxpayers as small and medium-sized taxpayers are priced-out due to the cost involved. The current rulings regime was set up to provide certainty to taxpayers on arrangements being carried out by them. This was seen as providing taxpayers with a private benefit, so the fees for rulings were determined on a full cost-recovery basis. Currently, private, product and status binding rulings all incur an application fee of $322 (GST inclusive) which covers the costs of receiving and reviewing the ruling application and a fee of $161 (GST inclusive) per hour spent by Inland Revenue considering the application and the issues it raises. This includes time spent consulting with the applicant. Inland Revenue’s costs in obtaining independent advice from external professionals are also passed on to the applicant (although this is rare). As the rulings bind the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner), Inland Revenue commits significant resources to each ruling to ensure that the correct position is taken. This resulted in the fees charged for rulings being higher than ori ginally estimated. In the year ended 30 June 2017, the average fee charged was $11,200. Further, taxpayers usually engage tax advisors to assist in the rulings process, which has added significant advisor costs to the process. The overall cost of the rulings process has meant that small and medium-sized taxpayers generally do not apply for rulings. This has meant that they have not been able to obtain the same level of certainty as larger taxpayers, and they are more likely to enter into a dispute with Inland Revenue as a result. 1 Justice Glazebrook suggested that the inability of small and medium-sized taxpayers to get binding rulings was inconsistent with the principle of equality before the law. 2 Further, participants at the Tax Administration in the 21 st Century conference in June 2014 commented that the lack of access to rulings meant that it was difficult to get certainty. Private sector tax advisors can provide a certain level of assurance as to the tax outcome of a particular transaction. However, under the Tax Administration Act 1994 only Inland Revenue can provide certainty as to the tax treatment by providing a binding ruling. Taxpayers can obtain certainty by taking a conservative tax position in a tax return, and then seeking to reduce the amount of tax payable through the disputes process. This process is referred to as a taxpayer-initiated notice of proposed adjustment. While this process does not have any fees, the costs for taxpayers and Inland Revenue is more than the rulings process 1 Figures from 2013, which are the most recent available, show that 75% of disputes commenced in that year related to amounts less than $100,000 suggesting they were initiated by small and medium-sized taxpayers. 2 Address to 2015 CA ANZ Tax Conference (November 2015). Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 3 because of the numerous stages and the time taken. As a result, it does not resolve the problem identified above. Minor errors Currently, genuine tax errors of less than $1,000 can be included in a subsequent return, rather than the original assessment having to be corrected. The process is intended to reduce compliance and administration costs for minor errors. The policy was intended to assist small and medium-sized taxpayers the most. However, the threshold is not limited to such taxpayers and can be used by larger taxpayers as well. Generally under accounting standards, material changes must be included in the latest financial statements as comparatives for the past periods, including, where relevant, cumulative adjustments to any balances brought forward. 3 Materiality in accounting standards means a change that could influence the economic decisions that users make on the basis of the financial statements. 4 Materiality depends on the size and nature of the omission or misstatement judged in the surrounding circumstances. The size or nature of the item, or a combination of both, could be the determining factor. Anecdotal evidence suggests most accounting corrections are made in the current period because they are considered not to satisfy the materiality threshold under accounting standards. This means that some minor errors can be included in the current set of accounts for accounting purposes, but must be included in the assessment for the original period for tax purposes. Having two different processes for minor errors adds compliance costs for taxpayers. Tax preparers and nominated persons As part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation 5 programme (and related to the Government’s wider Better Public Services initiative), Inland Revenue intends to offer more online services to tax agents as well as to other intermediaries. Given that these expanded services will include more self-service options and may potentially enable intermediaries to work more in real-time than at present, a concern is protecting the revenue base and the integrity of the tax system against any potential risks arising from intermediaries’ use of these services. Inland Revenue currently provides a range of services specifically for tax agents, including a dedicated phone service for tax agents to communicate with Inland Revenue and use of the E-File software package which allows tax agents to file their clients’ tax returns electronically. The statutory definition of a “tax agent” is used for determining who can access these services. This means that other tax service providers (such as those who only file GST returns and employer monthly schedules for their clients, or who provide budget advice and assist with tax return preparation and claiming social policy entitlements) are not at present given access these services, even though it would be desirable in many cases to do so. These providers can still look after their clients’ tax and social policy affairs as nominated 3 See NZ IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. 4 See NZ IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements. 5 Business Transformation is a multi-year, multi-stage programme to modernise New Zealand’s tax administration. Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 4 persons (with similar access to the client through online services in myIR, including return filing), but without the services specifically for tax agents. Restricting additional services to persons who are listed as tax agents is not required by law, but is an administrative decision by the Commissioner. The Commissioner can offer these services as widely or narrowly as she considers appropriate. However, revoking access to these services once granted can be difficult. Provided that the Commissioner had the ability to withdraw these services from a non-tax agent if necessary to protect the integrity of the tax system, there would be no good reason for restricting these online services (including the new online service offerings that will become available under Business Transformation) to only tax agents. In a number of cases, these services would make it easier and more efficient for other tax service providers to manage their filing and payment performance, compared with using the limited services available to them under the status quo. Inland Revenue’s view is that a person who is nominated by a taxpayer to act on their behalf is the agent of the taxpayer under common law. Therefore, even if the Commissioner has reasonable tax integrity concerns about allowing a person to act for other taxpayers (for instance, because the person has convictions for fraud), the Commissioner cannot refuse to recognise that person as a taxpayer’s nominated person because it is up to the taxpayer whether the nominee should act (or continue to act) on their behalf. However, there are concerns about the risk of persons who have been removed from the list of tax agents (due to tax integrity concerns) coming back into the system as nominated persons. 2.2 Who is affected and how? Simplified rulings Inland Revenue anticipates that most of those affected by the current cost barriers to getting a binding ruling are small and medium-sized taxpayers. The cost barrier prevents these taxpayers from obtaining greater certainty, which increases the likelihood of them entering into disputes with Inland Revenue. As noted above, the majority of tax disputes involve small and medium-sized taxpayers. Minor errors While the current threshold for including minor errors in a subsequent return affects taxpayers of all sizes, Inland Revenue anticipates that the major beneficiaries of the preferred option will be small and medium-sized taxpayers, as they are likely to have issues that fall within the relevant thresholds. However, the proposal is not limited to such enterprises and any taxpayer would be able to use the increased threshold. Taxpayers using the proposed increased threshold would not need to incur the cost of requesting a reopening of the original return and could instead include it in a subsequent return. Inland Revenue would benefit from reduced administrative costs in not having to reopen the relevant assessment. Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 5 Tax preparers Inland Revenue expects that the group of tax preparers who currently do not receive Inland Revenue’s services for tax agents consists mostly of boo kkeepers and payroll intermediaries. Hence it is expected that the major beneficiaries of the proposal to clarify the group of persons who are eligible for the services for tax preparers that will become available under Business Transformation would include bookkeepers, payroll intermediaries and their clients. Nominated persons The current inability for the Commissioner to refuse to recognise a person as a taxpayer’s nominated person may potentially advantage or disadvantage taxpayers that nominate a person to act for them. In some instances the exercise of a discretion to refuse to allow someone to be another taxpayer’s nominated person, if legislated, may help to protect taxpayers from fraudulent or unscrupulous behaviour; on the other hand, it is possible (especially if there are not sufficient constraints on the Commissioner’s ability to refuse to recognise a nominated person) that the taxpayer may be unfairly disadvantaged by the Commissioner’s exercise of the discretion. This is the reason for limiting the exercise of the proposed discretion to circumstances where the person is acting on behalf of a taxpayer for a fee or is otherwise acting in a professional capacity. Situations where a person is acting for a family member are not proposed to be covered by the discretion. 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? There are no constraints on the scope of options considered. Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 6 Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options have been considered? Assessment criteria The following criteria were used to assess the options: • Sustainability: the option should support the coherence and integrity of the tax system; • Compliance costs: the compliance cost for taxpayers and their agents should be minimised as far as possible; and • Administrative costs: the administrative costs to the Government should be minimised as far as possible. Options Two Government discussion documents in the Making Tax Simpler series on the Tax Administration Act were released in 2015 and 2016 (Towards a new Tax Administration Act and Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act). A number of the options discussed below were the subject of public consultation in the latter discussion document. Where the preferred options below differ from those consulted on in Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act, this is primarily as a result of the submissions received on the discussion document and of further consultation with stakeholders. Simplified rulings The main objective is to enable more small and medium-sized taxpayers to obtain rulings to increase the level of certainty they have. The sustainability criterion has greater weighting because it supports the integrity of the tax system. The following options were considered: • Option 1 – Status quo: The first option would be to retain the current rulings regime with the current fees and administrative requirements. As noted above at 2.1, the overall cost of the rulings regime has meant that small and medium-sized taxpayers have not been able to use the rulings regime, and this has raised questions about equality before the law. • Option 2 – Free rulings: Many similar jurisdictions, including Australia, offer free rulings for taxpayers. Accordingly, the second option would be to remove all fees for rulings. This would achieve the main objective of enabling more small and medium- sized taxpayers to obtain the certainty afforded by rulings. It would significantly reduce the compliance costs for taxpayers because they would be able to apply for rul ings for many more issues, and so they could ensure that they took the correct tax position. However, the extent to which this option would improve access to rulings is uncertain as taxpayers would still generally have to incur significant external advisor costs to satisfy the requirements of the current rulings regime. Also, this option could significantly increase the administrative cost for the Government because Inland Revenue would need the resources to deal with all the additional rulings applications. Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 7 Further, it would not reflect the private benefit that rulings applicants obtain through the rulings process. • Option 3 – Lower overall flat fee for all rulings: The third option would be a lower flat fee for all rulings based on a schedule of the size and type of taxpayer. This option was proposed in Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act. The proposal was to allow small and medium-sized taxpayers to use the current rulings regime but with lower fees. While this would reduce the compliance costs for taxpayers to some extent, they would still generally need to incur significant external advisor costs to satisfy the requirements of the current rulings regime. As a result, it is unlikely to significantly achieve the objective of making rulings more accessible for small and medium-sized taxpayers. Inland Revenue would also incur significant administrative costs in ruling for small and medium-sized taxpayers under the current regime given the current administrative process. However, using a schedule of fees based on the size of the entity may in most instances mean that the cost for a ruling roughly approximates the private benefit (being the economic value of the ruling) that the applicant received. 6 • Option 4 – Simplified rulings: The fourth option (the preferred option) would be to introduce a simplified rulings regime with reduced fees, which is focused on the needs of small and medium-sized taxpayers. Under this option, the simplified rulings regime would be available to entities whose annual g ross income was $5 million or less for the tax year before the current tax year (aligning it with the Accounting Income Method (AIM) threshold). AIM is a new method for paying provisional tax based on current year tax-adjusted income. The AIM threshold covers a significant number of taxpayers and excludes large corporates with complex tax adjustments. 7 Also, the new regime would only be able to rule on issues when the tax at stake was less than $1 million (if calculable). This amount would be close to the highest amounts subject to audit or dispute involving small and medium-sized taxpayers as determined from 2016 data. Also, this threshold would include approximately 99% of both voluntary and audit reassessments in the 2015 income year. The option would involve removing some of the requirements for a ruling application and would streamline the administrative process for obtaining a ruling. Specifically, the application would only need to identify the applicant and to disclose all the relevant facts and documents. The application would not be required to state the specific taxation laws or the propositions of law. Applications would also not need to specify a particular arrangement. However, the applicant would need to state the general tax outcome that was being ruled on; eg, that the income is not taxable, that the expenditure is deductible, or that the applicant is resident for tax purposes. This would significantly reduce the compliance costs for small and medium-sized taxpayers by reducing the fees and possibly external advisor costs involved in the process, and so would make rulings more accessible for small and medium-sized taxpayers. 6 While the private benefit of the ruling will be a function of the ruled transaction rather than the size of the applicant, the dollar value of the transaction in question and the size of the taxpayer will be correlated. 7 The estimated number of provisional taxpayers with annual turnover of $5 million or less in 2016 was around 149,000. Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 8 The Commissioner would retain the discretion to decline to rule under the simplified regime if the characteristics of the application were such that the Commissioner deemed it appropriate to be dealt with under the current rulings regime. Examples of when an appropriate simplified ruling would not be available may include when the application: • Raises issues where there is a significant absence, or perceived deficiency, in the relevant policy; • Directly challenges an existing Inland Revenue policy or technical position; or • Raises issues having significant national implications or a wide precedential effect. The option would increase Inland Revenue’s administrative costs of setting up the new process and dealing with any rulings under the process. To some extent Inland Revenue is currently providing advice in a less formal format, and only a small increase in resources will be needed to convert the advice into a ruling. Further, Inland Revenue anticipates that some of the simplified rulings will avoid the need for the taxpayer and Inland Revenue to enter into a dispute, so will divert resources from the disputes process to the rulings process. Minor errors The main objective is to better align the tax process for remedying minor amendments with the accounting treatment to reduce taxpayers’ compliance costs. The sustainability criterion has greater weighting because it supports the integrity of the tax system. The following options were considered: • Option 1 – Status quo: The first option would be to retain the current $1,000 threshold for carrying forward minor errors into a subsequent return. As noted above at 2.1, this means that some minor errors can be included in a subsequent set of accounts for accounting purposes, but must be included in the assessment for the original period for tax purposes. Having two different processes for minor errors adds compliance costs for taxpayers. • Option 2 – Raising the threshold to $5,000: The second option would be to raise the threshold for correcting minor errors in a subsequent return from a total tax discrepancy in a single return of $1,000 to $5,000. This would go some way to aligning the tax and accounting processes but it would have a relatively low limit. As a result, it would allow a better alignment than the status quo but it would not align as well as the other options. This option was suggested by one submitter on Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act. The option would reduce compliance costs for all taxpayers by allowing them to put errors up to $5,000 in a subsequent return rather than having to request to reopen the original assessment. Retaining a single monetary th reshold would retain the simplicity of the current approach, so it would make it easier for taxpayers to determine when they could include an error in the subsequent return compared with the other options. This option would, however, raise concerns about the integrity of the tax system. The flat threshold would allow relatively large errors for small taxpayers to be included in a Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 9 subsequent return without Inland Revenue becoming aware of the error. Taxpayers could include errors up to a maximum adjustment of income or deductions of $17,855 for a company, $15,150 for an individual on the top personal tax rate and $38,335 for GST. For small taxpayers these amounts are relatively significant, and may encourage them to be less careful about first time accuracy which may harm the integrity of the tax system. The option would reduce the administrative costs for Inland Revenue of reopening the original assessment for errors less than $5,000. • Option 3 – Introducing a supplementary threshold (up to 2% of taxable income or GST output tax if the error is $10,000 or less): The third option (the preferred option) would supplement the current $1,000 threshold with an optional additional threshold that relies to some extent on the significance of the error for the particular taxpayer. This would allow taxpayers to include any error in a subsequent return if the amount of the error was equal to or less than both $10,000 and 2% of their taxable income or output tax in the return in which the taxpayer sought to include the error. It would be optional for taxpayers, and they could still include errors up to $1,000 in a subsequent return. This would further align the tax and accounting processes for small and medium-sized taxpayers in line with the original intent of the threshold. 8 The option would not provide a significant alignment with the accounting treatment for large enterprises. The option would reduce the compliance costs for all taxpayers for errors up to $10,000 (subject to the 2% threshold) by allowing them to include such errors in a subsequent return. This would remove the need for taxpayers to request to reopen the original assessment. Data from the 2014 and 2015 income years suggests that a maximum adjustment threshold of $10,000 would include 97-98 percent of amendments by number and 84- 86 percent of adjustments by value. However, it is difficult to determine the additional number of errors that could be included in a subsequent return under this option. This is because it is unclear the extent to which taxpayers are complying with the current threshold. In addition, the data on the number of amendments made in the 2014 and 2015 did not link with the size of the taxpayer making the amendment. As noted above, the size of the error that a taxpayer would be able to carry forward into a subsequent return would be dependent on the amount of their taxable income or output tax. This option would continue to require larger errors to be included in the original return period, reflecting the lower compliance costs of amending previous assessments under the new computer system (START). For those more significant errors, the costs of reopening the original assessment under START would be less than the possible detrimental effects to the integrity of the tax system, which include: • Undermining the focus on taxpayers getting the original assessment right from the start; • Reducing the ability of Inland Revenue to identify the cause of the error, and 8 See the commentary to the Taxation (Consequential Rate Alignment and Remedial Matters) Bill 2009. Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 10 to assist taxpayers to prevent it from happening again; and • Creating opportunities for taxpayers to gain advantages from delaying the payment of tax. The supplemental threshold would cause a very small increase in compliance costs for taxpayers in having to determine whether a specific error wa s within the threshold. However, taxpayers could avoid the additional compliance costs because the supplementary threshold would be optional, and they could either seek to have the original assessment reopened or they could continue to rely on the existing $1,000 threshold. As such errors could be included in a subsequent return, the option would reduce the administrative costs for Inland Revenue. There may be a small increase in costs dealing with queries from taxpayers about whether an error comes within the threshold. • Option 4 – Introducing a larger supplementary threshold (up to 5% of taxable income or GST output tax if the error is $100,000 or less): The fourth option is essentially the same as option 3 but with higher thresholds. The option would supplement the current single monetary threshold with an approach that relies to a much greater extent on the significance of the error for the particular taxpayer. This would allow taxpayers to include any error in a subsequent return if the amount of the error was equal to or less than both $100,000 or 5% of their taxable income or output tax in the return in which the taxpayer sought to include the error. It would be optional for taxpayers. This option would best align with the tax and accounting processes for small, medium and large enterprises. This option was suggested by some submitters on Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act. The larger supplementary threshold would increase risks to the integrity of the tax system. It would reduce the incentives for taxpayers to get their assessments right from the start, and would create opportunities for taxpayers to gain advantages from delaying paying tax. The option would reduce Inland Revenue’s ability to ensure compliance with the relevant timing rules. These effects could undermine taxpayers’ perceptions of the integrity of the tax system. The option would reduce the compliance costs of taxpayers by allowing them to avoid having to request the original assessment be reopened. The size of the threshold would mean that nearly all errors could be included in a subsequent return. In other countries with high error correction thresholds, there is a requirement on taxpayers to declare any errors over a lower threshold. Such a declaration process is to protect the integrity of the tax system. A similar requirement is likely to be necessary in New Zealand for a high error correction threshold. However, Inland Revenue considers that the manual process of declaring an error through a separate process may outweigh the compliance benefits under START of reopening the previous assessment. The option would reduce the administrative costs of Inland Revenue in dealing with errors that are included in a subsequent return. However, there could be additional compliance costs in dealing with any manual declaration process. Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 11 Tax preparers The main objective is to reduce compliance costs for taxpayers and their agents (by expanding access to value-added services for tax preparers) while protecting the integrity of the tax system. The means via which this objective is to be achieved include providing transparency and clarity around the group of persons who are eligible for Inland Revenue’s service offerings for tax preparers; and improving Inland Revenue’s ability to refuse to allow a person to act on behalf of other taxpayers, where necessary, to protect the integrity of the tax system. The sustainability and compliance costs criteria therefore have greater weighting. On the basis that Inland Revenue will make its extended self-service options for tax preparers available to intermediaries who do not meet the current tax agent definition, overall, compliance costs under each of the options detailed below should decrease compared with the status quo. This is because use of the online self-service options by tax preparers who opt to receive them would allow these intermediaries to work more efficiently over the longer term, and may assist them to carry out tax compliance tasks to a higher standard (which, in turn, would yield benefits for their clients and Inland Revenue). Inland Revenue will also bear some administrative costs under each of the options, in the form of: • information technology systems costs associated with the implementation of the new online services and extending these to a wider group; • screening those applying to receive Inland Revenue’s extended service offerings and processing the relevant forms; • dealing with an initial increase in queries from tax preparers when the new service offerings are implemented in Stage 2 of Business Transformation 9 ; • on-going support with the use of online services. However, the increased take-up of online self-service options may lead to some reduction in administration costs for Inland Revenue over the longer term (for instance, as a result of a smaller volume of phone calls from tax preparers) . The following options were considered: • Option 1 – Status quo – non-tax agents continue to act as nominated persons: The first option would retain the current definition of ‘tax agent’ in the Tax Administration Act. Non-tax agents would continue to look after their clients’ tax and social policy affairs as nominated persons. Inland Revenue would still be able to offer the expanded online services for tax preparers to non-tax agents; however, maintenance of the status quo would not address the current uncertainty around the Commissioner’s ability to revoke these services, along with access to clients’ information, if necessary to protect the integrity of the tax system. On the other hand, if the proposed discretion for the Commissioner to not recognise a nominated person if doing so would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system 9 Stage 2 of Business Transformation involves streamlining personal and business income taxes. Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 12 (as discussed under the nominated persons heading below) is proceeded with, then this may provide sufficient clarity around the Commissioner’s ability to withdraw these services. Option 2 – Change the tax agent definition to include other intermediaries: The second option would expand the group of persons who are eligible to apply for listing as a tax agent beyond just those who prepare 10 or more income tax returns per year. It would not be compulsory for persons who meet the eligibility criteria to apply for listing, as nominated person access is likely to be sufficient for some people who act on behalf of other taxpayers. This would allow other tax preparers, such as bookkeepers and payroll intermediaries, to apply for listing as a tax agent to receive Inland Revenue’s extended service offerings. It would also mean that a person could be removed from the list of tax agents and have their access to client information and tax agent services withdrawn if they adversely affect the integrity of the tax system. 10 This option would impose some compliance costs on tax preparers (and on their clients) in the form of applying for listing, and gaining authorisation from their clients to act for them and to access the extended online services on their behalf. However, they would not be required to be listed as tax agents in order to act for their clients, but could instead continue to act as nominated persons without the additional services. Tax preparers would therefore only bear the compliance costs associated with becoming listed as a tax agent if they determine that doing so is worthwhile to receive the extended services. Bringing other persons within the scope of the tax agent definition would require a contingent provision to clarify the group of persons who are eligible for an extension of time (since the extension of time criteria, which are currently linked to the tax agent definition, are not proposed to change). Given the purpose of the tax agent list is to keep track of the persons who are eligible for an extension of time, it is unnecessary to impose a requirement on the Commissioner to maintain a list that would include a number of persons who are not eligible for the extension of time. To keep track of the subset of tax agents who are eligible for an extension of time, this option would in practice require the maintenance of two lists – the tax agent list, and a list of those who are eligible for an extension of time. This option would impose further administrative costs on Inland Revenue in the form of: processing an increased number of applications to be listed as a tax agent (including the associated screening processes); processing removals from the list of tax agents; and auditing authorities to act. 11 • Option 3 – Two-tier agency system: Under the third option (the preferred option), the current definition of ‘tax agent’ would be retained and another term would be separately defined in the Tax Administration Act to include other tax preparers. Like the existing section dealing with tax agents, the new provision would set out the 10 The existing discretion for the Commissioner to (if necessary) remove a person from the list of tax agents is subject to judicial review, which provides a check over the exercise of the discretion. 11 While a process exists for tax agents to obtain the “authority to act” on behalf of their clients client via electronic means, many tax agents still have their clients sign a written authority to act form, which the tax agent is required to hold on file. Inland Revenue audits each tax agent’s authorities to act by selecting 10 of the agent’s clients and requesting to see the completed and signed authority to act forms for those clients. Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 13 Commissioner’s ability to deregister the person if necessary to protect the integrity of the tax system. The Commissioner’s exercise of this discretion would be a judicially reviewable decision. This option would be more transparent and would provide more clarity for tax preparers and Inland Revenue than option 1. It would not only make the Commissioner’s discretion to revoke tax preparer service offerings from a person if necessary to protect the integrity of the tax system explicit in the legislation, but would also make it clear exactly who is entitled to receive these extended service offerings. Compared with option 2, this option would also better recognise the differing roles of tax agents and other tax preparers and would avoid conflating the two concepts. However, like option 2, this option would impose some compliance costs on tax preparers (and on their clients) in the form of registering with Inland Revenue to receive the extended services, and gaining authorisation from their clients to act for them. However, registration would not be compulsory; instead, they could continue to look after their clients’ tax and social policy affairs as nominated persons. Therefore, tax preparers would only bear the compliance costs of registering if they determined that doing so was worthwhile to receive the extended services. Eligibility to be registered as a tax preparer would be restricted to those who have 10 or more clients 12 and are in the business of acting on behalf of taxpayers in relation to their tax affairs or who carry on an occupation or professional public practice in which tax returns are prepared. This would also include those who perform pro-bono tax preparation services, provided that the requirement for at least 10 clients is met. 13 Compared with the status quo (option 1), this option would impose further administrative costs on Inland Revenue in the form of processing registrations and deregistrations and auditing authorities to act. Unlike option 2, the Commissioner would not be statutorily required to maintain a list of tax preparers (other than the list of tax agents which is already required by law). Nominated persons The following options were considered: • Option 1 – Status quo: The first option would maintain the status quo where a person who is nominated by a taxpayer to act on their behalf in dealing with Inland Revenue is viewed as the agent of the taxpayer under common law. Under this view, a nominated person’s authorisation to act for a taxpayer can only be revoked by the taxpayer notifying Inland Revenue that the person is not to act for them any longer. This means that the Commissioner cannot unilaterally refuse to recognise the person 12 This may include multiple entities within a group. 13 Those with less than 10 clients will be able to use the online services that will be made available to taxpayers and their nominated persons who have a myIR account. The services that taxpayers and nominated persons with ‘token access’ will be able to access include changing registration details, registering new accounts, filing returns, making payments, setting up instalment arrangements, accessing transactions summaries and GST returns summaries, and sending and viewing email. The main difference between token access and access for tax preparers is that tax preparers will be able to link and delink their own clients (whereas nominated persons will only be able to access their clients’ account information and return filing in myIR once the client has approved their access). There would also be some additional reporting which would likely only be useful for those with at least 10 clients. Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 14 as the taxpayer’s nominated person, even if the person has been convicted of fraud. The integrity risk of persons who have been removed from the list of tax agents (or deregistered as tax preparers) for tax integrity reasons coming back into the system as nominated persons, with no clear ability for the Commissioner to refuse to allow them access to taxpayers’ account information and online filing for these other taxpayers, would therefore remain. • Option 2 – Limited discretion for the Commissioner to not recognise a nominated person: The second option (the preferred option) would allow the Commissioner to choose not to recognise a person as a taxpayer’s nominated person if she has reasonable tax integrity concerns about giving the person access to taxpayers’ account information and online filing on behalf of that taxpayer. This would strengthen both the Commissioner’s existing power to remove a person from the list of tax agents and the proposed discretion to deregister a tax preparer if necessary to protect the integrity of the tax system. However, the circumstances in which the Commissioner could refuse to recognise a nominated person would be limited to where the person is acting for a fee or is otherwise acting in a professional capacity. “Acting for a fee or otherwise acting in a professional capacity” would not cover situations where the person is acting for a family member or friend. “Acting in a professional capacity” would however cover situations where a person is performing pro-bono work for a number of taxpayers. Ensuring that the Commissioner can refuse to recognise a person who would not be allowed to be a tax agent would help to safeguard the integrity of the tax system by reducing the likelihood of that person being able to commit fraud. However, there is a risk that this may give tax officials too much discretion, which could result in use of the rule in some instances where a refusal to deal with a person nominated by a taxpayer is undue. The proposal is not aimed at subjecting nominated persons to more stringent regulation than that faced by tax agents. The proposal is instead intended to ensure that, if a person would not be allowed to be listed as a tax agent for tax integrity reasons, the Commissioner can choose, if n ecessary to protect the integrity of the tax system, to refuse to allow them to act for other taxpayers under the nominated person regime in appropriately limited circumstances. This is the reason for the proposed restrictions on the discretion (that is, the discretion can only be exercised where the person is acting for a fee or is otherwise acting in a professional capacity), which should help to ensure that the Commissioner’s exercise of the discretion does not go too far. Further, the exercise of the discretion would be subject to judicial review. Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 15 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? Simplified rulings Inland Revenue prefers option 4 (simplified rulings regime) because it: • reduces the overall cost of rulings for small and medium-sized taxpayers, and should reduce the time to obtain a ruling; • protects the rulings regime from excess demand or a need for increased Inland Revenue resources (as opposed to free rulings or reduced fees for all rulings) • reflects the dual private and public benefit of the rulings regime for small and medium- sized taxpayers. Minor errors Inland Revenue prefers option 3 (introducing a supplementary threshold (lesser of $10,000 or 2%)) because it: • better aligns with the current practices and accounting treatment of small and medium-sized taxpayers; • produces a lower risk to the integrity of the tax system than option 4 (Introducing a larger supplementary threshold); • enables the Commissioner to allocate her limited resources to collecting over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law by better focusing on significant risks (as the data suggests the threshold will include the majority of amendments); and • reduces compliance costs for taxpayers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue. Tax preparers Inland Revenue prefers option 3 (two-tier agency system) because it: • reduces the potential harm to the integrity of the tax system (compared with option 1); and • allows for recognition of the differing roles of tax agents and other tax preparers (compared with option 2). Nominated persons Inland Revenue prefers option 2 (limited discretion for the Commissioner to not recognise a nominated person) because it reduces the harm to the integrity of the tax system.

Simplified rulings There is a possible fiscal risk from providing simplified rulings. The risk arises if taxpayers are given a ruling that later turns out to be incorrect (for instance, because not enough time was spent on the ruling), and that opens a fiscal risk for the Crown. The proposed thresholds under the preferred option reduce the monetary level of the risk. However, given the reduced scrutiny under the proposed option, as compared with the current rulings process, there is a greater risk of this occurring more frequently. The grounds for withdraw ing a simplified ruling would be the same as the existing grounds in the Tax Administration Act for withdrawing binding rulings. It is difficult to predict how much demand there would be for simplified rulings; hence there is some risk that there will be significantly higher demand for rulings than has been predicted, which may require further resourcing. Inland Revenue considers this risk would be mitigated to some extent by the fee charged for the simplified rulings, the entry requirements for when a simplified ruling can be applied for, and the application requirements for a ruling. The aim is to strike a balance between enabling small and medium-sized businesses to obtain simplified rulings to improve voluntary compliance without requiring significant additional resources for Inland Revenue to meet the demand. Minor errors There is a potential risk that increasing the threshold will encourage taxpayers to change their behaviour to include even larger errors (above the increased threshold) in subsequent returns. Submitters suggested that taxpayers may in practice be including errors larger than the current threshold in subsequent returns. Any increase in the threshold, therefore, may lead to an extension of this approach. This could have fiscal implications. Tax preparers There is a possible risk that a minority of tax preparers might use online services to carry out fraud which, due to the real-time nature of online services, would mean that fraudulent transactions would be quicker and easier to carry out. This is the reason for the proposed discretion for the Commissioner to deregister or to refuse to register a tax preparer if she has reasonable tax integrity concerns about allowing the person to access online services on behalf of other taxpayers. Nominated persons No other risks arising from this proposal (aside from the possible costs outlined in Section 4) have been identified. Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 20 Section 5: Stakeholder views 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? These proposals were foreshadowed in a green paper and a discussion document, Making Tax Simpler: A Government green paper on tax administration (released in March 2015) and Making Tax Simpler: Towards a new Tax Administration Act (November 2015). The specific proposals were included in the discussion document Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act (December 2016). An online forum was also provided at makingtaxsimpler.ird.govt.nz. There were 15 written submissions on the discussion document and 19 comments on the related online forum. The submissions are discussed below. Simplified rulings To make the binding rulings regime more accessible to small and medium-sized taxpayers, the discussion document included a proposal to reduce the fees for binding rulings. Submitters were generally in favour of the proposal, h owever, submissions disagreed over how fees should be decreased. Some submissions favoured retaining an hourly rate while others suggested flat or graduated fees. Supporters of a graduated fee suggested it would be fairer across different types of taxpayers. Others suggested that such an approach may discriminate between taxpayers. Three submissions also raised concerns that the time required for a ruling was a disincentive to their use. It was suggested that small and medium-sized taxpayers were often focussed on growth and needed to make quick decisions, while all taxpayers have business opportunities that develop unexpectedly and need rulings quickly. Submissions suggested that merely reducing the fees charged for rulings would not increase the use of them. The preparation costs with the current rulings regime would still be a barrier. Some submitters suggested that a simplified regime should be put in place to reduce the preparation costs of a binding ruling. Concerns were raised about whether the rulings team would be adequately resourced to cope with the increase demand for binding rulings that may come from reduced fees. It was noted that the rulings team currently provides a high standard of service and the standard and timeliness of rulings may suffer if further resourcing is not provided to the rulings team to cope with any increased demand. The above submissions were taken into account in designing the preferred option of a simplified rulings regime for small and medium-sized taxpayers. In particular, the simplified regime has been designed to be quicker and cheaper overall, and to complement the current rulings regime. Submitters also submitted that small and medium-sized taxpayers should be given greater access to less formal forms of advice, as they may be more suitable for the less complex tax issues raised by these taxpayers. As noted in Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act, Inland Revenue is in the process of designing its future organisational Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 21 structure which will be crucial in determining how it will balance its resources and provide more effective advice. This will include consideration of giving greater access to less formal advice. Questions were also raised as to why the proposal placed such a high priority on small and medium-sized taxpayers as opposed to the range of other taxpayers that may wish to access binding rulings. Other submitters noted that large taxpayers were well- serviced by the current rulings regime, and preferred no changes be made for those taxpayers. Inland Revenue considers that larger taxpayers are adequately serviced by the current rulings regime, and that the problem relates to the difficulty of small and medium-sized taxpayers obtaining the same certainty. Minor errors Submissions on the proposal to expand the current approach to minor errors were favourable of the concept. However, differing views emerged as to how minor errors should be approached. Submitters suggested options including: • A single threshold increased from $1,000 to $5,000 • A threshold with a significantly higher monetary threshold based on materiality to the taxpayer; for example, the lower of $100,000 or 5% (or 1% ) of the taxable income or output tax. • A threshold based on the use-of-money interest implications of the error rather than the amount of tax or income involved. The first two options suggested are reflected in the options discussed above. Inland Revenue considered: • the second and third options suggested above raised too many risks to the integrity of the tax system; and • the third submission would be too difficult to work in practice. A number of additional comments were also made on this proposal. It was submitted that a more useful remedy would be to extend the statutory response period in which a taxpayer may dispute their own assessment, as New Zealand currently has a uniquely brief period in which this may occur (within 4 months from the date of the return). Inland Revenue considers that the response period would need to be considered as part of a broader review of the disputes process. Tax preparers Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act consulted on a proposal to amend the statutory tax agent definition to include a wider group of “tax intermediaries”, such as those who may file only GST and/or PAYE returns (option 2 discussed in section 3.1) . However, submitters made a number of comments as to exactly how the definition of a tax agent should be amended. This included that there should be no fee earning criterion to be a tax agent as proposed in the discussion document. In particular, submitters said the proposed fee earning c riterion should not apply to agents or intermediaries performing pro bono work Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 22 for charities and not-for-profits, and that tax agents and other intermediaries who prepare tax returns on behalf of their employers should also remain eligible to be tax agents. 14 A few submissions stated that tax intermediaries and tax agents are distinct and the terminology should not be conflated. One submitter suggested that a better way to achieve both recognition and regulation of tax intermediaries who do not meet the current tax agent definition is to create a separate “tax intermediary” definition, as doing so would allow the retention of the current tax agent definition (which already sets out the eligibility criteria for an extension of filing time) and would recognise important differences between the two groups. It was further submitted that the majority of those currently meeting the definition of “tax agent” are subject to high levels of scrutiny and accountability and are required to have certain qualifications and meet continuing professional standards. As such, this will continue to justify the recognition of tax agents as distinct from intermediaries, despite the expansion of the role of tax intermediaries. Another submitter supported combining tax agents and intermediaries but submitted that, if the distinction between the two remains, then the distinction needs to be clear. These submissions are reflected in the discussion of the options above. Inland Revenue agrees with submitters that there should be no fee-earning criterion to be registered as either a tax agent or a tax preparer. Those who prepare income tax returns for their employers (such as in-house accountants preparing tax returns for multiple entities within a group) or who perform pro-bono income tax preparation services for 10 or more taxpayers are not currently excluded from being tax agents and Inland Revenue does not consider this should change. Further, there is no reason to exclude those preparing returns for other tax types (such as GST and PAYE) from accessing the new services for tax preparers on the basis that they do not earn a fee. In light of the submissions received on the differing roles of tax agents and other intermediaries, Inland Revenue considers it is appropriate to recognise these two groups as distinct. The boundary between how the two groups are defined should be clear, as the preferred option (option 3) would retain the current tax agent definition. Nominated persons Three written submissions and one online forum comment expressed support for the proposal to provide the Commissioner with a legislated discretion to not recognise someone as a nominated person, if doing so would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system. One submitter commented that the Commissioner’ s use of this discretion should be a reviewable decision. Two commentators on the online forum were opposed to the proposal, one stating that it is up to the taxpayer who represents them and should not be a matter for the 14 The intention behind the fee-earning criterion proposed in the discussion document was to differentiate between intermediaries who carry out a business or occupation that involves the preparation of tax returns, versus those who only act for other taxpayers in a small-time capacity. This is because the additional services would be of greater benefit to those in the former group, while the nominated person regime should be sufficient for those in the latter group. It was never intended that the likes of in-house accountants and those preparing GST and PAYE returns for multiple charities and non-profit bodies on a pro-bono basis be excluded from the scope of the proposal. Exceptions to the fee-earning criterion for these intermediaries were proposed in the discussion document, but it seems these were not as clearly explained as they could have been. Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 23 Commissioner. Inland Revenue recognises that the exercise of such a discretion, especially if it is drafted too widely, may in some instances unfairly disadvantage taxpayers that have nominated a person to act for them. This is the reason for limiting the exercise of the proposed discretion to circumstances where the person is acting on behalf of a taxpayer for a fee or is otherwise acting in a professional capacity. Inland Revenue therefore expects that the potential risk would be outweighed by the tax integrity benefit from not allowing clearly unfit persons (who are acting in a paid or professional capacity) to file returns on behalf of other taxpayers and access their information.

The preferred options will need to be implemented by legislative amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994. The legislative amendments could be included in the first omnibus tax Bill in 2018. The amendments would apply from the date of enactment. Explanation of the amendments and their effect would be contained in a Tax Information Bulletin, which would be released shortly after the bill received Royal assent. Simplified rulings The simplified rulings regime would need similar provisions to the current rulings regime to be enacted. The current requirements for a taxpayer to apply for a ruling would be tailored for the simplified regime. The thresholds would also be specified in the legislation. The fees for the simplified rulings regime would be specified in regulations (as is currently the case) or by the Commissioner at a later date and subject to the regulatory impact analysis requirements as necessary. The implementation of the preferred option would require an internal Inland Revenue process to issue the simplified rulings applications. The internal process would be developed in conjunction with the organisational design process that is currently being undertaken within Inland Revenue. There is a risk that there could be a significantly larger number of ruling applications than currently anticipated (being approximately 140-160 rulings per year). This would require Inland Revenue to commit significantly more resources to processing the rulings. Given the fees and likely advisor costs for applying for a ruling, the risk of a significantly larger number of rulings than anticipated is considered to be small. In any event, any further resources committed to the simplified rulings regime may be in substitution for other forms of advice currently provided or for disputes that would otherwise occur. As a result, if further resources are required for the simplified rulings regime these may to some extent come from a reduction in resources needed in other areas. Minor errors The proposed increase in the threshold for amending minor errors in a subsequent return would require an amendment to the Tax Administration Act 1994. Tax preparers and nominated persons The proposed provision to define the group of persons who are eligible to receive Inland Revenue’s extended services for tax preparers, along with the discretion for the Commissioner to deregister or refuse to register a tax preparer if necessary to protect the integrity of the tax system, would require an amendment to the Tax Administration Act 1994, as would the proposal to provide the Commissioner with a discretion to choose not Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 25 to recognise a nominated person if doing so would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system. The number of persons who would apply for registration as a tax preparer is unknown, so there is a risk that a large volume of applications may require Inland Revenue to commit more resources to processing the applications in the short term. However, given the compliance costs involved in registering and in getting authorisation from clients to access these services on their behalf, it is expected that a number of those eligible, particularly those who are less technologically savvy, may prefer to remain in the nominated person regime. The proposed restriction on eligibility to those who carry on a business or occupation in which tax returns are prepared, or who prepare tax returns for an employer, and who act on behalf of 10 or more taxpayers 15 , would also constrain the number of those eligible to apply for the services. 15 This may include several entities within a group. Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 26 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue will monitor the outcomes of the changes pursuant to the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process th at has been used to design tax policy (and subsequently social policy administered by Inland Revenue) in New Zealand since 1995. For the simplified rulings proposal, the monitoring would involve a review of the number of rulings made, and the types of taxpayers applying for rulings. Further indicators of the effectiveness of the policy may include the average time taken to make the rulings and the overall costs incurred by taxpayers in obtaining the rulings. For the proposal to increase the threshold to carry minor errors into a subsequent return, monitoring would more problematic. The fact that taxpayers would not be required to notify Inland Revenue when they had included a minor error in a subsequent return would make it difficult for Inland Revenue to monitor the effectiveness of the proposal. Two possible indicators of the effectiveness of the policy may be: • Feedback from taxpayers and representative groups that the amendment had reduced compliance costs for taxpayers; and • A reduction in taxpayers contacting Inland Revenue to remedy minor errors within the proposed threshold. For the proposal to introduce a new provision in the Tax Administration Act to clarify the persons who are eligible to register with Inland Revenue to receive the extended service offerings for tax preparers , the monitoring would involve feedback from tax preparers and representative groups on the extended service offerings, and may include a review of the number of tax preparer registrations processed and the number of deregistrations. For the proposed Commissioner discretion to refuse to recognise a nominated person (if allowing the person to act for other taxpayers would adversely affect the integrit y of the tax system), a possible indicator of whether the policy is appropriate may be the number of Commissioner-initiated revocations of access rights for nominated persons, as well as feedback from taxpayers, tax service providers and operational staff within Inland Revenue. Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries | 27 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The final step in the GTPP is the implementation and review stage, which involves post- implementation review of legislation and the identification of remedial issues. Post- implementation review is expected to occur around 12 months after implementation. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. Any necessary changes identified as a result of the review would be recommended for addition to the Government's tax policy work programme, and any resulting proposals would go through the GTPP.

This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis The key limitations on the analysis that follows are: •Cons ultation and testing: Although there has been consultation with employers and payroll providers employers with small payrolls w ho do not use payroll software were underrepresented in submissions. •Quality of data used for impact analysis: We have been unable to accurately estimate the monetary value of expected changes in administrative costs for Inland Revenue and compliance costs for employers and payroll software developers.

Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? PAYE error correction “PAYE error correction” describes the process by which employers advise Inland Revenue of changes to income, PAYE and other deductions, such as KiwiSaver when an error has been made in, or an adjustment is required to, the information originally filed with Inland Revenue. For many reasons, including human error and late receipt of information, payroll errors 1 are inevitable. There are three types of errors that require amendment to PAYE information: 1. Reporting errors arise when the employee(s) were paid and taxed correctly but reporting to Inland Revenue does not accurately reflect what was paid and/or withheld. 2. Payroll overpayment errors arise when an employee is overpaid, correcting the overpayment requires consequential change to the amounts withheld for PAYE and related deductions such as KiwiSaver. 3. Interpretation errors arise when the employee receives the correct pay but an incorrect tax treatment is applied, for example a benefit is treated as tax free when it should have been subject to PAYE. Because salary and wage earners are taxed when they are paid underpayments are taxed when they are paid and so there is no requirement to correct the information already provided to Inland Revenue. The current PAYE error correction process is set out in operational guidance from Inland Revenue and is largely manual. The current PAYE error correction guidelines require all errors to be corrected by filing an amendment to the original return. This requirement imposes considerable compliance costs on employers and administrative costs on Inland Revenue. The guidelines would need to be updated to reflect the changes proposed in the Taxation (Annual rates for 2017-18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Bill (The Bill). This Bill introduces “payday reporting” 2 . In general, payday reporting would require employers to file “employment income information” with Inland Revenue within 2 to 10 working days of payday. This information is currently provided to Inland Revenue on a 1 Payroll staff often distinguish between “errors” and “adjustments” with the latter category arising from timing events such as the late receipt of information. For simplicity these are all referred to in this document as errors. 2 This Bill is currently before the Finance and Expenditure Committee and the proposed changes are due to be mandatory from April 2019, employers can voluntarily adopt payday filing from April 2018.. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 2 monthly basis. Payday reporting will allow some errors to be identified and corrected more quickly but it will reduce the amount of time available to employers to correct information before it is sent to Inland Revenue and, when an error has continued for several pay periods, it will require more returns to be amended. Therefore, in the absence of any other changes, payday reporting will increase the overall number of errors reported to Inland Revenue. This is the status quo position. Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme provides an opportunity to reduce compliance costs for employers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue by modernising the PAYE error correction process using employers’ payroll software and taking advantage of the capabilities in Inland Revenue’s new computer system. This could be achieved by revising some of Inland Revenue’s requirements and coding PAYE error correction requirements into payroll software and Inland Revenue’s system. To achieve this outcome the requirements would need to provide certainty and must be accessible to employers and developers of payroll software. The requirements must also cater for those organisations which do not use payroll software. We note that the Bill proposes that the requirements for PAYE error correction can be set out in regulations. Other problems with PAYE error correction In addition, a matter affecting PAYE error correction has arisen which relates to the definition of PAYE income in the Income Tax Act 2007. The objective of providing certainty in relation to the requirements for PAYE error correction requires that this issue should be resolved as soon as possible so that it can be included in advice to providers of payroll software and employers. The problem concerns the taxable status of overpaid PAYE income which is not repaid. Inland Revenue’s legal position is that an overpayment which is not repaid is not taxable unless it has been obtained fraudulently or has become a debt remittance income. Consultation with employers suggests that at least some employers treat this income as taxable and that any change to their approach would incur additional compliance costs and could reduce the likelihood of the employee agreeing to repay the net amount overpaid. Some employers who treat overpaid income which is not repaid as subject to PAYE seek a refund of PAYE and other deductions, when they obtain agreement from the employee that the net amount will be repaid 3 , others wait until the net amount is fully repaid. 3 If the employee subsequently defaults on the repayment these employers submit a further error correction to reinstate the outstanding amount as income and pay PAYE on it. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 3 2.2 Who is affected and how? Employers would be most affected by the current situation and those who responded to consultation generally supported the proposed changes on the basis that they would help to reduce their compliance costs. Payroll software developers would also be affected by the proposals for PAYE error correction. They generally support the proposed changes because they would provide certainty and would simplify reporting. Employees could be potentially affected. If the requirements for PAYE error correction are unclear or too complex employers could ignore them and adopt approaches which could be unfair for employees whose records of income and deductions might be affected. Some tax professionals do not support the proposed change to the status of overpaid PAYE income which is not repaid because it would tax an amount which is not currently defined as PAYE income and denies the employer the refund of PAYE that is currently available. The individual employers who responded to consultation on this point nevertheless supported the proposed change. 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? The common law principle that wage and salary earners are taxed when they are paid is a constraint. This principle means that underpayments are taxed when they are paid; there is therefore no “error” from a tax perspective and no requirement on the employer to amend earlier tax returns. No change is proposed and t his issue is not analysed further in this impact summary. The Bill’s changes to PAYE reporting are a constraint as they require more frequent filing of PAYE information. These changes form part of Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme. One objective of this programme is to, as much as possible; integrate tax obligations with normal business processes by using business software to automate processes. Automation requires the rules to be set out clearly and centrally so that they can be coded. The proposed changes would be consistent with a largely automated approach to error correction. In most cases, this would allow an employer using payroll software to generate the information required by Inland Revenue as a consequence of updating their own records. Because a significant group of employers do not use payroll software the requirements for PAYE error correction should also cater for employers who would manually correct their PAYE information. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 4 Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options have been considered? Modernising PAYE error correction Criteria • Minimise compliance costs to the extent possible for employers and payroll software developers: • Minimise administrative costs for Inland Revenue, including consistency with the objectives of Inland Revenue’s business transformation. • Maintain the equity of the tax system. This means allowable approaches to PAYE error correction should not disadvantage employees to whom the income and deductions belong. • Maintain the integrity of the tax system. Options for error correction • Option 1: All corrections would be made by amending the original return (status quo). • Option 2: Employers would be able to make corrections by either; amending the original return or reporting the correction in a subsequent return. The ability to amend in a subsequent return would exist even if the error occurred in a previous tax year. Additional sub-options have been considered for interpretation errors and these are discussed below. Analysis of options for each error type against the stated criteria 1. Reporting errors Option 1 is preferred over option 2 for dealing with reporting errors. If reporting errors were not corrected in the original return there could be a mismatch in the reported information and the amount paid. This would give rise to reconciliation problems which give rise to compliance costs and administrative costs. Amending the original return would also ensure that employees would not be disadvantaged by the income or deductions actually received being reported in a later period. Option 2 does not address the problem. 2. Overpayment errors Option 1 would involve higher compliance costs for users of payroll software, compared with option 2. This is particularly true in the context of payday reporting - that is, if an error has continued for more than one payday, an employer who pays more often than monthly would have more returns to correct. Option 2 would involve a reduction in compliance costs for employers using payroll software, compared with option 1. These reductions would arise because employers would be able to report overpayment errors in a subsequent return which would Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 5 eliminate the requirement for a separate error correction return. Because it provides choices option 2 would also cater for employers who do not use payroll software and who prefer to make corrections by amending the original return. Option 2 would not give rise to integrity concerns. If the overpayment error occurred in a previous tax year option two would more often ensure that the reduction in an employee’s income feeds through into their annual assessment and social policy position. For this reason option 2 is also preferred on equity grounds as fewer employees would need to seek a reassessment to ensure the reduction in their income feeds through to an assessment. Option 2 would not be fully available to employers until Inland Revenue’s new computer system takes over the full processing of PAYE; this is not expected until 2020. Until then employers would only report overpayment errors in a subsequent return if the net amount reported were a positive number. 3. Interpretation errors Option 1 Requiring all interpretation errors to be corrected by amending the original return (the status quo) would impose higher compliance and administrative costs than option 2. There would not be equity or integrity of the tax system concerns with this option. Option 2 Allowing the employer to choose to correct the error either by amending the original return or by including the correction in a subsequent return would have lower compliance and administrative costs than option 1. However if the ability to correct interpretation errors in a subsequent return is unconstrained employees could be disadvantaged by having a significant increase in their income reported in a single payday return when they have not had an increase in available cash 4 . This concern led to consideration of sub option 2a below. In addition, concern for the integrity of the tax system led to consideration of a further sub option as set out in sub option 2b below. Option 2a This sub option would permit employers to choose to correct small interpretation errors in a subsequent return up to a threshold of PAYE on the error being less than 10% of the employee’s PAYE in the payday return. Larger interpretation errors would need to be corrected by amending the original return(s) . Option 2a would mitigate the risk of disadvantaging employees but it would impose higher compliance and administrative costs than option two. 4 This situation could arise if a taxable benefit such as subsidised accommodation had been treated as tax free, if the value of this benefit is all reported in one payday return the employee has higher income reported but no more cash. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 6 Option 2b In addition to the 10% threshold proposed in sub option 2a concern for the integrity of the tax system lead to a further proposal: that an employer could only correct interpretation errors in a subsequent return if they had made less than $10,000 of upward reassessments in that tax year. This sub option would have significantly higher compliance costs that options 2 and 2a but it has the advantage of reducing the likelihood that the correcting interpretation errors in a subsequent return could conceal widespread non-compliance. Options for amending definition of PAYE income Three options are considered using the criteria set out at the beginning of this section. • Option 1: no amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007. This is the status quo option. • Option 2: no amendment to the Income Tax Act and a significant investment by Inland Revenue in employer education in an effort to change employer behaviour. • Option 3: amend the Income Tax Act 2007 so that overpaid PAYE income that is not repaid remains subject to PAYE. Analysis of options Option 1 This option retains the current definition of PAYE income. Some employer submissions indicated that this option would be inconsistent with current employer practice and with how their payroll software is currently configured. Continuing with the status quo may undermine the objective of automating error correction through software and is likely to result in continuing non-compliance which undermines the integrity of the tax system. This option could also be seen as inequitable because it treats an employee who repays overpaid PAYE income as having the same income as an employee who does not repay it. Option 2 Under this option there would be no change to the definition of PAYE income in the Income Tax Act 2007 and Inland Revenue would widely publicise its view of the law in an effort to change employer practice and how payroll software is configured. The objective would be to enable payroll software to be used to report such errors to Inland Revenue and recover overpaid PAYE and other deductions as soon as an overpayment is identified and regardless of whether it is repaid or not. This option would have significant one-off educational costs for Inland Revenue and might not be successful. Those employers consulted view the status of overpaid PAYE income as wages or salary subject to PAYE. In addition, employers have reasons under employment law for not coding the amount as an overpayment in their Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 7 payroll system until agreement to repay has been reached. If this option resulted in a change in employer behaviour employers would benefit by being able to recover PAYE and other deductions from Inland Revenue regardless of whether they had recovered the net amount from the employee. Option 3 This option would expand the definition of PAYE income so that overpaid PAYE income not repaid would be subject to PAYE. This option would have lower compliance and administrative costs than the alternatives as it accords with how (some) employers currently treat such income and with how their software is configured. This option supports the integrity of the tax system as overpayments not repaid would generally become taxable as debt remittance income. However, because employees would be unlikely to be aware of this obligation it is unlikely that tax would be paid on such income. Option 3 would expand the definition of PAYE income and could be seen as unfair for employers because it denies employers refunds of PAYE and related deductions that they are currently entitled to. It could also be seen as unfair to employees who have been overpaid because that amount would be taxed before it becomes debt remittance income. As noted above, there are countervailing equity arguments that suggest that Option 3 is preferable on equity grounds because for social policy purposes it would recognise an employer who repaid overpaid income as on a lower income than someone who received an equivalent overpayment but did not repay it. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 8 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? Error Correction 1. Reporting errors: Option 1 (all corrections to be made by amending the original return) is the proposed approach as it is preferable on all criteria. 2. Overpayment errors: Option 2 (allowing the employer the choice between amending the original return and correcting in a subsequent period) is the proposed approach as it reduces compliance and administrative costs and is preferable on equity grounds. 3. Interpretation errors: Option 2a (allowing the employer the choice between amending the original return and correcting in a subsequent period subject to PAYE on the correction being less than 10 percent of the employee’s PAYE in the return) is the preferred approach. This option represents the best trade- off between reducing compliance costs for employers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue without the possibility of unfair impacts on employees. Definition of PAYE income The taxable status of overpaid PAYE income which is not repaid: Option 3 (amending the definition of PAYE income so that overpaid PAYE income which is not repaid remains subject to PAYE) is the preferred approach as it is preferable on all criteria. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 9 Section 4: Impact Analysis (Proposed approach) 4.1 Summary table of costs and benefits PAYE Error correction: the error correction items are considered together as costs are principally driven by the requirement to amend original returns. When there is a continuing requirement to correct errors by amending the original return employers who use software should experience reduced compliance costs owing to automation. Employers who do not use payroll software but who have internet connectivity would be able to access their already filed and processed returns through myIR and self- correct earlier returns; this should reduce costs for this segment. Employers who report PAYE on paper would continue to have access to a paper form for PAYE error corrections and for simple corrections should be able to make them over the telephone. Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties Providers of payroll software would need to up grade their products to support the electronic submission of error corrections in line with the proposed methods for error correction. Software providers could integrate this change into the regular update cycle. Work to create an automated channel for the status quo position is already underway in advance of the proposed regulations, as part of business transformation changes. These are transitional costs. Employers would have transitional costs of understanding the new approach in order to take advantage of it. Very low Very low Regulators Inland Revenue would need to ensure that employers and payroll providers are provided with appropriate education and support and that its new computer system is effectively set up and tested in order to receive negative values from 2020. These are transitional costs. Very low Wider government NA NA Other parties NA NA Total Monetised Cost NA NA Non-monetised costs Very low Expected benefits of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties Providers of payroll software: Have additional certainty that their payroll offerings are compliant with requirements. Employers (including payroll intermediaries). Once it becomes possible in 2020 for employers Very low Medium Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 10 to file negative values to correct overpayment errors in a subsequent return, compliance costs to correct overpayment errors, are expected to materially reduce. The ability to correct small interpretation errors in a subsequent return should reduce costs of reporting these errors. These benefits are ongoing. Regulators Inland Revenue once the new system has bedded in and employers can use their payroll systems to correct overpayment errors and minor interpretation errors in a subsequent return, including those showing negative values the cost of administering the PAYE system should reduce. Low Wider government Government employers are expected to have the same experience as private sector employers. The changes are also expected to benefit the Ministry of Social Development and the Accident Compensation Corporation which pay PAYE income to beneficiaries and to recipients of New Zealand superannuation and accident compensation. Medium Other parties NA NA Total Monetised Benefit NA NA Non-monetised benefits . Low/medium Overpaid PAYE income subject to PAYE Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties Software providers would have no costs as we understand their systems currently support the proposed approach. Employers: we understand that what is proposed aligns with how (some) employers currently treat this income and reflects how their systems work. Even though the proposed change would preclude employers from receiving a refund of PAYE on the overpaid income (some) employers are not currently claiming this refund. Unless this practice changed the increased cost would be theoretical, rather than real. Further, employers argue that continuing to treat overpaid income as subject to PAYE would make it more likely that the employee would repay the employer because repayment would be the only way their record of income for social policy purposes is corrected. To the extent this view is valid the theoretical increase in costs Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 11 identified below would reduce. Employer costs have been estimated as very low; this reflects the fact that the situation is not a common one and assumes that some employers do seek a refund of PAYE on overpaid PAYE income that is not repaid. Very low Regulators Inland Revenue: the proposal reflects the way the system is currently operating so no additional costs would be incurred. No change Wider government NA NA Other parties NA NA Total Monetised Cost NA NA Non-monetised costs As noted above (some) employers have advised us that what is proposed is how they currently operate. For these employers there would be no increase in costs. The costs have been entered as very low on the assumption that some employers are recovering PAYE on overpaid income not repaid. Very low Expected benefits of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties Payroll providers will have certainty that their systems could be used as currently configured to seek a refund of overpaid income when repayment is agreed or made. Employers would have certainty that the widespread current approach, that treats this income as subject to PAYE, is consistent with the law. Employees would be freed of any obligation to pay tax on the overpaid PAYE income when and if it becomes debt remittance income. Low Regulators Inland Revenue would no longer have to deal with ambiguity around the current position. Low Wider government NA NA Other parties NA NA Total Monetised Benefit Non-monetised benefits The primary benefit is increased certainty around how this income should be treated for tax purposes. Low Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 12 4.2 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? The proposed legislative change to deem overpaid PAYE that is not repaid as subject to PAYE would improve equity between overpaid employees. Under existing law two employees who are overpaid the same amount of PAYE income should be treated as having the same income for social policy purposes (for example working for families payments, student loan repayments and child support payments) despite one employee having repaid the money and the other not having done so. Section 5: Stakeholder views 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? Inland Revenue consulted with a number of providers of payroll software and employers and with the Corporate Taxpayers Group and Chartered Accountants of Australia and New Zealand prior to releasing an official issues paper in August 2017. An officials’ issues paper, PAYE error correction and adjustment, was released through Inland Revenue’s normal channels and in addition was sent to the members of the Payroll Practitioner’s Association, to providers of payroll software and to representatives of more than thirty employers who had indicated interest in the subject. Thirteen submitters responded some representing more than one employer. Submitters generally agreed with the problem analysis and the proposed regulatory approach with the exception of the original proposal for an employer level threshold for interpretation errors. Submitters argued that the employer level threshold could not be automated and that manual tracking would involve disproportionate compliance costs. In response to feedback the employer level threshold has been dropped. Concern was also expressed by some respondents that the 10% threshold for interpretation errors at the employee level was unduly low. This threshold has been retained at 10% because the amount could be material for someone on a low income. One respondent felt that the proposals were unduly complex. However an employer who wishes to minimise complexity will have the option to correct all errors by amending the original returns. No change has been made in response to this submission. Most respondents agreed with the proposed amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007, deeming overpaid PAYE income not repaid as subject to PAYE. The Corporate Taxpayers Group and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand however disagreed. The Corporate Taxpayers Group considered that the proposal would disadvantage employers by taxing an amount that is not employment income. Chartered Accountants Australian and New Zealand submitted that whether the net amount was recovered or not was a private matter between the employer and employee and the amount should not be taxed unless it became debt remittance income. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 13 In addition one software provider submitted that if an employer had made an adjustment when agreement to repay the overpaid amount was repaid they should not be required to make a further adjustment if the employee subsequently defaulted on the repayment. No changes we made in response to the submissions received on the proposal to amend the definition of PAYE income so that overpaid income not repaid is subject to PAYE. A number of technical questions were raised by payroll software providers and these will be considered in the process of developing the technical specifications. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 14 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? The proposals related to reporting errors, overpayment errors and interpretation errors would be given effect through regulations. Clause 235C of the Taxation (Annual Rates 2017 -18, Employment and Investment Income and Remedial Matters) Bill proposes that the Governor General may, by Order-in- Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue and following appropriate consultation, make regulations for the correction of errors in employment income information. The proposed timing provides adequate time for employers to understand the proposed changes and become familiar with the new options. In general the proposed regulations introduce additional options, with continuing to file amendments on the current basis being one option. Having options provides a means of managing implementation risk including risks that arise from a relative lack of engagement with employers with small payrolls. Inland Revenue’s systems are being upgraded to accept automatic error correction schedules from 1 April 2018. Issues relating to the effectiveness of the automated process should be resolved by the time the regulations, which permit a greater number of errors to be correcting in a subsequent return, come into effect on 1 April 2019. The proposal related to the tax status of overpaid PAYE income not repaid will be managed through a proposed amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007. It is intended that the amendment will be included in the next available taxation omnibus bill with a proposed effective date of 1 April 2019. Consultation by select committee is expected to provide a further opportunity for interested parties to express their views on this proposed change. The proposed change to the legislation reflects how many employers are understood to currently treat such income, implementation risks are not therefore considered to be material. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 15 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Information on the number of errors and adjustments to employment income information that are corrected at the employer’s request is currently available. There is no way to decompose the totals into different error types. Once the systems changes are made and the regulations are in place Inland Revenue will know how many automated error correction schedules are filed and the number of changes made. If the system is working as intended the number of changes that are made by amending earlier returns should reduce after it becomes possible for employers to file returns which include negative values (estimated as 2020). Inland Revenue will not know how many employers exercise the option of correcting overpayment and small interpretation errors in a subsequent return as this option eliminates the need to separately file error correction information. Implementation and operational issues will be identified through feedback from payroll software providers and through our call centres, account managers and specialised units such as those established to support large enterprises. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The arrangements will be reviewed as part of the post implementation review of phases three and four of Inland Revenue’s business transformation. In addition if monitoring shows unanticipated spikes in the numbers of error corrections being made to employment income information Inland Revenue will investigate the reasons and consider whether the issue: • is insufficient education; • reflects a problem with the specifications for payroll software or with Inland Revenue’s processing of error correction information; • stems from the regulations. Employers will have the opportunity to raise any concerns with our call centres and account managers and payroll software providers can do so through Inland Revenue’s Software Liaison Unit. If employees consider that they are unfairly affected by the actions of employers pursuant to the proposed regulations or legislative change they will be able to make their concerns known through our call centres or by asking the Commissioner to reassess their income. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 16 Coversheet: Taxation of non-bank securitisation vehicles Advising agencies Inland Revenue Decision sought The analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with policy changes to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet Proposing Ministers Steven Joyce (Finance) and Hon Judith Collins (Revenue) Summary: Problem and Proposed Approach Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? Securitisations can have several commercial benefits, compared with other funding mechanisms, such as risk management, balance sheet improvement, credit enhancement, lower cost of funding, and access to a wider pool of lenders. An important commercial objective of a securitisation is maintaining tax neutrality for the special purpose vehicle (SPV) used. There is a concern that the current tax rules may not allow for tax neutrality for the SPV to be achieved, and so may be discouraging securitisations. The Government wants to ensure that tax settings are not discouraging some businesses from realising the commercial benefits of securitisations. Proposed Approach How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option? There is currently a securitisation regime in the Income Tax Act 2007 which applies in respect of certain securitisations undertaken by financial institutions. The effect of the regime is that there are no tax consequences arising from the transactions between the financial institution and the SPV. Extending that regime to cover businesses that are not financial institutions would ensure that securitisations that meet the criteria of the regime are tax neutral. This would remove a tax disincentive to undertaking securitisations, which is likely to produce growth given the commercial benefits securitisations provide. Im pact Statement Template | 1 8. Section B: Summary Impacts: Benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? The main expected beneficiaries of the proposal are New Zealand businesses with large books of trade credits or other receivables (Originators) that may wish to raise funding by using those receivables as security. The proposal should reduce compliance costs by removing the requirement for the SPV to return tax itself, and by removing the need for the Originator to calculate and return tax where the transferred receivables remain economically within the Originator’s group. In terms of equity and fairness, taxing securitisations in accordance with their economic substance, would ensure that tax does not penalise (or incentivise) securitisations compared with other forms of fund raising. This would mean that the benefits of securitisations can be enjoyed more broadly. Where do the costs fall? The fiscal cost of the proposal for the Government is expected to be minor, as securitisations are typically structured to prevent tax arising where possible. There could be a fiscal cost from not recognising the transfer of assets to the SPV, although this would be the same as if the securitisation had not occurred. It is not expected that implementation of the proposal would raise any administrative issues for Inland Revenue. The proposal would reduce compliance costs for taxpayers, and would reduce tax costs to the extent that securitisations are not currently structured to prevent tax arising. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? A potential risk that was identified is that expanding the securitisation rules could open up the possibility of those rules being used to avoid tax on what is in substance a true sale to a third party. However, it is proposed that the expanded rules include a requirement that the securitised assets are treated as held by the Originator or another company in the group in its consolidated accounts under the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). It is considered that this requirement should mitigate the risk that the new rules could be used to avoid tax on what is in substance a true sale to a third party. Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. There is no incompatibility between this regulatory proposal and the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. Impact Statement Template | 2 Section C: Evidence certainty and quality assurance Agency rating of evidence certainty? We are reasonably confident in terms of the evidence on which the proposal is based, given that we have undertaken targeted consultation with interested and affected parties involved in New Zealand’s securitisation market. To be completed by quality assurers: Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Taxation of non-bank securitisation vehicles Regulatory Impact Assessment prepared by Inland Revenue and associated supporting material and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Assessment meets the Quality Assurance criteria. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: The reviewer’s comments on earlier versions of the Regulatory Impact Assessment have been incorporated into the final version. Impact Statement Template | 3 Impact Statement: Taxation of non-bank securitisation vehicles Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Assessment, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis It is understood that the current tax settings could be discouraging some businesses from realising the commercial benefits of securitisations. We cannot be sure of the scope of the problem, but have gleaned from consultation that the current tax settings are a disincentive to many taxpayer’s undertaking securitisations. We also understand that currently securitisations are typically structured to prevent tax arising where possible. However, the extent to which tax is currently paid in respect of securitisation transactions is not known, so the potential revenue cost is not able to be quantified. That said, removing a tax barrier would be expected to result in more businesses being able to enjoy the commercial benefits of securitisations, and the tax neutrality of those transactions would be no different than if the securitisation had not occurred. Responsible Manager (signature and date): Peter Frawley Policy Manager Policy & Strategy Inland Revenue July 2017 Impact Statement Template | 4 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the context within which action is proposed? A securitisation is a funding mechanism that involves issuing marketable securities that are backed by the expected cash flows from specific assets. New Zealand businesses with large books of trade credits or other receivables (Originators) may wish to raise funding by using those receivables as security. To do this, the Originator of the receivables transfers them to a special purpose vehicle (SPV), and the SPV then issues securities (typically debt instruments) to lenders. The SPV is structured to be bankruptcy remote from the Originator, so that the SPV’s assets cannot be accessed by the Originator’s creditors. In New Zealand (and internationally, in most cases) this means that the SPV is typically a trust. A securitisation can have several commercial benefits compared with a regular loan, such as risk management, balance sheet improvement, credit enhancement, lower cost of funding, and access to a wider pool of lenders. An important commercial objective of a securitisation is maintaining tax neutrality while ensuring the SPV is bankruptcy remote from the Originator. It is particularly important to ensure that the SPV itself is not exposed to a tax liability, as this can affect its credit rating. 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place? There is currently a securitisation regime in the Income Tax Act, but it applies only in respect of certain securitisations undertaken by financial institutions. Those rules were introduced as a result of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s (the RBNZ’s) response to the global financial crisis. Broadly, the RBNZ agreed to provide additional liquidity support for banks, provided the bank offered collateral securitised AAA rated residential mortgages as securities. As part of the security arrangements for this funding, the RBNZ required these mortgages be held by a bankruptcy remote special purpose vehicle (SPV). In the absence of a specific regime, there would have been potential tax consequences arising from the use of SPVs, as required to access the RBNZ’s liquidity support. The government determined that the tax rules should not impede the RBNZ measures assisting the stability of the financial system at that time. As a result, new provisions were introduced into the Act in 2009 to achieve tax neutrality. Those provisions were extended in 2010, after the RBNZ introduced a new bank liquidity policy which included measures to require banks and certain finance companies to lengthen their funding to better match their lending terms. The provisions in the Act now apply to financial institutions generally (not just registered banks) and to covered bond programme SPVs (economically very similar to the residential mortgage-backed security SPVs). The tax effect of the provisions is that the SPV is treated as transparent. The SPV’s property, activities, status, intention and purpose are attributed instead to the financial institution. The financial institution is also treated as being party to any arrangement to which the SPV is a party, and the SPV is treated as not being that party to the arrangement. Practically, this means that there are no tax consequences arising from the transactions between the financial institution and the SPV, while the SPV remains qualifying. Also, all transactions between the SPV and third parties are included in the financial institution’s tax return. The restriction of the current rules to securitisations by financial institutions is a consequence of the rules being introduced to facilitate financial institutions accessing the RBNZ’s liquidity support during Impact Statement Template | 5 the global financial crisis. Wider application of the rules was not necessary for that purpose. However, there is no particular policy reason why the rules should not apply more broadly to corporate securitisations. 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? There is a concern that the current tax rules may not allow for tax neutrality for the SPV to be achieved, and so may be discouraging securitisations. The current rules can also trigger a tax liability on transfer of the receivables into the SPV. While potentially less serious than SPV taxation, this issue can create a large administrative burden, as all the receivables need to be valued for tax purposes. The concern in relation to the tax treatment of securitisations by businesses that are not financial institutions arises as a result of the application of the general trust rules and the financial arrangements rules. Trusts can derive non-cash income, and there is an issue about whether this can be distributed as beneficiary income (in which case the beneficiary pays the tax on the income) or whether it must remain as trustee income (in which case the trustee pays the tax). In 2012, Inland Revenue published Interpretation Statement IS 12/02 “Income Tax – whether income deemed to arise under tax law, but not trust law, can give rise to beneficiary income”. The Interpretation Statement concluded that non- cash income can only be distributed to a beneficiary where there is a cash amount available for distribution. This can be an issue for SPVs, as securitisations are typically structured so the SPV has no cash income. This means that any non-cash income derived could result in a tax liability at the trust level. There is also an issue arising because of the application of the financial arrangements rules, which require a “base price adjustment” to be carried out when any financial arrangement is transferred, which can trigger a tax liability. Although potentially less serious than SPV taxation, this issue can create a large compliance burden and result in compliance costs for taxpayers (the Originator and the SPV), as all the receivables need to be valued for tax purposes. New Zealand has a small but active securitisation market, although there has been reduced activity following the global financial crisis. If the problem is not addressed, then the current tax settings may discourage some businesses from realising the commercial benefits of securitisations. 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? There are no particular constraints on the scope for decision making. Impact Statement Template | 6 2.5 What do stakeholders think? As noted above, this issue was originally raised by the private sector, with the suggestion that the current securitisation regime in the Income Tax Act be extended to other corporate securitisations to remove the tax disincentive to undertaking securitisations. Inland Revenue has undertaken targeted consultation on the proposal with interested parties. Given that the proposed amendments would only be relevant to those involved in New Zealand’s securitisation market, officials considered that targeted consultation was sufficient. We consulted, by letter and subsequent discussions, with: • Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand; • the New Zealand Law Society (the NZLS); • the Corporate Taxpayers Group; • the Financial Services Council of New Zealand; • the Financial Services Federation; • Chapman Tripp on behalf of the Trustee Corporations Association and New Zealand Guardian Trust; • EY; • Bell Gully (who received the consultation proposed through the NZLS); and • PwC. Submitters were supportive of the proposal to extend the securitisation regime beyond financial institutions to other corporate securitisations. Submitters commented that widening the scope of the regime in this way would ensure a tax neutral outcome for securitisations undertaken by corporates that are not financial institutions. The issues raised at consultation are discussed in section 3 below. Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? Option 1 (status quo) Option 1 is to retain the status quo. Under the status quo, the tax settings may discourage some businesses from realising the commercial benefits of securitisations, as these arrangements can have higher tax costs and compliance costs than other funding arrangements. Option 2 (extension of current rules) Option 2 is to extend the current securitisation regime (in sections HR 9 to HR 10) beyond financial institutions to other corporate securitisations. Option 3 (extension of current rules with requirement of recourse to the Originator) Option 3 is to extend the current securitisation regime beyond financial institutions to other corporate securitisations, but with an additional requirement of the lenders having recourse to the Originator. Arguably there is a potential risk that just extending the current rules (option two) could provide opportunities for the rules to be used to avoid tax on what is in substance a true sale to a third party. Impact Statement Template | 7 Introducing an additional requirement (for non-financial institution securitisations) of recourse to the Originator is one possible way of reducing the risk of the provisions being used to avoid the tax consequences of a true sale to a third party. However, it would seem that this risk would be mitigated by the requirement in the current provisions that the financial arrangements (the receivables) held by the SPV are treated as held by the Originator in its consolidated accounts under IFRS. Option 4 (extension of current rules with additional modifications) Option 4 is to extend the current securitisation regime beyond financial institutions to other corporate securitisations, but with a number of modifications, as suggested by submitters during consultation (discussed further in section 5, below), namely: • The regime could be extended in scope for financial institutions, beyond the types of securitisations currently covered (those involving residential mortgage-backed securities and covered bond programmes). The regime would apply more broadly for non-financial institutions, so it makes sense for financial institutions to also be able to benefit from the regime for other securitisations they may undertake. • The regime could be extended to cover securitisations involving assets/receivables other than financial arrangements. For example, it is common for trade receivables and operating leases, which are excepted financial arrangements, to be securitised. • The requirement for the securitised assets to be recognised in the Originator’s consolidated IFRS financial statements could be amended so that recognition in the consolidated IFRS financial statements of a company in the same group would suffice. • The regime should be elective, given that it removes a tax barrier. This would ensure that existing arrangements are not adversely affected if they have been structured to achieve a different result than what would arise under the regime. 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? The generic tax policy process (GTPP) includes a framework for assessing key policy elements and trade-offs of proposals. This framework is consistent with the Government’s vision for the tax and social policy system, and is captured by the following criteria: • Efficiency and neutrality – the tax system should bias economic decisions as little as possible; • Fairness and equity – similar taxpayers in similar circumstances should be treated in a similar way; • Efficiency of compliance – compliance costs for taxpayers should be minimised as far as possible; • Efficiency of administration – administrative costs for Inland Revenue should be minimised as far as possible. Efficiency and fairness are the most important criteria. It is generally worth trading-off increased compliance costs or administration costs for gains in these two criteria. 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? No other options have been ruled out of scope. Impact Statement Template | 8 Section 4: Impact Analysis Marginal impact: How does each of the options identified at section 3.1 compare with the counterfactual, under each of the criteria set out in section 3.2?

We consider that option 4 is the best option to ensure that the commercial benefits of securitisations are achieved while maintaining the integrity of the tax rules. As noted, this option would extend the current securitisation regime beyond financial institutions to other corporate securitisations, but with a number of modifications (discussed below). The suggested modifications arose out of feedback received during consultation, so officials consider that these modifications would best ensure that the objectives of the proposal are met, while ensuring the regime does not provide tax incentives for securitisations, or facilitate tax avoidance. Option 1, retaining the status quo, would mean that the tax settings would continue to discourage some businesses from realising the commercial benefits of securitisations, which can have higher tax costs and compliance costs than other funding arrangements. The Government wants to remove a tax disincentive to undertaking securitisations, given the commercial benefits they provide. The status quo is not supported. Option 2 is to extend the current securitisation regime to non-financial institutions. The extended regime would apply to a broader class of securitisable assets than those currently covered for financial institutions, as the type of securitisations currently within the scope of the regime (residential mortgage-backed securities and covered bond programmes) are not typically undertaken by non-financial institutions. However, the current consolidation requirement may be too restrictive for securitisations other than those currently covered. The current consolidation requirement is that the securitised assets are treated as held by the Originator in its consolidated financial statements under IFRS. However, as discussed further below, submitters have commented that it is often the case in corporate securitisations that the securitised assets are de- recognised by the Originator but are recognised in the consolidated financial statements of another group company. Option 2 would be somewhat limited in terms of the securitisations it would apply to, which means the tax settings would continue to discourage some securitisations. As a consequence, option 2 is not supported. Option 3 is to extend the current securitisation regime to non-financial institutions to a broader class of securitisable assets than those currently covered for financial institutions, but with the additional requirement of the lenders (the investors in the SPV) having recourse to the Originator. The possibility of an additional requirement of recourse to the Originator was suggested as an option in consultation to ensure that the provisions could not be used to avoid tax on what is in substance a true sale of financial assets to a third party. However, we consider that a requirement of recourse to the Originator is less preferable to other options for mitigating that risk. In particular, as discussed further below, the additional requirement of recourse to the Originator would be inconsistent with the commercial objective of ensuring that the SPV is bankruptcy remote from the Originator, and so would undermine the benefits of a securitisation. Submitters commented that from a practical point of view the Originator would not want to guarantee the SPV’s obligations, and would just borrow itself if it were necessary for the investors to have recourse to the Originator. This would mean that from a practical point of view option 3 might be little utilised, which is contrary to the objective of removing a tax disincentive so that the benefits of securitisations can be enjoyed more broadly. Therefore option 3 is not supported. The modifications to the proposed extended securitisations regime under the preferred option (option 4), and the reasons for them, are discussed below. Extension to assets / receivables that are not financial arrangements The current regime is limited to certain financial arrangements – New Zealand residential Impact Statement Template | 10 mortgages or loans secured by such mortgages. Submitters noted that it is common for excepted financial arrangements such as trade receivables and operating leases to be securitised, and submitted that the regime should be extended to include the securitisation of such assets. The intention of this proposed amendment is to extend the current securitisation regime so that New Zealand businesses with large books of trade credits or other receivables can securitise those assets in a tax neutral way. It was always intended that the amended securitisation regime (whether option 2, option 3 or option 4) should apply to a broader class of securitisable assets than those currently covered for financial institutions. These submissions are, therefore, consistent with the proposed amendments. Extension to all securitisations by financial institutions The current regime applies only to certain types of securitisations undertaken by financial institutions. Submitters have commented that if the regime is extended to non-financial institutions (who would typically not undertake the types of securitisations that are currently within the scope of the regime), then it should also be extended to other types of securitisations undertaken by financial institutions. Officials agree with this submission, and consider that financial institutions should be able to use the regime for the same transactions as other corporates, in addition to the residential mortgage- back securities and covered bond programme transactions currently covered. Amended consolidation requirement The current rules require that the securitised assets are treated as held by the Originator in its consolidated financial statements under IFRS. Submitters have observed that this requirement is suitable for residential mortgage-backed securities and covered bond programmes, but might be too restrictive for other securitisations. Submitters have commented that it is often the case in corporate securitisations that the securitised assets are de-recognised by the Originator but are recognised in the consolidated financial statements of another group company. It has been submitted that the consolidation requirement should be amended to accommodate such situations, and that if the group entity that recognises the securitised assets in its consolidated financial statements is separate from the Originator, the transfer of the receivables by the Originator should also be disregarded. One submitter suggested that it should be sufficient for the consolidation requirement if the SPV 1 is included in the IFRS consolidated accounts of the Originator, or a group that includes the Originator, the Originator’s parent company, or the beneficiary of the SPV. Officials agree with the submitters who suggested that the consolidation requirement could be amended so that it is sufficient if the securitised assets are recognised in the consolidated financial statements of the Originator or another group company. This would mean the benefits of the regime can apply more broadly. In addition, officials consider that such an amended consolidation requirement would be sufficient to ensure that the provisions do not apply where there is a true sale to a third party. Officials do not think it would be appropriate for it to be sufficient that the SPV or the securitised assets are included in the consolidated financial statements of the beneficiary of the SPV, if the beneficiary is not in the same group. It is considered that this could open up the possibility of the 1 As opposed to the securitised assets. Impact Statement Template | 11 provisions being used in a situation where there is in fact a true sale of the assets to a third party. Requirement of recourse to the Originator One of the proposed options, raised as a possibility as part of consultation, was for the extension of sections HR 9 to HR 10, with the additional requirement of the lenders (the investors in the SPV) having recourse to the Originator. This was suggested as a way of ensuring that the provisions could not be used to avoid tax on what is in substance a true sale of financial assets to a third party. Submitters commented that the additional requirement of recourse to the Originator would be inconsistent with the commercial objective of ensuring that the SPV is bankruptcy remote from the Originator. Submitters commented that this would undermine the benefits of a securitisation, and from a practical point of view the Originator would not want to guarantee the SPV’s obligations, and would just borrow itself if it were necessary for the investors to have recourse to the Originator. Officials agree. However, as noted in section 4, officials consider that the risk that the regime could be used to avoid tax on what is in substance a true sale of the assets to a third party could be appropriately mitigated by the requirement that the receivables held by the SPV be treated as held by the Originator or another group company in its consolidated accounts under IFRS. As such, it is not considered necessary to include an additional requirement of recourse to the Originator. Elective regime / application only to future securitisations Submitters suggested that the proposed extended regime should be elective, or otherwise apply only to future securitisations, to ensure that existing arrangements are not adversely impacted if they have been structured to achieve a different result than that arising under the extended regime. Officials agree with this submission. The regime is less burdensome than the current rules – ensuring tax neutrality for securitisations, so there is no issue with the regime being applied electively. The current regime is not framed as being elective. However, there is no particular policy reason why it should not be, given that it removes a tax barrier. Officials therefore recommend that the regime be explicitly elective for financial institutions and other corporates alike. Explicit tax neutrality One submitter commented that the legislation, or associated commentary, should make it clear that transactions within the scope of the extended regime do not give rise to tax consequences (such as a disposal for tax purposes). There was concern that the recent debt remission reforms indicate that loans made by the sole shareholder of a look-through company (LTC) to the LTC are not disregarded and that the shareholder would be required to account for the tax consequences of the loan essentially as both a deemed lender and borrower. It was suggested that this might indicate that the Originator in a securitisation would be treated as both disposing of and acquiring the securitised assets, given that section HR 9 shares similar statutory language to the transparency provisions in the LTC rules. It was also noted that there is uncertainty around the tax effects of a contribution of property to an LTC or partnership by a shareholder/partner. The submitter commented that general transparency principles would suggest that no disposal occurs, however alternative views had been put forward, and it was noted that this issue would be of particular importance in terms of the proposed expanded securitisation regime. Officials will ensure that the legislation and associated commentary make it clear that the intention is for there to be no tax consequences for transactions within the scope of the regime.

Non-monetised benefits Removes tax disincentives and reduces compliance costs. Medium Medium Impact Statement Template | 13 5.3 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? As noted in Section 1, the extent to which tax is currently paid in respect of securitisation transactions is not known, so the potential revenue cost is not able to be quantified. However, we understand that currently securitisations are typically structured to prevent tax arising where possible, so any revenue cost is expected to be minimal. Further, removing a tax barrier would be expected to result in more businesses being able to enjoy the commercial benefits of securitisations, and the tax neutrality of those transactions would be no different than if the securitisation had not occurred. In terms of the fiscal impacts of all of the options considered, as noted in Section 3, arguably there is a potential risk that expanding the regime could result in the rules being used to avoid tax on what is in substance a true sale to a third party. Introducing an additional requirement (for non- financial institution securitisations) of recourse to the Originator is one possible way of reducing the risk of the provisions being used to avoid the tax consequences of a true sale to a third party (Option 3). However, it would seem that this risk could be adequately mitigated by the requirement in the current provisions that the receivables held by the SPV are treated as held by the Originator in its consolidated accounts under IFRS (Option 2). Inland Revenue considers that the risk would be similarly mitigated by a requirement that the securitised assets are treated as held by the Originator or another company in the group in its consolidated accounts under IFRS (Option 4). 5.4 Is the preferred option compatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’? Yes. Impact Statement Template | 14 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? If approved, these proposals, which require legislative change, would be included in the next available taxation bill after the general election and would apply from the 2018/2019 income year. Given that the ability to use the regime for corporate securitisations would be optional, there is no need for any transitional arrangements. Taxpayers could simply file their returns on the basis of their decision to use the regime or not. We do not see any need for an election to use the regime to be specifically brought to Inland Revenue’s attention. When introduced to Parliament, commentary would be released explaining the amendments, and further explanation of their effect would be contained in a Tax Information Bulletin, which would be released shortly after the bill receives Royal assent. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? The proposals would have no system implications for Inland Revenue, and implementation would not incur additional administrative costs. No issues concerning implementation have been raised through consultation. Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? In general, Inland Revenue’s monitoring, evaluation and review of new legislation takes place under the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage tax policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The final stage in the GTPP is the implementation and review stage, which involves post- implementation review of the legislation, and the identification of any remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are also built into this stage. Inland Revenue’s Policy & Strategy unit monitors the first year of operation of new legislation. If there is a need to make remedial amendments to the new rules these will be prioritised for inclusion on the Tax Policy Work Programme, and the proposal would go through the GTPP.

Coversheet: Research & Development Tax Incentive Advising agencies Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) Inland Revenue (IR) The Treasury Callaghan Innovation Decision sought Implementation of a R&D Tax Incentive Proposing Ministers Hon Dr Megan Woods (Minister for Research, Science and Innovation) Hon Stuart Nash (Minister of Revenue) Summary: Problem and Proposed Approach Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? As the OECD (2017) outlined, New Zealand’s economic productivity has been below average for OECD countries for several decades, and this is a key explanation behind New Zealand’s relatively low per-capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP). It has been argued that New Zealand’s relatively low investment in knowledge-based capital may explain as much as 40 per cent of New Zealand’s productivity gap relative to the OECD average (de Serres, Yashiro & Boulhol, 2014). New Zealand expenditure on Research and Development (R&D) as a percentage of GDP is relatively low – currently 1.25 per cent, as compared to 2.40 per cent in the OECD as a whole, and the primary reason is low business investment in R&D. As a subset of this, New Zealand business expenditure on R&D (BERD) was 0.64 per cent of GDP in 2016 (Statistics New Zealand, 2017), compared to 1.64 per cent in the OECD as a whole. The Government has announced a goal of increasing total R&D as a percentage of GDP to 2 per cent, and to reach this target a significant amount of growth is expected to come from BERD. The R&D Tax Incentive is the Government’s primary mechanism for achieving this. It is common for governments to support BERD. Without government support, businesses tend to invest in less R&D than is optimal for the country as a whole as they are unable to capture the full benefits of their investment. The knowledge created through R&D spreads across the economy in various ways, including product imitation, reverse engineering, and worker mobility. While this generates wider societal gains, the business that generated it does not receive those benefits. Government support for business R&D compensates businesses for those benefits that they are unable to capture in full, and thereby provides them with more appropriate incentives. Impact Statement Template | 1 Proposed Approach How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option? The R&D Tax Incentive will lower the cost of undertaking R&D for firms. The subsidy will incentivise those firms already doing R&D to do more, while encouraging other firms to start R&D activities. New Zealand currently delivers R&D subsidies to businesses through Callaghan Innovation. The bulk of these subsidies are delivered through Growth Grants to firms that have stable, high-intensity R&D programmes. However, these grants are unavailable to the large majority of firms that are currently undertaking R&D or may undertake R&D in the future. While these remaining firms can obtain Project Grants, these are targeted at a specific type of R&D expenditure and involve significant compliance/transaction costs (ie, expenditure of time and resources) for firms. It is only one part of the policy approach to lift BERD and innovation. It is also part of a system of wider government support for New Zealand Science and Innovation covering both public and private R&D. Section B: Summary Impacts: Benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? The main expected beneficiaries of the R&D Tax Incentive are businesses that are currently undertaking R&D or will be undertaking R&D in future. The evidence suggests that around 1,500-2,000 businesses will be eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive in 2019, with this number rising as business R&D becomes more attractive. A relatively small set of firms perform the vast majority of R&D. According to the R&D survey, in 2016 approx. 85 per cent of BERD is performed by around 330 firms that spend over $1M (Statistics New Zealand, 2017). Accordingly, the financial benefits will be concentrated among the largest R&D performers. By significantly lowering the threshold for non-discretionary support of R&D, from $300,000 to $50,000, the R&D Tax Incentive will be available to a large number of firms that previously had no support. The direct benefit to business of the R&D Tax Incentive is higher returns after tax for performing R&D, as compared to other types of activity. While international evidence suggests that the returns on R&D expenditure by businesses are generally high, often 20- 30 per cent (Hall, Mairesse & Mohnen, 2009), the evidence available for New Zealand (Wakeman & Conway, 2017) suggests that the private returns for New Zealand firms may be considerably lower. Raising the returns for performing R&D through the R&D Tax Incentive is likely to increase the amount and number of firms engaging in R&D. Business R&D also creates significant spillover benefits for other firms and people within an economy through movement of people, transfer of knowledge between firms, creation of demand for complementary goods, and consumer benefits not captured within the price of the goods. International literature indicates that the benefits to the economy as a whole from R&D (ie, the social R&D rates of return) may be up to 100 per cent (Hall, Mairesse & Mohnen, 2009), so the additional benefits that are likely to flow to other participants in the economy are significant. Impact Statement Template | 2 Where do the costs fall? The primary cost of the R&D Tax Incentive will be a fiscal cost to the Government. In Budget 2018 the Government appropriated $1,020M over four years for the R&D Tax Incentive. This is in addition to the $528M already allocated for Growth Grants over the same period. Most of this is the costs of the payments to R&D-performing firms, but it is forecast that up to $6M per annum in administration costs will be required to support the incentive. Businesses will incur costs of complying with the requirements to receive a tax incentive. These have not been monetised but based on the Australian experience are expected to be around $35,000-40,000 per claimant. The current Growth Grant recipients bear the cost of the foregone grants, but most if not all will receive a tax credit of an equivalent or greater amount. They also will receive a reduction in compliance costs of complying with the Growth Grant criteria that will offset the costs associated with the Tax Incentive. Participation in the system is voluntary and the compliance costs should be outweighed by the subsidy. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? R&D Growth Grants (the current funding mechanism) for business R&D will be phased out with the introduction of the R&D Tax Incentive. There is a risk that business expenditure on R&D declines during the transition period from the R&D Growth Grants to the R&D Tax Incentive as firms adjust their R&D programmes to the new source of funding. The broader eligibility criteria of the R&D Tax Incentive compared to the Growth Grants means that overall business R&D expenditure is likely to rise over the short and long term. To reduce the risk of uncertainty and reduction in BERD we will: • Educate and develop appropriate guidelines so businesses understand how to claim the R&D Tax Incentive. • Allow a transition period of 2 years during which existing Growth Grant recipients may continue to claim a Growth Grant (instead of the Tax Incentive). • Provide clear information on transition arrangements for Growth Grant recipients to ensure a smooth transition to the Tax Incentive that supports businesses to maintain and grow their R&D over time. • Develop an appropriate implementation strategy to ensure the successful uptake of the R&D Tax Incentive. The other risk of the R&D Tax Incentive is re-characterisation of business-as-usual expenditure. This risk will be managed by: • A robust definition of eligible R&D to create a clear boundary between R&D and non- R&D. • Audit of claims, including in year approval of the R&D. Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. There is no incompatibility between this regulatory proposal and the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. Impact Statement Template | 3 Section C: Evidence certainty and quality assurance Agency rating of evidence certainty? We are confident of the evidence that R&D Tax Incentives are effective at increasing business R&D, which is based on a range of international studies. There is also strong evidence that business R&D leads to social returns that are higher than the private returns so the economy as a whole will benefit. It is more difficult to predict the actual level by which R&D will increase as a result of the Tax Incentive, which in turn drives the fiscal cost, and the spillover benefits that will result to rest of the economy. We have estimated this based on the best information available, including evidence from international studies about the size of the benefits, but there are wide confidence intervals around these estimates. To be completed by quality assurers: Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Treasury Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: A cross-agency Quality Assurance Panel with independent representatives from the Treasury, the Ministry for Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) and Inland Revenue (IR) has reviewed the Regulatory Impact Statement: R&D Tax Incentive prepared by MBIE and Inland Revenue and considers that it meets the Quality Assurance criteria. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: The RIA meets the QA criteria of being clear, concise, convincing, complete and consulted and provides a good basis for informed decision-making by Ministers Impact Statement Template | 4 Impact Statement: R&D Tax Incentive Section 1: General information Purpose MBIE and IR are solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Assessment, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing key policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Estimating the amount of R&D that will be eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive and its impact on the economy is complicated and hence the evidence on both is imprecise. The estimates of eligible R&D are based on the levels of business-funded R&D expenditure estimates from the 2016 R&D Survey (Statistics New Zealand, 2017). They are then projected forward into the future to account for expected increases in GDP and growth in R&D intensity (based on historical estimates). The estimates are also adjusted to allow for an anticipated response to the Tax Incentive. As there has been no analysis or impact evaluation of the R&D Tax Incentive implemented in New Zealand in 2008, there is no New Zealand evidence on which to base this. Instead, the estimates of the anticipated response are based on evidence from international studies that may not correspond to the situation in New Zealand. Nevertheless, this is the best information available. Given the campaign commitments of both Government parties to introduce a R&D Tax Incentive, we have not considered the option of significantly reforming the Growth Grant scheme. Responsible Manager (signature and date): Richard Walley Director, Science, Innovation and International Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment 29/ 08 / 2018 Keith Taylor Policy Manager Inland Revenue 29 / 08 / 2018 Impact Statement Template | 5 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the context within which action is proposed? As discussed above, the primary explanation for New Zealand’s low overall expenditure on R&D is low business investment in R&D in New Zealand. R&D activities are those conducted using a systematic approach for the purpose of creating new knowledge or new or improved goods, services or processes; and resolving scientific or technological uncertainty. This definition contemplates both traditional “white coat” scientific research and broader digital development concepts. New Zealand’s low business investment in R&D is in part due to industrial structure – the low R&D intensity of New Zealand firms (Mazoyer, 1999), the small size of traditionally R&D- intensive industries such as pharmaceuticals and aircraft manufacturing (Di Maio and Blakeley, 2004), and the low number of very large firms, who tend to be more research- active (OECD, 2017). There is more than industrial structure at play. Evidence suggests that the returns to innovation in New Zealand are relatively low (Wakeman & Conway, 2017), and hence New Zealand firms do not have the same incentive to invest in activities that will increase their innovative output. Moreover, OECD noted that the average rate of public support for business R&D is “well below the socially efficient level indicated by international empirical studies” (OECD, 2017). These factors indicate that there is scope for productivity gains from increasing the overall level of support for R&D expenditure. The Government has announced a goal of increasing New Zealand’s R&D expenditure to 2 per cent of GDP by 2027, and to reach this target a significant amount of the growth in R&D expenditure is expected to come from business. Across the OECD the average ratio of public to private expenditure is around 40 per cent to 60 per cent respectively. In New Zealand it is around 50:50. Lifting business investment in R&D to 60 per cent of our total R&D expenditure while achieving its 2 per cent target by 2027 will require growth in BERD of around 12 per cent per annum. After several years of being flat or declining, New Zealand BERD grew significantly in 2016-7 (Statistics New Zealand, 2017, 2018). However, it is still relatively low and it remains concentrated among a small set of firms. To achieve a further boost in BERD, as well as to transform the economy to become more knowledge intensive, requires broadening the base of R&D performing firms within New Zealand while continuing to increase the BERD of existing R&D-performing firms. The other element of context is that the New Zealand tax system operates within a broad- base, low-rate framework. The essence of this framework is that the tax system operates neutrally and as much in the background as possible. One implication is that a high burden of proof is required to move away from the general proposition that the tax system is not used to address externalities. Inland Revenue has expressed its reservations about using the tax system to incentivise R&D. However, it also notes that in this regard a majority of OECD countries have R&D tax incentive, and that its concerns may be moderated by a well-designed tax incentive. Impact Statement Template | 6 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place? New Zealand currently provides R&D subsidies through a range of grants administered by Callaghan Innovation, including: • Growth Grants: A non-discretionary grant paid to all businesses that spend more than $300,000 and 1.5 per cent of revenue on R&D over the prior two years. The grant funds 20 per cent of a business R&D programme up to a limit of $5 million per year (i.e., $25M of R&D spending), initially for a period of three years with automatic two-year extensions conditional on continuing to meet the criteria. The aim is to provide experienced R&D performers with the funding certainty and stability they need to grow their R&D spending in the long term. There were 316 recipients in 2017/18 at an (estimated) fiscal cost of $172.2M. • Project Grants: A discretionary grant, allocated to less-experienced R&D performers that do not meet the conditions for a Growth Grant for R&D. It funds 40 per cent of the first $800,000 of the eligible costs of a pre-specified project and 20 per cent of the remainder. There were 344 recipients in 2017/18 at an estimated fiscal cost of $20.3M. There has been no formal study or evaluation of the impact of Growth Grants on R&D spending, innovative activity, or economic outcomes, but there have been three studies done of the set of grants that existed prior to the formation of Callaghan Innovation on a range of outcomes (Ministry of Economic Development, 2011; Jaffe & Le, 2015; Wakeman, 2017). Wakeman (2017) did not find a significant impact of receiving a grant on R&D expenditure. Jaffe & Le (2015) and Wakeman (2017) found that grant recipients are more likely to patent and to introduce new products, but not to engage in process innovation. Wakeman (2017) found that recipients experience faster employment and labour productivity growth than non- recipients, and are more likely to survive. MED (2011) and Wakeman (2017) found that receiving a grant did not have a significant impact on multi-factor productivity. New Zealand also provides support for businesses performing R&D through the R&D loss tax credit (also known as the R&D tax-loss cash out). New Zealand-resident businesses are able to apply for 28 per cent of their losses associated with eligible R&D expenditure (up to a cap) to be paid out in cash, rather than carrying forward those losses until future years. 350 firms currently claim R&D loss tax credits. 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? As discussed above, the objective of the policy is to increase business investment in R&D, which has a central role in driving innovation and economic growth. Increasing investment in R&D is especially important in the New Zealand context because of the relative lack of complexity of the economy’s production base, which arguably hinders its potential economic performance (Hidalgo et al. 2007). R&D investment will help to diversify the New Zealand economy and create high-value jobs by building expertise in high-technology areas. At the same time, increasing the number of firms performing R&D will also mean that more firms are in a position to benefit from existing technology developed outside the firm, including at universities and Crown Research Institutes. It is especially difficult for firms to appropriate all the benefits of R&D, as compared to other types of investment, because it is difficult to prevent the benefits of new knowledge ‘spilling over’ to other firms. This occurs both by other firms imitating new products and processes (intellectual property rights are only partially effective in preventing this) and by the firm’s employees moving elsewhere and taking the knowledge with them. Moreover, due to the uncertainty of the returns associated with R&D investment, R&D-performing firms have Impact Statement Template | 7 difficulty in obtaining external finance. This means that – all else being equal – firms are likely to underinvest in R&D. There are several existing incentives for innovation (beside government subsidies), including the ability to deduct R&D expenditure from revenue for tax purposes and the commercial returns a firm receives for innovation. However, the rationale for public subsidisation of R&D is that these incentives on their own are not enough to ensure that the total level of investment in R&D reaches the socially optimal level. All OECD countries provide some form of subsidy to businesses for R&D (Appelt et al., 2016), and the OECD has also argued that the level of R&D subsidy is too low in New Zealand (OECD, 2017). R&D Grants and tax incentives are the two main mechanisms used internationally to incentivise business R&D. In general, the advantage of grants is that they can be directed toward specific projects that the Government deems are likely to offer high social returns (eg, Project Grants are targeted at a new R&D expenditure). However, they depend on the discretion of government officials – in the case of Project Grants, Callaghan Innovation – and as a result can entail significant compliance costs (eg, expenditure of time and resources on the application process) for firms. By contrast, tax incentives leave the choice of how to conduct and pursue R&D in the hands of the private sector and hence are likely to lead to R&D that is more market orientated. Growth Grants are designed to act in similar way to a tax incentive in that they are non- discretionary. However, while they provide substantial subsidies to a specific set of larger firms, they are unavailable to the large majority of R&D-performing firms. As a result around 300 firms received a Growth Grant in the 2017 year, compared with approximately 4500 firms that reported undertaking R&D in that year (Statistics New Zealand, 2018). The ubiquity of the tax system means that the R&D Tax Incentive is likely to have a broader reach. The policy opportunity is to provide government support in a way that complements the existing incentives that encourage firms to spend up to the optimal amount on R&D while creating the minimum distortion to their business activities. 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? The coalition parties both campaigned on the basis of introducing a R&D Tax Incentive to lift NZ’s R&D expenditure by encouraging businesses to research and innovate. Moreover the Coalition Agreement contains a stated objective to increase R&D spending to 2 per cent of GDP by 2027. Subsequent analysis and stakeholder consultation has confirmed an appetite for broader government support for business R&D and that New Zealand’s R&D expenditure is below the OECD average. The Minister of Research, Science and Innovation is also now consulting on a proposed Research, Science & Innovation Strategy that sets out how the Government proposes to reach its goal of lifting New Zealand’s spending on R&D to two per cent of GDP. The R&D Tax Incentive is a central component of that Strategy. We have assumed that some form of non-discretionary public subsidy for R&D would continue – i.e., either a Growth Grant or a R&D Tax Incentive. Moreover, we have assumed that the Callaghan Innovation Project Grants and the R&D tax-loss cash out would continue as complementary schemes. There is scope to revisit the design of these in future, particularly to align the R&D Tax Incentive and the R&D tax-loss cash out schemes, but it is not necessary as part of this decision. Impact Statement Template | 8 2.5 What do stakeholders think? As noted previously, the coalition parties campaigned on the basis of introducing a R&D Tax Incentive to lift NZ’s R&D expenditure by encouraging businesses to research and innovate. Subsequently, the Government has consulted widely on the proposal to introduce a R&D Tax Incentive, contained in the Research and Development Tax Incentive Discussion Document. Prior to the public release of the Discussion Document, it was circulated to a wider group of government agencies for comment. Following the release of the Government Discussion Document on 19 April, MBIE, together with IR and Callaghan Innovation conducted targeted consultation with stakeholders. This consultation confirmed an appetite for broader government support for business R&D. The submissions corroborated that increasing R&D was important in improving New Zealand’s productivity, helping create high skilled jobs, and supporting diversification of our economy. Around a third of submissions stated strong support for the R&D Tax Incentive, another third favoured Growth Grants (as against the R&D Tax Incentive proposed in the Discussion Document), and the final third expressed a range of different views – from wanting to see a mixture of the R&D Tax Incentive and Growth Grants to preferring a different mechanism altogether. The technology sector found the proposed definition limited valid R&D with its focus on traditional scientific research. We have taken this feedback on-board and worked with industry representatives to ensure the revised definition captures valid R&D performed across all sectors. Feedback suggested the minimum R&D expenditure threshold of $100,000 was too high. Many submissions also viewed the 12.5 per cent tax credit rate was too low to incentivise additional R&D, particularly given it was lower than the 20 per cent (14.4 per cent post tax) Growth Grant and the prior 2008 R&D tax credit. There was concern that refundability was not available for loss-making companies in year one impacting firms most likely to need support and many of whom had received Growth Grants. Officials initially considered it would not be practicable to design this mechanism in year one. Given the significant feedback received on this point, the scheme includes a mechanism to allow limited refundability in year one of the Tax Incentive with a view to expanding this pending further policy work in future years. Other specific proposed design features were viewed as overly restrictive or difficult to apply commercially. We have consulted on many of these points and developed alternative suggestions that are still consistent with the policy objectives. Following analysis of the submissions on the Discussion Document, there has been an ongoing programme of targeted engagement with key stakeholders, such as tax advisors, to test design features of the Tax Incentive. Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? The main options available to government are: • Continue with Growth Grants (status quo) • Replace Growth Grants with a R&D Tax Incentive. As described above, the Growth Grant provides a pre-tax payment of 20 per cent of a business’s R&D expenditure, up to a limit of $5 million per year (i.e., $25M of R&D Impact Statement Template | 9 spending). It is paid to all businesses that spend more than $300,000 and 1.5 per cent of revenue on R&D over the prior two years. The initial contract is for a period of three years, with repeating two-year extensions conditional on continuing to meet the criteria. It is administered by Callaghan Innovation, under a Ministerial Direction from the Minister of Research, Science & Innovation. The proposed R&D Tax Incentive operates by providing the taxpayer with a credit to their tax payable of 15 per cent of their eligible expenditure on R&D activities. The key design elements proposed are: • a credit rate of 15 per cent • a minimum R&D spending threshold of $50,000 per year • a maximum cap on R&D expenditure of $120 million • no R&D intensity threshold Businesses with insufficient tax liability to use their credits immediately will be able to obtain a refund of their tax credits (at the end of the year for the first two years, and in year from 1 April 2021). It also features various rules that will limit a business’s ability to re-characterise business as usual expenditure as R&D. Following consultation, the credit rate was increased (from 12.5 per cent) and the threshold was lowered (from $100,000). In addition, the ability to obtain a refund was brought forward to the first year of the Tax Incentive (albeit subject to limitations). We have treated the Growth Grant and R&D Tax Incentive options as mutually exclusive, as they both subsidise the same R&D activity through different mechanisms. While in theory both schemes could operate side by side (eg, targeted at different types of firms), operating two broad-based subsidy regimes would be inefficient. Neither option will stand alone as a solution to the problem. We have assumed that the Callaghan Innovation Project Grants and the R&D tax-loss cash out will continue as complementary schemes. It is also part of a system of wider government support for New Zealand Science and Innovation covering both public and private R&D. The Government makes an investment of around $1.5B in scientific research through the Strategic Science Investment Fund. It also invests around $400M in R&D through the Tertiary Education and Primary Industries portfolios. 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? The framework for assessing the key policy elements and trade-offs of the proposal is captured by the following criteria: • Impact on business R&D expenditure • Impact on innovative activity, employment, output, economic productivity, etc. • Compliance costs for firms • Impact on business certainty over time • Administrative feasibility • Fiscal costs/risk Impact Statement Template | 10 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? We have assumed that some form of non-discretionary public subsidy would continue, either a Growth Grant or a R&D Tax Incentive. We have therefore not considered the option of no subsidy for R&D. At the same time, given the campaign commitments of both Government parties to introduce a R&D Tax Incentive, we have not considered the option of significantly reforming the Growth Grant scheme. Impact Statement Template | 11 Section 4: Impact Analysis Marginal impact: How does each of the options identified at section 3.1 compare with the counterfactual, under each of the criteria set out in section 3.2? Growth Grants (Status quo) R&D Tax Incentive Impact on business R&D expenditure Targeted at firms with stable, high-intensity R&D activity. Out of 4500 R&D performers estimated by the Business Operations Survey 2017, only 316 firms received a Growth Grants in 2017/18 (albeit those that perform the majority of BERD). Expected to have wider coverage, particularly among smaller firms. The 2008 tax credit had over 600 participants. It is estimated that approx. 1500-2000 R&D performing firms will be eligible in 2019. The higher total amount of subsidy and the wider coverage is expected to lead to significantly higher R&D expenditure. (++) Impact on innovative activity, employment, output, economic productivity, etc. Although no direct evidence, it is expected that Growth Grants increase the likelihood of both patenting and introducing new products, and result in higher employment and labour productivity for recipients than they would otherwise. It also leads to spillovers benefits for other participants in the economy. Increased coverage of R&D-performing firms (and higher incentives for firms to engage in R&D) expected to result in some increase in innovative activity, employment, and labour productivity growth, particularly among firms that did not receive Growth Grants. A higher level of R&D expenditure will result in greater spillover benefits to other participants in the economy. (+) Compliance costs Growth Grants recipients incur costs in order of $10,000 to $30,000 to apply, and ongoing annual costs for audit of between $10,000 to $50,000 per year. 1 However, participation in the grant system is voluntary and the costs should be outweighed by the subsidy. Applications for R&D Tax Incentive expected to incur annual costs of an average of $35-40000 per year to comply with the filing requirements. 2 As for Growth Grants, participation is voluntary and the costs should be outweighed by the amount of the subsidy. (0) 1 Information submitted as part of the R&D Tax Incentive consultation process indicated Growth Grant application process costs approx. $22,000. Claimants are required to submit an audited certificate of expenditure to claim. 2 The 3-F Review in Australia estimated the compliance cost for business for the R&D tax credit were $19,000 to $35,000 for small firms and $79,000 to $157,000 for large companies, with an overall average of $37,000. Without any other evidence, the anticipated costs for New Zealand firms are assumed to be similar.

Implemented by tax legislation so harder to change (although 2008 tax credit was repealed). OECD research finds stable policy settings are important to achieve a BERD growth). (+) Administrative feasibility Administered by Callaghan Innovation. Costs were estimated to be $2.1M in 2017/18. Based on high-level estimates, Inland Revenue’s cost of administering the R&D Tax Incentive is forecast to be up to $6m per annum, although may be lower depending on the final design decisions. 3 (-) Fiscal costs/risk Fiscal costs estimated to be $172.2M in 2017/18. If it continues, costs are forecast to be $748.2M from 1 April 2019 to 30 June 2022. The appropriation for this period is $528M. Wider coverage of firms and slightly more generous subsidy rate/terms will result in higher fiscal costs. Fiscal costs are forecast to be $1215M (direct costs) plus $19.5M (administration costs) from 1 April 2019 to 30 June 2022. In Budget 2018 the Government allocated $1,020M for the R&D Tax Incentive, in addition to the amount already allocated for Growth Grants. There is also a slightly greater fiscal risk associated with the R&D Tax Incentive as, unlike a Growth Grant, it is legislated so more difficult for the Government to refuse payment in the event the costs exceed the appropriation. Experience from other countries suggests design of rules is important to minimise reclassification of expenses.

Impact Statement Template | 13 Section 5: Conclusions 5.1 What option, or combination of options, is likely best to address the problem, meet the policy objectives and deliver the highest net benefits? We consider that introducing a R&D Tax Incentive, complemented by carefully targeted direct grants (ie, Project Grants or something similar) will better support the Government’s objectives. Most if not all countries deliver a R&D subsidy through tax credits, direct grants, or a mixture of both. 4 While no two designs of a R&D Tax Incentive internationally are the same, there is consistent international evidence that R&D Tax Incentives have positive effects on business R&D spending. Most available evaluation studies find that R&D tax incentives lead to additional R&D investment. For example, out of 17 methodologically sound evaluations on the topic (What Works Centre for Local Economic Growth, 2015), ten indicate positive results, five find mixed results, and only two report no statistically significant relationship between the tax incentives and R&D investment. The review also points out that the seven studies rated as being methodologically more rigorous all find positive results. Moreover, the international evidence indicates that on average one dollar of tax credit generates around one dollar of additional R&D spending and some studies find greater impact in specific contexts (Appelt et al., 2016). The most robust study from the What Works Centre available takes advantage of a natural experiment as a result of UK policy changes, and found that across its R&D Tax Incentive scheme each £1 of government investment resulted in an additional £1.7 of investment by businesses. Results for small and medium enterprises were even higher rate at 2.5:1 (Dechezleprêtre et al., 2016). There is less evidence about the impact of grants, although it suggests that they are most effective when they are targeted towards small firms, firms that are new to R&D, and when the grants are intermediate-sized. The papers conclude that the most effective way to increase business expenditure on R&D is through a combination of tax incentives and carefully targeted grants. There is an opportunity to move towards this design, by replacing the Growth Grants with a R&D Tax Incentive, whilst retaining the targeted approach of Project Grants. We recognise that policy stability is important for improving business investment in R&D, and that (as a non- discretionary grant) Growth Grants have some important features of a tax incentive. Nevertheless we believe that the R&D Tax Incentive will be more effective than Growth Grants because of wider coverage of R&D-performing firms and greater flexibility around the types of R&D that can receive the subsidy. The restrictions on Growth Grants mean that they have had limited uptake (only 316 firms received Growth Grant in 2017/18). The experience with 2008 credit and R&D tax-loss cash-out provide evidence that tax measures have higher uptake than grants. The 2008 tax credit had over 600 participants, while there are currently 350 firms that access the R&D tax-loss cash-out mechanism despite tight eligibility and targeting criteria. We expect that 1500-2000 we expect will be eligible for the Tax Incentive. At the same time, the accounting treatment of R&D expenditure does not influence its 4 No subsequent evaluation was done of the impact or effectiveness of the R&D Tax Incentive introduced by the Labour-led Government in 2008 (and repealed by the National-led Government in 2009). There are a number of evaluations of the initiatives introduced elsewhere, and two reports that provide an overview of the international evidence: an OECD paper on the design, incidence and impact of R&D Tax Incentives (Appelt et al., 2016); and an MBIE occasional paper on the effectiveness of different levers for lifting BERD (Pells, 2014).

This allows valid, yet unsuccessful, R&D that would be excluded under the accounting standards used for Growth Grants to be recognised for the purposes of the Tax Incentive. 5.2 Summary table of costs and benefits of the preferred approach 5 Assuming 1000 new recipients at $37,500 per recipient. 6 From 1 April 2019 to 30 June 2022. 7 This is an upper estimate and the actual costs are expected to be lower. 8 Forecast fiscal costs of Growth Grants from 1 April 2019 to 30 June 2022 if it had continued.

Firms with insufficient tax liability will be able to apply for a refund of their 15% tax credit. Nevertheless, these firms still may be marginally better off with a 20% pre-tax cash subsidy because they receive a higher amount cash payment, albeit in exchange for a reduction in the losses that they can carry forward to tax purposes. 10 Assuming eligible R&D expenditure is the same. to be met from Vote: BSI and managed by MBIE in a similar way. discounting $395M after discounting at 6% Other parties No anticipated costs. $0 Total Monetised Cost FY 18/19-21/22: $509M after discounting at 6% Low Non-monetised costs n/a Expected benefits of proposed approach, compared to taking no action R&D performing firms Eligible firms will receive a tax credit equivalent to 15% of their R&D expenditure.

There is a potential risk that by providing an incentive, businesses are motivated to recharacterise non-R&D expenditure or business as usual as R&D. Steps are being undertaken in the incentive design to reduce the likelihood of, and opportunities to recharacterise non-R&D expenditure. These steps include requiring a close nexus between the R&D activity and the expenses claimed. 5.4 Is the preferred option compatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’?

High Low Total Monetised Benefit $395M after discounting at 6% Low Non-monetised benefits High Impact Statement Template | 17 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? Legislation will need to be passed to give effect to the R&D Tax Incentive policy. A stand- alone bill is proposed to make changes to the Income Tax Act 2007. The short timeframes for implementing the R&D Tax Incentive and receiving Royal Assent by June 2019 means that the bill will need to progress through the house swiftly. June 2019 is the latest date for enactment without disrupting companies’ payment of provisional tax. IR will be leading the implementation of the Tax Incentive through the tax system and will identify and mitigate operational risk so that it can be delivered successfully. IR has the necessary capabilities and capacity to implement changes to tax rules through its systems. Work requirements associated with the R&D Tax Incentive have been factored into the wider departmental planning associated with IR’s Business Transformation programme. An important element of the scheme is to have in-year approval of the R&D activity. This has the benefit of providing certainty to applicants that their R&D complies with the legislative requirements, as well as helping maintain the integrity of the Tax Incentive. The start date of this feature will be conditional on operational capacity and readiness. Because of Business Transformation constraints, it may not come into effect until the second year (2020/21). Not all implementation decisions have been completed yet, but IR expects to be able to resolve all issues by the start date. IR has begun assessing the skills and capacity that will be needed to implement the Tax Incentive. This involves identifying whether the required skills are available in-house or whether they reside in other organisations, such as MBIE and Callaghan Innovation, and if so how they will be accessed. Communication of the proposed changes started with the release of a Discussion Document in April. There is currently a programme of engagement with key stakeholders, such as the tax advisory community. These organisations each have networks of R&D performing firms. Officials from all agencies (MBIE, Callaghan Innovation and IR) are taking opportunities to inform and discuss changes with representative groups, eg., the Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ). Callaghan Innovation will use its network of grant recipients to inform them of the changes. IR, again working with the other agencies, has commenced developing guidance material to explain the legislation. Developing this material will require discussion with firms engaged in R&D so will provide opportunities to communicate the changes to potential Tax Incentive recipients. A constraint in the communications is that formal guidance about the legislation cannot be released until the legislation has been passed. However, consideration will be given to how to provide useful information while respecting legislative conventions. Because the R&D Tax Incentive is a new policy, there are no particular transition issues. However, it is noted that a goal in introducing the Tax Incentive is to not disrupt the R&D programmes of existing R&D performers. A significant part of the wider policy is that there will be, subject to Cabinet approval, a two-year transition period for Growth Grant recipients before this Grant is phased out. During this period, transitioning from the Growth Impact Statement Template | 18 Grant to the Tax Incentive is at the R&D performer’s discretion. This enables them to plan in a measured way so will avoid disruption. The Tax Incentive will come into effect for the tax year ending 31 March 2020. Early- balance-date firms will be able to claim the incentive for the full 12 months of their equivalent 2019/20 income-tax year. Taxpayers’ income-tax year will have started by the time the legislation receives Royal Assent. This may cause some difficulties for taxpayers since data collection obligations will apply for the whole period for which they are performing R&D. However, claims will only be submitted with taxpayers’ income tax returns. It is anticipated that the legislation will be enacted by then. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? In terms of the claim process most submissions through the consultation process requested that compliance burdens be kept light and that the process to claim be streamlined, clear and low cost. Feedback also highlighted the need for clear guidance and education material to support firms in making claims. Most submitters were also keen on being able to submit claims via third party software providers provided they would minimise compliance cost and increase the overall efficiency of the scheme. Overall, the time for policy implementation is tight. IR has made the following administrative decisions to increase certainty and predictability of support for firms. In terms of year one of the R&D Tax Incentive, firms will be required to register their interest in applying for the incentive and to file their claims online through IR’s e-service (myIR) at the end of the tax year. As part of the online claim process firms will be required to submit and upload supporting information that details the R&D activity and expenditure. By year three the intention is to allow R&D returns only from approved accounting software packages. The goal is to have strong uptake of the incentive by R&D performing firms. Unfamiliarity with the Tax Incentive and uncertainty about how to apply for it is an acknowledged risk, which might frustrate this goal. In the short term there will be some confusion because there will be multiple Government instruments for supporting business R&D. Growth Grants were referred to above. In addition, there is the R&D tax-loss cash out scheme that already operates within the tax system. It will operate with a separate definition of eligible R&D and firms will have to apply for this separately from applying for the Tax Incentive. For the first year, the education and guidance material described in 6.1 is the main means of addressing this. A review of the tax-loss cash-out scheme is scheduled for late 2018/early 2019, the goal being to harmonise this scheme with the R&D Tax Incentive, from Year 2 of the Tax Incentive (2020/21). Resource and time constraints have meant this could not be achieved any earlier. Another potential impediment to firms participating in the Tax Incentive is the experience from 2008 when a similar scheme was introduced but then closed after one year. The design of the Tax Incentive has been motivated by three objectives: promotion of R&D, management of fiscal risks, and maintaining integrity of the tax system. Keeping a focus on all three of these objectives gives the best chance of creating an enduring scheme. Implementation risks arise where firms recharacterise non-R&D expenditure as R&D in order to claim a larger incentive. The policy and legislation has been developed to manage this risk (though it cannot be eliminated). Mechanisms include: the definition of eligible R&D activity, the lists of eligible and non-eligible expenditure, and the various integrity measures described in section 7.1. This will be backed up by administrative processes, Impact Statement Template | 19 such as in-year approval of the R&D (likely to be from 2020/21) and audit. Successful uptake of the R&D Tax Incentive To ensure the successful implementation of the R&D Tax Incentive there needs to be strong uptake of it by R&D performing businesses. The submission process has shown that there is a lack of awareness of the benefits of the scheme and some of the design features within it. Specifically, there was confusion about the credit in comparison with the Growth Grants, concern about the lack of support for start-ups and businesses in tax loss, and concern that software businesses may be excluded from the scheme. To address these issues, officials from MBIE, IR and Callaghan Innovation are developing an implementation strategy to ensure there is widespread awareness and understanding of the R&D Tax Incentive before its implementation date in April 2019. Part of this process will be the development of guidelines which will sit alongside the tax legislation to inform businesses of the detailed parameters of scheme. Impact Statement Template | 20 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? System-level monitoring System-level monitoring will take place as part of the Research, Science and Innovation portfolio (e.g. through publication of the annual System Performance Report). Evaluation and data collection Officials have recommended including a legislative requirement that the government commission an evaluation on the R&D Tax Incentive every five years from the commencement of the scheme. Statistics New Zealand runs a business R&D survey every two years, and MBIE is currently working with Statistics New Zealand to increase the frequency of this survey to annual from 2019. This will provide the official information required to assess the impact of the R&D Tax Incentive. It has also been recommended that IR have the ability to make taxpayer-specific information in relation to R&D Tax Incentive claims available to MBIE, Treasury and Callaghan Innovation officials to support evaluation and policy development. In addition, it is proposed that anonymised claim information be integrated into Statistics New Zealand Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) and the National Research Information System (NRIS). This will allow researchers and evaluators to use data from the R&D Tax Incentive to monitor the impact more frequently than using the R&D Survey results (albeit R&D Survey provides the official statistics). Integrity measures Various measures are proposed to enhance the integrity of the scheme. Collection and dissemination of data, as described above, forms part of these. In addition, the names and the amounts of tax incentive received will be published, because it is considered that there could be public interest in who the recipients are and how much they are receiving. This data will be published with a two-year lag so as to not reveal the extent of firms’ current R&D activity, which might be commercially sensitive. Some firms considered publication of the amount of the tax incentive would breach their rights to taxpayer secrecy. Officials do not agree, but as a compromise the amount of the incentive will be presented in bands rather than the exact amount. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? In addition to the scheme being evaluated every five years, there will on-going monitoring of the policy by MBIE and IR in the shorter term. This is to speedily identify and remedy issues that could compromise the integrity of the incentive. It is proposed that the R&D Tax Incentive policy can be adjusted when serious issues occur as a result of monitoring. For example, officials consider a variety of second and third order regulatory mechanisms could be used to this effect. The proposed legislation will allow for schedules containing specific R&D activity and expenditure exclusions to be amended via Order in Council. The ability to make changes to the schedules outside of primary legislation is necessary so that the Government can quickly close off problem areas identified that could impact on the fiscal sustainability of the R&D Tax Incentive. Officials consider the goal of an enduring scheme will be supported by developing a community of stakeholders who share that goal. It is proposed to establish a consultative Impact Statement Template | 21 committee comprising officials and private sector representatives which will function as a forum for identifying and resolving problems.

Coversheet: Extension of the bright-line test for the taxation of residential property Advising agencies Inland Revenue, The Treasury Decision sought Approval to extend the current bright-line test from two years to five years. Proposing Ministers Minister of Finance, Minister of Revenue Summary: Problem and Proposed Approach Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? The Government’s objective for extending the bright-line test is to ensure that residential property speculators pay tax on the gains from their activity and also to improve housing affordability for owner-occupiers by reducing speculative demand. Proposed Approach How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option? The Government has publicly indicated it will extend the current bright-line test from two years to five years and that the current exemptions (including the main home exemption) from the bright line test will continue. This extension is intended to target speculators in the residential property market. Section B: Summary Impacts: Benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? Taxpayers and Inland Revenue will benefit from an additional period of clarity, as the bright-line rule will apply for longer. It is difficult to quantify these benefits. We expect that the longer the period that the bright-line test applies, the easier it will be for Inland Revenue to collect revenue from property speculators. The longer bright-line test also means that it is easier for taxpayers to know whether a particular residential property sale is taxable. The change will increase the number of property sales that are subject to tax. Some of these sales will be by speculators and some will be by investors. For the purposes of this analysis, speculators are those who buy houses with the aim of resale for profit and investors are those who did not acquire a residential property with an intention of resale. The extended bright-line test is expected to raise additional revenue for the government. However, it will not raise any additional revenue in the short run, due to the existing two year bright-line test. In the third year after coming into force, revenue is expected to Impact Statement: Extension of the bright-line test for the taxation of residential property | 1 increase each year until it reaches about $50 million per year. To the extent that the longer bright-line discourages speculators and investors from buying residential property, prospective first-home buyers could benefit from this proposal. At the margin, discouraging residential property speculators may also reduce competition in the housing market, reducing upward pressure on property prices and improving housing affordability for first-home buyers. Existing owner-occupiers who are seeking to move up the property ladder may also be positively impacted by this policy, to a lesser degree. While less competition in the market may reduce the price they would otherwise receive for their existing property, it may also reduce the price of the next property they buy. Where do the costs fall? The costs of the additional tax raised by the extended bright-line test fall on residential property speculators and investors who, by virtue of the timing of their property sales, are taxed on any gains made on the property sale. In the case of investors, the longer bright-line test is more likely to capture sales where the property was not acquired with an intention of resale. Both speculators and investors who delay the sale of the property, beyond what would have otherwise been the optimal time to sell (in order to avoid the tax), also bear an indirect cost. This delay is sometimes referred to as lock-in and it imposes economy wide costs because it reduces the efficient allocation of resources within the economy. While the precise nature and magnitude of the policy across the impacted parties are not known, due to the lack of empirical evidence and uncertainty of the behavioural response and future market conditions, this policy may impose costs (either indirectly or directly) on residential property: speculators; investors; tenants; and parties in related markets who experience demand fluctuations for their goods or services that correlate with housing market activity, such as conveyancers. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? There are two key risks with extending the bright-line test from two years to five years. The first is over-reach and the second is lock-in. There are also potential impacts on tenants. Over-reach The longer bright-line test means that there is more risk of capturing sales of residential property that was not acquired with an intention of resale. The original policy intent for the two-year bright-line test was to capture short-term speculative activity in the residential property market. The two-year period was set on the basis that buying and selling within a short window of time is likely to be indicative that the property was bought with the intent to make a profit on resale. When extended to five years, however, there is a risk that this association becomes less clear. This risk could be managed by providing more exemptions to the bright-line test. The Impact Statement: Extension of the bright-line test for the taxation of residential property | 2 current two year test has the following exemptions, the sale of the main home, relationship property settlements, and distributions by estates. With the longer bright-line test there are stronger grounds to provide exemptions to cover other situations that arise – for example illness or restructuring. However, the trade-off is that the bright-line test becomes less clear when exemptions are added. We also note that adding more exemptions would increase the complexity of the rules, making the bright-line test more difficult for taxpayers to comply with and for Inland Revenue to enforce. The bright-line test is intended to be an objective rule that is easy to apply. Lock-in The other risk with the extended bright-line test is the heightened risk of ‘lock-in’, which impacts on the efficient allocation of residential property. The costs that flow from lock-in are difficult to quantify. However, these costs are non-trivial because they get in the way of the efficient allocation of resources within an economy. Lock-in also discourages individuals and entities from reorganising how they hold assets. While lock-in does not alter the actual number of dwellings in the overall housing stock, it may reduce the number of dwellings for sale. If the fall in the number of dwellings for sale exceeds the reduced demand from speculators and investors then this could lead to increased competition for the housing stock available for purchase for a period of time. Because of the competing impact of these variables, the impact of lock-in on the housing market is ambiguous. Tenants Any reduction in the supply of residential rental properties, due to the reduction in speculators and investors buying and renting out property, is likely to put upward pressure on rents. A higher level of homeownership among former renters is unlikely to completely offset the pressure on rental prices. This is because owner-occupied homes typically have a lower occupancy rate than rental homes, so the reduction in the supply of rental housing (caused by some investors exiting the market) will probably outweigh the reduction in demand for rentals (as some renters purchase homes). Overall implications The Treasury notes that the risks relating to over-reach and lock-in are unable to be quantified and therefore it is difficult to assess their significance in relation to the Government’s objectives for extending the bright-line test. The IRD considers that two years is the better bright-line period, mainly because this reduces over-reach. Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. Impact Statement: Extension of the bright-line test for the taxation of residential property | 3 Section C: Evidence certainty and quality assurance Agency rating of evidence certainty? To be completed by quality assurers: Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: The Treasury Quality Assurance Assessment: No formal assessment being given since this is a 100 Day Plan priority. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: The Treasury’s comments are based on revised expectations for Regulatory Impact Assessments covering 100 Day Plan priorities. The Regulatory Impact Assessment describes how the proposed action will meet the intended objectives and also explains the uncertainties and risks around its likely impact on the broader housing market. The impact on different parties including speculators, investors, tenants and parties in related markets who experience demand fluctuations for their goods or services that correlate with housing market activity, such as conveyancers, are well explained. The analysis of the overall impact on housing markets is more limited, due to limited empirical evidence and the uncertainty around the behavioural response and future markets conditions, recognising that there may be possible unintended consequences. In addition, as noted in Section 1 of the Regulatory Impact Statement - “Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis” - only the proposed option has been assessed. Consequently, it is not possible to be confident that the Government’s objectives are being met in the best way and with the least unintended consequences. It would therefore be desirable to monitor and evaluate the outcomes in practice. It is noted that IRD will continue to evaluate its programmes in terms of taxpayer compliance with the current law, including the bright- line test and that officials will monitor the general housing market indicators collected by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE). We would recommend that further thought be given to possible ways of observing the specific impact of this policy on market outcomes, as this could be of value in future policy decision making. Impact Statement: Extension of the bright-line test for the taxation of residential property | 4 Impact Statement: Extension of the bright- line test for the taxation of residential property Section 1: General information Purpose The original bright-line test, when it was first introduced in 2015, provides an unambiguous rule for taxing gains made when residential property is sold. This rule supplements the current land sale rules. The bright-line test was targeted towards the problems of enforcement in relation to the significant churn and short term speculation in residential property that had been occurring in the period leading up to Budget 2015. Many taxpayers did not appear to be self-assessing their sales as taxable, while the subjective nature of the ‘intention test’ made it difficult to enforce. The bright-line test was intended to overcome the enforcement challenges arising from the subjective ‘intentions’ measure by establishing an unambiguous position based on the timing of the sale of the property. The main objective for extending the bright-line test (from two years to five years) is to capture more speculators trading residential property and to ensure that those who make gains from speculative property investment pay their fair share of tax. Another objective for extending the bright-line test is that – by reducing speculative demand – this improves housing affordability for owner-occupiers. In 2015, Inland Revenue and the Treasury supported the two year bright-line test to improve the integrity of the land sale rules. In 2010, the Treasury provided advice on a bright-line test for residential property, with a minimum of a five year period, as a base-broadening option for Budget 2010. Impact Statement: Extension of the bright-line test for the taxation of residential property | 5 Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis The key limitations and constraints applying to this analysis are as follows: 1. Single option analysis: As the Government has already announced its intention to extend the bright-line test, this analysis is focussed solely on the implementation of that option. 2. Time constraints: Ministers have directed officials to prepare this policy within the timeframes of the 100 Days Plan. Accordingly, this analysis has been prepared within tight time constraints. 3. Lack of empirical data: The analysis on the impact of this policy on the housing market and on related markets is constrained by a lack of empirical data. Where empirical evidence is not available, a theoretical assessment of the expected impact has been provided. While some empirical data is available from the introduction of the bright-line test in 2015, it is difficult to isolate the impact of that policy change from other influences on the housing market at that time. 4. Projected revenue figures: The extended bright-line test does not raise any additional revenue in the first two years (as these sales are captured by the existing two-year bright- line provisions), but is estimated to raise in the vic inity of $50 million per annum once fully established. The caveats pertaining to the revenue forecast are as follows: • The revenue forecasts assume that the five-year bright-line test is introduced in February 2018. This means that revenue from the five-year bright-line only begins for properties sold after February 2020. Returns from these sales are processed from March 2021, but Residential Land Withholding Tax is immediately taxable, so 2020/21 is the ‘phase in’ year. • There is significant uncertainty in the revenue estimates, as they are sensitive to property price appreciation assumptions. The revenue estimates are based on an assumption of aggregate property price appreciation of approximately 3% per annum in nominal terms (consistent with the assumption in the forecasts for the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Update). • The revenue estimates are also contingent on the behavioural response to the policy. These estimates assume a reduction in property sales as the bright-line period approaches (i.e. those who defer the sale to avoid paying tax on it). However, there is a risk that this adjustment could either underestimate or overestimate the actual deferral of sales. • The extension of the bright-line test in the long run may decrease administrative costs, if the extended bright-line leads to improved voluntary compliance. As existing systems are in place for the two-year bright-line test, the additional short-run costs from the extension are not anticipated to be significant. However, officials have not been able to quantify the administrative costs in the time available. Impact Statement: Extension of the bright-line test for the taxation of residential property | 6 Mark Vink Tax Strategy Economic System The Treasury \[23 November 2017\] Impact Statement: Extension of the bright-line test for the taxation of residential property | 7 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the context within which action is proposed? This proposal forms part of a suite of housing policies announced prior to the 2017 election, including a ban on foreign buyers, extending the bright-line to five years and ring-fencing rental losses. The extension of the bright-line test from two years to five years is to ensure that residential property speculators pay tax on the gains from their activity. As the tax is expected to, at the margin, reduce speculative demand for housing, this would – all else equal – reduce house price pressure, which supports the other objective of improving housing affordability for owner-occupiers. 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place? The two-year bright-line test for the taxation of residential investment property is already in place. Since 1 October 2015, any residential property bought and sold within two years of this date is taxable under the bright-line test (with some exceptions, including the main home exemption which can be used up to twice in a two year period). In addition to the bright-line test, there are also other tax rules which determine whether the gains from the sale of property are taxable, typically determined by the purchaser’s intention to profit at the time of sale or if they are engaged in regular property trading and/or development patterns. Inland Revenue has begun reviewing tax returns and Land Transfer Tax Statement data for the period 1 October 2015 to 31 March 2016. This analysis suggests that about 4,700 property transfers during the period appear to involve residential property bought and sold within the two year bright-line period. Preliminary analysis of these transfers suggests that about: • 2,700 (or 57%) appear to be exempt; • 300 (or 6%) appear taxable under the two year bright-line test; • 1,000 (or 21%) are taxable under other provisions; and • 700 (or 15%) have yet to be checked. The extension of the bright-line test will build on the existing regulatory systems already in place for the original two-year bright-line test. 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? While the gains on any residential investment property purchased with the intention to sell are taxable, the subjective nature of determining investors’ intention makes this difficult to enforce. The two-year bright-line test, introduced in 2015, captures the short-term (i.e. less than 2 years) speculation, but there is a risk that there is still speculative activity beyond this period that remains untaxed. Extending the bright-line test to five years reduces this risk and ensures that more residential property speculators pay their fair share of tax. Impact Statement: Extension of the bright-line test for the taxation of residential property | 8 Housing has become less affordable throughout New Zealand, particularly in urban areas. The fundamental causes of unaffordable housing are constraints on the supply of housing, relative to demand. While it is recognised that improving the responsiveness of housing supply is required to address the affordability challenge, supply-side reforms will take time to have effect. To the extent that housing affordability concerns are due to excess demand and some of this demand is from speculators, then reducing demand by speculators and investors, by ensuring they are taxed on any gains from residential property sales, may result in less upward pressure on house prices. This demand-side measure could help to reduce house price pressure until supply-side reforms take effect. 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? As the Government has already publically indicated that it wishes to quickly move to legislate for an extended bright-line test. Officials have provided advice on the implementation of this policy in fulfilment of Ministerial direction. Thus, this analysis has been prepared on the basis that the decision to proceed on the extension of the bright-line test has already been made. 2.5 What do stakeholders think? Due to time constraints, there has been no opportunity for formal consultation on the proposal to extend the bright-line test. Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? As the Government has already announced its intention to extend the bright-line test from two years to five years, and Ministers have directed officials to prepare this policy within the timeframes of the 100 Days Plan, this analysis is focussed solely on the implementation of that proposal. 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? The key criterion to measure the effectiveness of the policy against the Government’s stated objective (that is, to ensure that residential property speculators pay tax on the gains from their activity) is to monitor tax compliance (which is already a function of Inland Revenue). The other objective – that is, to improve housing affordability for owner-occupiers – is somewhat more complex and other criteria would need to be considered in-order to assess the impact of the policy on the housing market (and related markets). To avoid false attribution, however, any changes observed in the relative share of different market segments would need to be isolated from other relevant variables, particularly other interventions targeted at reducing investor demand, which may be difficult to achieve in practice. Different criteria would be required to indicate the adverse or unintended consequences of Impact Statement: Extension of the bright-line test for the taxation of residential property | 9 the extended bright-line test. For example, a reduction in the stock of rental property (controlling for other variables) may indicate that investors are leaving the market/reducing competition for owner-occupiers (although increasing competition for the remaining rental stock). A trend towards longer holding periods for residential investment property (again, controlling for other variables) may be indicative of the ‘lock-in’ effect, particularly if there was an observable sales peak just after the 5 year mark (from investors) which may be indicative of avoidance behaviour. 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? The option of a capital gains tax (CGT) is outside the scope of this analysis. A comprehensive CGT may be considered by the Tax Working Group, and if implemented it could do away with the need for the extended bright-line test (i.e. all sales captured by the bright-line test would be captured by the CGT).

Officials have not considered alternative options in the development of this policy. As the Government has already announced its intention to extend the bright-line test, this analysis is focussed solely on the implementation of that option. 5.2 Summary table of costs and benefits of the preferred approach Affected parties (identify) Comment: nature of cost or benefit (eg ongoing, one- off), evidence and assumption (eg compliance rates), risks Impact $m present value, for monetised impacts; high, medium or low for non-monetised impacts Evidence certainty (High, medium or low) Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Prospective speculators and investors The impact on housing prices is ambiguous. Regardless of the absolute price level, the after-tax cost of property speculation will be more expensive to a speculator (who is not able to hold the property for over 5 years) compared to owner-occupier purchasers who will not be taxed on their gains. For the marginal speculator, the extended bright- line test would be the ‘tipping point,’ so they would forgo the purchase, as other alternative investments become relatively more attractive. The extended bright-line test reduces the after-tax return on speculative investment (if the property is sold within 5 years), but if the reduced return is still expected to be the highest yielding investment (adjusted for risk) then it is rational for them to purchase the property. All investors face some risk of being taxed under the bright- line, including those who did not acquire the residential property with an intention of resale. This could discourage The impact on prospective speculators and investors is strongly dependant on the behavioural responses and on the availability of higher yielding alternative investment options. As these factors are not known, the impact on speculators and investors is not able to be quantified. Low Impact Statement: Extension of the bright-line test for the taxation of residential property | 12 investors concerned that they may face unexpected circumstances that would lead them to have to sell before five years has passed. Residential property speculators and investors who sell between 2-5 years Property speculators and investors who, by virtue of the timing and nature of their property sales, are taxed under the extended bright-line test bear the direct monetary cost of the tax for each property they sell. The longer bright-line period , the greater the potential number of sales of residential property that will be subject to tax. However, some of the investors caught by the extended bright-line may not have acquired the property with an intention of resale. The precise impact is contingent on taxpayer behaviour and housing market conditions, but the extended bright-line test is expected to raise $50 million per year in the fifth year after coming into force. There is no additional revenue in the first two years following the change coming into force, as these sales are already covered by the existing bright line. Medium Residential property investors and speculators who delay the sale of their property to not get taxed The extended bright-line test also increases the incentive for investors and speculators to hold on to their properties for a period exceeding five years. Speculators and investors seeking to not being taxed under the bright-line test may delay the sale of the property beyon d what may have otherwise been optimal. While these investors would not incur the costs of the tax, the timing distortion may reduce their overall gain. The size of this impact is uncertain, as it is contingent on the behavioural response of the investors and on broader market conditions. Low Existing property owners To the extent that the extension of the bright-line test succeeds in reducing demand from speculators and investors, this reduction in aggregate demand for Due to the lack of empirical data, this impact cannot be quantified, but it is expected to be marginal. Low Impact Statement: Extension of the bright-line test for the taxation of residential property | 13 residential property at the margin may marginally reduce price pressures, all else equal. Existing property owners could be negatively impacted if the policy results in house prices being lower than they would have been otherwise. Rental property tenants The extension of the bright line test may reduce the supply of rental accommodation if the tax discourages speculators and investors from investing in the rental market. Any reduction in the supply of rental accommodation is likely to increase rents (but will be offset to some degree as some renters take advantage of lower house prices to become owner-occupiers). Due to the lack of empirical data, this impact cannot be quantified. The precise impact would depend on the behavioural response from renters. The overall change in demand (which influences the rental price), will depend on the extent to which people alter behaviour in response to the price change. This could be in the form of a transition to home- ownership (for the higher-income renters), a move down the housing spectrum (e.g. a younger person may move back in with their parents), or an increase in household occupancy rates to spread the rental costs over more people. Low Expected benefits of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Government Increased revenue collected from the sale of residential investment property, as the extension of the bright-line test makes more sales as taxable. The precise impact is contingent on taxpayer behaviour and housing market conditions. However, this change is forecast to earn about $50 million per year in the fifth year after coming into force. There is no additional impact in the first two years, as these sales are already covered by the existing bright line. Assuming the five-year bright-line test is Medium Impact Statement: Extension of the bright-line test for the taxation of residential property | 14 introduced in February 2018 no additional revenue from the five-year bright-line test arises until properties sold after February 2020. Returns from these sales are processed from March 2021, but Residential Land Withholding Tax is immediate, so 2020/21 is the ‘phase in’ year. The extended bright-line test is expected to raise $10 million revenue in 2020/21, $30 million in 2021/22 and $50 million each year thereafter. Prospective first-home buyers At the margin, reduced competition from speculators and investors in the market may reduce prices and make it somewhat easier for prospective first-home buyers to purchase a property. Prospective first home-buyers are, until the property is purchased, a subset of the rental market. As a group, prospective first home-buyers are likely to (on average) typically be older and have higher incomes than the ‘median’ renter, reflecting that i t can take some time to accumulate savings for a deposit and the need to achieve a certain level of household income to service a mortgage. Due to the lack of empirical data, this impact cannot be precisely quantified. It would depend on both market conditions and the behavioural response of market participants. Low Impact Statement: Extension of the bright-line test for the taxation of residential property | 15 5.3 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? Other impacts that may result from the extension of the bright-line test include: 1. The ‘lock-in’ effect – i.e. speculators and investors retain properties longer than they otherwise would have as a result of the desire to avoid the tax. While the efficiency impacts of this are partially borne by the speculators/investors (as noted above), there are wider externalities on the housing market. The impact of lock-in on the housing market is unclear. For example, it could potentially improve tenure stability for renters but reduce the flow of housing onto the market for owner-occupiers to buy. From this efficiency perspective, a two-year bright-line test or a comprehensive CGT is likely to be preferable to a five-year bright-line test as the latter increases the risk of distorting timing decisions. 2. If the broader remit of what constitutes taxable speculative investment reduces demand from these types of investors, this may (all else equal) improve affordability for owner-occupiers (as they face less competition in the market from investors). The non-monetary impacts of increased homeownership can be positive, such as greater stability of tenure (and the associated secondary benefits), or negative, such as decreased labour market mobility. 3. Impact on related markets – The consequential impacts on related markets from this policy are not clear. To the extent that this policy discourages investors and reduces investor demand, the capital that would have otherwise been invested in residential property is displaced to other markets. This ‘displaced’ capital may manifest in one or more of the following outcomes: • Marginally increased demand for alternative investment types (as residential investment becomes relatively less attractive) • Purchasing a relatively more expensive main home than would otherwise be the case, as people invest more capital into the (untaxed) family home instead of investment property. • Other (non-housing) forms of increased consumption spending (as the net returns from investment decrease, consumption becomes relatively more attractive). • Reduced demand for complementary goods and services, such as real estate and conveyancing services. 5.4 Is the preferred option compatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’? Impact Statement: Extension of the bright-line test for the taxation of residential property | 16 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? The extension of the bright-line test from two years to five years is expected to be relatively straightforward to implement. Inland Revenue’s process for the current (two-year) bright-line period includes both manual and automated practices. An extension of the bright-line to five years may require more manual work until system solutions can be designed and implemented. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? Although the extension of the bright-line test is expected to be relatively straight-forward to implement, it is not without implementation risks to be managed. The key implementation risks are as follows: • Non-compliance risks: High level analysis of taxpayer compliance with the existing bright-line legislation suggests that voluntary compliance with the existing rules appears to be less than 50%. Non-compliance will still be an issue if the bright-line test is extended over a longer period. To manage the risk of non-compliance (and reduce the associated consequences on revenue and taxpayer fairness), Inland Revenue has visibility of property sales and is following up on cases of apparent non-compliance. Inland Revenue is also considering changes to existing processes that could drive up voluntary compliance. • Capital gains tax: The Tax Working Group may consider a CGT which, if implemented, could supersede the bright-line test. Impact Statement: Extension of the bright-line test for the taxation of residential property | 17 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? In September 2017, Inland Revenue completed a property compliance activities evaluation baseline report. This work considered all of Inland Revenue’s property compliance activities since legislative changes to property tax were introduced in 2015. The bright-line rules were brought in due to concerns that Inland Revenue had difficulty in enforcing the current land sales rules, in particular the intention test. Inland Revenue will continue to evaluate its programmes in terms of taxpayer compliance with the current law, including the bright-line test. Because of the attribution challenges (i.e. the practical difficulties of isolating the effect of the extended bright-line test from the multiple endogenous and exogenous variables influencing the housing market), there are no specific monitoring and evaluation measures for this policy alone, but officials will monitor the general housing market indicators collected by MBIE. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The extension to the bright-line period will be incorporated into the relevant Inland Revenue annual evaluation work as appropriate.

Coversheet: Proposed changes to bloodstock tax rules Advising agencies Inland Revenue and the Treasury Decision sought Final design approvals for Budget 2018 bloodstock initiative Proposing Ministers Hon Stuart Nash (Minister of Revenue) Summary: Problem and Proposed Approach Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? The Government wants to encourage investment in the New Zealand racing industry and ensure New Zealand horses can compete with the best in the world. The concern is that the current tax rules for bloodstock breeding do not encourage new investors into this part of the industry. Proposed Approach How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option? New rules will be introduced that allow new bloodstock investors to claim tax deductions, as though they had a bloodstock breeding business, if they purchase a standout yearling 1 with an intention to breed from the horse in the future. The aim is to incentivise new investors into bloodstock breeding while targeting the best yearling prospects. Section B: Summary Impacts: Benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? New investors establishing a breeding business will be able to access deductions earlier and in wider circumstances than they would otherwise. Existing breeders are likely to benefit from an increase in prices for yearlings at the margin. Qualified bloodstock managers may also benefit from additional demand for services in business planning. Finally, the entire racing industry may benefit in the long run from improvements in the 1 A horse with stud founding qualities, defined under the proposed policy as a horse whose purchase price equals or exceeds a bright-line price floor published by the Commissioner each year. This threshold will be the average minimum value of the top 5% of sales at premier yearling sales for the previous three years, and the top 3% for standardbreds, with colts and fillies treated separately. In this sense it will be a rolling average and require adjustment annually. Impact Statement Template | 1 quality of New Zealand’s bloodstock. Where do the costs fall? The monetary costs fall on the Government, which will fund the changes through tax expenditure. Some of the costs may fall on new and existing investors if they need to pay more for quality yearlings, particularly at the threshold. This may include overseas buyers of New Zealand bloodstock. The policy is expected to increase compliance costs for those taking advantage of the policy, as new investors will need to demonstrate an intention to breed by fulfilling a number of requirements, and Inland Revenue will also incur additional administration costs in evaluating these applications. Finally, there is a risk that encouraging investment in one area over others via the tax system may result in reduced tax revenue that needs to be made up elsewhere, and result in resources being captured by interest groups, which can undermine the Government’s overall objectives for the tax system. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how Impact Statement Template | 2 will they be minimised or mitigated? There is a risk that this policy may not improve the quality of New Zealand’s racing stock. Limiting the policy to standout yearlings may result in new investors but little improvement in the quality of breeding. The probability that a yearling will be used in a commercial breeding business is reasonably low and is determined in part by how well it performs on the race track, so establishing a breeding business on the future racing performance of a yearling may be a risky approach for investors. Another risk is that investors mainly interested in horse racing will access the rules, when currently the costs and prize money from horse racing are deliberately outside the tax base. We assume the price paid for a yearling may be a good proxy for a yearling that is more likely to be a commercial breeding prospect; therefore the price threshold reduces this risk by preventing investors from claiming an intention to breed with lower-priced horses. However, investors mainly interested in horse racing may be prepared to pay more for yearlings once bidding gets close to the published price threshold. Overall, changes in investor behaviour may result in the costs of this policy being higher than forecast in Budget 2018. The fiscal costs of this policy are based on a certain number of yearlings qualifying as standouts, and their estimated prices. The actual costs could be higher depending on the number of yearlings that are acquired with an intention to breed in the future and the prices paid for these yearlings. Inland Revenue will be able to monitor and report on the notifications it receives of yearlings being acquired with an intention to breed, and we also note that if prices for standout yearlings increase in the future, then the value of the threshold will increase over time. This may help to manage the fiscal risk. However, the increases will always lag behind what happens to prices in any given year. Another consideration is that an increase in yearling prices at the margin may disadvantage race horse investors who would otherwise have acquired yearlings for prices close to the price threshold. Nevertheless, this is an unavoidable risk of having a bright-line price. Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. Compatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. Section C: Evidence certainty and quality assurance Agency rating of evidence certainty? Impact Statement Template | 3 A review of the New Zealand racing industry by Australian racing administrator John Messara has indicated that the thoroughbred racing industry is in serious decline, referencing data such as foal crop numbers and monetary returns to owners. We have not considered whether tax incentives encouraging new investors into bloodstock breeding are the best way to reverse this trend. Further, there is significant uncertainty as to whether a standout yearling will actually be used in a bloodstock breeding business. We consider that a bright-line price is an appropriate way to manage some of the fiscal risk. To be completed by quality assurers: Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the ‘Proposed changes to bloodstock tax rules’ RIA prepared by Inland Revenue and considers that the information and analysis summarised in it partially meets the quality assurance criteria. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: The Regulatory Impact Assessment describes how allowing new bloodstock investors to claim tax deductions if they purchase a standout yearling with an intention to breed in the future will meet the stated objective and also provides excellent coverage of the main uncertainties and risks around its likely impact. The ability to have on-going monitoring may result in any unintended consequences being picked up as part of that process and any remedial action taken as appropriate. The analysis summarised in the RIA is as good as could be expected in light of the constrained range of options considered and the uncertainties over the net impacts of these tax changes on the bloodstock breeding industry. Even so, the analysis only partially meets the quality assurance criteria primarily because it is not possible to be confident that the stated objective is being met in the best way and with the least unintended consequences. Impact Statement Template | 4 Impact Statement: Proposed changes to bloodstock tax rules Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue and the Treasury are solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Assessment, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by Cabinet. Impact Statement Template | 5 Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis The Coalition Agreement between the New Zealand Labour Party and New Zealand First commits the Government to supporting New Zealand First’s Racing policy. This policy underscores the need for breeding programmes to re-establish New Zealand as a first tier country in racing. Officials have not assessed the nature and scale of the issues facing the racing industry, nor considered the full range of alternative options. We have not assessed whether the current tax rules are a reason for fewer new investors entering into bloodstock breeding. Prior to the new Government being formed, Inland Revenue officials had been considering racing industry proposals for tax reform. A few options were initially raised to address the problem identified by the industry, including the possibility of direct grants, but these alternatives were not developed further. In early 2018 officials began to focus on an approach that provides tax deductions for up to 30 yearlings per year. The industry advised that in any year, there are up to 20 thoroughbred yearlings and up to 10 standardbred yearlings that have the pedigree and physique and race winning potential to be commercial breeding horses in the future. Price paid for a yearling may be a good proxy for a yearling that is more likely to be a commercial breeding prospect; we assume that final purchase prices must be based on some assessment of a yearling’s qualities that make it more or less likely to be a breeding prospect in the eyes of an investor. However, because a yearling has not yet raced and proven its quality, a higher purchase price will not necessarily translate to a better quality horse. That can only be confirmed after the fact. The price threshold importantly aims to limit the number of horses that qualify for the policy. However, it is difficult to know how industry practices will change in response to these tax amendments. The extent to which investors will bid up horses near the threshold to qualify for tax benefits cannot be accurately predicted. Intention to breed also presents difficulties as a criterion, as it is not possible to know whether the intention an investor claims is genuine until a breeding business is realised. However, the quality of business plans and other information required to support a statement of intention to breed may enable Inland Revenue to identify those investors that do not have a genuine intention to breed from a yearling in the future. Responsible Manager (signature and date): Peter Frawley Policy Manager Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 11 September 2018 Impact Statement Template | 6 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the context within which action is proposed? A high proportion of people engaged in the horse racing and breeding industry are hobbyists. These participants are not entirely motivated by profit, but also by the enjoyment they derive from racing as a hobby and the opportunity to develop a future champion sire or breed the next champion race winner. Bloodstock breeders provide the future horses for the racing industry. Yearlings are typically offered for sale at organised public sales, where they are acquired by a range of purchasers including overseas investors, those buying a horse to race and potentially breed, existing breeding businesses, and investors seeking to start a breeding business. Investors frequently syndicate to share the cost of a horse, and will therefore have an interest in the horse rather than full ownership. The high costs of buying and maintaining a horse for racing, combined with the generally low stake money involved and the multitude of competition, result in it being a loss-making activity in many cases. Racing is exempted from income tax because it is considered to be a hobby. This prevents owners using losses from horse racing to shelter other income. Breeding is in the tax base as it is less likely to be undertaken as a hobby. That said, there are also a large number of hobby breeders. Investors acquiring yearlings face a low chance of breeding them for profit; the probability of an individual yearling colt ever going to a commercial stud in New Zealand is less than 5%, and the probability for a filly around 15%. Whether or not a young horse with good physique and pedigree is used in a commercial stud is contingent on its performance on the race track. The horse racing industry is represented by the New Zealand Thoroughbred Breeders Association, the New Zealand Standardbred Breeders Association, the New Zealand Racing Board, and Thoroughbred Racing New Zealand. The industry works closely with the government to design the rules that will apply to racing and breeding activities and then governs itself under these rules. Industry organisations have expressed concerns that New Zealand is losing top bloodlines to overseas buyers, reducing the quality of New Zealand bloodstock for racing. At the same time however, the industry wants to increase its export potential, which requires a supply of high quality horses to send overseas. These factors combine to create demand for more and better bloodstock, which has contributed to the Government’s proposal to expand incentives for new investors to undertake breeding. John Messara’s review indicates that the thoroughbred racing industry is in a state of serious malaise. It states that returns to New Zealand owners from 2016-17 were 22.9%, compared with 48.1% in New South Wales, and cites a significant decrease in the foal crop. Officials note that since 2004, the number of active breeders has dropped by a third, and the number of foals has dropped by over 40 per cent. In racing, the number of horses in training has dropped by 30 per cent since 2004, and the number of full-time equivalents employed in the racing industry has decreased by around 20 per cent. The general picture is that the Impact Statement Template | 7 industry is not generating as much economic activity as it once was, and is at risk of declining further. Past and current governments have provided support to the racing industry. The New Zealand Racing Board was established by the Racing Act 2003, with the purpose of providing effective governance for the racing industry, running a profitable betting business, promoting and enhancing the industry, and generating long term profit for the benefit of racing. Profits from the TAB, which is run by the New Zealand Racing Board, have for a long time been recycled back into the industry. The Board’s statement of intent for 2018 states that distributions for the racing codes for 2018/19 are budgeted at $151.6 million, a $0.8 million increase on last year. This includes the $12 million of additional funding targeted at increasing stakes across the 2017/18 and 2018/19 seasons that has been approved by the Board. As profitability increases, the expectation is code distributions will also be lifted from $151.6 million to $172.2 million in 2019/20. Code distributions are expected to grow further in 2020/21 to $190.0 million. 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place? The Racing Act provides governance arrangements for the racing industry, facilitates betting, and promotes the long-term viability of New Zealand racing. The breeding industry is taxed by the bloodstock rules in the Income Tax Act 2007. The current tax rules that apply to bloodstock breeding, last amended in 2006, allow bloodstock owners who have an active breeding business to access accelerated write-downs for bloodstock used in a breeding business: this means that stallions and broodmares receive deductions ahead of their expected decline in value. The accelerated depreciation on bloodstock was intended to make the purchase of bloodstock more attractive and significantly improve the economic potential of the racing industry. The Department of Internal Affairs, which provides advice to the Minister for Racing, has an interest in bloodstock policy. A review of the racing industry, commissioned by the Government, has been completed by Australian racing administrator John Messara. The Government’s goal is to ascertain whether the industry is meeting its full financial potential, and will consider Messara’s recommendations on future directions. Impact Statement Template | 8 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? The Government considers that the 2006 tax changes are not working as intended. Their view is that the changes favour existing breeders, due to the requirement that an owner must have an existing breeding business to qualify for the accelerated write-downs. The review of the racing industry completed by John Messara is also intended to ascertain how the industry can meet its full financial potential. Data published by the industry shows that horse racing and breeding are in decline and have been for a number of years. The Government’s aim is to encourage new investors to start a breeding business, on the basis that breeding stimulates the industry by increasing the pool of bloodstock, and if there are more breeding businesses then the industry will be more likely to produce a high quality of standout horses that carry economic potential. We have not considered whether an increase in the number of new investors in breeding is the best way to increase the quality of New Zealand bloodstock, or to address the challenges that the racing industry has been facing in recent years. The incentive to start a breeding business with yearlings is not ordinarily very strong, because of the overall uncertainty of this approach. If a horse performs poorly on the track and does not go to stud, then the owner may make a sizeable loss. However we note that, other things being equal, the tax incentives will make such bloodstock breeding a more appealing investment. 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? Ministers have ruled out the status quo, and have also ruled out the use of direct grants to encourage new investors. Officials’ preference was to stay with the status quo, as we see precedential disadvantages in expanding tax incentives in an industry that has a large leisure component. The recommendations included in John Messara’s review of the racing industry will further contribute to Ministers’ decision-making on the racing codes. Impact Statement Template | 9 2.5 What do stakeholders think? The stakeholders are the racing industry. They are represented by: the New Zealand Thoroughbred Breeders Association; the New Zealand Standardbred Breeders Association; the New Zealand Racing Board; and Thoroughbred Racing New Zealand. Officials have consulted with all of the stakeholders and the industry is broadly in favour of the proposed changes, although the changes are somewhat narrower than what the industry originally sought. The industry’s initial proposal was for deductions to be available to new bloodstock investors who claimed an intention to breed from a horse in the future. Their proposal was to amend the legislation so that: • A breeding business is treated as commencing on the purchase of a horse, provided there is an intention and plan to breed the horse for profit; and • The breeding business is only required by the end of the income year (ie does not need to be pre-existing at purchase) Officials had reservations with this broad proposal because of the number of horses that might qualify, and that all pre-breeding business expenditure could become deductible, even when no contribution to the breeding industry is realised. This could carry significant fiscal risk for the government. The industry later revised its proposal to allow an investor to claim a tax deduction against other income for the accumulated bloodstock holding costs (such as insurance, veterinary costs, and grazing costs), having claimed an intention to breed, at the earlier of: • The date the breeding phase commences; • The date the investor otherwise comes to have an interest in a bloodstock breeding business; or • The date they abandon their plans to breed the horse for profit (because the horse is sold, or proves unsuitable or unable to breed) Officials considered that this updated proposal was similar in substance to the original. The abandonment point allows investors to claim deductions for accumulated costs even when no breeding business eventuates, which officials also regarded as carrying sustainability risks for the government. Instead, officials have proposed a rule allowing write-downs only for the costs of standout horses (the most expensive horses), and proposed that the policy be limited to yearlings. The aim is to limit tax incentives to owners who never end up starting a breeding business by significantly restricting the number of eligible horses and thereby reducing the fiscal impact. It is a second-best option for the industry, and it is also a second-best for Government as it retains the possibility of subsidising some losses where no breeding business has materialised, but it mitigates a large amount of the potential fiscal risk. Impact Statement Template | 10 Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? The four options considered are: • Option 1: Status quo • Option 2: ‘Carry forward’ to business • Option 3: Claim to intention (industry’s preferred option) • Option 4: Claim to intention with high-quality yearling Option 1 (Status quo) Bloodstock breeders must have an existing breeding business to qualify for deductions on the cost of horses. The Government ruled this option out early on. Option 2 Allow pre-breeding business costs to be carried forward until a breeding business is established, and then deducted. It is a tax incentive as it allows pre-business expenditure to be deductible if a business eventuates, which departs from the general requirement that for costs to be deductible, they must be incurred in the course of carrying on a current business for the purpose of deriving income. Therefore, it provides an incentive for new investors to start a breeding business. This option is closest to the status quo, as no benefit is available until a breeding business is actually started. Due to the fact that it addresses the problem of the uncertainty of new investors’ intentions, officials preferred this option over options 3 and 4. Option 3 Allow pre-breeding business costs to be deductible when an intention to breed from a thoroughbred or standardbred horse for profit is claimed. Investors can also claim deductions if they abandon the intention to breed the horse for profit. Evidence of an intention to breed for profit in the future would include the pedigree of the horse, contractual arrangements, a detailed business plan, and a skilled manager/trainer. This option departs most substantively from the status quo, as it relaxes the requirements of the longstanding tax policy concept of a ‘business test’, and was the industry’s preferred option. The looser requirements provide an incentive for new investors to buy bloodstock for breeding. Option 4 Similar to option 3, but limit eligibility for deductions to standout yearlings that command a price above a bright-line threshold determined by previous sales results and published ahead of the next year’s sales by Inland Revenue. This restricts the incentive to horses that, as yearlings, are indicated by the market to be most likely to be genuine commercial breeding prospects, and thus mitigates the negative impact on Crown revenue. It provides an incentive for new investors to start a breeding business while taking steps to manage the fiscal risk. However, it has the same negative precedential effect as option 3. Impact Statement Template | 11 Horses acquired at Australian sales The Government is currently considering whether to include yearlings bought at Australian sales in the proposed policy. The industry has stated that allowing Australian yearlings into the policy would further help to improve New Zealand bloodlines, and has requested that these sales be included. There is a risk that including Australian sales will increase the fiscal cost, particularly given that Australian yearlings are more expensive than New Zealand yearlings overall, and each year more than a couple of standout yearlings may be acquired by new investors at the Australian sales. The industry has argued that there would not be demand for more than a few such Australian yearlings, and that there is therefore room for these horses within the proposed policy. We assume that including Australian horses in options 2 or 3 could also increase fiscal cost. 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? The main objective is to incentivise new bloodstock investors to start a breeding business, in order to promote investment in the New Zealand racing industry and enhance the quality of bloodstock. This has been measured against the following criteria: Effectiveness: The option should encourage investment in the racing industry by stimulating breeding and improve the quality of New Zealand bloodstock. Efficiency: The option should target the best breeding prospects to the greatest extent possible. Administration & compliance costs: The option should minimise administrative and compliance costs as much as possible. Sustainability: The changes should minimise negative precedential effect, and should fit within the allocated fiscal envelope. Efficiency and effectiveness are the most important criteria; targeting genuine breeding prospects is important for the policy to have a positive effect on the racing industry. We assume that price paid for a yearling may be a good proxy for a yearling that is more likely to be a commercial breeding prospect. As this is not certain, however, it is difficult to assert that the chosen option will be objectively effective, even if purchase price is the most logical metric available. Administration and compliance costs (least important) must also be taken into consideration, and sustainability will be traded off against efficiency and effectiveness, since all of the options involve overriding the traditional ‘business test’ for the racing sector, which inevitably sets negative precedent. Impact Statement Template | 12 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? The option to stay with the status quo has been ruled out by Ministers, as have direct grants. The Coalition Agreement supports New Zealand First’s racing policy. Thus, any options put forward have to address the Government’s objective of enhancing incentives to breed bloodstock. Impact Statement Template | 13 Section 4: Impact Analysis Marginal impact: How does each of the options identified at section 3.1 compare with the counterfactual, under each of the criteria set out in section 3.2? Add, or subtract, columns and rows as necessary. Option 1 (status quo) Option 2 (carry-forward costs until breeding business is established, then deduct) Option 3 (deductions when intention to breed claimed) Option 4 (deductions when intention to breed claimed; high value yearlings only) Effectiveness 0 + Likely to encourage some new investors relative to status quo, although incentive is weakest of the three options, and therefore possibly least eff ective at stimulating bloodstock breeding. There are no deductions if a breeding business does not eventuate. ++ Strong incentive for new investors to c laim that a rac e hors e was acquired with an intention to breed for profit in the future, as the only restriction on eligibility for deductions is the ability to demonstrate an intention to breed. Potentially the most effective at stimulating investment in the racing industry, but perhaps not into bloodstock breeding, as inves tors may mischarac teris e their intent. ++ May incentivise new investors who have a genuine intention to breed by offering concessions only for higher-priced horses. Theref ore, potentially equally eff ective at stimulating bloodstock breeding and increasing investment in the racing industry. Efficiency (targetedness) 0 ++ Has the benefit of resolving uncertainty surrounding investor intent. Genuine breeders are targeted, as c arried-forward losses can only be used when a breeding business is established. + Likely to encourage new investors into the rac ing industry, but potentially less efficient than option 4 as it doesn’t target standout horses, so may capture a large number of horses that were mainly acquired as horses to race rather than horses that are genuinely commercial breeding prospects. Likely to be reasonably expensive. + May be more efficient than option 3 because it targets new inves tors who are buying high-quality yearlings with better commercial breeding potential (presumably reflected by high purchase price). Administration & compliance costs 0 0 Similar to status quo as a breeding business is still required. There may be an increased number of applications, however administration is otherwis e the s ame. -- Low compliance costs as taxpayers claim an intention to breed in their tax return by including costs as deductions in the normal way. However, these claims are subject to review by the Commissioner if there is concern whether the intent exists. Potentially more administration costs to review and dispute claims of intention to breed. Typically, proving that an intention does not exist is difficult. Due to lack of restrictions on number of horses, number of cas es to review could be large. - More compliance and administration than options 1 or 2, as it is based on intention to breed. Less than option 3, because number of horses is restricted by bright-line price floor. Sustainability (precedent & fiscal cost) 0 - Slightly less sustainable than status quo, because additional incentives for investors increase differential treatment of sector, which can create precedent for other sectors seeking incentives in the future. However, the option is broadly in line with current policy settings as a breeding business is required. Fiscal cost is significantly lower than option 3 and 4. -- Least sustainable. Offering deductions to any bloodstock investor who can demonstrate intention to breed s ets wide precedent if other activities are lobbied to be brought into tax net in future. Potentially very costly fiscally. - Less sustainable than option 1 or 2; could set undesirable precedent if other activities are lobbied to be brought into tax net in future. But more limited than option 3, s o relatively more sustainable, with a lower fiscal impact. Overall assessment 0 + -- - Key: ++ much better than doing nothing/the status quo; + better than doing nothing/the status quo; 0 about the same as doing nothing/the status quo; - worse than doing nothing/the status quo; - - much worse than doing nothing/the status quo Impact Statement Template | 14 Section 5: Conclusions 5.1 What option, or combination of options, is likely best to address the problem, meet the policy objectives and deliver the highest net benefits? Option 2 is preferred over the other options considered. Accepting that the Government’s objective carries inherent fiscal and precedential risks, the preferred option is the one that is potentially most effective and efficient in achieving the objective, and least unsustainable, with increased compliance and administration costs as a further trade-off. However, the approach that has been chosen by the Government is option 4. There is a lack of evidence to suggest that high-priced yearlings are more likely to go on to breed than lower-priced yearlings, which makes it somewhat uncertain whether option 3 or option 4 will be more effective or efficient at improving the quality of New Zealand bloodstock. However, the fiscal cost of option 3 is potentially very high, and we consider that this cost is too high to justify the additional effectiveness it might entail. Further, we assume that a higher price paid for a yearling reflects the market’s view that a horse has qualities such as physique and pedigree that make it more likely to be a better racing and commercial breeding prospect. An investor who purchases a high-priced yearling presumably judges the horse to have better prospects than other yearlings, otherwise they would rationally buy the cheapest horse available. Due to officials’ concerns around the sustainability of allowing all horses into the policy, setting a price threshold is considered to be the best solution. This leads us to prefer option 4 over option 3, acknowledging that the Government and the industry did not agree with officials’ preferred approach of option 2. 5.2 Summary table of costs and benefits of the preferred approach Affected parties (identify) Comment: nature of cost or benefit (eg ongoing, one-off), evidence and assumption (eg compliance rates), risks Impact $m present value, for monetised impacts; high, medium or low for non-monetised impacts Evidence certainty (High, medium or low) Additional costs of option 4, compared to taking no action New investors New investors (with a horse costing more than the bright-line price) intending to start a breeding business will need to provide evidence of a business plan to the Commissioner. The cost of some horses may also go up. Low High Existing breeders Existing breeders may have to Low High Impact Statement Template | 15 2 There is a risk that the costs could be higher due to the behavioural effect of investors bidding up yearlings at the margin to qualify for the tax incentive. Nevertheless, data from the previous three years of sales have shown that the number of horses whose prices fall within this sensitive margin is low; therefore, we do not expect there to be a large fiscal blowout. pay more for yearlings as a result of yearlings being bid up for the tax incentive (though they will often be selling them, and getting that benefit). Breeders who syndicate yearlings to new investors may have to provide the business plan to the Commissioner themselves. Foreign investors Foreign investors may have to pay more for yearlings as a result of yearlings being bid up for the tax incentive. Low High Inland Revenue The Commissioner will need to evaluate business plans submitted by bloodstock owners claiming an intention to breed, which may be more administratively intensive than simply verifying the existence of a business. Low High Total Monetised Cost Cost allocated to tax expenditure in Budget 2018. $4.8 million over 4 years High 2 Non-monetised costs Increased administration and compliance costs for regulators and regulated parties. Low High Expected benefits of option 4, compared to taking no action New investors New investors would be encouraged to enter into a breeding business because of the concessions for standout horses where an intention to breed can be demonstrated. Medium Low Existing breeders Existing breeders will benefit from any increase in yearling prices as a result of new investors bidding up to get the tax concessions. Medium Low Foreign investors Foreign investors will benefit from any improvements to bloodstock exported from New Zealand (though they will also pay more for it) . Low Low Impact Statement Template | 16 5.3 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? The proposed changes involve relaxing eligibility requirements from “existing breeding business” to “intention to breed.” This change removes the requirement for a bloodstock breeding business to exist before an investor can claim tax deductions for the costs of owning bloodstock. The risk is that race horses are characterised as breeding prospects. Further, the success of the racing industry may encourage other sectors to approach the government for their own unique tax rules. 5.4 Is the preferred option compatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’? There are no identifiable areas of incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems.’ Total Monetised Benefit Potentially significant monetary benefit for existing bloodstock breeders and new investors. $4.8 million over 4 years Medium Non-monetised benefits More level playing field between new investors and current breeders. Medium Medium Impact Statement Template | 17 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? The new policy will require amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007. Once implemented, Inland Revenue will be able to enforce and monitor the arrangements. New investors will be required to notify the Commissioner of Inland Revenue of their intention to breed, supported by information including the investor’s details, a business plan, and veterinary reports, which Inland Revenue will evaluate. The Commissioner will publish the bright-line values each year and will be able to monitor how the policy is working overall using the information provided by investors. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? During consultation with the industry, concerns were raised about Inland Revenue being too regimented in determining a new investors’ intention to breed from a yearling in the future. The reality is that proving intention is very difficult. The existence of a business plan and other pieces of evidence are only indicators that an intention to breed may exist. Officials acknowledge that establishing a breeding business with a yearling is risky. We agreed that the Tax Information Bulletin would provide examples of the type of information and the level of detail that would be required to support a notification of intention to breed from a standout yearling. Impact Statement Template | 18 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? The information provided to the Commissioner by new investors claiming an intention to breed will give Inland Revenue the ability to monitor how the policy is working, who the new investors are, and whether the horse gets used for bloodstock breeding. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The Commissioner will need to annually publish the value thresholds for standout yearlings in light of the previous year’s sales prices, and can review arrangements on an annual basis. Inland Revenue will be able to assess whether the thresholds are allowing the desired number of yearlings into the policy, and whether those yearlings are going on to breed.

Coversheet: GST on assets sold by non- profit bodies Advising agencies Inland Revenue Decision sought Agreement in principle to policy proposal Proposing Ministers Minister of Revenue Summary: Problem and Proposed Approach Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? Inland Revenue has recently looked at what constitutes a non-profit body’s “taxable activity” and provided an interpretation that differs from the understanding previously held by many. This recent interpretation means a non-profit body can still claim input tax deductions on the purchase of goods and services but does not need to return output tax on the sale of these assets or equivalent event (such as an insurance pay-out or deregistration from GST) if these assets are not part of the non-profit body’s “taxable activity”. This interpretation has increased non-profit bodies’ advantage relative to other GST-registered persons and, in doing so created a significant but unquantifiable fiscal risk. Proposed Approach How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option? Non-profit bodies would be required to return GST on an asset’s sale or equivalent event if input tax deductions have been claimed for that asset. This is consistent with the previous understanding of a non-profit body’s “taxable activity” held by many and would not affect the broader concessionary GST treatment of non-profit bodies. Furthermore, this option would mitigate the revenue risk arising from the recent interpretation of a non-profit body’s “taxable activity”. Section B: Summary Impacts: Benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? The main expected beneficiary will be the Crown as the proposed option will prevent a significant but unquantifiable revenue risk by closing a gap in the GST base. Non-profit bodies will benefit from the proposed option as it will provide them with certainty as to the GST treatment of the sale of their assets (or equivalent event). Furthermore, the proposed option will provide guidance to non-profit bodies on whether or not they should elect to register for GST if they are below the GST registration threshold. Impact Statement Template | 1 Where do the costs fall? Non-profit bodies who had taken a view that GST was not payable on the sale of some assets they had claimed input tax credits for will suffer a GST cost under the proposed option. However, non-profit bodies would have suffered this GST cost under the previous understanding by many of a non-profit body’s “taxable activity”. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? It is possible that some non-profit bodies will have an unexpected GST cost arising from the proposed option. Transitional rules would be put in place to mitigate the impact of these costs. Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. There are no areas of significant incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. Section C: Evidence certainty and quality assurance Agency rating of evidence certainty? Inland Revenue is confident of the evidence base for the existence of the problem. However, Inland Revenue does not have the data available to quantify the magnitude of the potential revenue risk. Quantifying the magnitude of the revenue risk would require data on the value of assets held by non-profit bodies which are not part of their taxable activity, and the likelihood of these assets being disposed of or an equivalent event arising. To be completed by quality assurers: Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue and the Treasury. Quality Assurance Assessment: The quality assurance reviewers at Inland Revenue and the Treasury have reviewed the impact statement GST on assets sold by non-profit bodies and consider that the information and analysis summarised in it meets the quality assurance criteria of the Regulatory Impact Assessment Framework. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: We consider that given the nature of the problem that the impact statement addresses it would not be appropriate to undertake consultation with potential affected parties prior to the in-principle decision being made by Cabinet. In addition, we are comfortable that the restricted options analysis in this statement is appropriate in order to respond swiftly to address the problem. Impact Statement Template | 2 Impact Statement: GST on assets sold by non-profit bodies Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Statement, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing in principle policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Consultation and testing No consultation has been undertaken with external stakeholders yet. Consulting with external stakeholders would have worsened the revenue risk by bringing their attention to the problem and allowing them to exploit it. However, consultation is planned with stakeholders on the design of the proposed option. Range of options considered Only options targeted at addressing the specific issue identified have been considered. Other options which would alter the broader concessionary GST treatment of non-profit bodies have not been considered at this time. The analysis required to examine options that impact the broader concessionary GST treatment of non-profit bodies would not be able to be undertaken quickly enough in order to address the current revenue risk in a timely manner. Responsible Manager (signature and date): Chris Gillion Policy Manager Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 3 May 2018 Impact Statement Template | 3 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the context within which action is proposed? GST treatment of non-profit bodies Non-profit bodies may register for GST even if only a small proportion of their activities would be subject to GST. If they do register they are entitled to claim back GST on virtually all goods and services they acquire even if a large proportion of their activity is something other than making taxable supplies (such as receiving and paying out donations). In this respect the GST treatment of non-profit bodies is concessionary relative to other registered persons. New interpretation of a non-profit body’s “taxable activity” Inland Revenue’s Office of the Chief Tax Counsel (OCTC) has recently reviewed what constitutes a non-profit body’s “taxable activity”. OCTC concluded that the taxable activity of a non-profit body comprises the activity that is directed to the making of supplies for a consideration and extends to activities that have a sufficient nexus to this activity. However, the taxable activity of a non-profit body does not include activities they undertake which do not have a sufficient connection to the activity of making supplies for a consideration. Crown Law has also examined this issue and agreed with OCTC’s interpretation. The outcome of this new interpretation is an even more concessionary tax treatment for non- profit bodies than was already the case and a potentially significant revenue loss that cannot be accurately estimated. Non-profit bodies will still be able to claim back GST on all expenses except those related to an exempt supply. However, they would only have to return output tax on supplies that form part of their taxable activity. The sale of an asset that does not form part of a non-profit body’s taxable activity would not be subject to GST even though the non-profit body could have claimed GST refunds in relation to that asset. An example of this is a charity that owns two buildings – one a headquarters dedicated to fundraising (not a taxable activity) and one an emergency accommodation facility which charges a below market fee for its services (a taxable activity). The charity can claim an input tax deduction for capital and ongoing costs relating to both buildings because it can claim GST on anything that is not related to an exempt supply. Under the new interpretation it could be argued that the charity would not be required to pay output tax on a sale of the fundraising headquarters because the sale would not have been made in the course or furtherance of the taxable activity of providing emergency accommodation. The diagrams on the following page illustrate the GST position for a non-profit body under the previous understanding of “taxable activity” held by many (old interpretation), and the new interpretation of “taxable activity”. The green box on the left hand column shows the GST payable by the non-profit body and the red boxes on the right show the GST that can be claimed back by the non-profit body. The non-coloured boxes show where GST is either not payable or not able to be claimed back. We note that the only difference between the first and second diagrams is that the GST payable is reduced because some supplies that were previously considered part of a non-profit body’s taxable activity are now not taxable supplies under the new interpretation.

The regulatory system already in place is the revenue raising and collection regulatory system, specifically the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? Under the GST policy framework GST should be as neutral as possible among different taxpayers. As such, non-profit bodies should not receive concessionary treatment relative to other GST-registered persons. However, successive Governments have chosen to provide non-profit bodies with a concessionary GST treatment. The recent interpretation of a non-profit body’s “taxable activity” provides an even more concessionary treatment of non-profit bodies than may have been originally thought to exist. This further reduces the neutrality between the GST treatment of non-profit bodies and other registered persons. As such, the Government needs to consider whether it wants to allow this even more concessionary treatment or to restrict the concessionary treatment to what may have previously been regarded as the extent of the concessionary treatment of non- profit bodies. The recent interpretation of a non-profit body’s “taxable activity” has also created a potentially significant but unquantifiable revenue risk for the Crown. The revenue loss will arise when a non-profit body sells an asset that was assumed to have given rise to a GST liability prior to the recent interpretation but now does not. It can be expected that the pool of readily sellable non-profit bodies’ assets would be limited. On the other hand, there is a potential tax base risk related to the ability for GST-registered purchasers to claim second- hand goods deductions if the goods were not subject to GST. A revenue loss could also arise if a non-profit body deregisters for GST purposes. Further revenue losses could arise with insurance pay-outs if the asset in question would previously have been assumed to be part of the non-profit body’s taxable activity. GST previously returned by non-profit bodies on an asset’s sale or equivalent event may also need to be refunded under the new interpretation of a non-profit body’s “taxable activity”. Inland Revenue is aware of one non-profit body that will be receiving a large GST refund because of the new interpretation of “taxable activity”. The concern is that once this refund has been received, other non-profit bodies will also apply for significant GST refunds. The magnitude of the revenue risk arising from the recent interpretation of a non-profit body’s “taxable activity” cannot be accurately estimated. However, based on data from the Department of Internal Affairs (DIA), the value of current and non-current assets held by DIA- registered charities (including large organisations such as universities) is around $55 billion. This suggests that the revenue risk arising from the new interpretation is potentially very high. Impact Statement Template | 6 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? The need for a quick response to this issue means the broader concessionary GST treatment of non-profit bodies has not been reviewed. The concessionary GST treatment of non-profit bodies may still be reviewed at a later stage. 2.5 What do stakeholders think? Stakeholders have not yet been consulted on the problem or the proposed solution. Consultation would have made stakeholders aware of the problem and increased the risk of non-profit bodies applying for GST refunds based on the new interpretation of their “taxable activity”. Consultation with the non-profit bodies sector will take place following an announcement by the Minister of Revenue of the Government’s plan to require non-profit bodies to return GST on an asset’s sale or equivalent event if they have claimed input tax deductions for that asset. Consultation will involve a consultation paper being released, followed by a four week period for stakeholders to make submissions. Impact Statement Template | 7 Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? Option one: Do nothing (status quo) Under this option, the neutrality between the GST treatment of non-profit bodies and other registered persons would be further reduced. Furthermore, the revenue risks identified above will eventuate when non-profit bodies become aware of the new interpretation of a non-profit body’s “taxable activity”. Option two: Non-profit bodies would be required to return GST on an asset’s sale or equivalent event if they have claimed input tax deductions for that asset (proposed option) Under this option the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 would be amended to require non- profit bodies to return GST on an asset’s disposal or equivalent event if they have claimed input tax deductions for that asset. For example, a healthcare non-profit body is devoted to monitoring the health of children under the age of 5 in the local community. The non-profit body is partly funded by the local health board which provides the non-profit body with the necessary medical staff. The non- profit body obtains the necessary medical equipment and overhead expenses out of its own fund-raising activities. The non-profit body also leases out child car seats and baby equipment to the public for a fee. The non-profit body has claimed input tax credits for all the GST it has incurred in acquiring the equipment needed for both the health monitoring service and the hiring activity, and for rent and other overheads relating to both activities. The non-profit body decides that the hiring activity is detracting from its main activity of providing health checks and therefore decides to sell off the car seats and baby equipment to the highest bidders. It also discovers that there is now better medical equipment available for rent, the cost of which could be met by selling off the existing medical equipment to other health providers. Under this option the non-profit will be required to pay GST on the proceeds of sale of the car seats, baby equipment and medical equipment. Under the status quo it may have been argued that the sale of the medical equipment was not subject to GST as it was not sufficiently connected with the activity of hiring out car seats and baby equipment for a fee. Goods and services acquired before 1986 There would be no specific rule for goods and services acquired before 1986. Input tax deductions will not have been claimed for the capital cost of acquiring the goods and services but, if input tax deductions for expenses attributable to such goods and services had been claimed, the goods and services will be treated as if they had been brought into the GST base and therefore output tax would apply. Other GST-registered entities with pre-1986 assets are generally required to pay output tax on sale of the assets or equivalent event so the proposed approach simply aligns the GST treatment for non-profit bodies with the Impact Statement Template | 8 general GST treatment. Transitional rules It is possible that some non-profit bodies may have had a genuine expectation that, despite having claimed input tax credits, there would be no output tax liability on sale or equivalent event of an asset. This would be where they had already taken a view of what constitutes a non-profit body’s “taxable activity” consistent with Inland Revenue’s recent interpretation. In that case it would seem fair to allow these non-profit bodies to pay back any GST already claimed and remove the relevant goods and services from the GST base so as to put the non-profit bodies in the same position as if that GST had never been claimed. Under this option these non-profit bodies could, for a limited time, either notify Inland Revenue or apply to Inland Revenue to pay back any input tax claimed on goods and services affected by the changed interpretation since the date they were registered for GST, rather than pay output tax on the sale of the particular assets or an equivalent event. The main instances in which this is likely to be a better outcome for a non-profit body is with land or any other asset that appreciates rather than depreciates in value. Application date This option would apply retrospectively to the sale of a non-profit body’s assets (or equivalent event) from the date the Minister of Revenue makes an announcement signalling the Government’s intention to implement this option. This would minimise the potential revenue loss arising from the new interpretation of a non-profit body’s “taxable activity”. The option would also use a savings provision to preserve the tax positions of non-profit bodies taken before the date of this announcement. Following this announcement, a consultation paper would be released and stakeholders would have four weeks to make submissions. Consultation will be focussed on receiving submissions on the detailed design of the option, particularly the transitional rules. 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? The main objective of this project is to prevent the revenue risk arising from non-profit bodies receiving an even more concessionary treatment than may have been originally thought to exist. The following criteria will be used to assess options against this objective. • Neutrality – the option should promote neutral tax treatments of non-profit bodies and other persons. • Certainty – the option should provide certainty to non-profit bodies as to what assets would be subject to GST upon the asset’s sale or equivalent event. • Compliance costs – the option should minimise compliance costs for non-profit bodies. • Administration costs – implementation and administration costs for Government departments should be minimised. Impact Statement Template | 9 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? Removing the broader concessionary GST treatment of non-profit bodies is an option to address the issue that has not been considered. Reviewing the broader concessionary GST treatment provided to non-profit bodies would take time to fully analyse the impacts of making any changes. Furthermore, reviewing the broader concessionary GST treatment would require extensive consultation. However, the issues identified above require a quick response in order to minimise the revenue risk. Impact Statement Template | 10 Section 4: Impact Analysis Marginal impact: How does each of the options identified at section 3.1 compare with the counterfactual, under each of the criteria set out in section 3.2? No action Preferred option Neutrality 0 + (Reduces the concessionary treatment of non-profit bodies compared to other GST-registered persons) Certainty 0 + (Increased certainty for non-profit bodies) Compliance costs 0 - (Increased compliance costs associated with transitional rules) Administration costs 0 0 (No significant change in administration costs for Inland Revenue) Overall assessment 0 ++ Key: ++ much better than doing nothing/the status quo + better than doing nothing/the status quo 0 about the same as doing nothing/the status quo - worse than doing nothing/the status quo - - much worse than doing nothing/the status quo Impact Statement Template | 11 Section 5: Conclusions 5.1 What option, or combination of options, is likely best to address the problem, meet the policy objectives and deliver the highest net benefits? The preferred option is option one which requires non-profit bodies to return GST on an asset’s sale or equivalent event if they have claimed input tax deductions for that asset. This is the preferred option because it increases the neutrality of the GST treatment of non-profit bodies and other registered persons compared to the status quo. This option reduces the concessionary treatment of non-profit bodies that exists under the status quo, whilst still maintaining the previous commonly held view of the GST concessions available to non-profit bodies. Importantly, this option also prevents the significant revenue risk that exists under the status quo. This option also increases certainty as non-profit bodies will know that they are required to return GST on an asset’s sale or equivalent event if they have claimed input tax deductions for that asset. Under the status quo, a non-profit body would instead have to determine whether any particular asset formed part of their taxable activity to determine if they have to return GST for that asset’s sale. This certainty will also help non-profit bodies below the GST-registration threshold to determine whether they should elect to register for GST or not. It is acknowledged that the transitional rules would increase compliance costs for non- profit bodies that wish to use these rules. However, these rules are necessary to minimise the impact of an unexpected GST liability that may arise for non-profit bodies under the proposed option. Furthermore, this increase in compliance costs would only occur for non- profit bodies that choose to use the transitional rules.

We do not anticipate that the proposed approach would have any other impacts. 5.4 Is the preferred option compatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’? The preferred option is compatible with the Government’s “Expectations for the design of regulatory systems”. Impact Statement Template | 14 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? The proposal will require amendment to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. These amendments will be drafted following the proposed consultation and will be added to the next omnibus tax bill as a supplementary order paper. The proposed option will apply retrospectively from the date of the Minister of Revenue’s announcement of the changes. Between the date of the Minister’s announcement and the changes receiving the Royal assent, the status quo will apply. However, where taxpayers seek to obtain refunds during this transitional period, which must be repaid once the changes receive the Royal a ssent, the Commissioner may determine resources should not be applied to such reassessments consistent with her wider care and management obligations. Inland Revenue will manage the situation with taxpayers to minimise the occurrence of taxpayers receiving refunds that they will then need to pay back to Inland Revenue once the changes receive the Royal assent. Inland Revenue will be responsible for administering the changes once they are introduced. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? The main implementation risk concerns how to manage the period between the date of the Minister of Revenue’s announcement and the date of the Royal assent. It is expected that few non-profit bodies would apply for refunds they are entitled to under the status quo as they would know they would be required to pay any refund they receive back once the changes receive the Royal assent. Inland Revenue will also work with non-profit bodies and their tax agents to manage this transitional period. The proposed consultation following the Minister of Revenue’s announcement will also help to address any other implementation risks that may be raised by stakeholders. Impact Statement Template | 15 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue will monitor the outcomes pursuant to the Generic Tax Policy Process ("GTTP") to confirm that they match the policy objectives. The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. We do not expect extensive monitoring to be necessary as the proposed option is merely confirming what was until recently an understanding of the law held by many. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? Post-implementation review is expected to occur around 12 months after implementation. If the post-implementation review identifies any need for remedial action it would be recommended for addition to the Government's tax policy work programme and could potentially be included in future taxation bills.

Coversheet: GST on assets sold by non­ profit bodies Advising agencies Inland Revenue Decision sought Agreement in principle to policy proposal Proposing Ministers Minister of Revenue Summary: Problem and Proposed Approach Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? Inland Revenue has recently looked at what constitutes a non-profit body’s “taxable activity” and provided an interpretation that differs from the understanding previously held by many. This recent interpretation m eans a non-profit body can still claim input tax deductions on the purchase of goods and services but does not need to return output tax on the sale of these a ssets or equivalent event (such as an insurance pay-out or deregistration from GST) if these a ssets are not part of the non-profit body’s “taxable activity”. This interpretation has increased non-profit bodies’ advantage relative to other GST-registered persons and, in doing so created a significant but unquantifiable fiscal risk. Proposed Approach How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option? Non-profit bodies would be required to return GST on an a ss e t’s sale or equivalent event if input tax deductions have been claimed for that asset. This is consistent with the previous understanding of a non-profit body’s “taxable activity” held by many and would not affect the broader concessionary GST treatment of non-profit bodies. Furthermore, this option would mitigate the revenue risk arising from the recent interpretation of a non-profit body’s “taxable activity”. Section B: Summary impacts: Benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? The main expected beneficiary will be the Crown a s the proposed option will prevent a significant but unquantifiable revenue risk by closing a gap in the GST base. Non-profit bodies will benefit from the proposed option a s it will provide them with certainty a s to the GST treatment of the sale of their a sse ts (or equivalent event). Furthermore, the proposed option will provide guidance to non-profit bodies on whether or not they should elect to register for GST if they are below the GST registration threshold. Impact Statement Template | 1 Non-profit bodies who had taken a view that GST was not payable on the sale of some a sse ts they had claimed input tax credits for will suffer a GST cost under the proposed option. However, non-profit bodies would have suffered this GST cost under the previous understanding by many of a non-profit body’s “taxable activity”. Where do the costs fall? What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? It is possible that some non-profit bodies will have an unexpected GST cost arising from the proposed option. Transitional rules would be put in place to mitigate the impact of these costs. Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. There are no areas of significant incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory system s’. Section C: Evidence certainty and quality assurance Agency rating of evidence certainty? Inland Revenue is confident of the evidence b ase for the existence of the problem. However, Inland Revenue does not have the data available to quantify the magnitude of the potential revenue risk. Quantifying the magnitude of the revenue risk would require data on the value of assets held by non-profit bodies which are not part of their taxable activity, and the likelihood of these a ssets being disposed of or an equivalent event arising. To be completed by quality assurers: Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue and the Treasury. Quality Assurance A ssessment: The quality assurance reviewers at Inland Revenue and the Treasury have reviewed the impact statem ent GST on assets sold by non-profit bodies and consider that the information and analysis summarised in it meets the quality assurance criteria of the Regulatory Impact A ssessm ent Framework. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: We consider that given the nature of the problem that the impact statem ent ad d resses it would not be appropriate to undertake consultation with potential affected parties prior to the in-principle decision being made by Cabinet. In addition, we are comfortable that the restricted options analysis in this statem ent is appropriate in order to respond swiftly to address the problem. Impact Statement Template | 2 Impact Statement: GST on assets sold by non-profit bodies Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Statement, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing in principle policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Consultation and testing No consultation has been undertaken with external stakeholders yet. Consulting with external stakeholders would have worsened the revenue risk by bringing their attention to the problem and allowing them to exploit it. However, consultation is planned with stakeholders on the design of the proposed option. Range of options considered Only options targeted at addressing the specific issue identified have been considered. Other options which would alter the broader concessionary GST treatment of non-profit bodies have not been considered at this time. The analysis required to examine options that impact the broader concessionary GST treatment of non-profit bodies would not be able to be undertaken quickly enough in order to address the current revenue risk in a timely manner. Responsible Manager (signature and date): Chris Gillion Policy Manager Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 3 May 2018 Impact Statement Template | 3 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the context within which action is proposed? GST treatment of non-profit bodies Non-profit bodies may register for GST even if only a small proportion of their activities would be subject to GST. If they do register they are entitled to claim back GST on virtually all goods and services they acquire even if a large proportion of their activity is something other than making taxable supplies (such a s receiving and paying out donations). In this respect the GST treatment of non-profit bodies is concessionary relative to other registered persons. New interpretation of a non-profit body’s “taxable activity” Inland Revenue’s Office of the Chief Tax Counsel (OCTC) has recently reviewed what constitutes a non-profit body’s “taxable activity”. OCTC concluded that the taxable activity of a non-profit body comprises the activity that is directed to the making of supplies for a consideration and extends to activities that have a sufficient nexus to this activity. However, the taxable activity of a non-profit body does not include activities they undertake which do not have a sufficient connection to the activity of making supplies for a consideration. Crown Law has also examined this issue and agreed with OCTC’s interpretation. The outcome of this new interpretation is an even more concessionary tax treatment for non­ profit bodies than was already the case and a potentially significant revenue loss that cannot be accurately estimated. Non-profit bodies will still be able to claim back GST on all expenses except those related to an exempt supply. However, they would only have to return output tax on supplies that form part of their taxable activity. The sale of an a sse t that does not form part of a non-profit body’s taxable activity would not be subject to GST even though the non-profit body could have claimed GST refunds in relation to that asset. An example of this is a charity that owns two buildings - one a headquarters dedicated to fundraising (not a taxable activity) and one an emergency accommodation facility which charges a below market fee for its services (a taxable activity). The charity can claim an input tax deduction for capital and ongoing costs relating to both buildings because it can claim GST on anything that is not related to an exempt supply. Under the new interpretation it could be argued that the charity would not be required to pay output tax on a sale of the fundraising headquarters because the sale would not have been made in the course or furtherance of the taxable activity of providing emergency accommodation. The diagrams on the following page illustrate the GST position for a non-profit body under the previous understanding of “taxable activity” held by many (old interpretation), and the new interpretation of “taxable activity”. The green box on the left hand column shows the GST payable by the non-profit body and the red boxes on the right show the GST that can be claimed back by the non-profit body. The non-coloured boxes show where GST is either not payable or not able to be claimed back. We note that the only difference between the first and second diagrams is that the GST payable is reduced because some supplies that were previously considered part of a non-profit body’s taxable activity are now not taxable supplies under the new interpretation. Impact Statement Template | 4 GST position under “old” interpretation GST position under “new” interpretation Impact Statement Template | 5 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place? The regulatory system already in place is the revenue raising and collection regulatory system, specifically the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? Under the GST policy framework GST should be as neutral a s possible among different taxpayers. As such, non-profit bodies should not receive concessionary treatment relative to other GST-registered persons. However, successive Governments have chosen to provide non-profit bodies with a concessionary GST treatment. The recent interpretation of a non-profit body’s “taxable activity” provides an even more concessionary treatment of non-profit bodies than may have been originally thought to exist. This further reduces the neutrality between the GST treatment of non-profit bodies and other registered persons. As such, the Government needs to consider whether it wants to allow this even more concessionary treatment or to restrict the concessionary treatment to what may have previously been regarded a s the extent of the concessionary treatment of non­ profit bodies. The recent interpretation of a non-profit body’s “taxable activity” has also created a potentially significant but unquantifiable revenue risk for the Crown. The revenue loss will arise when a non-profit body sells an a sse t that was assum ed to have given rise to a GST liability prior to the recent interpretation but now does not. It can be expected that the pool of readily sellable non-profit bodies’ a sse ts would be limited. On the other hand, there is a potential tax base risk related to the ability for GST-registered purchasers to claim second­ hand goods deductions if the goods were not subject to GST. A revenue loss could also arise if a non-profit body deregisters for GST purposes. Further revenue losses could arise with insurance pay-outs if the a sse t in question would previously have been assum ed to be part of the non-profit body’s taxable activity. GST previously returned by non-profit bodies on an a sse t’s sale or equivalent event may also need to be refunded under the new interpretation of a non-profit body’s “taxable activity”. Inland Revenue is aware of one non-profit body that will be receiving a large GST refund because of the new interpretation of “taxable activity”. The concern is that once this refund has been received, other non-profit bodies will also apply for significant GST refunds. The magnitude of the revenue risk arising from the recent interpretation of a non-profit body’s “taxable activity” cannot be accurately estimated. However, based on data from the Department of Internal Affairs (DIA), the value of current and non-current a sse ts held by DIA- registered charities (including large organisations such as universities) is around $55 billion. This suggests that the revenue risk arising from the new interpretation is potentially very high. Impact Statement Template | 6 The need for a quick response to this issue m eans the broader concessionary GST treatment of non-profit bodies has not been reviewed. The concessionary GST treatment of non-profit bodies may still be reviewed at a later stage. 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? 2.5 What do stakeholders think?

Impact Statement Template | 14 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? The proposal will require amendm ent to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. These am endm ents will be drafted following the proposed consultation and will be added to the next omnibus tax bill a s a supplementary order paper. The proposed option will apply retrospectively from the date of the Minister of Revenue’s announcement of the changes. Between the date of the Minister’s announcement and the changes receiving the Royal assent, the status quo will apply. However, where taxpayers seek to obtain refunds during this transitional period, which must be repaid once the changes receive the Royal assent, the Commissioner may determine resources should not be applied to such reassessm ents consistent with her wider care and management obligations. Inland Revenue will m anage the situation with taxpayers to minimise the occurrence of taxpayers receiving refunds that they will then need to pay back to Inland Revenue once the changes receive the Royal assent. Inland Revenue will be responsible for administering the changes once they are introduced. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? The main implementation risk concerns how to manage the period between the date of the Minister of R evenue’s announcem ent and the date of the Royal assent. It is expected that few non-profit bodies would apply for refunds they are entitled to under the status quo as they would know they would be required to pay any refund they receive back once the changes receive the Royal assent. Inland Revenue will also work with non-profit bodies and their tax agents to manage this transitional period. The proposed consultation following the Minister of Revenue’s announcement will also help to address any other implementation risks that may be raised by stakeholders. Impact Statement Template | 15 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue will monitor the outcomes pursuant to the Generic Tax Policy Process ("GTTP") to confirm that they match the policy objectives. The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. We do not expect extensive monitoring to be necessary as the proposed option is merely confirming what was until recently an understanding of the law held by many. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? Post-implementation review is expected to occur around 12 months after implementation. If the post-implementation review identifies any need for remedial action it would be recommended for addition to the Government's tax policy work programme and could potentially be included in future taxation bills.

August 2018 A special report from Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue Administrative measures DEFINITION OF LARGE MULTINATIONAL GROUP Section YA 1 The new legislation introduces the term “large multinational group”, which is relevant as Inland Revenue’s increased powers to assess tax or collect information only apply to members of large multinational groups. Background The rules in the new legislation that increase Inland Revenue’s powers to assess tax or collect information are limited so they only apply to members of large multinational groups. These rules are: • The permanent establishment anti-avoidance rule in new section GB 54 of the Income Tax Act 2007 which can only be applied to members of large multinational groups. • New section HD 30 which allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to collect tax that is owed by a non-resident member of a large multinational group from a wholly- owned group member who is a New Zealand resident or that has a permanent establishment in New Zealand. • New section 17(1CB) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 extends the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s powers to request information so they also apply to information or documents relevant to the taxation of the large multinational group and that is held by any member of that large multinational group, including group members who are outside New Zealand. • New section 21BA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 can be used to apply consequences to a member of a large multinational group that fails to provide an adequate response to a section 17 request for information or documents within a reasonable timeframe. These consequences enable the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to make a tax assessment based on the information she has available and to prevent information that was requested, but not provided to the Commissioner, from being admitted as evidence in a dispute or court proceeding. • New section 139AB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides the abilit y for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to apply a civil penalty of up to $100,000 on a member of a large multinational group that does not co-operate with requests for information. 1 • Large multinational groups whose ultimate owner is a New Zealand resident parent entity are required to file a country-by-country report with Inland Revenue under new section 78G of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Key features A large multinational group is defined in section YA 1 as a consolidated accounting group that has annual consolidated group revenue for the preceding income year or period prior to the relevant income year of more than EUR €750m (which is the exemption threshold described in paragraph 5.52 of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines). This EUR €750m revenue threshold was agreed by the OECD as a way to define the large multinational groups that are required to file Country-by-Country reports with relevant tax authorities. Example M is a multinational group which has a member which is resident in New Zealand. M’s consolidated accounts reported revenues of US $1.8b for the year ending 31 December 2018. Because these revenues are more than EUR €750m on 31 December 2018, for M’s next income year beginning 1 January 2019, M will satisfy the definition of a large multinational group. To qualify as a large multinational group, the group must also have a member resident in New Zealand or income with a source in New Zealand and a member who is resident in a country or territory other than New Zealand. There is no requirement that the group members be companies, so the revenues for consolidated group could include revenues that are earned through partnerships or trusts. REQUESTING INFORMATION FROM LARGE MULTINATIONAL GROUPS Sections 17(1CB), 21BA, 139AB and 142GB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 The new legislation amends the Tax Administration Act 1994 to provide the Commissioner of Inland Revenue with additional powers to request information from large multinational groups in order to assist a tax investigat ion of the relevant mult inational. Background To combat BEPS, Inland Revenue needs to be able to properly investigate complex tax positions taken by multinationals. One of the main practical difficulties that Inland Revenue has encountered in conducting these investigations is a lack of willingness by some multinationals to provide information. The information required in an investigation can include legal contracts and evidence about commercial and economic activities carried on by offshore entities. This information is often held by an offshore group member of the multinational, rather than in a New Zealand company or office. For example, it is common for multinationals to prepare and retain transfer 2 pricing documentation within a specialist transfer pricing unit in their head office in another jurisdiction. As the OECD notes in paragraph 5.15 of chapter V of their Transfer Pricing Guidelines: “It may often be the case that the documents and other information required for a transfer pricing audit will be in the possession of members of the MNE group other than the local affiliate under examination. Often the necessary documents will be located outside the country whose tax administration is conducting the audit. It is therefore important that the tax administration is able to obtain directly or through information sharing, such as exchange of information mechanisms, information that extends beyond the country’s borders.” In addition to transfer pricing, Inland Revenue needs to access offshore information to apply other international tax rules. These include the permanent establishment rules which determine whether New Zealand can tax the business profits of a non-resident company (and if so, how much of that profit New Zealand can tax), and the general anti-avoidance rule, which may be used to challenge cross-border tax avoidance. Key features The new rules in relation to requesting information only apply to members of large multinational groups. A large multinational group is defined in section YA 1 as a consolidated accounting group that has annual consolidated group revenue exceeding EUR €750m for the preceding income year or period prior to the relevant income year. The group must also have a member resident in New Zealand or income with a source in New Zealand and a member who is resident in a country or territory other than New Zealand. The Commissioner has a power under section 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to request specific information or documents from a person as part of a tax investigation. This person would typically be resident of New Zealand or have a physical presence such as an office in New Zealand. New section 17(1CB) expands the scope of the existing section 17 power by allowing it to also be used to request information or documents that are held by any member of a large multinational group. This includes members that are non-residents, such as a parent or a sister company. The information must be relevant to the taxation of the large multinational group, as opposed to an investigation concerning the tax position of someone who is outside the group such as a customer. For multinational tax investigations the relevant information sought will typically be about companies rather than natural persons. In some cases customer information may be relevant to the taxation of the large multinational group. For example, a contract with a customer may be relevant to applying the transfer pricing rules to determine whether a related party arrangement has arm’s length conditions and an arm’s length amount of consideration. New section 21BA is designed to bolster Inland Revenue’s ability to require multinationals to comply with a request for information under section 17 by setting out some specific consequences that can be applied if the multinational fails to provide an adequate response 3 within a reasonable timeframe. These consequences enable the Commissioner to make a tax assessment based on the information she has available and to prevent information that was requested, but not provided to the Commissioner, from being admitted as evidence in a dispute or court proceeding. New section 139AB provides the ability for Inland Revenue to apply a civil penalty of up to $100,000 on large multinational groups which do not co-operate with requests for information. Application date The amendments to insert new sections 17(1CB), 21BA, 139AB and 142GB into the Tax Administration Act 1994 apply from 27 June 2018, which is the date that the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act 2018 was enacted. This means that these new administrative powers and penalties can be used by Inland Revenue after 27 June 2018 when pursuing current or new investigations, even if those investigations include income years prior to the date of enact ment. Detailed analysis Section 17(1CB): Allowing Inland Revenue to request information held by non-resident members of large multinational groups New section 17(1CB) allows the Commissioner to apply section 17(1) to request information or documents that are in the knowledge, possession, or control of a member of a large multinational group, including members that are non-resident. The requested information must be relevant to the taxation of the large multinational group, as opposed to an investigation concerning the tax position of someone who is outside the group such as a customer. For multinational tax investigations the relevant information sought will typically be about companies rather than natural persons. In some cases customer information may be relevant to the taxation of the large multinational group. For example, a contract with a customer may be relevant to applying the transfer pricing rules to determine whether a related party arrangement has arm’s length conditions and an arm’s length amount of consideration. Although section 17(1CB) can be used to request information from any member of the large multinational group, in practice, it is anticipated that the Commissioner would request the information from the group member who is resident or potentially subject to tax in New Zealand. In some cases that group member may already hold or be able to access (for example, through a shared internal document system) the information themselves. If the group member does not hold or have access to the information themselves, they will need to source the required information from other members of their group and then pass on the requested information to the Commissioner. For example, the Commissioner could ask a New Zealand subsidiary of a mult inat ional corporation to provide transfer pricing documentation that was held by their offshore parent. The New Zealand subsidiary would ask their parent to provide this documentation to them, and they would then supply it to the Commissioner. 4 Inland Revenue understands that large multinational groups typically have processes whereby information requests from tax authorities are escalated and approved by their head office (this can include cases where the relevant information is already held in New Zealand). The head office will have the authority to require the other group members to provide the information. Further information about Inland Revenue’s operational procedures for issuing notices under section 17 is available in Operational Statement OS 13/02 1 which outlines the procedures. Although this Operational Statement has not been updated to reflect the new section 17(1CB) the intention of section 17(1CB) is simply to expand the scope of Inland Revenue’s existing section 17 power so it also applies to information held by any member of a large multinational group. The existing operational procedures include: • Where information is to be demanded under section 17, a notice will be issued in writing. Generally a section 17 notice will only be issued following a failure to provide information previously requested or where specific issues have been identified and attempts to resolve these issues have failed. • The Commissioner will only require disclosure of information considered necessary or relevant and that is reasonably required in the circumstances of the case. The Commissioner will be reasonable in relation to the quantity of information sought and the timeframe for providing that information. Reasonable time will be allowed where there is genuine difficulty in obtaining and/or providing the information requested. Section 21BA: Consequences from failure to provide information New section 21BA is designed to bolster Inland Revenue’s ability to require multinationals to comply with a request for information under section 17 by setting out some specific consequences that can be applied if the multinational fails to provide an adequate response within a reasonable timeframe. These consequences enable the Commissioner to make a tax assessment based on the information she has available and to prevent information that was requested, but not provided to the Commissioner, from being admitted as evidence in a dispute or court proceeding. It is similar to section 21 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which can be applied to requests for information from a person claiming a deduction for a payment that the person has made to an offshore person. New section 21BA applies when all of these requirements are met: • the Commissioner has requested, under section 17, informat ion or documents fro m a large multinational group member and the information relates to the large multinational group or to a member of the large multinational group; and • that group member has failed to provide a response within three months, or has provided a misleading, incomplete or otherwise inadequate response; and • the Commissioner has provided a further notice to the group member and the member has still failed to provide a sufficient response within one month of the further notice. If these requirements are met section 21BA allows the Commissioner to impose the following consequences on the large multinational group: 1 https://www.ird.govt.nz/technical-tax/op-statements/os-1302-sec-17-notices.html 5 • The Commissioner may rely on information that she holds to make a tax assessment of the group member or another member of the large multinational group and to apply any relevant criminal or civil penalties to the large multinational group. Any resulting assessment should be soundly based on the law and the information that is available to the Commissioner. • If the large multinational group disputes the assessment or penalties the requested information will not be allowed as evidence in the dispute in a court proceeding (unless a court or authority determines that the information request was unreasonable and admitting the evidence is necessary to avoid manifest injustice). Subsection 21BA(1) outlines the scenarios where section 21BA can be applied. Subparagraph (a) deals with the case where no response is provided within three months. Subparagraph (b) deals with cases where a response is provided but the Commissioner considers the response to be misleading, including where relevant information has been omitted from the response. Subparagraph (c) deals with cases where the response omits the information that the Commissioner requires to check compliance with the transfer pricing rules or attributing income to a permanent establishment. Subparagraph (c) can apply regardless of whether or not the relevant information is in the knowledge, possession, or control of the member. This ensures the consequences under section 21 can still be applied where the information does not exist because the multinational group has not prepared transfer pricing documentation or has not attempted to calculate the profits attributable to a permanent establishment. In the absence of this subparagraph, multinationals would be incentivised not to prepare or retain this information. Subparagraph (d) deals with any other case where a response has been provided but the Commissioner does not consider the response fulfils the requirement of the section 17 request. Civil penalty for failure to provide the requested information New section 139AB provides the Commissioner with the ability to impose a civil penalty of up to $100,000 on large multinational groups which fail to comply with a section 17(1CB) request for information or documents. Section 17(1CB) is explained above, but for this section to apply the information or document must be relevant to the taxation of the large multinational group and be in the knowledge, possession, or control of the member or another member of the large multinational group. Like other civil penalties, the civil penalty in section 139AB is treated as an additional tax liability for the purpose of late payment penalties and the use of money interest rules. Section 142GB provides that the due date for the civil penalty is the date specified by the Commissioner in the notice of the assessment of the penalty but which must be at least 30 days after the date the notice is issued. Criminal penalties cannot typically be applied in relation to a request made in relation to information held by another member of the large multinational group under section 17(1CB). 6 The criminal penalties in section 143 and 143A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 are not modified by the new legislation. There are some existing defences which mean the criminal penalties in section 143(2) and 143A(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 do not apply when the information is not in the knowledge, possession or control of the person or a non- resident who is controlled by the person. Example As part of an investigation of transfer pricing positions taken by S Co, a New Zealand subsidiary of a large multinational group, the Commissioner asks the New Zealand subsidiary to provide certain transfer pricing documentation including the local file of S Co and certain information from the local file of H Co, a group member in Singapore which has entered into transfer pricing arrangements with S Co. S Co provides their local file but does not provide any of the requested information from the local file of H Co. On 1 August, the Commissioner provides in writing a section 17 notice to S Co to formally request certain information from the local file of H Co. S Co does not respond to the request. On 1 November (three months after the issue of the section 17 notice), the Commissioner provides a second notice to notify that if S Co does not provide the further information by 1 December (30 days after the second notice was issued) that section 21BA may be applied. S Co responds indicating it is not able to provide the requested information. The Commissioner makes an assessment of S Co based on the information available in S Co’s local file as well as other information on comparable arrangements from databases and issues a notice of proposed assessment to S Co stating that she has applied section 21BA(2) when making this assessment as she does not have access to the information requested from H Co’s local file. The assessment is for additional tax of $4m as well as a civil penalty of $100,000 under section 139G from failing to comply with the section 17 request. Because of section 21BA(3), S Co will typically be unable to use the transfer pricing documentation from H Co’s local file that was previously requested and not provided to the Commissioner to dispute the Commissioner’s assessment of S Co’s tax positions. COLLECTING UNPAID TAX FROM LARGE MULTINATIONAL GROUPS Section HD 30 Background Inland Revenue has strong powers to collect revenue from persons who are residents of New Zealand or who have a physical presence here. However, it can be difficult for Inland Revenue to collect tax from non-resident companies that have no physical presence in New Zealand, including in cases where they are a member of a large multinational group which does have a subsidiary or permanent establishment in New Zealand. Key features 7 New section HD 30 will allow Inland Revenue to collect tax owed by a non-resident member of a large multinational group from another wholly-owned group member who is a New Zealand resident or that has a permanent establishment in New Zealand. The rule does this by treating the other group member as an agent for the unpaid tax of the principal member (the non-resident) that owes the tax. The rule will only apply if the principal member (the non-resident) fails to pay the unpaid tax and if the Commissioner notifies the wholly-owned group member that they will be treated as an agent for the unpaid tax. The agent can be a non-resident who is treated as having a permanent establishment in New Zealand under the new section GB 54 (arrangements involving establishments and non- resident businesses). The agent will have the same dispute rights as the principal member. The rights of an agent are given by section 44 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and include rights of objection under section 44(3) to an assessment under section 44(2). Application date New section HD 30 applies from 27 June 2018, which is the date that the Act was enacted. This means that these new powers can be used by Inland Revenue after 27 June 2018 when pursuing current or new investigations, even if those investigations cover income years prior to the date of enactment. COUNTRY-BY-COUNTRY REPORTS Section 78G of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Background One of the OECD’s BEPS recommendations was to require large multinational groups (those with annual consolidated group revenue of EUR €750m or more in the previous financial year) to provide a Country-by-Country report which contains certain high-level information on the groups’ global activities to tax authorities who would then exchange this information with each other. The following aggregate information will need to be collected for 2016 and subsequent years for each jurisdiction in which the impacted groups operate: • gross revenues (broken down into related party and unrelated party categories); • profit (loss) before income tax; • income tax paid (on cash basis); • income tax accrued (current year); • stated capital; 8 • accumulated earnings; • number of employees; and • tangible assets other than cash and cash equivalents. In addition, impacted groups will need to list all of their entities that are resident in each jurisdiction, noting also the main business activity of each entity. This information will assist tax authorities in providing them with a starting point for assessing risk and potentially requesting more detailed information that could be used to investigate a multinational’s tax posit ion. Inland Revenue requires New Zealand headquartered multinational groups with annual consolidated group revenue of EUR €750m or more in the previous financial year to file a Country-by-Country report for all income years beginning on or after 1 January 2016. This requirement currently applies to about 20 multinational groups, who have been notified by Inland Revenue. A specific legislative provision to require multinationals to file Country-by-Country reports is not strictly necessary as Inland Revenue is already able to use section 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to enforce these requirements. A specific provision is useful because it will provide a more explicit signal to the affected multinationals and other countries of New Zealand’s commitment to Country-by-Country reporting. For example, accounting firms produce information about each country’s relevant reporting requirements and they may not realise New Zealand is requiring Country-by-Country reports to be prepared and filed if they are not mentioned in our relevant tax legislation. Section 17 allows the Commissioner to request a taxpayer to provide specific information. Application date Section 78G applies from 27 June 2018, which is the date that the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act 2018 entered into force. For the periods from 1 January 2016 to 27 June 2018, Inland Revenue will continue to use the existing requirement in section 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to require the affected New Zealand headquartered multinational groups to provide Country-by-Country reports. Detailed analysis New section 78G applies to large multinational groups with an ultimate owner who is a resident of New Zealand. A large multinational group is defined in section YA 1 as a consolidated accounting group that has annual consolidated group revenue of more than EUR €750m (which is the exemption threshold described in paragraph 5.52 of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines). This EUR €750m revenue threshold was agreed by the OECD as a way to define the large multinational groups that are required to file Country-by-Country reports with relevant tax authorities. 9 The revenue threshold is measured using the consolidated accounts for the preceding income year or period prior to the relevant income year. Example X Co is a resident of New Zealand and is the parent company of a multinational group. X Co’s consolidated accounts reported revenues of NZ $1.2b, which exceeds EUR €750m for the year ending July 2018. For their next income year ending July 2019, X Co will be required to file a Country-by-Country report with Inland Revenue. In the income year ending July 2019 X Co’s consolidated accounts has reported revenues of NZ $1.1b, which for that year is less than EUR €750m. For their next income year ending July 2020, X Co will not be required to file a Country-by-Country report. To be a “large multinational group” under section YA 1 of New Zealand’s legislation, the group must also have a member resident in New Zealand or income with a source in New Zealand and a member who is resident in a country or territory other than New Zealand. Unlike some other provisions in Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Act 2018) which apply to all large multinational groups (as defined in section YA 1), the Country- by-Country reporting requirement in section 78G of the Tax Administration Act 1994 only applies to large multinational groups whose ultimate owner is a resident of New Zealand (approximately 20 groups). The “ultimate owner” is the parent entity that is required to prepare consolidated accounts that includes their subsidiaries (these consolidated accounts will include consolidated amounts from the other group members) and for which there is no other entity that owns directly or indirectly a controlling interest in the parent whereby that other entity would be required to prepare consolidated accounts that include the parent entity. New Zealand’s financial reporting requirements currently require large entities (including companies, partnerships and limited partnerships) to prepare accounts regardless of whether the entity is listed on a stock exchange. For these preparation requirements “large” is defined in the Financial Reporting Act 2013 as entities that earn over NZ$30m of consolidated revenues (which is smaller than EUR €750m) or that have over NZ$60m of consolidated assets in the previous two years. New Zealand is a relatively small jurisdiction which allows Inland Revenue to readily identify any large organisation headquartered here that should be subject to Country-by-Country reporting requirements. In the very unlikely event that such an organisation did not prepare consolidated financial statements, Inland Revenue would use section 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to specifically request this information. 10 Example Y Co is a resident of New Zealand and is a member of a large multinational group. However, Y Co is a subsidiary of Z Co which is a resident of Australia. Z Co is the parent company of the multinational group. Y Co will not be required to file a country-by-country report in New Zealand, but Z Co is required to file a Country-by-Country report with the Australian Tax Office in Australia. Inland Revenue will receive Z Co’s Country-by-Country report information when these reports are exchanged under the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on the Exchange of Country-by-Country Reports. Large multinational groups with an ultimate owner that is a resident of New Zealand are required to disclose a Country-by-Country report to the Commissioner that includes: • The information described in annex III of chapter V of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines. This annex includes the OECD template for the Country-by-Country report. • Other information as may be required by the Commissioner. This provides flexibility for future changes to the Country-by-Country report or any additional information that the Commissio ner may require. The OECD transfer pricing guidelines include a template for the Country-by-Country report and instructions and definitions for the compiling the information in the template in annex III of chapter V of the guidelines. The deadline for filing a Country-by-Country report is within the 12 months after the 12 month period to which the information in the report relates. For example, a Country-by-Country report relating to 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019 would need to be filed with Inland Revenue on or before 31 December 2020. Inland Revenue would then exchange this report with other countries by July 2021. 11
August 2018 A special report from Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue Hybrid and branch mismatch rules Sections FH 1 to FH 15, EX 44(2), EX 46(6)(e), EX 46 (10)(db), EX 47B, EX 52(14C), EX 53(16C), RF 2C, FE 6(2), FE 66(3)(a), FE 6(3)(aba), FE 15(1)(a), BH 1(4) and RF 11C of the Income Tax Act 2007 Hybrid and branch mismatch arrangements are cross-border arrangements that exploit differences in the tax treatment of an instrument, entity or branch under the laws of two or more countries to eliminate, defer or reduce income tax. This is often referred to as double non-taxation. The OECD as part of Action 2 of its BEPS Action Plan has made a number of recommendations for domestic law changes to help countries neutralise the tax advantages from hybrid and branch mismatches. These recommendations have been picked up (or are being picked) by a number of countries including the United Kingdom, Australia, the members of the European Union and (to a more limited extent) the United States. Subpart FH of the Income Tax Act 2007 enacts the core aspects of the OECD recommendations with suitable modification for the New Zealand context. There are consequential amendments to other tax regimes including the FIF (foreign investment fund), NRWT (non-resident withholding tax) and thin capitalisat ion rules. Background Hybrid and branch mismatch arrangements exploit the different ways that countries treat financial instruments (hybrid instruments) and entities (hybrid entities and branches) to create tax advantages. Take the simple example of a hybrid financial instrument issued by a subsidiary to its parent company (resident in another country) that makes a quarterly coupon payment. The instrument is treated as debt by the subsidiary and the coupons result in deductible interest. The instrument is treated as equity by the parent and the coupons are treated as non-assessable dividend income. The hybrid financial instrument results in double non-taxation as there is a deduction in the subsidiary country for an amount that is not taxed in the parent country. Double non-taxation of this kind is difficult to deal with because it arises even though both countries’ tax rules are being complied wit h. However, causes distortions in investment patterns, results in an unintended reduction in aggregate tax revenues, and generally gives multinationals an unfair competitive advantage over local businesses. 1 To counter such double non-taxation, the OECD made a number of recommendations to address hybrid and branch mismatches through the release of two reports in 2015 and 2017. 1 The recommendations comprise two kinds of rules. The first kind are rules to reduce the likelihood of such mismatches arising. For example, the OECD recommended that countries include a rule so that a foreign dividend exemption in the payee country is not available to the extent the dividend payment is deductible to the payer. New Zealand already has such a rule in section CW 9. The second kind are “linking rules” which apply where the mismatch has not been prevented by other do mest ic rules. The linking rules effectively adjust the tax outcomes under a hybrid or branch mismatch in one country in order to align them with the tax outcomes in the other country. Consistent with the approach adopted by several countries around the world, New Zealand has chosen to adopt the OECD recommendations in a comprehensive manner wit h suitable modification for the New Zealand context. The linking rules are introduced through subpart FH and there are consequential amendments to other tax regimes as well, including the FIF, NRWT and thin capitalisat ion rules. While the new rules are relatively complex, it is important to bear in mind that they will have no impact for the vast majority of taxpayers. Their impact will be limited to taxpayers that are currently benefitting from tax arbitrage because of hybrid or branch mismatches. Key features Subpart FH includes rules to address the hybrid and branch mismatches arising from the following: • hybrid financial instruments (sections FH 3 and 4); • disregarded hybrid payments and deemed branch payments (sections FH 5 and 6); • reverse hybrids and branch payee mismatches (section FH 7); • deductible hybrid and branch payments resulting in double deductions (sections FH 8 and 9); • dual resident payers (section FH 10); and • imported mismatches (section FH 11). Where there are two or more parties to a mismatch, the rules generally only apply if there is some degree of association between the parties to the arrangement, or if the arrangement has been structured to achieve a mismatch. Subpart FH provides some ways for taxpayers to simplify the application of the hybrid and branch mismatch rules to their arrangements. In particular, in respect of: 1 Neutralising the Effects of Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements, Action 2: Inclusive Framework on BEPS (2015) and Neutralising the Effects of Branch Mismatch Arrangements, Action 2: Inclusive Framework on BEPS (2017). 2 • inbound hybrid financial instruments, the taxpayer may elect to treat the instrument as a share for New Zealand income tax purposes (section FH 13); and • wholly-owned outbound foreign hybrid entities existing on 6 December 2017 (the date the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill was introduced), the taxpayer may irrevocably elect to treat the entity as a company for New Zealand income tax purposes (section FH 14). The introduction of the linking rules in subpart FH of the Act has flow on implications for other New Zealand tax regimes, including the FIF, NRWT and thin capitalisation rules. Application dates The majorit y o f the hybrid and branch mismatch rules apply for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. There are two exceptions to this application date. The first exception is in respect of the financial instrument rule in sections FH 3 and FH 4 for banking or insurance regulatory capital instruments issued on or before 6 September 2016 (the date the Government discussion document on Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements was released). This regulatory capital has been grand-parented until the first date on which the person has an unconditional right to call or otherwise cancel the financial instrument without penalty. The second exception is in respect of the imported mismatch rule in section FH 11 for non- structured imported mismatches. For payments under non-structured imported mismatches, the rule will apply for income years beginning on or after 1 January 2020. 3 CORE PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS Sections FH 1 and FH 2 The hybrid and branch mismatch rules introduce a number of new concepts to tax legislation. This section of the special report highlights a number of the key concepts and principles before considering the specific hybrid and branch mismatch rules introduced in subpart FH and the consequential amendments from those rules. For simplicity, the rules will generally be referred to interchangeably as the “hybrid and branch mismatch rules” and the “hybrid rules” in this special report. This is consistent with the definition of “hybrid mismatch legislation” in section FH 15 which covers both the hybrid and branch mismatch rules. OECD hybrid and branch mismatch reports The OECD as part of Action 2 of its BEPS Action Plan has made a number of recommendations to help countries change their domestic law so as to neutralise the tax advantages from hybrid and branch mismatches through two reports issued in 2015 and 2017. 2 The hybrid mismatch report outlined comprehensive recommendations to deal with hybrid mismatch arrangements in October 2015. This report considered mismatches that are the result of differences in the tax treatment or characterisation of an instrument or entity. While some of the hybrid mismatches identified in the report involved branches, it did not directly consider similar issues that can arise through the use of branch structures. The branch mismatch report considering these issues was issued in 2017. The report considered mismatches that arise as a result of differences in the allocation of income and expenditure between a branch and head office, including situations where the branch country does not treat the taxpayer as having a taxable presence in that country. The hybrid and branch mismatch rules introduced in subpart FH closely fo llo w the OECD recommendations with suitable modification for the New Zealand context. While the terminology used in the OECD hybrid and branch reports and the legislation is not necessarily the same, the intent is broadly similar and some of the examples in the special report have been adapted from the OECD reports. Therefore, in addition to the guidance in this special report, the OECD hybrid and branch mismatch reports may generally be used as interpretive aids for the hybrid and branch mismatch rules. Hybrid and branch mismatch arrangements Hybrid and branch mismatch arrangements are cross-border arrangements that exploit differences in the tax treatment of an instrument, entity or branch under the laws of two or 2 Neutralising the Effects of Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements, Action 2: Inclusive Framework on BEPS (2015) and Neutralising the Effects of Branch Mismatch Arrangements, Action 2: Inclusive Framework on BEPS (2017). 4 more countries to defer or reduce income tax. This can result in double non-taxat ion, including long term tax deferral. D/NI and DD mismatches There are two broad types of hybrid and branch mismatch arrangements addressed in the OECD hybrid and branch mismatch reports: deduction/non-inclusion (D/NI) arrangements and double deduction (DD) arrangements. D/NI mismatch arrangements occur when a payment results in a deduction in one country with no corresponding income taxed in the recipient country, if that outcome is the result of the different tax treatment of an instrument, entity or branch. DD mismatch arrangements occur when a taxpayer is ent itled to a deduction in two countries for the same payment. D/NI and DD hybrid and branch mismatches can arise in several ways involving financial instruments, hybrid entities or branches. The OECD identified a number of ways in which the mismatches can arise and developed recommendations to neutralise the tax advantages they can provide in the reports noted above. These ways include mismatches that arise through the use of hybrid financial instruments, disregarded hybrid payments, structures producing double deductions, reverse hybrids, dual resident entities, imported mismatches, and deemed branch payments and payee mismatches. Each of these hybrid or branch mismatch arrangements is covered by the rules in subpart FH and discussed in detail later in the special report. OECD recommendations The OECD recommended two kinds of rules to address hybrid and branch mismatches. The first kind are rules to reduce the likelihood of such mismatches arising. For example, the OECD recommended that jurisdict ions include a rule so that a foreign dividend exemption in the payee country is not available to the extent the dividend payment is deductible to the payer. New Zealand already has a rule to cover this circumstance in section CW 9. The second are “linking rules” which apply where the mismatch has not been prevented by any other domestic rules. The linking rules effectively adjust the tax outcomes under a hybrid or branch mismatch in one country in order to align them with the tax outcomes in the other country. Since both countries may have a provision to adjust the tax outcomes under a particular hybrid or branch mismatch arrangement, in a number of cases, there is an order of application through “primary” and “defensive” rules. This ensures that, in situat ions where both countries have implemented hybrid and branch mismatch rules that would counter a particular arrangement, only one country will counter the mismatch. The primary rule is broadly that the payer country should deny a deduction to the extent it is: • not included in the taxable income of the recipient country (for a D/NI mismatch); and • claimed with respect to expenditure of a resident that is also deductible in another country (for a DD mismatch). If the primary rule is not applied because the payer country has not implemented the hybrid and branch mismatch rules, then the defensive rule can apply: 5 • requiring the deductible payment to be included in taxable income of the recipient (for a D/NI mismatch); or • denying the deduction in the country where the payment is made (for a DD mismatch). Table 1 summarises how the OECD recommendations have been implemented into domestic law. The recommendations are numbered in accordance with the OECD hybrid mismatch report with the corresponding branch mismatch recommendation (if any) showed separately alongside the hybrid recommendations. Restructuring considerations The intended outcome of the introduction of hybrid and branch mismatch rules is that less hybrid and branch mismatch arrangements will be used by taxpayers. Generally, if a taxpayer chooses an ordinary arrangement or structure over one that exploits a mismatch the tax advantage will be removed. Even if this does not result in additional tax revenue for the New Zealand Government, this is a desirable outcome. Taxpayers should be able to restructure out of hybrid and branch mismatch arrangements into ordinary structures without attracting tax avo idance risks. Take the example of a foreign company (resident in a country without hybrid rules) that funds a New Zealand subsidiary company with the use of a hybrid financial instrument. Interest paid by the New Zealand subsidiary under the instrument would be subject to deduction denial under section FH 3 of the hybrid rules (see below for discussion of this rule). The foreign company decides to refinance its New Zealand investment in response to the introduction of New Zealand hybrid rules. The replacement financing might be an ordinary debt arrangement under which the New Zealand subsidiary would pay interest not subject to deduction denial under FH 3, and taxable in the foreign country. This type of refinancing should not be considered tax avoidance despite the possibility that a valid deduction could have replaced a denied deduction, thereby reducing New Zealand taxable income. Similarly, a foreign company that owns a hybrid entity in New Zealand (such as an unlimited liability company) may wish to restructure its New Zealand operations in response to the introduction of New Zealand hybrid rules. A replacement structure may be a limited liability company with expenditure that is not subject to deduction denial under sections FH 5 and FH 9 (see below for discussion of these rules). This type of restructure should not be considered tax avoidance even if denied deductions of a hybrid entity in New Zealand would be replaced by valid deductions that are not part of a hybrid mismatch arrangement. 6 Table 1: New Zealand’s implementation of the OECD recommendations Linking rule recommendations Section Rec.

There are four key definitions that determine whether the rules potentially apply: “act together”, “control group”, “related” and “structured arrangement”. We discuss these terms individually in the following section on key definit io ns. Ordering of the linking rules Hybrid and branch mismatch arrangements can arise in several ways and, it is possible, that more than one of the hybrid mismatch rules in subpart FH may apply to a taxpayer. Section FH 2 outlines the order in which the hybrid mismatch rules in sections FH 3 to FH 11 should be applied by a taxpayer. Subsection FH 2(1) outlines the order of the application of the sections that disallow deduction. These are set out in table 2. Table 2: The order for applying the rules that disallow deduction Order Section Rule 1 FH 3 Hybrid financial instrument mismatch – primary rule 2 FH 5 Disregarded hybrid payment mismatch – primary rule 3 FH 7 Payments made to a reverse hybrid 4 FH 11 Imported mismatch 5 FH 8 Deductible payment made by a hybrid entity mismatch – primary rule 6 FH 9 Deductible payment made by a hybrid entity mismatch – defensive rule 7 FH 10 Deductible payment made by dual resident payer mismatch Subsection FH 2(2) outlines the order of the application of the sections that treat receipts as assessable income. These are set out in table 3. Table 3: The order for applying the rules that treat receipts as assessable income Order Section Rule 1 FH 4 Hybrid financial instrument mismatch – defensive rule 2 FH 6 Disregarded hybrid payment mismatch – defensive rule Elections Sections FH 13 and FH 14 provide that, in some circumstances, taxpayers may opt out of the potential application of the hybrid and branch mismatch rules to some of their arrangements. In particular: • For inbound hybrid financial instruments, the taxpayer may elect to treat the instrument as a share for New Zealand income tax purposes (section FH 13); and 8 • For a foreign hybrid entity 3 wholly-owned by a person on 6 December 2017 (the date of the introduction of the Bill), the owner may irrevocably elect to treat the entity as a company for New Zealand income tax purposes (section FH 14). This election must be made by the time the owner files their tax return for the first year in which the hybrid rules apply to the owner. 3 A foreign hybrid entity is one that is fiscally transparent for New Zealand tax purposes and fiscally opaque for the purposes of the foreign country in which it is formed. 9 KEY DEFINITIONS Section FH 15 The hybrid and branch mismatch rules introduce a number of new concepts to the New Zealand tax lexicon. We outline the key definitions that apply broadly across the rules below. Financial instrument, hybrid entities and deducting branches Financial instrument “Financial instrument” is defined in section FH 15. It is relevant for sections FH 3 and FH 4 (and the borrower election to treat a hybrid financial instrument as a share in section FH 13. The definit ion is intended to encompass all forms of debt and equity. It builds on the existing financial arrangement definition, which is deliberately very broad. There are then a number of additions including for: • shares; this inclusion may be of less significance given the deductible foreign equity dividend exclusion in section CW 9, but it would be odd to leave shares out of the definit ion; • annuities: which are excluded from the financial arrangement rules only because they are taxed under their own regime; • farm-out arrangements; • share lending arrangements: share repurchase agreements (share repos), and share lending arrangements which do not meet the statutory definition of a share lending arrangement in section YA 1, are financial arrangements. Share lending arrangements which do meet the statutory definition are excluded from the financial arrangement definition, but should be included as “financial instruments” for the purposes of the hybrid and branch mismatch rules, as they may be hybrid financial transfers, subject to either sections FH 3 or FH 4; and • loans in New Zealand currency described in section EW 5(10): these are interest-free, repayable on demand loans that are excluded from the financial arrangement definitio n for the lender. Hybrid entity No entity is inherently a hybrid entity. Hybridity exists only as a result of the inconsistent tax classification of the entity by two countries’ tax systems. This is reflected in the definition of a “hybrid entity” in section FH 15 which provides that it means a person or other entity that is recognised as a person subject to tax (that is, is taxed like a company) in a country that treats it as a tax resident, and not recognised as a person that is subject to tax (that is, is taxed like a partnership or a branch) in another country. For example, a limited partnership may be taxed as a resident entity in the country in which it was incorporated, but taxed as a disregarded (or flow-through) entity in a partner (investor) country. The hybrid ent it y definit io n is relevant for sections FH 8 and FH 9 (primary and defensive rules applying to payments resulting in double deductions) to help to define when those rules 10 apply, and section FH 14 to define the kind of entity in respect of which an opaque election can be made. The term is also used in sections FH 6 (defensive rule for disregarded hybrid payments mismatches) and FH 12 (which is concerned with surplus assessable income). Although the term is not used in sections FH 5 and FH 6, those sections will often apply to payments made by hybrid entities. Deducting branch “Deducting branch” is defined in section FH 15. It is relevant for sections FH 5 and 6 (primary and defensive rules for disregarded hybrid payment mismatches), sections FH 8 and 9 (primary and defensive rules applying to payments resulting in double deductions) and section FH 11 (imported mismatches). A deducting branch is a branch, permanent establishment or other activity of a person in a country or territory where the expenditure or loss attributed by the person to the branch is deductible (or gives rise to other tax relief) in that country or territory against income of the person. This includes a deemed permanent establishment under the new rules in respect of permanent establishments. Control groups, related parties and structured arrangements The hybrid and branch mismatch rules generally apply when the mismatch is between related parties (broadly twenty five percent common ownership) or control groups (broadly fift y percent common ownership), or the mismatch arises from a payment under a structured arrangement. These terms are defined in section FH 15. Related The definit ion of “related” is important for sections FH 3 and FH 4 (primary and defensive rules applying to hybrid financial instrument mismatches). It is also relevant to section FH 8 (primary rule applying to payments resulting in double deductions). The definit io n of related is closely based on the associated person definitions in subpart YB, except that: • for two companies, it imposes a twent y five percent common ownership test (rather than a fift y percent common ownership test); • it applies the same twent y five percent rule to a general partnership as for a limited partnership (which means that a partner in a general partnership is not automatically ‘related’ to that partnership as would be the case for the “associated persons” definit ion); and • there is a common control test, which also aggregates interests of persons who act together, as defined in section FH 15. Control group Many of the hybrid and branch mismatch provisions only apply to payments between members of a control group (unless there is a structured arrangement). The “control group” definit ion in section FH 15 is generally intended to include persons who are commonly controlled or meet a fift y percent common ownership threshold. 11 For companies and partnerships (whether formed under New Zealand or foreign law) these tests are well established for other purposes, and the definition used in the hybrid and branch mismatch rules incorporates these other definitions. For trusts, it is more difficult to determine ownership (whether by reason of control or economic interests), and accordingly the legislation uses the same tests that apply to determine whether or not parties are associated in sections YB 5 to 11. In addit ion, the meaning of control group has been defined to include: • members that are consolidated for accounting purposes and/or prepare group financial statements; and • a common control test, which aggregates the interests of persons who act together, as defined in section FH 15. Act together The “act together” definition is relevant for determining whether two persons are in a control group or are related persons by virtue of paragraphs (g) or (h) of the control group and related definit ions. Paragraphs (g) and (h) include two persons in a control group if one effectively controls the other or the same group of persons effectively controls both. In both cases, interests held by persons who are related or who act together are aggregated. The intent of the acting together test is to: • prevent taxpayers from avoiding the related party or control group tests by transferring their rights or interests to another person that continues to act under their direction in respect of those interests; and • target taxpayers who individually hold minority stakes in an entity, but enter into arrangements that would allow them to act together (or under the direction of a single controlling mind) to enter into hybrid mismatch arrangements in respect of one or more of them. The definition of “act together” is highly fact dependent. For instance, two persons will act together if one typically acts in accordance with the wishes of the other, or if their actions are typically controlled by a third person. There are a number of limbs that determine whether two parties are acting together. The definition is met where two persons (the holders) each have voting rights or equity interests in a person or other entity and at least one of the criteria below are met: • the holders are associated under section YB 4 (two relatives); • a holder typically acts in the way preferred by the other holder because of the other holder’s preferences; • the holders have entered into an arrangement that has an effect on the value or control of the rights or interests that is more than incidental and does not arise from a restriction on the sale of the rights or interests; 12 • the actions of the holder are controlled or expected to be controlled, whether that be legally or typically, by a third person or group of persons (the co-ordinator); • the holders and a co-ordinator enter an arrangement affecting the ownership or control of the rights and interests and having an effect on the value or control of the rights and interests that is more than incidental; or • the holders agree with a co-ordinator that the co-ordinator can act on behalf of the holders in relation to the rights and interests. Subsection FH 15(2) provides an exclusion from the “act together” definition for the last three limbs above where the co-ordinator manages two investment funds that hold voting rights or equit y interests in the same person or entity, but the two funds do not act together in relation to their rights and interests. We comment on these limbs below. Relatives Limb (a) of the definition focuses on natural persons and deems a person to hold any voting rights or equity interests that are held by members of that person’s family as determined under section YB 4 (Relatives). Typically acts in the way preferred by the other holder Under limb (b) of the definition, a person will be treated as acting in the way preferred by another holder where the person is legally bound to act in accordance with the other holder’s instructions or if it can be established that the person is expected to act, or typically acts, in accordance with the other holder’s instructions. The focus of the test is on the actions of that person in relation to the voting rights or equity interests. The test is not intended to treat as acting together two or more shareholders that typically vote in a similar way to each other, but make their decisions independently and without reference to each other. It is intended to apply where a holder typically acts in a way preferred by another holder because it is preferred by the other holder. Entered into an arrangement that has a more than incidental effect on the value or control of the rights and interests Under limb (c) of the definition, a person will be treated as holding the equity or voting interests of another person if they have an entered into an arrangement that has an effect on the value or control of the rights or interests that is more than incidental. The test covers arrangements concerning the exercise of voting interests and/or regarding beneficial ent it lements, such as an entitlement to profits or eligibility to participate in distributions. In addit ion, it covers arrangements concerning the ownership of those rights, such as options to sell rights. The test is intended to capture arrangements that are entered into with other investors and does not cover arrangements that are simply part of the terms of the equity or voting interest concerned, or that operate solely between holder and issuer. The arrangement regarding the control of the voting rights or equity interests must have a more than incidental effect on the value of those rights or interests. The more than incidental 13 threshold means that an investor will not have their rights or interests treated as part of a common holding arrangement simply because the investor is party to a commercially standard shareholder agreement that does not have a significant impact on the ability of the investor to exercise ownership or control over their interests. Example 1: Commercially standard shareholder agreement Aardvark Co together with a number of other investors holds one hundred percent of the shares in Badger Co. Aardvark Co is the single largest shareholder holding forty percent, with the remaining 12 investors each holding five percent. The shareholders enter into a shareholders’ agreement that provides Aardvark Co with a first right of refusal on any disposal of the shares and drag-along and tag-along provisions in the event that an offer is made for a majority of the shares in Badger Co. Question Whether Aardvark Co and the other investors in Badger Co are acting together within the scope of limb (c) of the definition? Answer No (generally). The right to buy other shareholders’ shares at market value, as well as the drag along and tag along rights are relatively standard terms in a shareholders’ agreement for a company that is not widely held. These types of provisions will not generally have a material impact on the value of the holder’s equity interest and therefore should not be taken into account for the purposes of limb (c) of the acting together requirement. Example 2: Shareholders subscribe for proportional debt There are 10 investors in Crab Co with each holding ten percent of its shares. The 10 investors enter into a shareholders’ agreement to subscribe for proportional debt in Crab Co. The proportional debt is a hybrid financial instrument for some of the investors, but not all of them, depending on their tax residence. The 10 investors each voted positively for Crab Co to issue the proportional debt, but exercised their voting rights independently of each other. Question Whether the investors in Crab Co are acting together within the scope of limb (b) or (c) of the definition? Answer No (generally). If some, or (in this case) all, of the investors agree that they will fund the company pro rata in a certain way, that should not, in and of itself, mean that the investors typically act in the way preferred by the other holders because of the holder’s preference per limb (b). While the shareholders’ agreement may provide for the issue of proportional debt, it should not generally have a more than incidental impact on the value of the shares. For instance, if Crab Co issues $10m of debt, both its assets and liabilities should increase by $10m, leaving the value of its equity unchanged so limb (c) should not apply. Co-ordinator Under limbs (d) to (f) of the definition, two persons or a group of persons will be treated as acting together if their interests are managed, controlled or affected in a way that is more than merely incidental by another person or group of persons (the co-ordinator). These limbs will not apply to a co-ordinator that manages two investment funds that hold voting rights or equity interests in the same person or entity, if the two funds do not act together in relation to their rights and interests. 14 Example 3: Co-ordinator Take the facts of example 2, except that each investor invests through an investment partnership that holds one hundred percent of Crab Co. The investment partnership has a general partner that decides on the investments of the partnership. The investment partnership makes a debt investment in Crab Co. This debt is a hybrid financial instrument for some of the investors, but not all of them as they are resident in different countries. Question Whether the investors of the partnership are acting together due to the presence of a co-ordinator within the scope of limbs (d) to (f )? Answer The partners can be considered to be acting together in relation to their interest in Crab Co via their investment partnership under limb (d) of the definition as their investments are controlled by the general partner. The partners will also be acting together based on the partnership agreement if that provides for the decision-making rights of the general partner. (Note that the exception to the co-ordinator rule in FH 15(2) does not apply on these facts as there is only one relevant investment vehicle.) Structured arrangement The “structured arrangement” definition in section FH 15 is relevant throughout the hybrid and branch mismatch rules. This is because it is used to define the situations where a hybrid or branch mismatch between persons who are not related or in a control group is subject to the rules. OECD recommendation The structured arrangement definition is consistent with recommendation 10 of the OECD hybrid mismatch report. In this regard, paragraphs 318 to 319 of the report state that: “The purpose of the structured arrangement definition is to capture those taxpayers who enter into arrangements that have been designed to produce a mismatch in tax outcomes while ensuring taxpayers will not be required to make adjustments under the rule in circumstances where the taxpayer is unaware of the mismatch and derives no benefit from it. The test for whether an arrangement is structured is objective. It applies, regardless of the parties’ intentions, whenever the facts and circumstances would indicate to an objective observer that the arrangement has been designed to produce a mismatch in tax outcomes. The structured arrangement rule asks whether the mismatch has been priced into the terms of the arrangement or whether the arrangement’s design and the surrounding facts and circumstances indicate that the mismatch in tax outcomes was an intended feature of the arrangement.” These principles have been taken into account in incorporating the definition of structured arrangement into domestic legislation. Definition The definit io n of a structured arrangement can be broken into two parts. The first limb in (a) outlines two (potentially overlapping) circumstances that will be a structured arrangement. The first is where the pricing is based on the existence of a hybrid 15 mismatch. The second is where the facts or circumstances indicate that the arrangement is intended to rely on or produce a hybrid mismatch. The second limb in (b) is person-specific and reflects that a structured arrangement should only exist for a person where they (or a member of their control group) could reasonably have been expected to have been aware of the mismatch regardless of whether they benefited from it or not. This means that it is possible, albeit not necessarily co mmon, that what may be a structured arrangement to one person will not be a structured arrangement to another. We discuss these elements of the definition below. Price assumes existence of a hybrid mismatch The price of the arrangement will assume the existence of a hybrid mismatch if the mismatch has been factored into the calculation of the return under the arrangement. This test looks to the actual terms of the arrangement, as they affect the return on the arrangement, and as agreed between the parties, to determine whether the pricing of the transaction is different from what would have been agreed had the mismatch not arisen. This is a legal and factual test that looks only to the terms of the arrangement itself and the allocation of risk and return under the arrangement, rather than taking into account broader factors such as the relationship between the parties or the circumstances in which the arrangement was entered into. The test would not take into account the consideration paid by a taxpayer to acquire a hybrid financial instrument from another holder (for example, where the instrument is acquired at a premium or a discount from a third party) unless the instrument is issued and sold as part of the same arrangement. Example 4: Hybrid mismatch priced into the terms of the arrangement Dolphin Co (a company resident in Country D) and Elk Co (a company resident in Country E) are unrelated parties. Elk Co issues a bond that pays an annual coupon to Dolphin Co. The bond is treated as a debt instrument under the laws of Country E but as an equity instrument under the laws of Country D. Country D generally exempts foreign dividends under its domestic law but taxes interest income. Therefore the payment results in a D/NI outcome that is a hybrid mismatch. The formula for calculating the coupon payment on the bond provides for a discount to the market rate of interest which is calculated by reference to the company tax rate in Country D (that is, the coupon formula is equal to market rate × (1 – 0.5 of the tax rate)). Question Whether the bond is a structured arrangement for Elk Co? Answer Yes. The mismatch has been factored into the calculation of the coupon under the bond so limb (a)(i) of the definition is met. Elk Co could reasonably be expected to be aware of the sharing of the tax benefit that arises to it from the mismatch as the coupon formula reflects a below market rate of interest so limb (b) of the definition is met as well. 16 Facts or circumstances indicate an intention to rely or product a hybrid mismatch The facts and circumstance test is a wider test than the pricing test noted above and looks to a number of factors to determine whether the arrangement is intended to rely on or produce a hybrid mismatch. These factors include the relationship between the parties, the circumstances under which the arrangement was entered into, the steps and transactions that were undertaken to put the arrangement into effect, the terms of the arrangement itself and the economic and commercial benefits of the transaction Facts and circumstances that indicate an arrangement is intended to produce a hybrid mismatch include the following: • an arrangement that is designed, or is part of plan, to create a hybrid mismatch; • an arrangement that incorporates a term, step or transaction to create a mismatch; • an arrangement that is marketed, in whole or in part, as a tax-advantaged product where some or all of the tax advantage is derived from the hybrid mismatch; • an arrangement that is primarily marketed to taxpayers in a country where the hybrid mismatch arises; • an arrangement that contains features that alter the terms under an arrangement, including the return, in the event that the hybrid mismatch is no longer available; and • an arrangement that would produce a negative return absent the hybrid mismatch. The fact that an arrangement produces a combination of tax and commercial benefits does not prevent the arrangement from being a structured arrangement if, on an objective basis, it would be concluded that part of the explanation for the arrangement was to generate a hybrid mismatch. Reasonably be expected to be aware Whether an arrangement is a structured arrangement is person-specific as it depends on whether a person (or a member of that person’s control group) could reasonably have been expected to be aware of the mismatch. This limb of the definition is consistent with paragraphs 342 to 343 of the OECD hybrid mismatch report which state that: “A person will be a party to a structured arrangement when that person has a sufficient level of involvement in the arrangement to understand how it has been structured and what its tax effects might be. A taxpayer will not be treated as a party to a structured arrangement, however, where neither the taxpayer nor any member of the same control group was aware of the mismatch in tax outcomes or obtained any benefit from the mismatch. The test for whether a person is a party to a structured arrangement is intended to capture situations where the taxpayer or any member of the taxpayer’s control group was aware of the mismatch in tax outcomes and should apply to any person with knowledge of the arrangement and its tax effects regardless of whether that person has derived a tax advantage under that arrangement.” 17 Example 5: Arrangement marketed as a tax-advantaged product Flamingo Co (a company resident in Country F) subscribes for bonds paying an annual coupon issued by Gorilla Co (an unrelated company resident in Country G). Flamingo Co subsequently sells the bond to Hedgehog Co, another unrelated company resident in Country H. Due to differences in the treatment of the underlying instrument under the respective laws of Country G and Country H, the coupon payments give rise to a hybrid mismatch resulting in a D/NI outcome. Flamingo Co subscribed for these bonds after receiving an investment memorandum that included a summary of the expected tax treatment of the instrument (including the fact that payments on the instrument will be eligible for tax relief in Country H). A similar investment memorandum was sent to a number of other potential investors in Country H. Question 1 Whether the bond is a structured arrangement for Flamingo Co? Answer 1 The bonds will give rise to a structured arrangement to Flamingo Co because: (i) the facts indicate that the bond has been marketed as a tax-advantaged product and has been primarily marketed to persons who can benefit from the mismatch; and (ii) Flamingo Co acquired the bond on initial issuance and was aware of the potential mismatch in tax treatment from the investment memorandum. However, provided F Co is taxable on the return from the bonds, there is no D/NI mismatch to counter. Question 2 Whether the bond is a structured arrangement for Hedgehog Co? Answer 2 Whether or not the bonds are a structured arrangement to Hedgehog Co will depend on the facts. The bond was marketed as a tax-advantaged product and was primarily marketed to persons who could benefit from the mismatch, including persons in Country H. However, it may not be a structured arrangement to Hedgehog Co, if Hedgehog Co paid market value for the bond and could not reasonably have been expected to be aware of the mismatch in tax treatment. Hybrid mismatch The “hybrid mismatch” definition is used in section FH 11, the imported hybrid mismatch section, and the definition of structured arrangement. It is a broad definition that effectively covers D/NI and DD mismatch arrangements. Hybrid mismatch legislation “Hybrid mismatch legislation” is defined to mean subpart FH and legislation of other countries or territories that has an intended effect corresponding to subpart FH (or a provision in subpart FH). In this regard, foreign legislation will correspond to subpart FH if it is consistent with the effect of the recommendations of the OECD hybrid mismatch report and/or branch mismatch report. 18 This question is most relevant for the defensive rules in sections FH 4, 6 and 9, because if the foreign country has an equivalent of the corresponding primary rule then the taxpayer will not apply the defensive rule in New Zealand. Whether foreign legislation has an intended effect corresponding to the hybrid mismatch rules will need to be determined at the time of the mismatch. For example, if another country has a rule that denies deductions for duplicate tax losses this could be considered to have the same effect as hybrid rules relating to DD mismatches. The other country would not need to have rules that correspond to each of the recommendations in the OECD hybrid report and/or branch report. It would only need to have a rule that corresponds to the particular hybrid or branch mismatch that would be countered in New Zealand if not addressed by the foreign country. It is not expected that another country’s legislation will be exactly the same as New Zealand’s. This means that the amount that New Zealand might counteract, in a given situation, could be different from that which would be counteracted by another country’s rules in that same situat ion. Alternatively, another country’s rules may only apply to certain types of payments (for example, interest and royalty payments but not others). These circumstances should not prevent that other country’s rules qualifying as hybrid mismatch legislation. However, the question of whether a defensive rule in subpart FH applies or not is not determined simply by whether or not the other country has hybrid rules. For instance, section FH 6, which is discussed in detail below, is a defensive rule that only grants priority to another country’s hybrid mismatch legislation if that country’s rule applies to the relevant payment and payer in the income year. The US dual consolidated loss (DCL) rules are an example of hybrid mismatch legislation. Inland Revenue understands that these rules generally operate as follows: • A US company is denied the ability to reduce its US tax in relation to losses that are used under the laws of a foreign country to offset income that is not taxed by the US. These may be losses incurred by a foreign branch of the US company, through a foreign hybrid owned by the US company, or by a dual resident company. • The denial can be turned off if the US company makes a domestic use election. This election requires the company to elect not to use the loss under the laws of another country to offset income which the US does not tax. The non-foreign use period is limited to five years following the year of the loss. • If a domestic use election is made, but the loss is used to offset income which the US does not tax during the five year period, or other “triggering events” occur (such as a sale of the foreign hybrid that incurs the loss), the US tax reduction resulting from the US use of the loss is recaptured and there is also an interest charge. If the loss is so used (or another triggering event occurs) after the five year period, there is no penalty. On the basis of this understanding, the US DCL rules appear to be hybrid mismatch legislation corresponding to section FH 8. Expenditure incurred by a US taxpayer, or a New Zealand hybrid entity which is deductible by a US owner, will not be subject to section FH 9 so long as the US taxpayer is subject to the DCL rules and has not made a domestic use elect ion. If the US taxpayer has made a domestic use election, then section FH 9 will apply to deny a deduction for the expenditure. That is because the domestic use election is an election that the DCL rules do not apply to the US taxpayer in respect of the relevant expenditure. During the five year “non-foreign use” period imposed by the terms of the domestic use election, this should not be a practical issue, since the terms of the domestic use election will 19 in any event prohibit the use in New Zealand of that expenditure against income which the US does not tax. Once that period has passed, the US DCL rules will not deny the US person the ability to use the expenditure in New Zealand against income which the US does not tax. However, section FH 9 will continue to apply, to similar effect. Mismatch situation “Mismatch situation” means a situation giving rise to denial of a deduction, or assessable income, under sections FH 5, FH 6, or FH 8 to FH 10. The definition is important as mismatch situations result in “mismatch amounts” discussed below, which are where the hybrid counteraction may be offset against surplus assessable income in section FH 12. A situation can be a mismatch situation in a year even if there is no denial of a deduction (or inclusion of income under FH 6) in the relevant year. A person can be involved in more than one mismatch situation. Further, a single mismatch situation can give rise to more than one kind of mismatch. For instance, a New Zealand resident hybrid entity can make payments which are subject to both section FH 5 (because they are made to a foreign owner who disregards the entity) and section FH 9 (because they are deductible in New Zealand and a foreign country). Mismatch amount “Mismatch amount” means an amount, arising fro m a mismatch situat ion, for which a deduction may be allowed under section FH 12 when the amount is set off in a tax year against an amount of surplus assessable income. It can only arise from “mismatch situations”. 20 HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT RULE Sections FH 3 and FH 4 Background The hybrid financial instrument rule is recommendation 1 of the OECD hybrid mismatch report and addresses D/NI mismatches. Hybrid mismatches that fall within the scope of the hybrid financial instrument rule in sections FH 3 and FH 4 can be split into two categories: character mismatches and timing mismatches. Recommendation 2.1 of the OECD hybrid mismatch report which recommends that countries should not grant an exemption for dividends that are treated as deductible in a foreign country, is also important in considering the application of this rule. Character mismatch The following diagram illustrates a character mismatch arising from a financial instrument that pays coupons: Interest / Dividend A Co B Co + Loan − In this character mismatch, the financial instrument (loan) is treated as debt by B Co and the coupons are treated as deductible interest. However, the instrument is treated as equity by A Co and the coupons are treated as non-assessable dividends. This results in double non- taxation. Timing mismatch The following diagram illustrates an example of a timing mismatch arising from a financial instrument that pays interest upon maturity: 21 Contingent interest A Co B Co + Loan − In this timing mismatch, A Co and B Co enter into a five-year term loan where interest accrues on the loan, but is only payable at maturity or earlier at the discretion of B Co. The loan is treated as debt by both A Co and B Co. Interest payments on the loan are treated as deductible by B Co in the year the interest accrues but will only be treated as income by A Co when (and if) such interest is actually paid. This results in double non-taxation in the sense that there is a significant deferral (five years) between when the interest is deductible to B Co and when it is assessable to A Co. Summary of legislative response Sections FH 3 and FH 4 implement recommendation 1 of the OECD hybrid mismatch report. They are respectively the primary and defensive rules relating to hybrid financial instruments (which include, but are not limited to, financial arrangements plus shares). Section FH 3 is the primary rule and applies to inbound investment to deny a New Zealand inco me tax deduction for a payment under a hybrid financial instrument taking into account the extent to which it is subject to tax in the payee country. Section FH 4 is the defensive rule and applies to outbound investment to tax a payment under a hybrid financial instrument in New Zealand taking into account the extent to which it is deductible in the payer country. Section FH 4 is expected to have limited application in New Zealand as deductible payments under a hybrid financial instrument would not qualify as exempt foreign dividends under existing section CW 9. The definit ion o f “deductible foreign equity distribution” has also been amended in section YA 1. 22 Application date Sections FH 3 and 4 apply for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. This means that section FH 3 applies to payments for which deductions are claimed in that income year or subsequently. The date on which the payment giving rise to the deduction is paid is not relevant. Section FH 4 on the other hand applies only to payments received on or after the start of a person’s income year beginning on or after 1 July 2018. There is an exception to section FH 3 for banking and insurance regulatory capital entered into on or before 6 September 2016 (the date the Government discussion document Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements was released). Such regulatory capital is grand- parented until the first date on which the issuer has an unconditional right to call or otherwise cancel the financial instrument without penalty. Detailed analysis Section FH 3 – primary rule Section FH 3 is the primary rule of recommendation 1 of the OECD hybrid mismatch report. It applies with priority over the defensive rules of foreign countries. It applies when a person is a party to a financial instrument under which the person makes a payment if: • the person incurs in an income year expenditure that relates to the financial instrument and does not arise solely fro m a foreign exchange fluctuation; • the expenditure is deductible (in the absence of the hybrid mismatch rules); • the tax law of a country outside New Zealand treats the payment when made as received by a person in that country (who may be a resident of that country or a non-resident carrying on business there). It does not matter if the other country will not treat the payment as received until a later year than the year in which the deduction arises in New Zealand; • the financial instrument is or is part of a structured arrangement or the payer and payee are related; and • the tax treatment of the payee in its country meets either subsection (2) or subsection (3). Subsection (2) relates to character mismatches and subsection (3) relates to timing mismatches. Example 6: No mismatch with respect to measurement of foreign exchange differences Falcon Co (a company resident in Country F) owns all the shares in Kiwi Co (a company resident in New Zealand). Falcon Co provides Kiwi Co with an ordinary loan denominated in F$ (FD). Interest on the loan is payable annually in arrears at a market rate and the principal on the loan is payable at maturity. The loan is treated as a debt instrument under the laws of both Country F and New Zealand and the countries take a consistent position on the characterisation of the payments made under the loan. The interest payable on the loan is deductible in Kiwi Co and included in ordinary income under the laws of Country F. The value of NZD falls in relation to FD while the loan is still outstanding so that payments of interest and principal under the loan become more expensive in NZD terns. Under NZ law, Kiwi Co is entitled to a deduction for this increased cost. There is no similar adjustment under Country F law as it is simply receiving the payments it expected to receive in FD. 23 Question Whether the adjustment under New Zealand law for the increase in costs attributable to the fall in the value of NZD against FD gives rise to a hybrid mismatch within the scope of the hybrid financial instrument rule in section FH 3? Answer No. While the fall in the value of NZD gives rise to a deduction under NZ law that is not reflected by a corresponding inclusion in Country F, this difference does not give rise to a D/NI outcome provided the proportion of the interest and principal payable under the loan is the same under the laws of both countries. Gains and losses that result from converting foreign exchange into local or functional currency are attributable to the wa y countries measure the value of money, rather than the value of the payment itself. Character mismatches Subsection (2) applies to character mismatches. Character mismatches arise if two criteria are met. The first criterion is that neither the foreign payee country, nor any other foreign country, recognises the payment as ordinary income of the payee. For instance, if the foreign payee’s country of residence did not recognise the payment as ordinary income, but it was included as part of the ordinary income of the payee in another country through a branch, then the first criterion would not be met (that is, there could be no character mismatch). The second criterion is that the payment would be recognised as ordinary income in the payee country if the classification of the payment or payment instrument were varied, and the payee had the usual tax status for a person or entity of the payee’s class. This criterion is based on two key principles: • The rule should only apply where the mismatch in tax treatment between the two countries is attributable to how the payee and payer countries treat the instrument for tax purposes The primary example of a character mismatch is where the payer country treats the instrument as debt and the payee country treats the instrument as equity resulting in deductible interest in the payer country and exempt dividends in the payee country. The D/NI mismatch in such a case is attributable to the classification of the payment or payment instrument. The test the legislation effectively sets is whether the D/NI mismatch would cease to exist if the payee country treated the financial instrument and/or payment in the same way as the payer country. Taking this approach to the example in the preceding paragraph, if the payee country treated the instrument as debt (instead of equity), it would treat the payments received as interest (rather than dividends). Therefore, as long as the interest payments would be treated as ordinary income in the payee country (assuming a usual tax status of the payee as discussed below), the D/NI mismatch would cease to exist, which means that there is a character mismatch. • The rule should not apply where the mismatch is solely attributable to the status of the taxpayer or the context in which the instrument is held 24 This reflects that D/NI results can be due to factors other than the hybridity of a financial instrument. However, character mismatches should only arise because of the contrasting ways in which the payee and payer countries treat the instrument for tax purposes. For example, a vanilla loan paying interest could produce a D/NI result where the payee is a sovereign wealth fund or tax resident in a country wit h no inco me tax or a territorial tax regime. However, this would not be a hybrid mismatch. The test the legislation applies is whether the mismatch would still arise if the instrument was a debt instrument in the payee country, and entered into by a payee of usual or ordinary status for a person in the payee’s class. If it would, then the mismatch should be attributed to the classification of the instrument, rather than the status of the taxpayer or the context in which the instrument is held, and section FH 3 can apply to the New Zealand payer. Example 7: Hybrid financial instrument Zebra Co (a company resident in Country Z) owns all the shares in Kiwi Co (a company resident in NZ). Zebra Co lends money to Kiwi Co. The loan carries a market rate of interest which is payable every six months in arrears. Payments of interest and principal under the loan are subordinated to the ordinary creditors of NZ Co and can be suspended in the event Kiwi Co fails to meet certain solvency requirements. New Zealand treats the subordinated loan as a debt instrument, while Country Z treats the loan as akin to equity and treats payments under the loan as exempt foreign-sourced dividends. The payments on the loan fall within the scope of the hybrid financial instrument rule. Country Z’s does not recognise the arrangement between Zebra Co ad Kiwi Co as giving rise to ordinary income for Zebra Co, as it is an exempt dividend that is not taxed at the payee’s full marginal rate. If the classification of the arrangement were varied such that Country Z viewed the arrangement as an ordinary loan, the dividends would be recognised as interest income that is fully taxable to Zebra Co. As a result, the counterfactual requirement in FH 3(2) is satisfied. Kiwi Co is denied a deduction for its interest expenditure under FH 3(4). Example 8: Interest payment to an exempt person Elephant Co (a company resident in Country E) owns forty percent of the shares in Kiwi Co (a company resident in NZ). Elephant Co lends money to Kiwi Co. The loan carries a market rate of interest which is payable every six months in arrears. Payments of interest and principal under the loan are subordinated to the ordinary creditors of NZ Co and can be suspended in the event Kiwi Co fails to meet certain solvency requirements. Both Country E and New Zealand treat the subordinated loan as a debt instrument. Elephant Co is a sovereign wealth fund established under Country E law that is exempt from tax on all income. E Co is therefore not taxable on the interest payment. Question 1 Whether the interest payments under the loan fall within the scope of the hybrid financial instrument rule in section FH 3? Answer 1 No. The interest payments under the loan give rise to a mismatch in tax outcomes as they are deductible under NZ law, but are not included in ordinary income under Country E law. However, the D/NI result is not dependent on the classification of the financial instrument (that is, the subordinated loan). Rather, it applies solely because of the tax exempt status of Elephant Co as a sovereign wealth fund. The mismatch in tax outcomes would not have arisen had the interest been paid to a taxpayer of usual status (say a company), so cannot be attributed to the classification of the instrument. 25 Question 2 Whether the outcome above changes if the subordinated loan is instead a hybrid financial instrument that is treated as an equity instrument by Country E (with dividends treated as exempt) but a debt instrument by New Zealand (with interest treated as deductible)? Answer 2 Yes. The D/NI result now arises for two reasons: (1) Elephant Co is a tax exempt sovereign wealth fund; and (2) Country E treats the hybrid financial instrument as an equity instrument but Kiwi Co treats it as a debt instrument. Whether there is a character mismatch under subsection FH 3(2) then depends on whether there would be a D/NI result if Elephant Co had the usual tax status for a person of the its class (say a company in this case). This will depend on how Elephant Co would be taxed if it were not specifically tax exempt. Suppose Elephant Co takes the form of a trust, which would be taxed on the instrument if it were treated as interest in Country E. In that case there would be a character mismatch under subsection FH 3(2). Example 9: Interest payment to a person established in a no-tax jurisdiction Horse Co (a company resident in Country H) owns all the shares in Kiwi Co (a company resident in New Zealand). Horse Co lends money to Kiwi Co. The loan carries a market rate of interest which is payable ever y six months in arrears. Payments of interest and principal under the loan are subordinated to the ordinary creditors of Kiwi Co and can be suspended in the event Kiwi Co fails to meet certain solvency requirements. Both H Co and Kiwi Co treat the subordinated loan as a debt instrument. Country H does not have a corporate tax system and Horse Co does not have a taxable presence in any other country. Horse Co is therefore not liable in any country on payments of interest under the loan. Question 1 Whether the interest payments under the loan fall within the scope of the hybrid financial instrument rule in section FH 3? Answer 1 No. The interest payments under the loan give rise to a mismatch in tax outcomes as they are deductible under New Zealand law, but are not included in ordinary income under Country H law. However, the D/NI result is not dependent on the classification of the financial instrument (that is, the subordinated loan). Rather, it applies because Country H does not have a corporate tax system for any taxpayers. Question 2 Whether the outcome above changes if the subordinated loan is instead a hybrid financial instrument that is treated as an equity instrument by Horse Co but a debt instrument by Kiwi Co (with interest treated as deductible)? Answer 2 No. The D/NI result would still arise if Horse Co treated the subordinated loan as a debt instrument (mirroring Kiwi Co’s treatment of it). This is because Country H has no corporate tax system. Example 101: Interest payment to a taxpayer resident in a territorial tax regime Tiger Co (a company resident in Country T) owns all the shares in Kiwi Co (a company resident in New Zealand). Tiger Co lends money to Kiwi Co. The loan carries a market rate of interest which is payable every six months in arrears. Payments of interest and principal under the loan are subordinated to the ordinary creditors of Kiwi Co and can be suspended in the event Kiwi Co fails to meet certain solvency requirements. Both Tiger Co and Kiwi Co treat the subordinated loan as a debt instrument. 26 Country T has a pure territorial tax system and does not tax income unless it has a domestic source. Interest income paid by a non-resident is treated as foreign source income and is exempt from tax. Question 1 Whether the interest payments under the loan fall within the scope of the hybrid financial instrument rule in section FH 3? Answer 1 No. The interest payments under the loan give rise to a mismatch in tax outcomes as they are deductible under New Zealand law, but are not included in ordinary income under Country T law. However, the D/NI result is not dependent on the classification of the financial instrument (that is, the subordinated loan). Rather, it applies because Country T taxes on a purely territorial basis. Question 2 Whether the outcome above changes if the subordinated loan is instead a hybrid financial instrument that is treated as an equity instrument by Tiger Co but a debt instrument by Kiwi Co (with interest treated as deductible)? Answer 2 No. The D/NI result would still arise if Tiger Co treated the subordinated loan as a debt instrument (mirroring Kiwi Co’s treatment of it). This is because Country T has a pure territorial tax system and the interest income paid by a non-resident is treated as foreign source income. Ordinary income is defined in subsection (9). It is income taxed at the full (or usual) marginal rate of a person for income from financial instruments, and which is not eligible for any exemption, exclusion, credit or tax relief, other than for withholding tax imposed on the payment. Example 11: Ordinary income An offshore parent tax resident in Country A lends money to a New Zealand subsidiary on the basis that the loan is subordinated to general creditors and interest payments are subject to a solvency requirement. If the interest is not paid, it compounds. The loan is treated as a share under Country A tax law, and payments are treated as dividends. Country A taxes only ten percent of any dividend received from a foreign subsidiary. The tax rate imposed on this ten percent is the same as the tax rate imposed on interest income. In this case, ninety percent of the interest payment is not taxed as ordinary income. However, it would be taxed as ordinary income if the loan were treated as a debt instrument for purposes of Country A tax law. Accordingly, the payment meets the requirements of subsection FH 3(2). Alternative 1 Country A also has a rule that denies the ninety percent exclusion to dividends from foreign subsidiaries if they are deductible to the subsidiary (similar to section CW 9(2)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007). In this case section FH 3 would not apply. The dividend would remain deductible, since it is taxable as ordinary income to the offshore parent. It should not matter if there is a timing difference between when the payment is treated as deductible to the New Zealand subsidiary (that is, interest deducted on an accrued basis under the financial arrangements rules) and when it is taxable to the offshore parent (that is, when it is received) under subsection FH 3(2), unless subsection FH 3(3) relating to timing mismatches applies. Alternative 2 27 The loan from the offshore parent is to the New Zealand branch of a subsidiary also resident in Country A, and the offshore subsidiary and the offshore parent are in a tax consolidated group in Country A, pursuant to which payments between the two companies are disregarded for Country A tax purposes. In that case, the payment would not be included in the offshore parent’s income regardless of the classification of the payment or the loan. Accordingly, the payment is not subject to section FH 3 (though it may well be subject to section FH 5). Timing mismatches Subsection (3) applies to “timing mismatches”. These arise if: • an amount of a payment is recognised as ordinary income; • the financial instrument, including extensions contemplated by the financial instrument, does not have a duration of three years or less; and • the payee is not using a reasonable accrual method to recognise income from the payment and the payment is not, or is not reasonably expected to be, recognised in the payee country in an accounting period beginning within 24 months of the year in which the amount is deductible. Example 12: Timing mismatch I An offshore parent company makes an advance to a New Zealand subsidiary company, with interest accruing but payable only if demanded by the parent. The loan has no specified maturity date. The New Zealand subsidiary deducts interest as it accrues, but the parent only has to recognise the interest when it is paid under the tax law in its country of residence. In this case, although demand for repayment of the advance could be made at any time, there is no requirement for the advance to be repaid within three years, so the three year de minimis does not apply. In the absence of section FH 3, the group can expect to generate a tax advantage by the subsidiary not paying the interest. Accordingly, unless there is some evidence to support an expectation that the interest will be paid within the required period, the interest payment will be subject to deduction denial under subsection FH 3(4). If the offshore parent does receive payment of the interest in the future, the New Zealand subsidiary will receive a deduction for the interest previously denied under subsection FH 3(7) to the extent the interest payment is recognised as income by the parent. Hybrid counteraction Subsection (4) defines the amount for which the payer is denied a deduction when subsection (1) is satisfied. The deduction has two components. The first component is for the incurred amount. This is the expenditure incurred by the payer relating to the payment instrument and the payee. For financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency, the expenditure should be calculated taking into account the effect of changes in the NZD value of both the principal amount and the payment itself (to the extent these changes are otherwise taken into account in determining income). In such cases, the incurred amount in subsection (4) is also intended to include both amounts. 28 The second component is a formula wit h a fraction, which is: 1 – payee tax / ordinary tax. This is intended to reduce the deduction denied to the extent that foreign tax is imposed on the payment. Payee tax is the total of: • the tax to which the payment is liable in the payee country within the timing in subsection (6). This could be tax on inco me recognised in payee country in the same year as the deduction is claimed in the payer country, but also includes tax on income recognised in an accounting period beginning within 24 months of the year in which the deduction is claimed in the payer country. It is calculated by multiplying the amount of the payment that is recognised as income by the applicable rate of tax; and • the amount of income tax actually imposed on the income under CFC rules in another country again within the timing in subsection (6). In relation to this second element, there must be actual tax payable on the income. This test will not be met if the CFC tax is reduced by losses or credits, other than credits for withholding tax imposed by New Zealand on the payment. Ordinary tax is the amount of tax which would be imposed on the payment if it were ordinary income in the payee country. Example 13: Timing mismatch II Take the facts of example 12. In this case: • the incurred amount is the deduction claimed by the payer in a given year; and • if a payment is made within the 24-month timing in subsection (6) for which the deduction is claimed, “payee tax” will include an amount equal to ten percent of the payment times the payee’s ordinary tax rate. The formula in section FH 3(4) will deny a deduction for the incurred amount times ninety percent. Otherwise payee tax will be zero, even if tax is paid by the payee outside the 24-month timing in subsection (6)). Example 14: Timing mismatch III Take again the facts of example 12. It is now determined that the amount for which a deduction is claimed is not likely to be included in the offshore parent’s income within the required time period, so that section FH 3 does apply to the expenditure. In this case: • the incurred amount is the deduction claimed by the payer in a given year; and • unless there is some evidence to the contrary, it would be reasonable to conclude that no payment is expected to be made within the required time period in subsection (6) in which the deduction is claimed (if it were, there would be no timing mismatch). So there will be no payee tax. Subsection (7) applies to amounts for which a deduction is denied because of a timing mismatch (that is, the amounts fall within subsection (6)). Once the payment is recognised as ordinary income in the payee country, the payer is allowed a deduction for the amount previously denied under subsection (4). The intention of subsection (8) is to deal with the effect of foreign currency gains of a person who, but for such gains, would be denied a deduction for expenditure incurred under a 29 financial arrangement because it falls within subsection (2). If such a person has net income from the financial arrangement due to the foreign currency gain, subsection (8) provides that the income will be excluded income. If the deduction for the payment would have been only partially denied, the income is excluded income in the same proportion. Section FH 4 – defensive rule Section FH 4 is the defensive rule of recommendation 1 of the OECD hybrid mismatch report. Section FH 4 applies when a person subject to New Zealand tax receives a payment under a financial instrument if: • the payment would not give rise to assessable income of the payee, or gives rise to assessable income not meeting the timing requirements in subsection (7). The timing requirements are that the income must be allocated to an accounting period beginning within 24 months of the end of the accounting period to which the deduction is claimed in the payer country; • the payment is treated in another country as deductible (or entitled to equivalent tax relief) to a person in that country; • that country does not have an equivalent to section FH 3 (the primary rule for hybrid financial instruments); • the financial instrument is part of a structured arrangement or the payee and payer are related; and • the payment meets the requirements of subsection (2) or (3). Subsection (2) relates to character mismatches and subsection (3) relates to timing mismatches. Character mismatches Subsection (2) applies to character mismatches, which arise when a payment does not give rise to assessable income to the payee, but would do so if the classification of the payment or the financial instrument were varied. Generally, it is not expected that subsection (2) would apply to a dividend, since New Zealand already taxes deductible dividends (as the section CW 9 exemption does not apply to deductible dividends). Nor is it intended that section FH 4 would apply to payments under a finance lease where the payer in another country treats the lease as an operating lease and claims a deduction for the entire amount of the payment. In this case, so long as the instrument remains a financial instrument, there is no variation to its terms that would result in the payments being assessable to the extent they represent a payment of principal in respect of the deemed loan under the finance lease. Example 15: 2Deemed interest on interest-free loan Kiwi Co (a company resident in New Zealand) lends money to Beetle Co on interest-free terms and the laws of Country B allow Beetle Co to claim a deduction for tax purposes as if it had paid interest on the loan at a market rate. NZ treats the loan as a debt instrument. Question 30 Whether the loan falls within the scope of the hybrid financial instrument rule in section FH 4? Answer The loan does not fall within the scope of the hybrid financial instrument rule because there is no payment under the loan that gives rise to a deduction for tax purposes in Country B. (Note that this example does not consider the application of the transfer pricing rules. If the transfer pricing rules apply to the loan, they may also treat Kiwi Co as earning income under the loan.) Example 16: Potential character mismatch Camel Co (a company resident in Country C) issues 10 year redeemable preference shares (RPS) to Kiwi Co (a company resident in New Zealand), which owns one hundred percent of the voting interests in Camel Co. The RPS pay an annual return (dividend) that accrues daily and, to the extent accrued dividends are unpaid, forms part of the redemption price. In Country C, the RPS are treated as debt for tax purposes and the coupons are ordinarily deductible as they accrue. Country C does not have a tax rule equivalent to the primary rule for recommendation 1 of the OECD hybrid report. Question Whether the RPS fall within the scope of the hybrid financial instrument relating to character mismatches in section FH 4? Answer In New Zealand, the coupons would be assessable as dividend income because the exemption in section CW 9 for foreign dividends would not apply. Therefore, there is no D/NI mismatch arising from the RPS to counter. Timing mismatches Subsection (3) applies to timing mismatches. It applies to a payment under a financial instrument which does not have a duration, including extensions contemplated by the financial instrument, of three years or less. Subsection (3) applies if the payment gives rise to assessable income, but the gap between the year in which the deduction is claimed by the payer in its country and the derivation of assessable income in New Zealand meets the requirements of subsection (7). An amount meets the requirements of subsection (7) if it is not included, or is not reasonably expected to be included, in income in New Zealand in an income year beginning within 24 months of the end of the accounting period in which it is deductible in the payer country. 31 Example 17:3 Prepaid interest Kiwi Co (a company resident in New Zealand) owns one hundred percent of the voting interests in Donkey Co (a company resident in Country D) and provides it with an interest-bearing loan for a fixed term of three years. Donkey Co pays the interest upfront in a lump sum payment for which it is entitled to an immediate deduction in the foreign country. Kiwi Co returns the interest payment on an accruals basis over the three-year term. Question 1 Whether the loan falls within the scope of the hybrid financial instrument rule relating to timing mismatches in section FH 4? Answer 1 The loan will not give rise to a timing mismatch under section FH 4(3) for Kiwi Co as it has a term of three years (limb (b)). Question 2 Whether the answer changes if the loan is for a five-year term instead? Answer 2 The loan will give rise to a timing mismatch under section FH 4(3). The portion of the interest income which under the financial arrangement rules in subpart EW would not be derived in or before the income year beginning 24 months after the end of the borrower’s income year would be taxed upfront on receipt under section FH 4(4), instead of spread on an accruals basis under the financial arrangement rules in subpart EW. Hybrid counteraction Subsection (4) is the main operative subsection for a character mismatch. It provides that a payment which is subject to the section gives rise to assessable income equal to the amount that would be assessable if the classification of the financial instrument were varied. Under subsection (6), this income is allocated to the year in which: • in the case of a character mismatch, it would be derived if the terms of the instrument were varied so that the payment gave rise to income; or • in the case of a timing mismatch, the payment is received. Replacement payment under returning share transfer Subsection (5) provides for the case where a New Zealand taxpayer receives a replacement payment under a returning share transfer. Replacement payments are taxable income. However, if the returning share transfer is also a share lending arrangement as defined in section YA 1, the replacement payment can carry an imputation credit (section OB 64). If the share borrower is entitled to a deduction in its country for the replacement payment, the attachment of such a credit would give rise to a hybrid mismatch. In order to reverse this, the imputation credit is denied. 32 Deductible foreign equity distribution definition The definition of “deductible foreign equity distribution” has been amended in section YA 1 to include distributions on shares in a foreign company for which a deduction against income or equivalent tax relief or tax benefit is allowed, or would be allowed in the absence of the hybrid mismatch legislation (including situations where the distribution is sourced directly or indirectly from an amount paid to the foreign company that is deductible). This means that the exclusion in section CW 9 for deductible foreign equity distributions will continue to apply to such distributions with priority over the hybrid mismatch rules of other countries, consistent with the OECD’s recommendation 2.1. For example, the adoption of hybrid rules in Australia will have no effect on the tax treatment of a New Zealand company in respect of a deductible dividend received from an Australian company. 33 DISREGARDED HYBRID PAYMENTS AND DEEMED BRANCH PAYMENTS Sections FH 5 and FH 6 Background The disregarded hybrid payment rule is recommendation 3 of the OECD hybrid mismatch report. The deemed branch payment rule is recommendation 3 of the OECD branch mismatch report. Disregarded hybrid payments The following diagram illustrates an example of a disregarded hybrid payment mismatch. Such mismatches always involve a payment by a hybrid entity. A hybrid entity is an entity which is transparent for tax purposes in the country of an investor (Country A) but opaque for tax purposes in another country, generally where it is established (Country B). In the diagram below, B Co is the hybrid entity. A Co. + - InterestLoan Country B Country A B Sub 1 B Co. An interest payment from a hybrid entity (B Co) to its investor (A Co) will be deductible in Country B and disregarded in Country A. This results in a D/NI hybrid mismatch. The mismatch results in double non-taxation if B Co groups its tax loss with the income of another entity (B Sub 1 in the example) whose income is not taxable in Country A. Deemed branch payments The same outcome can arise if B Co is instead a branch of A Co in Country B and is entitled in Country B to a deduction for a charge made to it by A Co, if that charge is not also recognised in Country A. 34 Summary of legislative response Sections FH 5 and FH 6 identify amounts of expenditure relating to:  payments that are deductible in the country of the payer and are disregarded in the country of the payee due to the status of the payer; and  mismatches in the deductibility and recognition of charges by a head office to a branch in another country which are recognised for tax purposes in the branch country, generally as a way of a branch country ensuring that it taxes only that portion of a multinational entity’s income that corresponds to the activities undertaken in the branch country. These charges are only subject to the sections to the extent they do not reflect a simple allocation of actual third party costs. For example, these sections would apply to a profit margin charged by head office to a branch, or a charge for some internally- performed function. Section FH 5 applies where the deduction is in New Zealand, whereas FH 6 applies where New Zealand is not including a payment (or deemed payment) as income and the payment (or deemed payment) is deductible in another country. These identified amounts are treated as non-deductible under FH 5 or are included as assessable income under FH 6. A deduction for them is provided under section FH 12 to the extent they do not exceed surplus assessable income under the offsetting rule in that section. Application date The rules apply to income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. Section FH 5 applies to payments for which deductions are claimed in that income year or subsequently. Section FH 6 applies only to payments that are paid on or after the start of the payee’s income year. Detailed analysis Section FH 5 – primary rule Section FH 5 is the primary rule for recommendation 3 of the OECD hybrid mismatch report and recommendation 3 of the OECD branch mismatch report. It applies with priority over the defensive rules of foreign countries. The primary rule concerns New Zealand residents and New Zealand branches of non- residents that incur an amount of expenditure relating to disregarded hybrid payments, or a charge relating to deemed branch payments. Subsection (1) sets out the conditions that must be satisfied for the primary rule to apply. They are that: • there must be an amount of expenditure relating to either a disregarded hybrid payment under subsection (2) or a deemed branch payment under subsection (3); • the payment or charge is not assessable income to the recipient in New Zealand; • the expenditure or charge is deductible in New Zealand; 35 • the payment or charge is treated as not being received in a foreign country due to the status of the payer; • the payment or charge would be treated as received in a foreign country if the tax status of the payer were different; • the payment or charge does not give rise to tax under CFC rules in a foreign country. For the primary rule to apply to a disregarded payment, subsection (2) must be satisfied in addition to (1). Subsection (2) requires that the payer (who can be a New Zealand resident or a branch of a non-resident) either makes a payment to another person in the same control group or makes the payment under a structured arrangement. This requirement is set out separately because it is not necessary for the deemed branch payments context. For the primary rule to apply to a deduction claimed by a New Zealand branch for a charge paid to a non-New Zealand part of the same legal entity (deemed branch payments) the charge must satisfy the requirements of subsection (1) and some further requirements set out in subsection (3) . The purpose of these requirements is to distinguish deduction for allocation of third party expenditure (which are dealt with by section FH 9) from true intra-entity charges. 4 Where the relevant conditions are met, the payer of the payment is denied a deduction for all expenditure (including foreign exchange gains and losses) relating to the payment, under subsection (4) . However, under section FH 12, if the payer has surplus assessable income the mismatch amount may be set off against that amount. Example 18: Disregarded hybrid payment mismatch (primary rule) Jefferson Co, a foreign company resident in Washington Country (a foreign jurisdiction) owns one hundred percent of Hamilton Co, an unlimited liability company resident in New Zealand. Jefferson Co. provides Hamilton Co with a foreign currency loan under which interest is payable annually. In the relevant income year, the foreign currency strengthens relative to the New Zealand dollar. The interest payments and any foreign currency movements on the loan are deductible (before applying the hybrid rules) to Hamilton Co in New Zealand. The laws of Washington Country allow Jefferson Co to treat Hamilton Co’s income and expenditure as attributable to Jefferson Co because of Hamilton Co’s unlimited liability. This means that the interest payment is disregarded in Washington Country due to the status of the payer (Hamilton Co). If Hamilton Co were treated differently, for example if it were treated as a separate entity in Washington Country, the interest payment would be treated as received by Jefferson Co. Under section FH 5(5), Hamilton Co has a mismatch amount for its incurred expenditure on the debt instrument. This expenditure is non-deductible under section FH 5(4) . Hamilton Co would have to apply section FH 12 to determine whether a deduction can be claimed. 4 See paragraphs 85-88 of the OECD Branch Mismatch Report for a fuller discussion of the difference between deductions for allocation of third party expenditure and true intra-entity charges. 36 Example 19: 4Deemed branch payment mismatch (primary rule) Root Co, a foreign company resident in Ashes Country (a foreign jurisdiction) operates through a branch in New Zealand. Root Co manufactures cricket bats in Ashes Country, and sells them to retail stores in various countries, generally via branches of Root Co in those countries, including the one in New Zealand. Root Co transfers its cricket bats from Ashes Country to its branch in New Zealand. Each cricket bat transfer is compensated for tax purposes by a $250 charge from the branch to Root Co representing $150 of costs per cricket bat to Root Co as well as a $100 arm’s length mark-up in recognition of the profit generating activities of the manufacturing process in Ashes Country. This $100 mark-up is approximately the same as the marginal profit Root Co receives upon selling a cricket bat in Ashes Country. Currently, the entirety of the $250 charge is deductible to Root Co’s branch in New Zealand and can be offset against income earned by the branch for cricket bat sales. Ashes Country exempts active branch income from taxation. The $250 is potentially within scope of proposed section FH 5 as a deemed branch payment. The $150 cost component of the charge is not within scope of section FH 5. This is because it does not satisfy proposed section FH 5(3)(b) due to the amount being determined by reference to the actual costs of Root Co. (though this amount may be subject to proposed section FH 9). However, the $100 arm’s length mark-up component of the charge meets the requirements of section FH 5(3)(b) as it is a profit-based amount and so it is not determined by reference to any payments made by Root Co. or any other person in a control group with Root Co. To the extent that the $100 mark up portion of the transfer price for each bat is not treated as income of Root Co. in Ashes Country, it will be denied a deduction under section FH 5(4). It will also be a mismatch amount under FH 5(5) until there is surplus assessable income against which it may be set off under section FH 12. Section FH 6 – defensive rule Section FH 6 is the defensive rule for recommendation 3 of the OECD hybrid mismatch report. It also applies as a defensive rule for recommendation 3 of the OECD branch mismatch report, though the report does not recommend a defensive rule. The defensive rule mirrors the primary rule and is targeted at payments that are: • deductible to a foreign entity but disregarded in New Zealand; and • foreign branches of New Zealand persons who are entitled to a deduction in another country for a deemed branch payment or charge. Subsection (1) of section FH 6 sets out the requirements for the defensive rule to apply: • a non-resident, or foreign branch of a New Zealand resident, must be treated by the relevant foreign country as having made a payment (a disregarded hybrid payment) meeting the requirements of subsection (2) to a person in New Zealand or having incurred a deemed branch payment meeting the requirements of subsection (3); • the relevant foreign country allows the payer a deduction for the payment or equivalent tax relief; • the relevant foreign country does not have hybrid mismatch legislation corresponding to section FH 5 (the primary rule) that applies to the payer and the charge for any part of the relevant year (in that case, the foreign country’s primary rule would take priorit y); • the person in New Zealand does not derive assessable income from the payment; 37 • the payment would result in assessable income for the person in New Zealand if: – in the case of a hybrid mismatch, the tax status of the payer were different. New Zealand tax law does not generally provide for foreign entities to be entirely disregarded. Even if they are fiscally transparent, such as partnerships, a payment by the entity to a member is generally taken account of for tax purposes (albeit that inclusion by the member of the payment may be largely offset by attribution to the member of a share of the deduction – this means the payment is potentially subject to section FH 9). One case where a payment can be disregarded in this way is where it is made by one member of a tax consolidated group to another member – see section FM 8(2); or – in the case of a branch mismatch, the payer and payee were separate persons; and For the defensive rule to apply to a disregarded payment, subsection (2) must be satisfied in addition to (1). Subsection (2) requires that the relevant parties are a payee in New Zealand that is in the same control group as the payer (who can be a non-resident or a foreign branch of a New Zealand resident) or that the payment is made under a structured arrangement. For the defensive rule to apply to a deemed branch payment from a foreign branch of a New Zealand person, that charge must satisfy the requirements of subsection (1) and some further requirements set out in subsection (3) . As with section FH 5(3), the purpose of these requirements is that section FH 6 should only apply to a mismatch arising because of an intra- group charge deduction in a foreign country being unmatched by income in New Zealand. Section FH 8 is intended to apply to double deductions arising due to the allocation of the same expenditure to two countries. Where the conditions referred to above are met, the amount of the payment or charge is assessable income (it is treated as being zero, if the payment or charge gives rise to a loss, for example, due to foreign exchange fluctuations), under subsection (4) . This assessable income is derived in the year in which it would be derived if the payer and payee were separate persons or the payer’s tax status was different, under subsection (5) . The assessable income is further treated as a mismatch amount under subsection (6), which can be reversed if the taxpayer has surplus assessable income under section FH 12 to offset against it. Subsection (7) prevents a mismatch amount under subsection (5) from being carried forward if the payer country introduces hybrid mismatch legislation corresponding to the primary rule for disregarded hybrid payment and/or deemed branch payment mismatches. 38 Example 20: New Zealand consolidated group and disregarded hybrid payment Ro yalty pay men t Y or k New Zealand C leme nt CoMcKenzie Co Foreign branch The Conchord Group McKenzie Co and Clement Co are two companies resident in New Zealand in the entertainment business. They are both part of a consolidated group (the Conchord group) under New Zealand law. Clement Co has a branch in York, a foreign country that does not have hybrid rules. Clement Co makes a royalty payment to McKenzie Co through its foreign branch. Under the laws of York, Clement Co is entitled to a deduction for the payment. Under New Zealand’s consolidation rules in subpart FM, the payment is treated as excluded income for McKenzie Co with no deduction for Clement Co. The counterfactual test in FH 6(1)(d) is satisfied because if Clement Co’s tax status were changed such that it is no longer consolidated with McKenzie Co, the payment would be assessable income for McKenzie Co. McKenzie Co must include the royalty payment as assessable income. This amount is a mismatch amount and may give rise to a deduction under section FH 12 if there is an amount of surplus assessable income that can be used to offset the amount. 39 REVERSE HYBRID RULE AND BRANCH PAYEE MISMATCH RULE Section FH 7 Background Section FH 7 implements recommendation 4 of the OECD hybrid mismatch report, denying a deduction for a payment to a reverse hybrid in certain cases. It also implements recommendation 2 of the OECD branch mismatch report, denying a deduction for a payment which is not taxed due to a branch mismatch in certain cases. The following diagram illustrates an example of a reverse hybrid mismatch. Such mismatches always involve a payment to a reverse hybrid entity. A reverse hybrid entity is opaque for tax purposes in the country of an investor (Country A) but transparent for tax purposes in another country, generally where it is established (Country B). In the diagram below, B Co is the reverse hybrid. A Co. - Interest Loan Country B Country A B Co. C Co. Country C + If B Co receives a payment that is deductible for the payer (C Co), that payment may not be taxed in Country A or Country B. This is because Country B views the payment as being earned by A Co, while Country A views the payment as being earned by B Co. If the payment would have been taxable had it been made directly from C Co to A Co, this is a deduction/no inclusion (D/NI) hybrid mismatch outcome. A similar outcome can arise as a result of a branch payee mismatch. For example, if the diagram above is modified so that there is no B Co but:  Country A treats C Co.’s payment as received by a Country B branch of A Co, and exempts it under a territorial approach to active income; and 40  Country B does not recognise the payment as received by a permanent establishment in Country B, the result will be that the payment by C Co is deductible in Country C, but not taxed anywhere due to the different allocation rules in Countries A and B, which is once again a D/NI mismatch. Application date Section FH 7 applies to deductions claimed in income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. Detailed analysis Section FH 7(1) denies a deduction for expenditure relating to a payment: • to a person who exists under the law of another country (the payee country). This requirement assumes that the person is not a natural person, and owes their existence to the laws of a particular country. For example, in the case of a company, the company must be formed or otherwise owe its existence to a particular country’s laws; • where the expenditure would be allowed as a deduction for the payer in the absence of the hybrid rules; • treated in the payee country as either: - received in another country. This will be the case where there is a potential branch mismatch. A branch mismatch requires that the payee treats the payment as attributable to operations outside its residence country; or - income of another person in the same control group as the payer. This will be the case where there is a potential reverse hybrid mismatch. The payee country treats the reverse hybrid as fiscally transparent, so that the payment is treated as the income of its owners. The requirement is only met in the case of an owner who is in the same control group as the New Zealand payer; • where the payee and payer are also in the same control group, or the payment is made under a structured arrangement; • where the payment is not subject to taxation of a person in the same control group as the payee. This will be the case where: - in the case of a potential branch mismatch, the branch country does not tax the payment; - in the case of a reverse hybrid, the owner country does not tax the payment; • the payment would have been taxable if it were made: - in the case of a branch mismatch to the payee directly in the payee country; - in the case of a reverse hybrid, directly to the owner. 41 If these requirements are met, section FH 7(2) denies a deduction for the payment and any related expenditure from foreign currency movements (which would be included as part of ‘interest’ expenditure under the financial arrangement rules in subpart EW). Example 21: 5Diverted branch payment mismatches Pavlova Co (a company resident in New Zealand) makes a deductible payment to the foreign branch of a group member, Banana Cake Co (which is incorporated and resident in Country B). The domestic law of Country B (the payee country) exempts foreign branch profits and considers the payment to have been paid to the foreign branch of Banana Cake Co. In Country C, Banana Cake Co is recognised as having a permanent establishment (PE) but the payment is regarded as having been paid to Banana Cake Co in its own right, instead of being allocated to the PE. The payment is therefore not subject to income tax in either Country B or Country C. The payment thus meets the requirements of section FH 7(1)(a), (b), (c), and (d). The counterfactual requirement in section FH 7(1)(e) is also met as the payment would have been subject to income tax in Country B had it been treated as a payment to Banana Cake Co’s head office in Country B. As the requirements in Section FH 7(1) are satisfied, subsection (2) denies Pavlova Co a deduction for its payment to Banana Cake Co. Example 22: Disregarded branch payment mismatches The facts are the same as in example 21, except that Banana Cake Co is not regarded as having a PE in Country C. Country B still considers that there is a PE in Country C. This mismatch therefore satisfies each of the requirements of Section FH 7(1) in the same way as the diverted branch payment example above. Pavlova Co will similarly be denied a deduction under subsection (2) for its payment to its group member Banana Cake Co. 42 DEDUCTIBLE HYBRID AND BRANCH PAYMENTS (DOUBLE DEDUCTIONS) RULE Sections FH 8 and FH 9 Background The deductible hybrid rule is recommendation 6 of the OECD hybrid mismatch report and the branch payments rule is recommendation 4 of the OECD branch mismatch report. The following diagram is an example of a deductible hybrid payments mismatch. Such mismatches always involve a payment from a hybrid entity. Hybrid entities are treated as transparent under the laws of the investor’s tax country and opaque under the laws of the establishment or operating country. This hybrid treatment can result in the same item of expenditure incurred by the hybrid being deductible under the laws of both the parent and payer countries. In the example, B Co is a who lly-owned subsidiary of A Co. B Co is disregarded for Country A tax purposes. B Co borrows from a bank and pays interest on the loan. B Co derives no other income. Because B Co is disregarded, A Co is treated as the borrower under the loan under Country A’s tax laws. The arrangement therefore results in an interest deduction under the laws of both Country B and Country A (unless Country A denies a deduction for some reason, for example under an active foreign income exemption). B Co is consolidated for tax purpose with its operating subsidiary (B Sub 1), which allows it to utilise the tax benefit of the interest deduction to B Sub 1. The ability to utilise the tax benefit through the consolidation regime allows the two deductions for the interest expense to be offset against separate income arising in Country A and Country B. This is a double deductions (DD) mismatch. Branch structures can also achieve the same result, particularly if the country where the entity with the branch is resident in a country that taxes the branch income (as New Zealand does). 43 Summary of legislative response Sections FH 8 and FH 9 implement recommendation 6 of the OECD hybrid report and recommendation 4 of the OECD branch report. They are respectively primary and defensive rules designed to deal with hybrid and branch payment mismatches which produce double deduction (DD) outcomes. The primary rule applies where the hybrid entity or branch is owned by a New Zealand resident and located in a foreign country, whereas the defensive rule applies where the hybrid entity or branch is in New Zealand and owned by a person in another country. The primary rule applies with priority over the defensive rules of foreign countries. Notably, the primary rule’s application is restricted. Only foreign branches or hybrid entities that are capable of offsetting their losses against the income of an existing foreign (non- hybrid) entity are within scope of the rule. This means that simple offshore structures, such as a New Zealand company with only a foreign branch in a country are excluded from the rule. The primary rule also contains a transitional rule that ensures that a person that transitions into the scope of the rule will not benefit from the restricted scope in relation to previous year foreign losses. The effect of these provisions is to identify gross amounts of expenditure relating to a person’s branch or hybrid entity. These identified amounts are non-deductible in New Zealand unless they can be offset against surplus assessable income under section FH 12 (see below). Application date The rules apply to income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. Detailed analysis Section FH 8 (primary rule) New Zealand residents that are related to a foreign hybrid entity or have a foreign branch may fall within the scope of this rule. The key requirement for the rule to apply is in sections FH 8(1)(a) and FH 8(1)(b) which together mean the section only applies if the relevant foreign country allows losses of the hybrid entity/branch to be offset against income of an existing person whose income is not taxed in New Zealand (other than that which is sourced in New Zealand). This is generally referred to as non-dual inclusion income in the OECD hybrid and branch mismatch reports, and is income which is not surplus assessable income under the new legislation. 44 Example 23: New Zealand company with simple foreign branch structure Kowhai Co + Interest Lilliput New Zealand Bank − Foreign branch Loan Kōwhai Co, a company resident in New Zealand, sells native wood carvings in New Zealand and in Lilliput (a foreign country). Kōwhai Co conducts its Lilliput business through a branch in that country. Kōwhai Co borrows from a bank to support its activities in Lilliput. This loan is attributed to its Lilliput branch. As New Zealand taxes its residents on their worldwide income, Kōwhai Co will be entitled to a deduction in New Zealand for interest paid on the loan. The interest expenditure will also be deductible in Lilliput for Kōwhai Co’s branch. FH 8(1)(a) is not satisfied as Kōwhai Co has not used the income of another person or entity) to offset against its Lilliput branch interest expenditure (there is no such person or entity). Accordingly, Kōwhai Co’s New Zealand tax position has not been altered by the introduction of hybrid and branch mismatch rules. However, a rule equivalent to section FH 9 (the defensive rule for double deductions in hybrid entities and branches) in a foreign country may have an impact on Kōwhai Co’s foreign tax affairs. Section FH 8(2) denies a New Zealand person a deduction for the expenditure it incurs through the hybrid entity or branch. This expenditure is treated as a mismatch amount that can be offset (that is, deducted) to the extent there is surplus assessable income under section FH 12. 45 Example 24: Foreign hybrid entity structure Prospero Co Interest expenditure Titania New Zealand Mercutio Co Falstaff Co 75% Minority owner + − Lenders Loan in T$ 25% The Globe group consists of Prospero Co, Falstaff Co and Mercutio Co. Prospero Co, a company resident in New Zealand, owns seventy five percent of Falstaff Co, a hybrid entity resident in Titania (a foreign country). Falstaff Co is treated as a company in Titania, but is treated for New Zealand tax purposes as a partnership. Its income and expenditure is thus attributed to its owners (Prospero Co and the twenty five percent minority owner). Falstaff Co owns one hundred percent of Mercutio Co, a company resident in Titania, and the two entities are consolidated. The consolidation regime of Titania allows the losses of one entity to be offset against the income of the other. Mercutio Co is treated for New Zealand tax purposes as a company, and undertakes an active business in Titania, such that its income is not attributed to Prospero Co under the CFC regime. Falstaff Co performs a financing function for the Globe Group, and its financing costs are deductible in Titania which means that it regularly makes tax losses in Titania. The financing expenditure is also attributed to Prospero Co under New Zealand law, and Prospero Co claims deductions for its seventy five percent share of that expenditure. Because Falstaff Co borrows in Titanian dollars, fluctuations in the NZ$/T$ exchange rate mean the amount of its deductions attributed to Prospero Co under New Zealand tax rules can be much larger or smaller than the amount calculated for Titanian tax purposes. Prospero Co satisfies section FH 8(1) due to the ability of its related hybrid entity Falstaff Co to offset its losses ag ainst the income of Mercutio Co, which is not generally assessable in New Zealand under the CFC regime. Under sections FH 8(2) and (3), Prospero Co has a denied deduction and mismatch amount equal to its expenditure from Falstaff Co. There is no need to compare the amount of this expenditure with the amount of expenditure Falstaff Co calculates for Titanian tax purposes. If Mercutio Co were a partnership, so that its income was subject to New Zealand tax in the hands of Prospero, section FH 8(1) would not apply, and no deduction for the financing costs would be denied to Prospero under section FH 8. A person that is outside the scope of section FH 8(1) because its foreign hybrid or branch is not able to set off expenditure or loss against another person’s non-dual inclusion income and then falls within the scope of the subsection due to a change of group structure (for example, the acquisition of a new non-hybrid entity in the same country as the hybrid entity) is subject to the rule on a prospective basis and also must consider subsections (4) and (5) of section FH 8. These provisions function as a transitional rule for persons in such a situation to reverse 46 their historic foreign hybrid or branch losses if they become usable in the other country in a way that would defeat the integrity of the primary rule. This transitional rule only applies if: • the person was related to a foreign hybrid entity or had a foreign branch prior to subsection (1) applying to the person; and • the laws of the relevant foreign country allow accumulated losses of the hybrid entity or branch to be set off against income that is not assessable in New Zealand under the new structure. To the extent those requirements are met, section FH 8(5) treats the net loss of the hybrid entity or branch as assessable income and a mismatch amount. Example 25: New Zealand company with foreign branch making acquisition Drake Co New Zealand Foreign branch Pink Moon Country Bryter Co Acquisition Drake Co, a company resident in New Zealand, has for many years sold guitars in Pink Moon Country (a foreign country) through a branch. In the last two years trading conditions have been poor in Pink Moon Country and the branch has made losses. These losses accumulate in Pink Moon Country and can also be offset against Drake Co.’s assessable income from other activities. Drake Co has had no other activities or interests in Pink Moon Country. Drake Co does not satisfy the section FH 8(1)(a) and section FH 8(1)(b) requirements because the branch losses cannot be offset against the income of an entity that is not taxable in New Zealand. However, Drake Co believes its prospects in Pink Moon Country will improve, and has now decided to expand its operations there by acquiring Bryter Co - a company resident in Pink Moon Country that sells pianos and has a profitable track record. Bryter Co is treated as a company for New Zealand tax purposes. The tax laws of Pink Moon Country allow Drake Co. to group its Pink Moon branch operation losses with Bryter Co profit such that its future branch losses can be offset against the income of Bryter Co. Drake Co must now apply section FH 8 to any future branch losses; they will become non-deductible mismatch amounts under sections FH 8(2) and (3). The laws of Pink Moon Country have no rules preventing the branch losses of Drake Co accumulated before the Bryter Co acquisition being carried forward and offset against Bryter Co income post-acquisition. Drake Co meets the requirements of FH 8(4) and so must apply section FH 8(5) and include as assessable income the accumulated Pink Moon Country branch losses (as calculated for New Zealand tax purposes) in its New Zealand income in the income year of the Bryter Co acquisition. 47 Section FH 9 (defensive rule) The defensive rule mirrors the primary rule. It applies to a foreign resident operating in New Zealand through a branch or a New Zealand hybrid entity in the same control group as a foreign resident. The defensive rule does not apply where the country of that foreign resident has enacted hybrid mismatch legislation corresponding to the primary rule. The rule applies when expenditure of the hybrid entity/branch is deductible in New Zealand and the country of the foreign resident also allows that expenditure as a deduction for the foreign resident. Section FH 9(2) denies a deduction for the expenditure incurred in New Zealand, and section FH 9(3) treats the denied deduction as a mismatch amount unless and until it is set off against surplus assessable income under section FH 12. Example 26: 6Foreign-owned hybrid entity resident in New Zealand Jefferson Co, a foreign company resident in Washington Country (a foreign jurisdiction) owns one hundred percent of Hamilton Co, an unlimited liability company resident in New Zealand. Hamilton Co is a hybrid entity. Hamilton Co incurs various expenses in carrying out its business. These expenses are deductible in New Zealand and are also treated as deductible against the income of Jefferson Co under the tax laws of Washington Country. Washington Country has not enacted hybrid rules. Under sections FH 9(2) and FH 9(3), Hamilton Co has a denied deduction and mismatch amount for its incurred expenditure. This expenditure will be non-deductible, except as provided for in section FH 12. This denial is intended to ensure that the expenses incurred by Hamilton Co cannot be used to offset income which is taxable in New Zealand but is not taxable to Jefferson Co in Washington Country. A mismatch amount under subsection (3) cannot be carried forward and deducted under section FH 12 if the foreign country introduces hybrid mismatch legislation corresponding to the primary rule for deductible hybrid and branch payment mismatches. 48 DUAL RESIDENT PAYER RULE Section FH 10 Background The dual resident payer rule is recommendation 7 of the OECD hybrid mismatch report. It is similar to recommendation 6 of the OECD hybrid mismatch report in that it deals with a single payment that is deducible in two countries. However, in this case, there is only one entity (a company) involved, which both countries treat as tax resident and can lead to double deduction (DD) mismatches. The diagram below illustrates an example of a dual resident payer mismatch. In the example, B Co (a company incorporated in Country B but tax resident in both Country A and Country B) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of A Co (a company incorporated and tax resident in Country A). B Co owns the shares in B Sub 1 (also incorporated and tax resident in Country B). B Co is consolidated for tax purposes with A Co (under Country A law) and B Sub 1 (under B Country law). Similar to the deductible hybrid payment example above, B Co borrows from a bank and pays interest on the loan. B Co derives no other income. Because B Co is resident in both Country A and Country B it is subject to tax on its worldwide income in both countries on a net basis and can utilise any net loss under the tax consolidation regimes of both countries to offset inco me of other resident companies. This creates the potential for the two deductions for the interest expense to be set off against separate income arising in Country A and Country B. Summary of legislative response Section FH 10 implements recommendation 7 of the OECD hybrid mismatch report. It deals with companies that are resident in two countries and which produce double deduction (DD) outcomes by denying the deduction in New Zealand (noting that the other country will also deny the deduction if they have an equivalent to recommendation 7). The deduction denied will be treated as a mismatch amount until there is surplus assessable income under section FH 12. 49 New Zealand tax law already prevents a dual resident company from grouping its losses or being a member of a tax consolidated group, which are two ways that dual resident company losses can be offset against income that is not taxed in both countries. This rule will more thoroughly prevent this outcome by removing the ability of a dual resident company to offset its expenditure against income earned through a reverse hybrid, such as (potentially) a New Zealand limited partnership. Application date The rule applies to income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. Detailed analysis Section FH 10(1) provides that the rule applies to a company that is a New Zealand resident and is liable to tax in another country due to its domicile, residence or place of incorporation. Section FH 10(2) states that a company meeting the requirements of subsection (1) is denied a deduction for all of it s expenditure. The deduction denied is a mismatch amount under section FH 10(3). Such a company must then consider whether there is any surplus assessable income under section FH 12 to determine whether the denial can be reversed. Generally, the two sections will interact by allowing the expenditure to be offset against the income of the company, less any income that is not and will not be included in the other country that the company is resident in. This might include: • income earned through a New Zealand limited partnership, if the other residence country treats the limited partnership as a country for its tax purposes; • income earned in a foreign branch, if the other country has a foreign branch exemption. 50 IMPORTED MISMATCH RULE Section FH 11 Background The imported mismatch rule is recommendation 8 of the OECD hybrid mismatch report and recommendation 5 of the OECD branch mismatch report. An imported mismatch occurs when a payment that does not directly result in a hybrid mismatch outcome funds another payment that does result in a hybrid mismatch outcome. The illustration below is an example of an imported mismatch. Loan A Co. + - H yb rid Financial Instrument Country B Country A Borrower Co. B Co. Country C - + The imported mismatch here occurs between B Co and Borrower Co. Borrower Co gets a deduction for its payment and B Co includes that payment as taxable income, meaning there is no direct hybrid mismatch on that payment. However, that payment is used to fund the payment on a hybrid financial instrument fro m B Co to A Co. Assuming neither Country A nor Country B has hybrid rules, this payment results in a deduction for B Co., but no corresponding income inclusion for A Co. The loan between Borrower Co and B Co. then ‘imports’ the hybrid mismatch back to Country C, where there is a resulting indirect deduction/no inclusion (D/NI) hybrid mismatch. Summary of legislative response Section FH 11 implements recommendation 8 of the OECD hybrid mismatch report and recommendation 5 of the OECD branch mismatch report. Section FH 11 denies a deduction for a payment (the imported mismatch payment) which does not itself give rise to a hybrid or branch mismatch, but which is treated as funding such a 51 payment (the funded payment). Imported mismatch payments are split into payments where the imported mismatch payment and the funded payment are part of an arrangement (a structured arrangement) and those where they are not. Application date Section FH 11(3), which denies a deduction for an imported mismatch payment which is part of a structured arrangement, applies to payments made in inco me years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. Deductions for other imported mismatch payments (unstructured imported mismatches) are not denied until income years beginning on or after 1 January 2020. Detailed analysis General The imported mismatch rule in section FH 11 prevents taxpayers from entering into structured arrangements or arrangements with group members that shift the effect of an offshore hybrid mismatch into New Zealand through the use of a non-hybrid instrument such as an ordinary loan. In brief, the imported mismatch rule denies deductions for a broad range of payments, including interest, royalties, rents and payments for services, if the income from such funds is offset, directly or indirectly, against a payment that arises under a hybrid mismatch arrangement in a foreign country. This means that the hybrid or branch mismatch will be between two foreign countries, rather than between New Zealand and a foreign country, but there will be a deductible payment in New Zealand that is helping fund the hybrid or branch mismatch payment. Conditions Subsection (1) provides that the imported mismatch rule applies where there is a person that makes a payment (the funder) to another person in a foreign country that does not have the hybrid and branch mismatch rules corresponding to subpart FH and which: • directly or indirectly funds a hybrid or branch mismatch payment. In order for the funded payment to be a hybrid mismatch payment, it must be between two non- residents who do not have hybrid or branch mismatch rules that counteract the mismatch (paragraphs (a), (d) and (e)); • is otherwise deductible to the funder (paragraph (b)); and • is: - made under a structured arrangement; or - funds a hybrid mismatch between two persons (the payer and the payee) where the payer is in the same control group as the funder (paragraph (c)). Structured and unstructured imported mismatches The amount of the deduction denied to the funder depends on whether the payment is made under a structured arrangement or not. The definit io n o f a structured arrangement is the 52 definition used for the hybrid rules generally (discussed above). A structured arrangement can exist between control group members. For example if funds are provided by a foreign parent to a New Zealand borrower via a series of consecutive intra-group funding transactions, and a transaction in that series gives rise to a hybrid mismatch, it is highly likely that the loan to the New Zealand borrower is part of a structured arrangement. Interest on the loan is subject to denial under section FH 11. In determining whether or not a payment is made under a structured arrangement, it is not relevant when the arrangement was entered into, only when the payment is made. For example, suppose that in 2010, a multinational group set up a structure which gave rise to a hybrid mismatch not involving New Zealand, but where payments from New Zealand funded a part of the hybrid mismatch payment. A payment made as part of such a structure by a New Zealand person in a tax year beginning on or after 1 July 2018 will be subject to section FH 11. If the payment is under a structured arrangement, the amount of the denial is given by subsection (3). It is the amount of the deduction, limited to the amount of the funded payment for which a deduction would be disallowed to the payer of the hybrid mismatch payment if hybrid mismatch legislation applied to that person. If the payment is not under a structured arrangement, the amount denied is the amount that can fairly and reasonably be treated as providing funds for the funded payment giving rise to a hybrid mismatch under subsection (4). Subsection (5) provides that this amount should be determined consistently with the approach used in chapter 8 of the OECD hybrid mismatch report. OECD imported mismatch approach One of the complexities with the imported mismatch rule arises because there may be multiple countries (including New Zealand) with deductible payments that are helping fund the hybrid mismatch arising between two other foreign countries. Some co-ordination and order is required so that the double non-taxation is countered appropriately. The OECD hybrid mismatch report outlines three tracing and priority rules to determine the order and extent to which deductions should be denied for imported hybrid mismatches which should be applied in the following order. This ordering is not codified in the legislation, although subsection (5) states that the amount of deduction denied under unstructured hybrid mismatches should be determined consistently with the approach used in chapter 8 of the OECD hybrid mismatch report. Structured imported mismatches The structured imported mismatch rule applies first to deny deductions to the extent there is a payment made under a structured arrangement that results in an overseas hybrid mismatch under subsection (3). This rule applies a tracing approach to determine the extent to which an imported mismatch payment made under a structured arrangement has funded a hybrid payment under the same arrangement. 53 Example 27: Structured imported mismatch rule In the example illustrated in the figure below, A Co (a company resident in Country A) is the parent company of the ABCDE Group. A Co provides financing to B Co (a wholly-owned subsidiary of A Co resident in Country B) under a hybrid financial instrument. Interest payments on the hybrid financial instrument are deductible under Country B law but not included in ordinary income under Country A law. B Co on-lends the money provided under the hybrid financial instrument to C Co and D Co (companies that are resident in Country C and Country D respectively). C Co on-lends money to E Co (a wholly-owned subsidiary of C Co resident in New Zealand) . The loans are all part of the same intra-group financing arrangement. The figure illustrates the group financing structure and the total gross amounts of interest payments made in each accounting period under this structure. E Co is the only group entity resident in a country that has implemented the OECD hybrid and branch recommendations. Question 1 Whether the interest payments made by E Co to C Co are subject to adjustment under the imported mismatch rule in section FH 11 and, if so, the amount of the adjustment required under that rule. Answer 1 E Co’s imported mismatch payment to C Co and B Co’s payment under the hybrid financial instrument to A Co are payments made under the same structured imported mismatch arrangement. New Zealand should, therefore, deny the full amount of the interest deduction (40) under the structured imported mismatch rule under section FH 11. New Zealand will still impose non-resident withholding tax at the applicable rate on the interest paid by E Co to C Co. Question 2 Whether the answer changes if Country C is a country that has implemented the OECD recommendations Answer 2 54 E Co is no longer making a payment to a person in a foreign country that does not have hybrid mismatch legislation (as C Co is in Country C which has implemented the OECD recommendations), which means that section FH 11 will not apply. This is because the imported mismatch should instead be countered by C Co in Country C. Question 3 Whether the answer changes if Country B is a country that has implemented the OECD recommendations. Answer 3 If B Co is resident in a country that has implemented the OECD recommendations it should apply its hybrids rules so the payment from B Co to A Co is non-deductible. If this happens, there will be no hybrid mismatch for New Zealand to counteract. Direct imported mismatches To the extent the overseas hybrid mismatch has not been neutralised by one or more countries applying the structured imported mismatch rule, there is an unstructured imported mismatch, and subsection (4) applies. Subsections (4) and (5) provide that the amount denied should be determined consistent with the approach in chapter 8 of the hybrid mismatch report. Chapter 8 provides for a two rules to allocate unstructured imported hybrid mismatch payments. The first rule is the direct imported mismatch rule. This rule considers whether the foreign deduction from the overseas hybrid mismatch can be directly offset against an imported mismatch payment that is made by a member of the same control group. The rule applies an apportionment approach to help determine the extent to which a country should counter the overseas hybrid mismatch where more than one country has a direct imported mismatch. The intent of the apportionment approach is to prevent more than one country counteracting the same overseas hybrid mismatch such that there would be double taxation. Example 28: Structured imported mismatch rule and direct imported mismatch rule The facts are the same as above, except that B Co already has an existing funding arrangement in place with D Co that is unconnected with the group financing structure and that C Co, D Co and E Co (the shaded entities) are all resident in countries that have implemented the OECD hybrid and branch recommendations. Assume in this example that D Co is resident in New Zealand. The figure below illustrates the total gross interest payments made in each accounting period under the group’s financing structure. 55 Questions Whether the interest payments made by C Co and E Co would be expected to be adjusted under the imported mismatch rule and, if so, the amount of the adjustment required under the rule. Whether the interest payments made by D Co are subject to adjustment under the imported mismatch rule in section FH 11 and, if so, the amount of the adjustment required under the rule. Answers The structured imported rule should apply in Country C to deny the full amount of C Co’s interest deduction (80). The interest payment by E Co is made to a payee that is subject to the hybrid mismatch rules. The payment should therefore not be an imported mismatch payment. The interest payment made by D Co should not be treated as made under a structured arrangement unless the D Co loan and the other group financing arrangements were entered into as part of the same overall scheme, plan or understanding (in which case a structured arrangement would arise). New Zealand should, however, apply the direct imported mismatch rule to deny half of the interest payment paid by D Co to B Co (40) under subsections FH 11(4) and (5). Indirect imported mismatches If the overseas hybrid mismatch has not been fully neutralised by one or more countries applying the structured imported mismatch rule and direct imported mismatch rule, the second unstructured rule is the indirect imported mismatch rule. This rule applies a tracing methodology to determine the extent to which the hybrid deduction from an overseas hybrid 56 mismatch has been indirectly funded by imported mismatch payments from other group members. Like the direct imported mismatch rule, the indirect imported mismatch rule applies an apportionment approach to help determine the extent to which countries should counter the overseas hybrid mismatch which are direct imported mismatches for other countries. The intent of this approach is again to help prevent more than one country counteracting the same overseas hybrid mismatch such that it would result in double taxation. Example 29: Direct and indirect imported mismatch rule The figure below sets out the financing arrangements for companies that are members of the same group. In this case A Co has lent money to C Co. C Co has lent money to B Co and D Co and B Co and D Co have lent money to their subsidiaries. Each company is tax resident in different countries. As illustrated in the diagram, the loan between A Co and C Co is a hybrid financial instrument. The hybrid financial instrument is not, however, entered into as part of a structured arrangement. The hybrid deduction arising under the hybrid financial instrument is 200. E Co and F Co each make a deductible intra-group interest payment to B Co of 100 and D Co makes a deductible intra-group interest payment to C Co of 200. D Co, E Co and F Co are the only entities in the group that are resident in a country that has implemented the OECD hybrid and branch recommendations. Assume that E Co is resident in New Zealand. Question 1 Whether the interest payments made by F Co and D Co would be expected to be adjusted under the imported mismatch rule and, if so, the amount of the adjustment required under the rule. 57 Whether the interest payments made by E Co are subject to adjustment under the imported mismatch rule in section FH 11 and, if so, the amount of the adjustment required under the rule. Answer 1 The direct imported mismatch rule should apply in Country D to deny D Co a deduction for all of the interest paid to C Co (200). This fully counteracts the hybrid mismatch between C Co and A Co. Therefore, E Co and F Co do not need to apply the indirect imported mismatch rule (that is, there is no counteraction required in New Zealand). Question 2 Whether the above changes if the hybrid deduction arising under the hybrid financial instrument is 300 instead of 200. Answer 2 The direct imported mismatch rule should still apply in Country D to deny D Co a deduction for all of the interest paid to C Co (200). This leaves 100 of the hybrid mismatch between C Co and A Co to counteract by E Co and F Co. E Co and F Co apply an apportionment methodology to each deny half of their interest deduction (50). This leaves the other half of their interest deduction (50) as deductible. 58 SURPLUS ASSESSABLE INCOME Section FH 12 Background Section FH 12 introduces the key OECD hybrids concept of ‘dual inclusion income’ which is referred to as ‘surplus assessable income’ in the Act. It is important as deductible/not includible (D/NI) payments and double deduction (DD) payments do not result in double non- taxation if they are deducted against dual inclusion income. For instance, consider a deductible hybrid payment under section FH 8 where a New Zealand company is the sole investor in a hybrid entity in a foreign country. The hybrid entity makes payments that result in deductible expenditure in both New Zealand and the foreign country which results in denied deductions and a mismatch amount under subsections FH 8(2) and (3). However, the hybrid entity derives significant income that is taxable in both New Zealand (to the owner of the entity) and the foreign country. This means that there is net taxable profits in both countries, and there is no potential for the double deductions to be utilised against income that is only subject to tax in one country, so there is no tax mischief. The purpose of section FH 12 is to reverse the denial of deductions (or inclusion of income, in the case of section FH 6) that arises under sections FH 5, FH 6 and FH 8 to FH 10 where there is surplus assessable income. Summary of legislative response Section FH 12 allows a deduction for hybrid mismatch amounts to the extent that the person paying or deriving the amounts has income which is taxable in New Zealand and can be expected to also be taxed in the other country giving rise to the hybrid mismatch. This income can arise in a different income year from the year the hybrid mismatch amount is disallowed. Section FH 12 applies separately to each mismatch situation to which a person is party, but it applies to all mismatch amounts with respect to that situation. Both mismatch amount and mismatch situation are discussed separately above in the definitions part of this special report. Section FH 12 defines surplus assessable income through a formula. Generally, it is surplus assessable income from earlier years which has not been offset by deductions for mismatch amounts, plus assessable income arising during the year from the structure which can be expected to be taxed in the other country also. There are adjustments for other items as well, including exempt dividends which can be included as surplus assessable income in so me cases. The carry forward of surplus assessable income and hybrid mismatch amounts is subject to the usual forty nine percent ownership continuity test that applies to tax losses. Application date Section FH 12 applies to income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. 59 Detailed analysis The importance of surplus assessable income Deductible/not includible (D/NI) payments result in double non-taxation where the deduction is used against income which is taxed only in the payer country. In that case the effect of the D/NI payment is to reduce payer country tax without increasing payee country tax. To the extent that the entity or branch earns income which is taxable in both countries (surplu s assessable income), the D/NI payment will still reduce payer country tax, but it will increase payee country tax. That is because the payee country income calculation will not give a deduction for the D/NI payment. So, any tax reduction as a result of that payment in the payer country will simply reduce the amount of payer country tax for which a credit can be claimed in the payee country, and there is no tax mischief. The same result holds for double deduction (DD) payments. If a DD payment by a hybrid payer is used against non-surplus assessable income, that can result in double non-taxation. However, if the hybrid is profitable in both the hybrid and owner countries, all of the double deduction expenditure (DD) will, broadly speaking, be deducted against surplus assessable inco me, and there is no tax mischief. The purpose of section FH 12 is to reverse the denial of deductions (or inclusion of income, in the case of section FH 6) that arises under sections FH 5, FH 6 and FH 8 to FH 10 where there is surplus assessable income so that taxpayers are not inappropriately affected by the denied deductions (or inclusion of income) under the hybrid mismatch rules. Unlike the OECD’s dual inclusion income, surplus assessable income does not depend on the actual assessable amounts in each country. This is for reasons of pragmatism rather than principle. The approach is to focus on the New Zealand income as a starting point. For instance, if a $100 amount of assessable income derived through a mismatch situation in New Zealand corresponds to a $50 amount of taxable income offshore (because of a foreign exchange fluctuation, or because the income is recorded in a different way to New Zealand), the entire $100 can be applied to the surplus assessable income formula. However, where income which is taxable in New Zealand will not be taxable in the other country because of more fundamental factors, like the structure through which that income is earned (for example, it is earned in a foreign branch, and the other country has an active foreign branch exemption, or its earned through a reverse hybrid entity) the income is not treated as surplus assessable income. Section FH 12 Section FH 12(1) applies when a person has a hybrid mismatch amount for a mismatch situation. A person can have more than one mismatch situation. 60 Example 30: 7Two mismatch situations Burr Ltd 99% New Zealand Theodosia LP Branch Country A Country B Burr Ltd, a New Zealand resident company, owns 99.9 percent of Theodosia LP, a limited partnership formed under the laws of, and operating in, Country A (the remaining 0.1 percent is held by another group company). Theodosia LP is a hybrid entity, because it is taxed as a company in Country A and a partnership in New Zealand. It has a branch in Country B. Income and expenditure of the branch is not taxed in Country A because of an exemption for active branch income. Burr Ltd also owns one hundred percent of Mercer Ltd, a company incorporated and tax resident in Country A, which is in a tax consolidated group with Theodosia LP for Country A tax purposes. Payments by Theodosia LP that relate to its Country A activities are deductible in New Zealand (to Burr Ltd) and Country A (to Theodosia LP). Payments by Theodosia LP that relate to its Country B activities are not deductible in Country A but are deductible in New Zealand and Country B. In this case, Burr Ltd is party to two mismatch situations, one with respect to its interest in Theodosia LP and one with respect to its interest in Theodosia LP’s Country B branch. It will have a different mismatch amount for each one. Subsection (2) requires a person’s mismatch amounts (which can arise under different sections in subpart FH) from a mismatch situation to be set off against the person’s surplus assessable income from the situation. This effectively reverses the impact of denied deductions (or inclusion of income) under the hybrid rules once the potential tax mischief is no longer present. The formula for surplus assessable income in subsection (3) comprises a series of defined amounts; earlier plus assessable plus exempt less unrecognised less protected less deductions plus status. An explanation of these formula components is below: 61 • Earlier: Surplus assessable income not offset by mismatch amounts in previous years (subject to a reduction also for foreign tax credits in the other country, discussed below). • Assessable: Assessable income that the person derives fro m the mismatch situat io n during the year. • Exempt: If the person is a New Zealand resident hybrid entity owned by a non-resident, exempt consists of the New Zealand source dividends derived during the year if these are taxable to the foreign owner with no tax credit other than for withholding tax. This item recognises that the hybrid treatment of the New Zealand entity can cause a payment to be taxable in a foreign country with no deduction in New Zealand. • Unrecognised: Assessable income from the mismatch situation which is not subject to tax in the foreign country because of the residence of another person (who is not another owner), or because of the source of the income. This item recognises that a taxpayer’s mismatch situation may generate assessable income that is not taxable in the relevant other jurisdiction. This income should not count towards surplus assessable income. • Protected: The amount of assessable income earned by the entity through its mismatch situation which is protected from New Zealand tax by a foreign tax credit. For a given year, this amount should be calculated under subpart LJ before a hybrid mismatch rule counteraction is made under subpart FH. • Deductions: deductions for expenses incurred in earning assessable income which do not give rise to mismatch amounts. • Status: the amount of expenditure on a payment by the person to a payee in New Zealand that is a mismatch amount and not deductible in a foreign country because of the tax status of the person and the payee. For instance, a payment made by a New Zealand hybrid entity that is denied a deduction under section FH 9 may have an amount of Status if that payment was made to a another New Zealand hybrid entity if the tax status of those entities results in the payment being disregarded in the relevant foreign country. Example 31: Surplus assessable income Taking the facts of example 30, suppose the following amounts of income and expenditure during the year. The tax rate in all three countries is 25%. Burr Ltd, before applying subpart FH: New Zealand only Country A only Country B only Total Assessable income 300 200 100 600 Expenses 150 210 40 400 New Zealand taxable income 150 (10) 60 200 For the Country A mismatch situation, Burr Ltd has a double deduction amount of $210 and surplus assessable income of $200, being: • Assessable: $300 (the amount of assessable income earned through Theodosia LP including through the Country B branch); less • Unrecognised $100 (the amount not recognised in Country A because it is from an active business in Country B ). (There is no Earlier amount as this is a one-year example. There is no Exempt amount on the facts. There is no Protected amount assuming no tax is paid in Country A. There is no Deductions or Status amounts as there are no deductions incurred in deriving assessable income from the mismatch situation other than hybrid deductions.) 62 Accordingly, of the $210 deduction denied to Burr Ltd under section FH 8, $200 is allowed as a deduction under section FH 12, and Burr Ltd has $10 of denied deduction to carry forward to the next year. For the Country B mismatch situation, Burr Ltd has a double deduction amount of $40 and surplus assessable income of $100, being the $100 assessable income earned through the Country B branch. The other amounts in the calculation of surplus assessable income are zero. So all of the $40 deduction denied under section FH 8 for the Country B mismatch situation is allowed under section FH 12. For the Country B situation, Burr Ltd also has $60 surplus assessable income which it can carry forward to the next year under subsection (6). This surplus assessable income cannot be used to claim a deduction for the $10 of denied deduction for Theodosia LP’s Country A double deductions because that deduction arises under a different mismatch situation. Carry forward Mismatch amounts not offset against surplus assessable income in a year can be carried forward to the next tax year under subsection (6) provided that they meet the same forty nine percent continuity of ownership test as applies to tax losses (this is set out in subsection (8)). Surplus assessable income that is not offset against mismatch amounts in a year can also be carried forward to the next tax year in the same way. However, before continuity is considered, subsection (7)(a) reduces the amount of surplus assessable income by the amount that is subject to the foreign tax credit regime of a foreign country equivalent to New Zealand’s subpart LJ. This is to ensure that net New Zealand income from a mismatch situation cannot be offset against future mismatch amounts if double tax has been relieved by a foreign country through foreign tax credits in relation to that net New Zealand income. Example 32: Disallowed carry forward of mismatch amount Further to examples 30 and 31, Theodosia LP (excluding its branch in Country B) has $30 of double deductions and $50 of surplus assessable income in year two. The $10 mismatch amount for which a deduction was not allowed in year one can prima facie be deducted against the $20 of surplus assessable income. However, the group that includes Burr Ltd, Theodosia LP and Mercer Pty Ltd is sold to a new owner at the beginning of year two. This sale will terminate the carry forward of the $10 denied deduction with respect to the Country A mismatch situation. So that amount cannot be deducted in year two. Stranded losses Subsection (9) provides for a situation where an amount for which a deduction is denied under section FH 8 (a double deduction amount) ceases to be a mismatch amount because the person treated as having the loss in the other country ceases to exist before the loss is used in the other country. This means the loss is no longer able to be used in that other country. This is referred to in the hybrid mismatch report as a “stranded loss”. The subsection applies where: • a New Zealand person has a mismatch amount arising under section FH 8 available to be carried forward at the end of a year; • the person who incurred the loss under the other country’s rules (which may be the New Zealand person or a hybrid entity) ceases to exist; and 63 • under the law of the other country, in the year in which the mismatch arose or any later year, the person has not offset a loss against income which is not assessable in New Zealand. If these requirements are met, the mismatch amount will be: • in the case of a loss incurred by a foreign branch of a New Zealand person, treated as a tax loss component in the year the entity with the branch ceases to exist, in which case it can be offset against another group company’s income in that year; or • in the case of a loss incurred by a hybrid entity which ceases to exist, treated as an ordinary tax loss of the owner. Grouping Subsection (10) is a grouping provision that allows a company to set off a mismatch amount from a mismatch situation against another company’s surplus assessable income (from a different mismatch situation) if those companies are in the same group. The subsection is available if: • two companies are in the same wholly-owned group when the mismatch amount and surplus assessable income amount arise; • the two companies have each applied FH 12 to offset their mismatch amounts and surplus assessable income mismatch amounts themselves, and the surplus assessable income amount are excess; and • the offset could be made if the offset company and the group company were the same company. There does not need to be a nexus between the income and the expenditure for the two items to be grouped under this grouping rule. A company cannot carry forward a mismatch amount or surplus assessable income amount that it has used for a grouping offset under subsection (10). 64 DIVIDEND/SHARE ELECTION Section FH 13 Background If a deduction is denied for an interest payment on a hybrid financial instrument under section FH 3 and the payment is also subject to NRWT (generally at 10% or 15%), there is an element of double taxation. Taxpayers can generally avoid this result by entering into non- hybrid arrangements. For instance, if a company raised funds by borrowing under a vanilla debt arrangement, the interest would be deductible (and not denied under section FH 3), and NRWT would be deducted at the appropriate rate (generally at 10% or 15%). Conversely, if a company raised funds by using equity, any dividends paid would not be deductible (such that section FH 3 would have no application), and NRWT would not apply where the dividends are either fully imputed, or where the taxpayer is entitled to NRWT at 0% under an applicable tax treaty. The dividend/share election option in section FH 13 allows a New Zealand resident who makes a payment under a hybrid loan to treat the loan as a share for all circumstances in order to avoid any inconsistencies arising as a result of its being treated differently for different tax purposes. This means that any interest paid on the instrument will be treated as dividends for tax purposes. Distributions under the instrument may then be made without deducting NRWT if the payer attaches imputation credits to the deemed dividend, or where the taxpayer is ent it led to NRWT at 0% under an applicable tax treaty. Summary of legislative response Section FH 13 allows a person who pays interest which is non-deductible by reason of section FH 3 to choose to treat the hybrid financial instrument on which the interest is paid as a share, and the payment as a dividend, for all tax purposes. Taxpayers that wish to make this election should send their election notices to hybridelections@ird.govt.nz , where they will be monitored by Inland Revenue. Application date The election is available for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. Key features Section FH 13 allows a person who pays interest which is non-deductible by reason of section FH 3 to choose to treat the hybrid financial instrument on which the interest is paid as a share, and the payment as a dividend, for all tax purposes. The election must be notified to the Commissioner before it takes effect, specifying the date on which it takes effect. On the effective date, the amount owing under the loan is treated as fully repaid by the person (which may trigger an NRWT obligation) and subscribed for an issue of shares having the same terms as the loan. 65 An election ceases to have effect if the interest payments are no longer subject to deduction denial under section FH 3. At that time the deemed shares are treated as cancelled for an amount equal to the amount payable under the loan, and that amount is treated as re- subscribed for the loan. Detailed analysis Subsection (1) states who can make the election – a borrower who would be denied a deduction of interest under section FH 3 (the primary version of the hybrid financial instrument rule). Subsection (2) states the broad result of the election, which is that while the person is eligible to make it, the financial arrangement giving rise to the payment is treated as a non- participating redeemable share for all purposes of the Act. This means that distributions on the financial arrangement will be treated as dividends for tax purposes. These dividends will be subject to the benchmark dividend rule in section OB 61. Subsection (3) requires the election to be notified to the Commissioner specifying an elective date which must be on or after the date of the notice. Taxpayers that wish to make this election should send their election notices to hybridelections@ird.govt.nz , where they will be monitored by Inland Revenue. There is no prescribed form for the notice; however, it should include the taxpayer’s name and IRD number, the financial arrangement to which the election applies, and the date on which the election is to be effective. Subsections (4) and (5) outline in more detail the effect of an existing financial arrangement being subject to an election (the election can also be made for a financial arrangement yet to be entered into), and also the effect of it ceasing to be subject to the election. On the effective date for the election the borrower is treated as paying all amounts owing under the financial arrangement. If this includes unpaid interest, this interest will give rise to an NRWT or AIL obligation as appropriate. The amount so repaid, less any NRWT, is then treated as subscribed for a non-participating redeemable share. There is no provision for an election to be revoked. However, once the interest payments on the instrument are no longer subject to section FH 3 (for example, because the payee country implements recommendation 2 of the OECD hybrids report), the election becomes ineffective. The deemed shares are then treated as redeemed for the amount owing (which will include any accrued “dividend”) and that amount, again less any NRWT, is treated as re- subscribed for the shares. 66 OPAQUE ELECTION Section FH 14 Background The hybrid rules impose a compliance burden on a person who is subject to New Zealand tax and has an interest in a foreign hybrid entity (that is, an entity which is fiscally opaque under the tax law of a foreign country, but transparent for New Zealand tax purposes. The person has to determine whether there are any deductions claimed by the entity in the other country for payments which are deductible in New Zealand as well (that is, DD mismatch under section FH 9). If section FH 9 applies, the person will also have to determine the expenditure attributable to the foreign entity and treat it as ring-fenced expenditure, only able to be deducted against surplus assessable income. Section FH 9 is part of hybrid rules that target double non-taxation due to different rules relat ing to the tax classification o f entit ies. Double non-taxation can also be addressed by New Zealand classifying the relevant entity in the same way as the other country. Section FH 14 allows a New Zealand owner of a foreign hybrid entity to take this approach in limited circumstances. Summary of legislative response Section FH 14 allows a New Zealand resident who has a wholly owned foreign hybrid entit y when the Bill is introduced to elect to treat it as a company for New Zealand tax purposes. It is intended to simplify compliance for people who set up foreign hybrid vehicles before the hybrid rules were introduced. Taxpayers that wish to make this election should send their election notices to hybridelections@ird.govt.nz . Application date The election applies for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. It must be made before the due date for the return of income for the first year in which the hybrid mismatch rules apply to the person. Key features Section FH 14 applies to a New Zealand resident who has, or is a member of a wholly owned group that has, a wholly owned hybrid entity. By making the election such a person can treat the entity as a company for New Zealand tax purposes. This will mean the person does not have to apply many of the hybrid rules in relation to the entity, particularly section FH 9. Of course, it will also mean that the entity’s income is separate from the owner’s income, so that, for example, losses from the entity do not reduce the owner’s taxable income. 67 Detailed analysis Subsection (1) outlines who can make the election – a New Zealand resident who owns, or is a member of a wholly-owned group that owns, all the ownership interests in a hybrid entit y on the date the Bill was introduced (6 December 2017). This is because the election is intended to simplify compliance for people who set up foreign hybrid vehicles before the hybrid rules were introduced. Subsection (2) states the broad result of the election, which is that the hybrid entity is treated as a company for all purposes of the Act. Subsections (3) to (7) then outline the specifics regarding the election and how it operates. The owner must notify the Commissioner of the election on or before the due date for the person’s tax return for the first income year in which the hybrid rules apply to the person (subsection (3)). Taxpayers that wish to make this election should send their election notices to hybridelections@ird.govt.nz . There is no prescribed form for the notice; however, it should include the taxpayer’s name and IRD number, specific the foreign hybrid entity to which the election applies, and the tax year on which the election is to be effective. The election will be effective from the first income year in which the hybrid rules apply to an owner and later income years (subsection (4)). This election will determine the New Zealand tax treatment of the entity for the remainder of its existence, regardless of who owns it in the future, as the election is irrevocable (subsection (7)). The effect of the election is that the owners of the entity are treated as selling, on the first day of the income year, the hybrid entit y’s undertaking to a new company in return for the shares in the company (paragraph (5)(a)). The sale will in most cases trigger some taxable gain or loss, after which point the hybrid entity’s undertaking will no longer directly be in the New Zealand tax base (that is, flow through treatment will not apply to the foreign hybrid entity’s income and expenses immediately after the deemed sale has taken place). The CFC regime will apply in the usual way to the foreign hybrid entity following the election wit h distributions from the hybrid entity treated as dividends unless they qualify to be treated as a return of capital or capital gain distribut ion. The available subscribed capital of the deemed new company will equal the net value of the undertaking it is deemed to acquire (subsection (6)). Example 33: Opaque election NZ Co has had a wholly-owned a foreign hybrid entity in Country F since 1 April 2010. The foreign hybrid entity incurs tax losses each year in New Zealand which would effectively be ring-fenced under section FH 9. NZ Co understands that it will no longer benefit from potential double deductions from the foreign hybrid entity and wishes to reduce the compliance costs of the hybrid rules by making the opaque election in section FH 14. NZ Co has a standard balance date of 31 March. Question 1 When does NZ Co need to make the election in election FH 14 by? Answer 1 NZ Co must file the election before the due date for its 2019–20 tax return. If NZ Co has an extension of time for filing its tax return, this will be by 31 March 2021. 68 Question 2 What will the effect of the election be? Answer 2 NZ Co will be deemed to sell the undertaking (or business) of the foreign hybrid entity to a new company in exchange for the shares in the company on 1 April 2019. If there is any taxable gain or loss from the sale, this will flow through to NZ Co. From that point onwards, foreign hybrid entity will be treated as a company for all purposes of the Act. NZ Co will file controlled foreign company disclosures for the foreign hybrid entity and treat equity distributions from the foreign hybrid entity prima facie as dividends. Question 3 NZ Co sells the foreign hybrid entity on 1 April 2020 to Kiwi Co. Kiwi Co would prefer to treat the foreign hybrid entity as transparent for New Zealand tax purposes. How does NZ Co’s section FH 14 election impact this preference of the new owner? Answer 3 NZ Co’s election is irrevocable and so Kiwi Co must continue to treat the foreign hybrid entity as a company for all purposes of the Act. 69 FIF RULE CHANGES RELATING TO HYBRID RULES Sections EX 44(2), EX 46(6)(e), EX 46(10)(db), EX 47B, EX 52(14C) and EX 53(16C) Summary of legislative response The Act contains some amendments to the foreign investment fund (FIF) regime designed to ensure that a person holding a FIF interest must use the comparative value (CV) method to calculate FIF income from the interest if a distribution on the interest might otherwise be subject to counteraction under the hybrid rules. The amendments also turn off the ability for a share supplier of a FIF interest under a returning share transfer to use the fair dividend rate (FDR) method in relation to an arrangement within the scope of the hybrid rules. Application date The changes apply for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. Key features The key features of the FIF rule changes relating to the hybrid rules is that they require a person to use the CV method in relation to a FIF interest if: • the FIF is entitled to a deduction or equivalent tax relief in relation to the distribution (subject to certain additional requirements); and • the person holds the shares as a share user under a returning share transfer which is within the scope of the hybrid rules. They also turn off the ability of a share supplier in a returning share transfer to use the FDR method in relation to FIF interests which are within the scope of the hybrid rules. Background Scenario 1 A straightforward situation where the hybrid rules could apply to a New Zealand resident holding a FIF interest is where the arrangement is within the scope of the hybrid rules and the FIF is entitled to a deduction or equivalent tax relief for a distribution in its country. If the person is applying the FDR method: • technically, the dividend is exempt income (section CW 9(1)); and • the distribution may be greater than the amount recognized under the FDR method. This may make it difficult to determine for the FIF to determine whether and to what extent the hybrid rules should apply in its country to the deductible dividend. 70 Scenario 2 A more complex scenario arises in relation to a FIF interest held by a New Zealand resident share user pursuant to a returning share transfer. The hybrid rules apply to hybrid transfers giving rise to a deductible/non-includible (D/NI) result. One way this can occur is if a New Zealand person lends money to a foreign related party by way of a returning share transfer which is a share repo arrangement. In a share repo arrangement, the loan takes the form of an initial sale of shares by the borrower to the lender, followed by a sale back of equivalent shares. The lender may make a financing return by: • receiving and retaining the dividend on the shares; • receiving a greater amount for the sale back of the shares than it paid to acquire them. In some countries, the cash borrower in a share repo arrangement is treated for tax purposes as continuing to own the shares, which it has provided as security for a loan. In this case, the tax law applying to the borrower will usually treat any dividend paid on the shares and retained by the lender as if it were both income to the borrower from the share and a deductible payment by the borrower to the lender. If the lender is a New Zealand person and exempt from tax on the dividend, this payment is deductible (to the borrower (share supplier)) and non-includible (to the lender/share user). Application of the FDR regime, which taxes a deemed 5% return, complicates the picture, and would make it difficult to know whether or how to apply the hybrid rules to such a dividend payment. In order to avoid these complications, the legislative changes provide that the New Zealand lender (the share user) in such situations has to use the CV method to determine its income from the share. This ensures that the dividend is taxable to the lender, and the hybrid rules do not need to apply. It is analogous to the taxation of a deductible foreign equity distribut ion. Scenario 3 A third scenario arises when a New Zealand resident supplies FIF interests under a returning share transfer which is a share loan. Under current law the person can continue to apply the FDR method as if they still held the shares. If the person is a share lender and receives a substitute payment which is deductible to the payer, this can give rise to a hybrid mismatch. In order to prevent this possibility, the legislative changes prevent such a person from applying the FDR method if the counterparty is related to the person, or the returning share transfer is a structured arrangement. Detailed analysis Scenario 1 New paragraph EX 46(10)(db) deals with scenario 1 in the background above. It provides that in such a case the share is a non-ordinary share, which means income from it must be determined using the comparative value (CV) method. This method includes dividends in the calculation of the income, so there can be no hybrid mismatch arising from the payment. 71 New paragraph (db) only applies if: • the arrangement is within the scope of the hybrid rules, because the parties are related or it is a structured arrangement; • the non-resident is not a foreign PIE equivalent. In many countries, widely-held investment funds are entitled to a deduction or equivalent tax relief for distributions, designed to ensure that their investors, rather than the fund, are subject to tax on underlying income from the fund’s investments. One example is an Australian unit trust (AUT), where income to which unit holders are presently entitled is taxed to them rather than the trust. This change is not intended to remove the ability for a New Zealand taxpayer to use the FDR method in relation to an AUT undertaking portfolio investment. Scenario 2 New section EX 47B deals wit h scenario 2 in the background above In such circumstances, the New Zealand share user is required to use the CV method to calculate their FIF income or loss from a FIF interest subject to a returning share transfer if: • the share supplier is resident in another country; • the share user is related to the share supplier, or the returning share transfer is or is part of a structured arrangement. “Related” and ‘structured arrangement” are defined terms in new section FH 15 (discussed above); and • the share supplier is treated as the owner of the shares for the purposes of the tax rules where it is resident. This is because the share supplier may be deducting the dividends paid on the shares as a financing cost in the foreign country, whereas the share user may be applying the fair dividend rate (FDR) method to tax the FIF interest. The difference between the income returned under the FDR method and the dividend paid results in a potential D/NI mismatch. There are consequential changes to related provisions in the Act: • Section EX 44(2) has been amended so that new section EX 47B has been added to the list of the provisions which limit a person’s choice of FIF income calculation methods. • Section EX 46(6)(d) has been amended so that a person who holds a FIF interest as a share user in a returning share transfer can use the comparative value method to calculate FIF income from that interest if section EX 47B applies to the person. • The definit io n o f a “returning share transfer” in section YA 1 has been amended so it does not require that the transfer shares are listed. Scenario 3 Subsections EX 52(14C) and EX 53(16C) have been amended to deal with Scenario 3 in the background above. These subsections previously allowed a person who held a FIF interest and calculated income from that interest under the FDR method (whether it be the annual or periodic method) to continue to apply that method even if the person has disposed of the shares under a returning share transfer. 72 In practice, this seemed to mean that replacement payments paid by the share user could be treated as exempt (as dividends would be), and the share supplier would continue to pay tax only on the “fair dividend”. In order to avoid the potential for a hybrid mismatch counteraction in such a case (where the share user is a non-resident in a country with hybrid rules), subsections EX 52(14C) and EX 53(16C) have been amended to deny the ability take this approach if the share user is related to the share supplier, or the returning share transfer is part of a structured arrangement (“related” and “structured arrangement” are defined terms in new section FH 15 discussed above). In such circumstances, the share supplier now has to apply the financial arrangement rules to the returning share transfer. The financial arrangement rules are comprehensive, and will ensure that replacement payments are taxable. 73 NRWT CHANGES CONSEQUENT ON HYBRID RULES Section RF 2C Background One purpose of the non-resident financial arrangement income (“NRFAI”) definit io n is to identify situations where there is a sufficient degree of deferral between deductions and payments under a financial arrangement between associated parties that NRWT should be imposed on an accrual basis, rather than the usual payments basis. Applying NRWT on an accrual basis ensures that in such cases, there is a better matching between deductions for the borrower and the imposition of NRWT on the lender. However, the NRFAI definition looks at when expenditure is incurred, rather than when it is deductible. This means that where a deduction for expenditure is denied or deferred under the hybrid rules, that denial or deferral is not taken into account, for the purposes of the NRFAI definition, because it does not affect the time when the expenditure is incurred. This is not appropriate. For example, suppose interest expense is incurred in a year, but the deduction for the expense is deferred under section FH 5. In that case there can be no deferral between the allowing of a deduction and the payment of NRWT until the deduction is allowed by the hybrid rules. Summary of legislative response The formula for determining whether a financial arrangement gives rise to non-resident financial arrangement income (NRFAI) in section RF 2C has been amended. It is intended to ensure that expenditure for which a deduction is denied or deferred under the hybrid rules is not taken into account in determining whether a loan gives rise to non-resident financial arrangement income. Application date The amendment applies for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. Detailed analysis Subsection RF 2C(4) has been amended to reduce the amount of the denominator in the formula used to determine whether a loan gives rise to NRFAI. The accumulated accruals in the denominator is now reduced by the amount of deductions which have been denied under the hybrid rules in subpart FH (referred to as “hybrid deductions”). 74 THIN CAPITALISATION CHANGES CONSEQUENT UPON HYBRID RULES Section FE 6(2), FE 6(3)(a), FE 6(3)(aba), FE 7(3)(b), FE 15(1)(a), FE 21(3), and FE 23 Background The thin capitalisation rules prevent a multinational group taking deductions for interest expense in New Zealand to the extent that it is excessively highly leveraged. Leverage is determined by comparing debt with assets less non-debt liabilities. If a deduction is permanently denied for interest under the hybrid rules, it is not appropriate for that amount to be treated as interest under the thin capitalisation rules. Such treatment could result in that amount being subject (effectively) to an additional denial of deduction. It is also not appropriate for the debt giving rise to that interest to be treated as interest-bearing debt. It should be treated as either equity or a non-debt liability. If a deduction is denied under the hybrid rules, there is a possibility that a deduction will subsequently be allowed, by reason of being offset against surplus assessable income under new section FH 12. Application of the thin capitalisation rules to such interest should depend on the position of the New Zealand borrower and its worldwide group at the time the interest is incurred. Accordingly, no amendment to the current thin capitalisation rules is required in respect of such interest. Separate thin capitalisation rules apply to registered banks controlled by a single non-resident. Consequential changes have been made to these rules for the same reason as for the generic thin capitalisation rules. Summary of legislative response Sections FE 6, FE 7, FE 15, FE 21, and FE 23 have been amended to ensure that interest for which deductions are permanently denied under the hybrid rules do not give rise to additional income under the thin capitalisation rules (including the bank thin capitalisation rules), and that the debt associated with such interest is not treated as debt under those rules. Application date The amendment applies for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. Detailed analysis General thin capitalisation rules Section FE 6 provides that an entity subject to the thin capitalisation regime has income equal to, broadly speaking, that portion of its interest deductions that is equal to the extent to which its New Zealand debt/assets percentage exceeds the greater of sixty percent and one hundred and ten percent of its worldwide debt/assets percentage for inbound investment (the respective 75 percentages are seventy five percent and one hundred and ten percent for outbound investment). Section FE 6 has been amended so that the formula in subsection (2) does not include, in the amount of interest which can give rise to such income under the thin capitalisation rules, the amount of interest for which a deduction is permanently denied under the hybrid rules. This is achieved through the following amendments: • The formula in subsection (2) has been amended so that the interest deductions are reduced by a new term “mismatch”; • “Mismatch” is defined in new paragraph (3)(aba) as the total of the amounts denied as deductions under section FH 3, and as interest under sections FH 7 and FH 11. These three sections contain the hybrid rules where the denied deduction is not a mismatch amount that can be reversed to the extent there is surplus assessable income under section FH 12; and • The definition of “total deduction” in paragraph (3)(a) has been amended so that it includes the interest deductions that would be allowed in the absence of the hybrid rules in subpart FH. This is to reflect the intent that interest deductions that are potentially only deferred (rather than permanently denied) under the hybrid rules should remain subject to the thin capitalisation rules. Section FE 15 outlines how total group debt should be calculated under the thin capitalisation rules for a New Zealand group. Subsection (1) has been amended to exclude from the definition of total group debt the amount of financial arrangements that give rise to interest for which a deduction is permanently denied under the hybrid rules (that is, where the deduction is denied under section FH 3, FH 7 or FH 11). Bank thin capitalisation rules Section FE 7 has been amended so that a reporting bank’s interest expenditure does not include interest for which a deduction is denied under sections FH 3 (for character mismatches only), FH 7, or FH 11 (those being the hybrid rules that permanently deny deductions). Section FE 21 has been amended such that interest expenditure denied under sections FH 3 (for character mismatches only), FH 7, or FH 11 gives rise to additional financial value for the purposes of calculating equity value for a banking group. Correspondingly, Section FE 23 has been amended such that a banking group’s funding debt does not include debt under which a deduction has been denied under sections FH 3 (for character mismatches only), FH 7, or FH 11. 76 HYBRID MISMATCH RULE FOR NRWT Sections BH 1(4), RF 11C New section RF 11C inserts a new hybrid mismatch rule allowing New Zealand to charge NRWT on payments under certain cross border hybrid financing instruments if New Zealand treats the payment as interest. This rule overrides our double tax agreements (DTAs). Background The Government has identified a hybrid mismatch issue that arises in the following circumstances. The New Zealand branch of a non-resident company borrows money from another non- resident in the same overseas country as the borrowing company. The borrowing is under a hybrid instrument which New Zealand treats as debt but the other country treats as shares. Under our DTAs, New Zealand is able to charge NRWT on interest payments made by a non- resident’s New Zealand branch to another non-resident. However, New Zealand is not able to charge NRWT on dividends paid by one non-resident company to another (regardless of whether the dividends are connected with a branch in New Zealand). This means that whether New Zealand can charge NRWT on payments under a hybrid financial instrument where the borrower is a New Zealand branch of a non-resident and the lender is a resident of the same country depends on whether the payments are classified as interest or dividends for DTA purposes. If the payments are dividends for DTA purposes, and New Zealand was not able to impose NRWT on them, then the branch would be entitled to an interest deduction in New Zealand for the payments but the payments would not be subject to NRWT. This would be contrary to the intent of the relevant DTA provisions. Australia already has a rule effectively providing that outgoing payments are not dividends for DTA purposes (and so are subject to Australian NRWT) if they are treated as interest under Australia’s domestic law. 5 Application date New section RF 11C applies retrospectively from 1 April 2008. Where taxpayers have already adopted the position that NRWT or AIL is not payable in respect of such cross border interest payments made prior to the introduction of the Bill (6 December 2017), a savings provision is available. Detailed analysis The Act inserts a new section RF 11C. Section RF 11C(1) provides that the section applies to a payment of interest (as defined in section YA 1) by a company that is resident outside New Zealand under an applicable DTA to another person who is also resident outside New Zealand 5 Section 3(2A) of Australia’s International Tax Agreements Act 1953 77 under that DTA, if the payment has a New Zealand source under the Income Tax Act. Sectio n RF 11C(2) then provides that the payment is treated as interest under the NRWT rules and the DTA, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the DTA. The Act also amends section BH 1(4) to make it clear that section RF 11C overrides the applicable DTA. The combined effect of the legislation is that New Zealand may withhold NRWT from a cross border payment that is New Zealand source interest under the Act, regardless of whether it is treated as a dividend under the applicable DTA. Example 34: Hybrid mismatch in DTA/NRWT context A foreign group in the business of bridge building consists of two consolidated foreign companies resident in Greenwich (a foreign country), Simon Co and Garfunkel Co. Simon Co has a New Zealand branch and Garfunkel Co issues a convertible note to Simon Co to assist with its troubled New Zealand operations. (Assume for the purposes of this example that New Zealand and Greenwich have a DTA in force that is consistent with the commentary above.) Simon Co must make annual payments to Garfunkel Co under the note and these payments are treated as interest under New Zealand domestic law, but as dividends in Greenwich. RF 11C(2) will ensure that the payment is subject to NRWT, regardless of its treatment in Greenwich or under the DTA. 78
August 2018 A special report from Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue Interest limitation rules RESTRICTED TRANSFER PRICING FOR CROSS-BORDER RELATED BORROWING Sections GC 6, GC 15 to GC 19 and YA 1 (cross-border related borrowing, and related-party debt) of the Income Tax Act 2007 New rules have been introduced requiring related-party loans between a non-resident lender and a New Zealand-resident borrower to be priced using a restricted transfer pricing approach. Under these rules, specific rules and parameters are applied to certain inbound related-party loans to: • determine the credit rating of New Zealand borrowers at a high risk of BEPS, which will typically be eit her one or two notches below the ultimate parent’s credit rating; and • remove any features not typically found in third party debt in order to calculate (in combination with the credit rating rule) the appropriate amount of interest that is deductible on the debt. Separate rules apply to financial institutions such as banks and insurance companies. Application date The amendments apply to income years starting on or after 1 July 2018. The amendments will not apply to an arrangement that complies with an advance pricing agreement issued by the Commissioner before 1 July 2018. Key features Amendments to section GC 6, including the introduction of subsections GC 6(3B) to (3E), provide for the rules to restrict interest deductions on cross-border related borrowing. The rules, where they apply, alter the terms and conditions of a borrower and/or an instrument considered before applying the general transfer pricing rules, including the 1 amendments to transfer pricing also amended by the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act 2018 and discussed elsewhere in this special report. The rules are contained in sections GC 15 to GC 19: • Section GC 15 sets out how the rules operate and also defines an “insuring or lending person” as the rules operate differently for these persons. • Section GC 16 calculates how the credit rating of a borrower, other than an insuring or lending person, may be adjusted. • Section GC 17 calculates how the credit rating of an insuring or lending person may be adjusted. • Section GC 18 disregards certain features of a financial arrangement for the purpose of calculating an interest rate. • Section GC 19 confirms that for arrangements existing before the new rules apply the loan must be repriced at the last day before the new rules apply that the loan was priced or repriced. Background New Zealand’s thin capitalisation rules limit the amount of deductible debt a company can have, rather than directly limiting interest deductions. In order for the rules to be effective at actually limiting interest deductions in New Zealand to an appropriate level, allowable interest rates on debt also need to be limited. Historically this limitation has been achieved through transfer pricing. However, this approach has not been wholly effective. The transfer pricing rules require taxpayers to adjust the payments for cross-border related party transactions so they align with the arm’s length conditions that would be agreed to by a third party in a comparable transaction. The arm’s length interest rate on a debt is affected by a number of factors including its term, level of subordination, whether any security is offered, and the credit rating of the borrower. New Zealand's transfer pricing rules have been updated and strengthened by including adopting economic substance and reconstruction provisions similar to Australia’s rules through the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act 2018. The amended transfer pricing rules disregard legal form if it does not align with the actual economic substance of the transaction. They also allow transactions to be reconstructed or disregarded if such arrangements are commercially irrational and would not be entered into by third parties operating at arm’s length. Even with these stronger transfer pricing rules, transfer pricing is not the most effective way to prevent profit-shifting using high-priced related party debt. When borrowing from a third-party, commercial pressures will drive the borrower to try to obtain as low an interest rate as possible and on the best terms and conditions – for example, by providing security on a loan, and by ensuring their credit standing or rating is not adversely affected by the amount being borrowed and the borrowing rate. 2 These same pressures do not exist in a related-party context. A related-party interest payment, such as from the New Zealand subsidiary of a multinational to its foreign parent, is not a true expense from the perspective of the company’s shareholders. Rather, it is a transfer from one group member to another. There are no commercial tensions driving interest rates to a market rate. Indeed, it can be profitable to increase the interest rate on related-party debt above a market rate – for example, if the value of the interest deduction is higher than the tax cost on the resulting interest income. In addit ion, related-party transactions are fundamentally different to third-party transactions. Factors that increase the riskiness of a loan between unrelated-parties (such as whether the debt can be converted into shares or the total indebtedness of the borrower) are less relevant in a related-party context. For example, the more a third- party lends to a company, the more money is at risk if the company fails. However, the risks facing a foreign parent investing in New Zealand do not change whether it capitalises its investment with debt or equity. As the foreign parent and New Zealand subsidiary are commonly controlled, in many cases the terms and conditions of any loan can be set having regard to taxation, rather than the commercial considerations that would be most important in an actual arm’s length loan. Related-party loans can feature unnecessary and uncommercial terms (such as being repayable at the borrower’s discretion or having an extremely long term) that are used to justify a high interest rate. Simply making the related party debt subordinated or subject to repayment optionality may also be used as justifications for a higher interest rate. In other cases, a very high level of related party debt may be loaded into a New Zealand subsidiary to depress the subsidiary’s creditworthiness, which also is used to justify a higher interest rate. It can be difficult for Inland Revenue to challenge such arrangements under the transfer pricing rules as similar conditions are not generally found in arrangements entered into by third parties in comparable circumstances. With the new stronger transfer pricing rules, the taxpayer would have to provide evidence that the legal form was consistent with the economic substance and that a third party operating at arm’s length would agree to enter into the arrangement. These new requirements should limit the use of artificial or commercially irrational funding arrangements. However, in iso lat ion, they would still provide scope for taxpayers to choose to borrow from related parties using higher-priced forms of debt than they would typically choose when borrowing from third parties. In addition, the highly fact-dependent and subjective nature of transfer pricing can make the rules complex and uncertain to apply. Assessing compliance with the arm’s length principle requires very detailed and specific information and analysis of how a comparable transaction between unrelated parties would have been documented. This makes complying with the transfer pricing rules a resource-intensive exercise which can have high compliance costs and risk of errors. Transfer pricing disputes can take years to resolve and can have high costs for taxpayers and Inland Revenue. New Zealand is not alone in these concerns. The OECD’s final report on interest limitation rules notes that thin capitalisation rules are vulnerable to loans with excessive interest rates. This was one of the reasons behind the OECD favouring the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) approach to limit interest deductions. 3 From restricted transfer pricing to interest rate The guidance in this report as well as the legislative restrictions imposed by the restricted transfer pricing rule focus on credit rating, and instrument terms and conditions restrictions, rather than directly determining an appropriate interest rate or margin. For any particular credit rating, it is necessary to use this informat ion, alo ng wit h other relevant factors, to determine an appropriate interest rate. This will frequently require access to specialist information such as that provided by Bloomberg or Reuters, on comparable instruments. This approach is unchanged between the previous transfer pricing rules and the additional requirements required under the restricted transfer pricing rule. Selection of suitable comparables and any adjustments that need to be made to them, such as converting into New Zealand Dollars, remains critical to arriving at an appropriate rate for a given transaction. Detailed analysis The following flow chart sets out, at a high level, the steps a New Zealand borrower must go through, before determining a credit rating adjustment is required under the new rules. Further detail on each of these steps is provided below 4 Flowchart 1: Process for determining NZ borrower’s credit rating Do you have a 50% or greater interest by a non- resident or more than one non-resident acting in con cer t?

To be a cross-border related borrowing funds must have been provided to the borrower under which deductible expenditure arises and one or more of the following factors: • the lender and borrower are associated; • there is a person or group of persons that has an ownership right of at least 50% in the lender and the borrower; • the funding is provided through an indirect associated funding arrangement (detailed further on); or • the lender is part of a non-resident owning body or other group of non-residents acting in concert and that body or group has an ownership right of at least 50% in the borrower. Provides funds Section GC 6(3B)(a) requires that for an arrangement to be a cross-border related borrowing, a non-resident lender must provide funds to the borrower. This term has been used in the thin capitalisation rules since their inception and is also used in the non-resident financial arrangement income rules. It is explained on pages 54 and 55 of Tax Information Bulletin Volume 29, No 5, June 2017. It includes a finance lease, which in substance is a vendor-financed sale. It does not include an operating lease. Expenditure arises for the borrower Section GC 6(3B)(b) requires that for an arrangement to be a cross-border related borrowing, expenditure must arise for the borrower for which the borrower is allowed a deduction. There is no advantage in adjusting the interest on a related party loan if that interest is not deductible including under sections FH 3, FH 7 and FH 11 of the hybrid and branch mismatch rules (that is, one that is not subject to reversal under section FH 12). There is no timing restriction on this provision so the rules continue to apply if the deduction is temporarily disallowed, for example because it is a hybrid deduction denied subject to reversal under section FH 12. Association The lender and borrower will be associated if they meet one or more of the existing association tests in subpart YB. An ownership right of at least 50% in the borrower This test is determined under sections FE 38 to FE 41. These sections provide how ownership interests in companies are determined and ensure that the restricted transfer pricing rule applies to the same groups that are covered by the thin capitalisation 6 rules. The calculations are similar to the control interest calculations in the controlled foreign co mpany rules. In the majorit y of cases, where rights are held in equal proportion across all (classes of) shares, having an ownership right of at least 50% will occur where two companies are associated anyway. However, this test will also include some lenders and borrower who are not associated if rights are not held in the same proportion across all (classes of) shareholders. The test references the direct control interests in section EX 5(1) as if the borrower was a foreign company and looks at the highest interest across the following categories: • shares in the borrower • shareholder decision-making rights in the borrower; which are decision making concerning: – dividends or other distributions – constitution of the company – variation in capital – appointment of a director • a right to receive income of the borrower • a right to receive any of the value of the net assets of the borrower As this test is based on the highest interest, it is possible for more than one person or group to have an over 50% interest. As this is not an income attribution provision, and only requires potential restrictions on the pricing of interest when a group has control or influence over the pricing of interest paid to them, this does not raise concerns. 7 NZ Shareholder Co has a voting interest of 51.25% so is associated with NZ Co. However, the restricted transfer pricing rule will not apply to NZ Shareholder Co as it is not a non-resident. Non- resident Shareholder Co has a voting interest of 48.75% so it is not associated with NZ Co. However, Non-resident Shareholder Co has 60% of the right to appoint directors. Any loans to NZ Co by Non- resident Shareholder Co will be subject to the restricted transfer pricing rule. If NZ Shareholder Co sold all of its shares in NZ Co to another non-resident both the new shareholder and Non-resident Shareholder Co would be subject to the restricted transfer pricing rule as both shareholders would be non-residents with an interest of greater than 50%. Indirect associated funding An indirect associated funding arrangement is defined in section GC 6(3C). It is based on the similar indirect associated funding arrangement definition in section RF 12I for the purpose of the NRWT rules. The purpose of this test is to prevent a lender from circumventing the restricted transfer pricing rule by channelling funding through an unassociated person to a New Zealand borrower where direct funding would be covered by one of the other limbs of the cross-border related borrowing definitio n. Example 2 Foreign Co has a wholly owned subsidiary, NZ Co. Foreign Co has deposited NZ$20 million with Foreign Third Party Bank. Foreign Co and Foreign Third Party Bank have agreed that Foreign Third Party Bank will pay 10% interest to Foreign Co on the deposit and will also lend NZ$20 million to NZ Co at a rate of 9.7%. If Foreign Third Party Bank had lent NZ$20 million directly to NZ Co without this arrangement the interest rate would have been 7%. If Foreign Third Party Bank had simply lent money to NZ Co, the restricted transfer pricing rule would not apply as Foreign Third Party Bank does not have any interest in NZ Co. However, as the loan is indirect associated funding, it is covered by the restricted transfer pricing rule. Example 1 NZ Co has two classes of shares and two shareholders; as follows: Share class NZ Shareholder Co Non-resident Shareholder Co Total Class A 55 45 100 Class B 4 6 10 Class A shares hold all income distribution interests as well as decision making concerning distributions, the constitution of the company and variation in the capital of the company. Each class B share holds the right to appoint one director. Voting interests are determined by the shareholder decision making rights as follows: Decision making right NZ Shareholder Co Non-resident Shareholder Co Total Distributions 55% 45% 100% Constitution 55% 45% 100% Capital 55% 45% 100% Directors 40% 60% 100% Average 51.25% 48.75% 100% 8 Whether a cash pooling arrangement is classified as indirect associated funding was covered on page 68 of Tax Information Bulletin Volume 29, No 5, June 2017 when this term was introduced for the non-resident financial arrangement income rules. In short, a cash pooling arrangement may be indirect associated funding if the arrangement was entered into with the purpose or effect of avoiding the restricted transfer pricing rule but will not apply to commercial cash pooling arrangements such as those set up with a fluctuating debit and credit balance to cover working capital requirements. Acting in concert This test covers borrowers that have at least 50% of their rights held by a group of non-residents that act in concert to control the borrower. This overlays the 50% ownership right test described above with the existing non-resident owning body and acting in concert tests that already apply for thin capitalisation and NRWT. In section GC 16(3), such a group is referred to as a co-ordinated group and a borrower from a co-ordinated group is referred to in this report as not having an identifiable parent. Each of these terms can be used interchangeably. There are two exceptions to this general treatment: • If the borrower is owned by a single non-resident with no other business activity, and that non-resident is itself controlled by a co-ordinated group, the New Zealand borrower will be treated as controlled by a co-ordinated group. This is because the New Zealand borrower will be in the same situation as if the direct non-resident did not exist and the New Zealand borrower was owned directly by each of the members of the co-ordinated group. • If the borrower is controlled by a co-ordinated group but one of the members of that co-ordinated group meets the 50% test by themselves the New Zealand borrower is treated as not controlled by a co-ordinated group. This is because the restricted transfer pricing rules apply without the need to consider the existence or otherwise of a co-ordinated group. Exclusion of certain preference shares Section GC 6(3E) excludes ownership interests arising from certain preference shares from the cross-border related borrowing test. To meet this exclusion the preference shares must be: • held by a person not associated with the issuer; and • issued with the intention of satisfying or replacing debt previously provided by the preference shareholder to the issuer in the ordinary course of business. The purpose of this exclusion is to cater for certain situations where a non-resident, in the business of lending to third parties, loans money to a New Zealand borrower who gets into financial difficulty. In such cases, rather than a portion of the debt being cancelled, the borrower may issue the lender preference shares. In this circumstance the lender, has an ownership right in the borrower, subject to the terms and conditions of the preference share. However, it clearly would not be appropriate to require the 9 interest rate on the remaining debt to be determined having regard to the group credit rating of the preference shareholder. This exclusion will not apply if the preference shares are issued to a person who is already associated with the borrower, or if the preference shares are sold or transferred to a third party. These restrictions are designed to prevent investors using this exclusion to take or extend an equity-like interest without this being included in determining ownership for purposes of the restricted transfer pricing rules. Credit rating adjustments A borrower that is subject to the new rules will follow the process set out in Flowchart 2, to arrive at one of the following issuer credit ratings: • Default credit rating – the borrower’s own rating • Restricted credit rating – the higher of (i) the borrower’s own rating if their debt/assets percentage is no higher than 40% debt and (ii) BBB- • Group credit rating – the higher of the group borrower’s credit rating minus one or two notches and the borrower’s own rating (the group borrower is the group company with the highest amount of unsecured long term borrowing) • Optional credit rating – the credit rating implied from significant third party debt None of the credit rating methods is intended to require a borrower or another entity in the worldwide group to obtain a credit rating if it does not already have one. Instead a credit rating, subject to any restrictions imposed by the methods, can continue to be implied based on an analysis of current and historical information to form a business risk profile that takes into account compet it ive posit ion, managerial conduct and intent, industry and country risk and a financial risk profile based on cash flow and leverage. This forms the basis of the borrower’s stand-alone position which may be influenced by other factors including group or governmental support to form the issuer credit rating. Default credit rating The default credit rating in section GC 16(2) and (8) is the borrower’s rating including any implicit parental support. This is the rate that applies under the rules outside of the restricted transfer pricing rule. It will continue to apply where the borrower is a low BEPS risk. This is also the rating that applies when a borrower has less than $10 million of cross-border related borrowings. The Commissioner has previously issued administrative guidance for transfer pricing of loans with a total principal up to $10 million in order to minimise compliance costs. The availability of the administrative approach is not intended to be affected by the new restricted transfer pricing rule and a loan priced under this approach is intended to be compatible with the default credit rating. To make this clear, loans where the borrower has less than $10 million of cross-border related borrowings have been carved out of the restricted credit ratings and group credit rating methods discussed below. 10 Further detail on the administrative approach is available at: http://www.ird.govt.nz/international/business/transfer-pricing/transfer- pricing/practice/transfer-pricing-practice-financing-costs.html Restricted credit rating The restricted credit rating in section GC 16(3) and (9) will apply where the borrower does not have an identifiable parent and eit her is a high BEPS risk or chooses to use it to reduce compliance costs. It is based on the borrower’s standalone rating but adjusted to reduce its debt level to 40% if it is above this and is subject to a to a minimum rating of BBB-, or equivalent given by a rating agency approved by the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank approves rating agencies for their non-bank deposit taker rules which are published at: https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/regulation-and-supervision/non-bank-deposit- takers/requirements/credit-ratings There are four rating agencies currently approved by the Reserve Bank. BBB- is the lowest investment grade credit rating assigned to a party by Standard & Poor’s, Fitch and Equifax Australasia and is equivalent to a Baa3 Moody’s rating. If a New Zealand borrower is controlled by a non-resident and that non-resident has no other business activity and itself has no identifiable parent the New Zealand borrower will be treated for the purpose of determining its credit rating as having no identifiable parent rather than the direct non-resident being its parent. The consequence of this is the New Zealand borrower will need to consider whether the restricted credit rating applies rather than the group credit rating. Group credit rating The group credit rating in section GC 16(4) and (10) will apply where the borrower has an identifiable parent and eit her represents a high BEPS risk (discussed below) or chooses to use it to reduce compliance costs. A New Zealand borrower’s rating, in comparison with the group borrower’s rating, is reduced by two notches if the parent’s rating is BBB+ or above and one notch if it is below this. A notch is referred to in the legislation as the smallest division within the credit rating categories (for example from AA to AA- or AA- to A+). This distinction is made as a two notch difference is only available where the New Zealand borrower would not end up below BBB-. BBB- is the lowest credit rating that is still investment grade. A one notch movement at a rating below investment grade would be expected to have a larger impact on the interest rate than a one notch movement at a rating above investment grade. As with the equivalent terminology in the restricted credit rating, the reference to BBB+ uses the rating scale used by Standard & Poor’s and other agencies. An equivalent rating by a different rating agency (such as a Baa1 Moody’s rating) would also be acceptable. 11 The following table sets out the lowest available credit rating for a high BEPS risk borrower with an identifiable parent for certain credit ratings: Group borrower credit rating Maximum spread New Zealand borrower credit rating A 2 notches BBB+ A- 2 notches BBB BBB+ 2 notches BBB- BBB 1 notch BBB- BBB- 1 notch BB+ BB+ 1 notch BB Optional credit rating The optional credit rating in section GC 16(5) and (11) allows a New Zealand borrower to apply a credit rating to an amount of their related party borrowing that is the same as that implied from significant 1 third party borrowing by a member of their New Zealand group. For a borrower that could use the default credit rating the optional credit rating would be consistent with this; however, this option is available for all borrowers, including insuring or lending persons, wit h cross-border related borrowing and third party debt. The optional credit rating allows the credit rating of a cross-border related borrowing to be set under the same credit rating that can be implied from third party lo ng-term senior unsecured debt. This is based on the same principle as the third party exceptions used for disregarded features and described below. As with the disregarded features exception the optional credit rating can be used for cross-border related borrowing with a principal of up to four times the third party debt – this restrict ion is to prevent a borrower using a small amount of expensive third party debt to just ify a full deduction for the interest on a large amount of expensive related party debt. The focus on unsecured debt only is intended to be favourable to taxpayers as this debt represents the credit risk of the borrower as a whole compared with secured debt which represents some reduction in credit risk by virtue of the secured lenders preferential ranking relative to the unsecured lenders in the event of a default. Usually a well secured loan will have an interest rate that implies a higher credit rating than that of the lower ranking debt of the entity, such as unsecured or subordinated debt. Where a borrower has both secured and unsecured third party borrowing it would be appropriate for the optional credit rating to be based on the lower credit rating implied by the unsecured debt. Choosing to use the restricted, group or optional credit rating As referred to above, a borrower can choose to apply the restricted credit rating, group credit rating or optional credit rating in certain circumstances. Where this is available, no election notice is required. The method is chosen by calculating a deduction under 1 “Significant” is not a term used in the legislation, but is discussed in the next paragraph. 12 the method and including this in the income tax return that first includes this arrangement. Once a borrower chooses a method for a particular arrangement in their first income tax return they cannot change to a different method in a subsequent return. What is a high BEPS risk? A borrower will generally be unable to use its standalone credit rating (default credit rating) and required to use the group or restricted credit rating options when it is a high BEPS risk, and the optional credit rating does not apply. This will occur when at least one of two factors is present: High New Zealand group debt percentage A borrower with an identifiable parent has a high New Zealand group debt percentage if it s debt percentage is greater than 40%, unless its rat io is within 110% of it s worldwide group (section GC 16(4)(b)). Where there is no identifiable parent, the 110% safe harbour cannot apply and the equivalent relevant test is in section GC 16(3)(c). Borrowing from a low tax rate jurisdiction different from the ultimate parent Borrowing from a low tax jurisdiction is borrowing from a lender resident in a country where the interest is subject to a lower than 15% tax rate. This factor is in section GC 16(3)(c)(i) and (ii) , and GC 16(4) (b)(i) and (ii) for borrowers without and with an identifiable parent respectively. This factor does not apply if the ultimate owner of that lender is also resident in that jurisdiction. This factor is intended to apply to lending routed through a low tax country, which may be structured to achieve a tax advantage. It should not apply simply because a lender group is based in a low tax country. This factor does not apply to entities that are subject to lower, or no, tax due to a policy decision such as exempt sovereign wealth funds. This is achieved, by looking at both the lender’s own tax rate and the tax rate that would apply to a company with the usual tax status of a company. This test considers the jurisdiction of each lender when a loan is provided by more than one person. If any of the lenders of a specific loan fail this test the borrower will be a high BEPS risk for that entire loan rather than just the portion provided by the lender in the low tax jurisdiction. Calculation dates The high BEPS risk tests are calculated on the latest calculation date provided by section GC 16(6). For a loan that is entered into, renewed or renegotiated after the new rules apply the calculation date will be the day the loan is entered into (under paragraph (6)(b)) or the day it is renewed or renegotiated (under paragraph (6)(c)). The calculation dates for other loans is covered separately below. 13 The calculation date may not be on a thin capitalisation measurement date 2 . To reduce compliance costs of a borrower determining whether it exceeds the 40% threshold on that date , section GC 16(7) allows the borrower to estimate their debt percentage by making appropriate adjustments to the thin capitalisation calculations done on the most recent measurement date rather than having to re-do the entire calculation. While ”appropriate adjustments” is not defined this is intended to include the effect of the new loan as well as any actions related to that wider arrangement such as using the loan to repay an existing loan or purchase a new asset. De minimis A de minimis has been included in section GC 16(3)(b) and GC 16(4)(a) to minimise compliance costs of borrowers with smaller amounts of related party cross-border loans. A borrower with less than $10 million of cross-border related borrowing will not have to consider the credit rating adjustment part of the rules and will apply the default credit rating as they do now. The optional credit rating will continue to be available for a borrower with less than $10 million of cross-border related borrowing who chooses to use it. The de minimis continues to apply to a loan in future years even if the de minimis is not satisfied in those future years, unless the loan is renewed, extended or renegotiated. The borrower will have to consider whether the de minimis applies each time they enter into a new cross-border related borrowing. An equivalent de minimis also applies in sections GC 17(b) and GC 18(1)(a) which are discussed elsewhere in this report. Implicit parental support A borrower must include any implicit support arising because it is a member of the foreign parent’s worldwide group when determining its default credit rating in section GC 16(8) or group credit rating in section GC 16(10)(b). This is consistent with the OECD transfer pricing guidelines 3 , in particular paragraphs 1.157 and 1.164 to 1.167 of those guidelines, reproduced below: 1.157 Comparability issues, and the need for comparability adjustments, can also arise because of the existence of MNE group synergies. In some circumstances, MNE groups and the associated enterprises that comprise such groups may benefit from interactions or synergies amongst group members that would not generally be available to similarly situated independent enterprises. Such group synergies can arise, for example, as a result of combined purchasing power or economies of scale, combined and integrated computer and communication systems, integrated management, elimination of duplication, increased borrowing capacity, and numerous similar factors... Example 1 1.164 P is the parent company of an MNE group engaging in a financial services business. The strength of the group’s consolidated balance sheet makes it possible for P to maintain an AAA credit rating on a consistent basis. S is a member of the MNE group engaged in providing 2 Taxpayers are only required to calculate whether they comply with thin capitalisation on their measurement dates which, under section FE 8, can be daily, 3-monthly or annually. Most taxpayers choose to have an annual measurement date. 3 OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations 2017. 14 the same type of financial services as other group members and does so on a large scale in an important market. On a stand-alone basis, however, the strength of S’s balance sheet would support a credit rating of only Baa. Nevertheless, because of S’s membership in the P group, large independent lenders are willing to lend to it at interest rates that would be charged to independent borrowers with an A rating, i.e. a lower interest rate than would be charged if S were an independent entity with its same balance sheet, but a higher interest rate than would be available to the parent company of the MNE group. 1.165 Assume that S borrows EUR 50 million from an independent lender at the market rate of interest for borrowers with an A credit rating. Assume further that S simultaneously borrows EUR 50 million from T, another subsidiary of P, with similar characteristics as the independent lender, on the same terms and conditions and at the same interest rate charged by the independent lender (i.e. an interest rate premised on the existence of an A credit rating). Assume further that the independent lender, in setting its terms and conditions, was aware of S’s other borrowings including the simultaneous loan to S from T. 1.166 Under these circumstances the interest rate charged on the loan by T to S is an arm’s length interest rate because (i) it is the same rate charged to S by an independent lender in a comparable transaction; and (ii) no payment or comparability adjustment is required for the group synergy benefit that gives rise to the ability of S to borrow from independent enterprises at an interest rate lower than it could were it not a member of the group because the synergistic benefit of being able to borrow arises from S’s group membership alone and not from any deliberate concerted action of members of the MNE group. Example 2 1.167 The facts relating to S’s credit standing and borrowing power are identical to those in the preceding example. S borrows EUR 50 million from Bank A. The functional analysis suggests that Bank A would lend to S at an interest rate applicable to A rated borrowers without any formal guarantee. However, P agrees to guarantee the loan from Bank A in order to induce Bank A to lend at the interest rate that would be available to AAA rated borrowers. Under these circumstances, S should be required to pay a guarantee fee to P for providing the express guarantee. In calculating an arm’s length guarantee fee, the fee should reflect the benefit of raising S’s credit standing from A to AAA, not the benefit of raising S’s credit standing from Baa to AAA. The enhancement of S’s credit standing from Baa to A is attributable to the group synergy derived purely from passive association in the group which need not be compensated under the provisions of this section. The enhancement of S’s credit standing from A to AAA is attributable to a deliberate concerted action, namely the provision of the guarantee by P, and should therefore give rise to compensation. We note that some o f the OECD guidelines, including those quoted above, use the Moody’s rating scale. The rest of this document uses the Standard & Poor’s rating scale which is more common in New Zealand. A rating of Baa3 in the Moody’s scale is equivalent to BBB- in Standard & Poor’s. Group Borrower’s credit rating For simplicit y, the term ‘ group borrower’s credit rating’ is used in a number of places in this report; however, this term is not used in the legislat ion. Instead section GC 16(10)(a) refers to “the credit rating for long-term senior unsecured debt of the member of the borrower’s worldwide group under subpart FE, that has the most such debt”. It is not appropriate to base the parent’s credit rating on the credit rating of the ultimate parent of a group as in some instances this company will not be the highest rated member of the group. For example where the ultimate parent is a non-operating holding company. This entity would not be the one providing implicit support to the 15 New Zealand borrower and it would instead be more appropriate to base the implicit support on the credit rating of a higher rated member of the group. The group borrower’s credit rating is used because it should be easier for the New Zealand borrower to identify this entity without having to obtain the credit rating o f all group members including those that may not have a published credit rating. In most instances the group borrower will be either the main operating entity of the worldwide group or a separate treasury entity that funds the group. Multinationals have a commercial incentive to ensure that the credit rating of the largest group borrower is as high, and therefore the interest rate is as low, as possible. Accordingly the credit rating of the member wit h most long-term senior unsecured debt) is expected to reasonably reflect the credit of the worldwide group. The members of the worldwide group are identified using the existing rules in section FE 17 which is based on entities that are consolidated under generally accepted accounting practice. Where an entity is part of the group but not wholly-owned or does not have exactly the same shareholding as other members of the group this will not exclude that entity from being considered the group borrower for the purpose of these rules. The amount of long-term senior unsubordinated debt is not apportioned to reflect different shareholdings. For example, if a group only has two entities with lo ng-term senior unsecured debt – a 100% owned entity with $400m of debt and a 60% owned entity with $500m of debt – the 60% owned entity would be treated as having debt of $500m rather than $300m and therefore would be the group borrower for the purpose of determining the group credit rating. Long term senior unsecured debt The legislation does not define ‘lo ng term’, as this is a commonly used and understood term. This includes the use of different credit rating scales for short and lo ng term instruments. Typically long term refers to debt with a term when issued of at least one year. In many circumstances a borrower determining which entity in their group has the highest level of long term senior unsecured debt will be able to consider non-current liabilities on each member’s balance sheet. However, this distinction may not be sufficient to differentiate between lo ng-term senior unsecured debt and other instruments such as subordinated or secured debt or where debt that has been issued with a term of more than one year is nearing maturity. The purpose of this part of the rules is to provide a cost-effective measure for determining what an appropriate credit rating for the group is. It will typically not be necessary to identify and classify all debt within an entity or group as it is only important to determine which is the entity with the most senior unsecured debt rather than the absolute amount of such debt. This would be expected to be sufficient where a group has made reasonably efforts to identify the group borrower and the outcome appears fair without the obvious omission of a clearly higher-rated entity. The reason for choosing unsecured debt only is that it more accurately reflects the credit risk of the entity or group rather than the specific security provided. The exclusion of secured debt may also exclude special purpose vehicles (SPVs) set up for a specific project, such as an infrastructure investment. 16 Application to existing arrangements The restricted transfer pricing rule applies to cross-border related borrowing for income years beginning on and after 1 July 2018. This includes existing arrangements entered into before this date in which case, under section GC 19, the interest rate will be calculated at the date the loan was entered into (or renewed, extended or renegotiated if this resulted in the interest rate being reset). The high BEPS risk tests for an existing arrangement can be calculated at either of the following dates: • The last day before the new rules apply – GC 16(6)(a) • When the loan was last repriced before the new rules apply – GC 16(6)(d) No separate election is required for this choice; however, the borrower should document this choice in the records used to support their tax return calculations. In this way a borrower who is a low BEPS risk at either of these two dates will not have to calculate the credit rating adjustment for existing arrangements. They may still have to calculate the impact of the disregarded features (discussed below). The restricted transfer pricing rule will not apply to arrangements that comply with an advance pricing agreement issued by the Commissioner before 1 July 2018. 17 Flowchart 2: Determining the credit rating to use for restricted transfer pricing Mutual Agreement Procedure The mutual agreement procedure (MAP) under an applicable double tax agreement will continue to be available where a group considers the actions of one of the contracting states will result in taxation not in accordance with the agreement.

As with any MAP this would require them to put forward their reasoning as to why the amount allowed as a deduction in New Zealand is insufficient to the lender’s competent authority. Inland Revenue will be able to process the matter as efficiently as possible if a copy of this information is provided to the New Zealand competent authority at the same time. Guarantee fees The restricted transfer pricing rule does not explicitly cover guarantee fees. The OECD is currently developing guidance on how guarantee fees should be treated. IR officials will continue to monitor this situation including whether future legislative change may be required. No fee is appropriate for a guarantee of related party debt. Payment of a guarantee fee to a non-resident related party may be appropriate if it guarantees third party debt. However, this would have to be considered on a case by case basis and would not be expected to materially exceed the cost of a non-resident group member borrowing from a third party and on-lending to the New Zealand borrower with the New Zealand borrower’s interest deduction calculated under the restricted transfer pricing rule. Ignoring surrounding circumstances, terms, and conditions Another way arm’s length interest rates can be inflated is by imposing conditions on the lending that would not normally be found in standard third party debt. That is, conventionally, such terms and conditions would be expected to be resisted or rejected by the borrower or the lender as the case may be. To mitigate this risk the following features, subject to the exemptions below, will be disregarded or adjusted for when considering the pricing of a particular instrument: The term of the loan being greater than 5 years Almost all NZ$ bank debt and the majority of third-party bond issues are for a term of 5 years or less. Due to a (generally) positive sloping yield curve and the lack of comparables with terms of over 5 years, debt with very long duration can be priced higher than equivalent shorter terms. If the term of cross-border related borrowing is more than 5 years section GC 18(4) and (8)(b) will price it as if its term is 5 years unless an exception applies. This pricing should apply for the term of the loan. Further detail is provided on this provision below. Subordination Subordination is where an instrument ranks behind other instruments in the event of default. This reduces the chance of the creditor receiving all their money back in the event the borrower runs into financial difficulty and can be used to justify a higher 19 interest rate. Often in a related party context any subordination will not affect the amount the parent (or other lender within the group) would receive in the event the subsidiary failed. Arrangements with subordination will have that subordination disregarded by section GC 18(3)(g) for the purpose of calculating the price. Exotic features Exotic features are those generally not seen with third-party lending. Section GC 18(3) provides a list of features that will be disregarded in determining the transfer price for cross border related borrowing, which include: • payment other than in money (for example, repaying a loan by issuing shares) • interest payment deferral beyond 12 months; • options which give rise to premiums on interest rates (for example, on early repayment by the borrower); • promissory notes or other instruments which do not provide rights to foreclose/accelerate repayment; • convertibility to equity or other exchange at the option of the borrower; and • contingencies (for example, where interest is repaid only under certain conditions). Deferral beyond 12 months Disregard any increased interest rate that arises where payment of interest is made less than annually to the extent that increase is due to the increased risk of default due to interest being deferred beyond 12 months. This provision will not apply where the increase in interest reflects the loss of the ability to reinvest the deferred interest so that the effective rate of return is the same as if the interest was not deferred. Example 3 The arm’s length rate if a borrower borrows $100 with annual interest is 5%. If instead, the borrower issues a zero coupon bond for $100 with a $127.63 redemption payment in 5 years’ time section GC 18(3)(b) will not apply as this bond has the same 5% interest rate. Any higher interest rate, for example to compensate for the higher credit risk from longer exposure to the borrower, will be disregarded. Third party features While generally the above features will be disregarded under the new rules for cross- border related borrowing, they will be taken into account under section GC 18(9) if the borrower (or its worldwide group, if it is part of one) has a significant amount of third-party debt with that feature. The extent to which disregarded features can be taken into account depends on the structure of either the borrower’s, or its worldwide group’s, third-party debt. That is: 20 • the borrower’s related-party debt can have a disregarded feature in proportion to its third-party debt. For example, if the borrower had $100m of senior third- party debt and $50m of subordinated third-party debt, related-party debt that is 2:1 senior:subordinated would be allowable; or • the character of debt owed by the borrower matches the character of the borrower’s group’s third-party debt provided that type of debt is commercially appropriate in the New Zealand context. For example, say on a worldwide consolidated basis the borrower’s group has $200m of ordinary debt and $50m of convertible notes. If the borrower has $40m of ordinary related-party debt, this means that up to $10m of convertible related-party debt would be allowable (as this means the borrower’s debt character – a 4:1 mix of ordinary and convertible debt – would match that of its group). In order for the borrower to use its own third-party debt to justify an otherwise disregarded feature, that third-party debt must be significant. That is the related-party debt with a feature cannot be more than 4 times the third-party debt with that feature. This is to prevent taxpayers agreeing to small amounts of expensive third-party debt in order to justify expensive related-party debt. Terms greater than 5 years Section GC 18(4) to (8) determines whether a term greater than 5 years is disregarded for the purposes of calculating the interest rate. Section GC 18(4) includes that the 5 year term restriction does not apply to instruments that qualify as regulatory capital under section GC 18(10). This is explained further in the insuring or lending persons section below. For New Zealand borrowers that are not an “insuring or lending person” whether a term of over 5 years can be included in calculating an interest rate is determined under a similar process to the general third party features test above. The rules are necessarily more complicated for the over 5 years terms exclusion as not all loan terms can be treated equally; for example, a 6 year term third party loan could not be used to justify a 30 year term related party loan. The third party exception can either be (at the option of the taxpayer) based on third party debt of the worldwide group or third party debt of the New Zealand group. Due to minor differences in terminology this decision affects which subparagraphs o f sections GC 16(4) to (8) apply. This choice is also consistent with the choice available for other disregarded features in section GC 18(9)(a). The threshold term is calculated at the date the loan was entered into renewed or extended rather than the remaining term. The following table guides through the steps a taxpayer must go through to if they seek to apply the third party exception to a loan with a term over 5 years: 21 Step Reference if using worldwide group third party debt Reference if using New Zealand third party debt 1.

NZ Subsidiary Ltd 4 has existing loans of $700,000 from Foreign Parent with a term of less than 5 years. It enters into three further loans with Foreign Parent with terms over 5 years on successive days and needs to consider what term will be included for setting the interest rate. Loan 1 A $50,000 loan with a term of 7 years. • Section GC 18(8)(a) does not apply as the term of the loan (7 years) does not exceed the threshold term (9 years). • Section GC 18(8)(b)(i) does not apply as related party loans having a term of more than 5 years ($50,000) as a proportion of total related party loans ($700,000 + $50,000 = 750,000) is 6.7% which is less than the threshold fraction of 30%. • Section GC 18(8)(b)(ii) does not apply as related party loans having a term of more than 5 years ($50,000) is less than 4 times the value of worldwide loans with this feature (4 x $30,000,000). • Section GC 18(8)(b)(iii) does not apply as the threshold fraction was not determined under subsection (5)(b)(ii). Therefore the 7 year term is not adjusted and is included in calculating the interest rate. Loan 2 A $100,000 loan with a term of 11 years. • Section GC 18(8)(a)(i) is met as the term of the loan (11 years) exceeds the threshold term (9 years). • Section GC 18(8)(a)(ii) is met as related party loans having a term of more than 5 years ($50,000 + $100,000 = $150,000) as a proportion of total related party loans ($750,000 + $100,000 = $850,000) is 17.6% which is less than the threshold fraction of 30%. Therefore the 11 year term is adjusted to the threshold term of 9 year for the purpose of calculating the interest rate. 4 For simplicity for the purpose of this example disregard the $10 million de minimis in GC 18(2)(a). 23 Loan 3 A $200,000 loan with a term of 9 years. • Section GC 18(8)(a) does not apply as the term of the loan (9 years) does not exceed the threshold term (9 years). • Section GC 18(8)(b)(i) is met as related party loans having a term of more than 5 years ($150,000 + $200,000 = $350,000) as a proportion of total related party loans ($850,000 + $200,000 = $1,050,000) is 33.3% which exceeds the threshold fraction of 30%. Therefore the 9 year term is adjusted to 5 years for the purpose of calculating the interest rate. Example 5 Foreign Co has three senior unsecured loans from third parties. These are each for US$100 million and had terms at issue of 5 years, 10 years and 15 years respectively, so the average maturity of their long- term senior unsecured debt is 10 years. NZ Co, a wholly owned subsidiary of Foreign Co, has a loan from Foreign Co for NZ$20 million with a term of 10 years. Foreign Co’s threshold term is 12.5 years as the 5 year loan is not included in the calculation. However, their threshold fraction is US$200 million/US$300 million or 2/3. As NZ Co’s threshold fraction of NZ$20 million/NZ$20 million or 1/1 would exceed Foreign Co’s threshold fraction the term would be adjusted to 5 years. Foreign Co chooses to restructure their loan to NZ Co by lending NZ$10 million for 5 years and NZ$10 million for 12.5 years and using this to repay the original NZ$20 million loan. As NZ Co’s threshold term of 12.5 years and threshold fraction of NZ$10 million/NZ$20 million or 1/2 is now less than Foreign Co no adjustment is made under the restricted transfer pricing rule. Example 6 NZ Co has a $100 million 30 year loan from its parent, Foreign Co and no third party debt. The interest rate on this loan is reset on 1 January each year. Foreign Co has an embedded call option whereby it can demand repayment on the reset date provided it gives 30 days prior notice. Foreign Co does not face any more risk than if they provided a one year loan that was rolled over each year. The term of this loan would be required to be adjusted to 5 years but the annual interest rate reset and embedded call option would continue to be included in the pricing so it is unlikely any adjustment would be required to the amount of deductible interest. 24 Flowchart 3: Determining the interest rate on a particular instrument – not for insuring or lending persons Credit ratings of insuring or lending persons Financial institutions (referred to in the legislation as an “insuring or lending person”) are generally required to use their parent’s credit rating rather than the default credit rating, restricted credit rating or group credit rating discussed above. There are two reasons for this: • Financial inst itutions are more integral to their worldwide group in that a default is more likely to affect the risk perception of the worldwide group. This result s in a higher level of implicit support. • Financial institutions apply a different business model with much higher levels of leverage and, as interest is their main income source, calculating their debt percentage under the standard thin capitalisation rules is not appropriate.

These last two bullet points are dealt with by section GC 15(2)(d) and (e) respectively. An example of the last category is a motor vehicle importer which also operates a finance company to allow their customers to lease their vehicles. This will essentially require the group to be split into two for the purpose of applying the rules with the finance company subsidiary having a credit rating under section GC 17 and the remainder of the group applying section GC 16. If importing motor vehicles and operating a finance company was undertaken in a single company, the company would need to determine it s main business activity so that it is either an insuring or lending person or not an insuring or lending person. Credit ratings The default credit rating for insuring or lending persons is the group borrower’s credit rating in section GC 17(a). Unlike the approach for non-insuring or lending persons there is no high-BEPS risk test and there is no difference between the group borrower’s rating and the New Zealand borrower’s rating. In many instances, including the majority of the banking industry on their current ratings, this should not provide a practical restriction as the New Zealand rating is already the same as the group borrower’s. Even if the group borrower and New Zealand subsidiary ratings diverge in the future this may not impose a restriction in practice due to the availability of the optional credit rating – which is explained further below. Although the credit rating must be the same as the group borrower’s this does not require the interest rates on identical debt to be identical. If there is market observable data that a New Zealand financial institution with the same credit rating as its group borrower pays a higher or lower interest rate for an equivalent instrument, then the new rules will not prevent that differential also applying in the determination o f interest rates on cross-border related borrowing. One notable example that has been identified is the credit rating of certain insurance companies. Many insurance companies, either internationally or in New Zealand, will have a high credit rating but little or no debt compared with another entity in the group that will have a slightly lower credit rating but the majority of borrowing for the group. As noted above, the group borrower’s credit rating is based on the entity in the group with the highest amount of long-term senior unsecured debt. Therefore the credit rating of the insurance group will be based on the credit rating of the entity that 26 borrows externally which will be lower than the credit rating of the insurance company. This lower rating should more accurately reflect the actual borrowing costs of the group. There are two alternative methods of determining the credit rating. The first is a $10 million de minimis in section GC 17(b). This is consistent with the $10 million de minimis for non-insuring or lending persons, and allows an insuring or lending person with less than $10 million of cross-border related borrowing to apply the credit rating that would apply under the standard transfer pricing rules in the absence of the restricted transfer pricing rule. The second alternative method is the optional credit rating in GC 17(c). This follows the same methodology as the optional credit rating for non-insuring or lending persons. The borrower can use the credit rating implied from this debt of up to four times the value of the third party debt. Further detail on this method is provided in the non-insuring or lending person section above. Regulatory capital of banks, insurers and non-bank deposit takers The Reserve Bank requires banks, insurance companies and non-bank deposit takers to hold certain levels of capital to support their operations. Some of this regulatory capital can take the form of debt with deductible interest for tax purposes. There are legitimate commercial reasons why multinational banking and insurance groups often issue regulatory capital in their home country, and then invest some of that regulatory capital down into other countries where they operate. Where this capital is passed down to New Zealand, it would not necessarily satisfy the general third party exception as: • the foreign parent will often be subject to different regulatory requirements in it s home jurisdiction so will have issued instruments with different features; or • the worldwide group may have a more comprehensive range of activities in it s home jurisdict ion. An example is a group that operates a bank and an insurance company internationally but only operates as an insurance company in New Zealand. It is important that the tax rules do not discourage the existence of regulatory capital as that increases the risk of that business being unable to meet its obligations to depositors, policy ho lders or other creditors. For banks, insurance companies and non-bank deposit takers the third party test is replaced with a regulatory capital test in section GC 18(10). This test allows a bank, insurance company or non-bank deposit taker to include features in pricing related party debt if that feature was required for the instrument to be recognised by the Reserve Bank as regulatory capital or solvency capital, even where those features would otherwise have to be disregarded under the restricted transfer pricing rules. There are four further areas of detail on this regulatory capital test which are: 27 • minimum standards; • terms; • disqualification; and • back-to-back loans. Minimum standards Banks, insurance companies and non-bank deposit takers usually maintain regulatory capital above the minimum standards, primarily so they can remain above the standards if a future event, including losses and payments of dividends, causes their level to drop. Banks can also issue different levels of capital depending on what features it has. Potential loss of interest deductions should not discourage this behaviour. Any features that are required to meet the Reserve Bank requirements should be included in pricing even where the entity is over the minimum standard or where it issues a type of capital that has a greater risk than another type of capital. Terms Under the current regulatory framework, banks can issue Tier 2 capital which, amongst other requirements, must have a minimum original maturity of at least five years. However, when such an instrument has less than five years to maturity, the amount that is recognised as regulatory capital is amortised on a straight-line basis at a rate of 20% per annum as follows: Years to maturity Amount recognised More than 4 100% Less than and including 4 but more than 3 80% Less than and including 3 but more than 2 60% Less than and including 2 but more than 1 40% Less than and including 1 20% Due to this amortisation, banks are incentivised to issue Tier 2 capital for terms exceeding the minimum 5 years. Section GC 18(4) recognises this by allowing any term of greater than 5 years to be included in pricing on any instrument that is recognised as regulatory capital, even though that longer term is not required in order for the instrument to qualify as regulatory capital. Section GC 13(1)(b) still requires identifying conditions that independent parties after real and independent bargaining might be expected to agree upon for the comparable transactions. This means terms would not be expected to be significantly longer than the term of equivalent Tier 2 capital issued to third parties, or where there is no such capital what would be expected to be agreed by a New Zealand borrower who was issuing Tier 2 capital to third parties. 28 Disqualification From time to time, the Reserve Bank changes the regulatory capital requirements. For example, it is currently consulting on removing the requirement for regulatory capital to convert to common equity in certain circumstances. Where there is a regulatory change there will often be a transitional period where a former regulatory capital instrument will only be partially recognised and will eventually cease to qualify as regulatory capital. Where this occurs, the bank or insurance company will not necessarily repay the instrument as there may be other commercial reasons to retain it (such as meeting the expectations of external investors). The features that formerly qualified it as regulatory capital will still be present, even where it ceases to qualify as regulatory capital. In these circumstances, these features will still be included in the pricing, so the test is based on the instrument qualifying as regulatory capital when it was entered into rather than any subsequent changes. Officials will monitor the use of this provision and would not expect an insuring or lending person to maintain high priced related party debt that no longer qualifies as regulatory capital when there is no commercial reason to do so other than to obtain a higher tax deduction than on a new instrument, especially when equivalent third party instruments have been repaid. Back-to-back loans Some banks, insurance companies and non-bank deposit takers have an entity, such as a New Zealand holding company or a New Zealand branch of the foreign parent, which is not itself regulated by the Reserve Bank but that raises funds from the worldwide group to on-lend to the regulated ent ity. A consequence of this is a New Zealand taxpayer may receive high priced debt with features that provide no direct benefit to it as a stand-alone entity but will match the instrument/funding on-lent to a group member which is regulated and therefore the group is provided with a regulatory benefit. Any features included in an instrument issued by a non-regulated entity that would be necessary for it to qualify as regulatory capital (refer to the tests discussed above) if the entity was a regulated entity will be included in pricing provided that instrument is part of a back-to-back loan to the regulated entity/group. These two instruments are referred to in the legislation as the funding arrangement and the funded arrangement. This is achieved in section GC 18(10)(b), (d) and (f) by requiring that the feature “reflects” a feature of regulatory or solvency capital. This term is not intended to require perfect mirroring between features of the funding and funded arrangements but this should not provide the opportunity for inclusion of any features in the funding arrangement under the pretext of imperfect mirroring. The inclusion or non-inclusion of a feature in the funding or funded arrangement should not prevent that instrument qualifying in respect of other features. Where more judgement is required is where a different feature is included in the funding arrangement than in the funded arrangement. An appropriate approach would be to include a feature in a funding arrangement, which does not exactly match a feature in a funded arrangement, only if 29 the feature provides protection to the banking/insuring/deposit taker associate in a similar circumstance to that faced under the funding arrangement. Furthermore the increase in price due to the feature in the funding arrangement should not exceed the increase in price due to the feature in the funded arrangement. Not all regulatory capital will be a financial arrangement as a bank may also issue preference shares which are an excepted financial arrangement. The rules also allo w the funded arrangement to be an excepted financial arrangement while the funding arrangement is a financial arrangement. In this instance it is expected that the terms of both arrangements will less perfectly mirror each other than where the funded arrangement is a financial arrangement; however, the paragraph above that discusses the limits on features of the funding arrangement will continue to be relevant. 30 Flowchart 4: Determining whether a feature can be included in pricing for banks, insurance companies and non-bank deposit takers No Yes No Yes No Yes No U se c r edit r ating determined in flow cha rt 2 Does the loan quali fy as regulatory capital by the Reserve Bank?

The thin capitalisation rules in subpart FE have been amended so that debt percentages will now be based on an entity’s assets net of its “non-debt liabilities”. A number of other changes have been made to strengthen the thin capitalisat ion rules. These are: • a de minimis in the inbound thin capitalisation rules; • reducing the ability for companies owned by a group of non-residents to use related-party debt; • new rules for when a company can use an asset valuation for thin capitalisation purposes that is different from what is used for financial reporting purposes; • an anti-avoidance rule that applies when a taxpayer substantially repays a loan just before the end of a year to circumvent the thin capitalisation rules; and • a minor remedial to clarify how the owner-linked debt rules apply when the borrower is a trust. Application date These amendments apply to income years starting on or after 1 July 2018. Grandparenting for five years has been included for the 110 percent debt threshold for non-residents acting together, which is set out in more detail below. Key features The thin capitalisation rules in subpart FE have been amended so that the debt percentages are based on an entity’s assets net of its non-debt liabilities. This applies to both inbound and outbound thin capitalisation. There are consequential amendments to the Controlled Foreign Company (CFC) rules in subpart EX of the Act to ensure the non-debt liabilities adjustment applies in relation to the CFC rules where relevant. A number of other changes have also been made to the thin capitalisation rules. These changes have: • Extended the de minimis in section FE 6 of the outbound thin capitalisation rules (New Zealand companies with foreign subsidiaries) to the inbound thin capitalisation rules (foreign controlled New Zealand companies). 32 • Reduced the 110 percent worldwide debt threshold to 100 percent for a NZ group controlled by a group of non-residents acting together for the purposes of the interest apportionment rule in section FE 6. • Strengthened the integrity of the rules that allow taxpayers to value assets using values not reported in their financial accounts for the purposes of determining total group assets under section FE 16. • Introduced an anti-avoidance rule in new section GB 51B to prevent taxpayers circumventing the thin capitalisation rules by repaying a loan just before a measurement date. • Amended the owner-linked debt provisions in section FE 18(3B) to ensure they operate correctly for trusts. Background to non-debt liabilities The thin capitalisation rules form part of New Zealand’s international tax rules and are designed to protect our tax base. Like many countries, New Zealand has been reviewing its thin capitalisation/interest limitation rules in light of the OECD’s 2015 Final Report, Limiting Base Erosion Involving Interest Deductions and Other Financial Payments, on Action 4 of the BEPS Action Plan. This review identified aspects of New Zealand’s thin capitalisation rules that could be strengthened, and these aspects were subject to public consultation that followed the release of the Government discussion document, BEPS – Strengthening our interest limitation rules, in March 2017. New Zealand’s thin capitalisation rules are based on the principle that a multinational group should not have significantly less capital in New Zealand, relative to the size of its New Zealand business, than it has on a worldwide basis, unless it has no more than a 60% debt/assets ratio. Historically this comparison has been made by comparing the ratio of debt to assets for the New Zealand group with the same ratio for the worldwide group. This measure did not deal well wit h companies wit h non-debt liabilities. When a New Zealand group has significant non-debt liabilities, its debt/assets ratio can appear relatively low, even though it has very little equity contributed by its owners. The thin capitalisation rules in subpart FE have been amended to prevent this, by excluding non-debt liabilities from the definition of assets. The non-debt liabilities change better aligns New Zealand’s thin capitalisation regime with its core objectives and with other countries’ thin capitalisat ion rules. Detailed analysis Non-debt liabilities adjustment Section FE 12 has been amended so that in calculating its New Zealand group debt percentage, an entity will be required to measure its assets net of its non-debt liabilities, as defined in section FE 16B. 33 In addition, there are consequential amendments to sections EX 20D and EX 20E to ensure the non-debt liabilities adjustment also applies in relation to the CFC rules where relevant. Section FE 16B has separate, albeit similar, definitions for non-debt liabilities depending on whether they are being calculated for the New Zealand group (section FE 16B(1)) or the worldwide group (section FE 16B(2)). Non-debt liabilities for New Zealand group – section FE 16B(1) For a New Zealand group, non-debt liabilities are all liabilities shown in the entity or group’s financial statements, except for: • liabilities that are debt under section FE 15; • certain interest-free loans from shareholders; • certain shares held by shareholders; • provisio ns for dividends; and • certain deferred tax liabilities. This effectively means that non-debt liabilities comprise the liabilities that are not debt, nor shareholder funding that is akin to group equity, and certain deferred tax liabilities. This represents a broad range of liabilities that include, but are not limited to: • trade credits; • GST payable; • provisions and accruals for employee benefits such as wages, bonuses, redundancy and holiday pay and long service leave; • financial liabilities from derivatives such as interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts; and • current and deferred tax liabilities. The exclusions in paragraphs FE 16B(1)(a) to (e) are covered in more detail below. Debt liabilities Paragraph (a) excludes from non-debt liabilities any liabilities that are counted as debt under section FE 15. This includes, but is not limited to, financial arrangements that provide funds to the entity and give rise to deductions for the entity. Financial arrangements that provide funds include finance leases and some credit sales. This is discussed in the definition of “cross-border related borrowing” above. The primary example of debt liabilities is interest-bearing debt. 34 Interest-free loans from shareholders Paragraph (b) excludes from non-debt liabilities any financial arrangements providing funding to the entity if either: • the funding is advanced pro rata with shareholding; and/or • the shareholder (along with any associated persons) holds 10 percent or more of the voting interests in the company. This is because such loans are akin to group equity if they are held pro rata with shareholding, or by a substantial shareholder. This exclusion is targeted at interest-free loans from shareholders. The exclusion does not include related-party agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services (defined in section YA 1 and colloquially known as trade credits), which will therefore be treated in the same way as other non-debt liabilities. Trade credits are treated this way because the price payable for the corresponding goods or services is generally increased by an implicit interest charge for the deferral of payment, and therefore it is not appropriate to treat them as non-interest bearing. Example 7 A Co is owned by two non-resident shareholders in the following proportions: B Co (80%) and C Co (20%). B Co and C Co provide a combination of interest-bearing and interest-free loans in proportion to their shareholdings. The interest-bearing loans are debt under section FE 12 and therefore are not non-debt liabilities under section FE 16B(1)(a). The interest-free loans are not debt under section FE 12 but also are not non-debt liabilities under section FE 16B(1)(b) as the loans are advanced in proportion to shareholding. Therefore, neither the interest-bearing nor interest free loans should be treated as non-debt liabilities for thin capitalisation purposes. This means the interest-bearing loans will have the same effect on A Co’s thin capitalisation calculation as any other third party loan, while the interest free loans will have the same effect as shareholder equity. Preference shares Shares can be treated as liabilities for accounting purposes in some circumstances (for example, if the shares are redeemable at the holder’s option or on a specific date). Paragraph(c) excludes shares held by a shareholder from the definition of a non-debt liability if either: • the funding is advanced pro rata with shareholding; and/or • the shareholder (along with any associated persons) holds 10 percent or more of the voting interests in the company. 35 Similar to the exclusion targeted at interest-free loans in paragraph (b) such shares are akin to group equity if they are held pro rata with shareholding, or by a substantial shareholder. Otherwise it is appropriate for them to be excluded in determining the extent of equity funding in a New Zealand group. Provisions for dividends Paragraph (d) excludes a provision for dividends from the definition of a non-debt liability. This is because it is similar in substance to an interest-free loan from shareholders. Deferred tax liabilities Paragraph (e) excludes a deferred tax liability from the definition of a non-debt liability if it satisfies three requirements. The general purpose of these requirements is to exclude a deferred tax liability only if it has in effect already been taken into account in the valuation of the relevant asset. The three requirements are: • it arises as a result of the difference between the value of an asset in the financial statements and the amount which remains depreciable or deductible for tax purposes; • it reflects an amount of tax that would not arise if the relevant asset were sold for the value in the financial statements; and • the value of the relevant asset in the financial statements takes into account the deduction or depreciation actually available for tax purposes in relation to the asset (rather than the deduction or depreciation recorded in the financial statements), or on the basis that the asset is non-depreciable or depreciable at a rate of zero. The first limb will be met relatively often, due to either a difference between accounting and tax depreciation rates, or asset revaluations. The second limb means that a deferred tax liability relating to a depreciable asset can only be excluded from being a non-debt liability to the extent that it is higher than the tax that would be payable if the asset was sold for its accounting value. This means that the deferred tax liability should still be taken into account to the extent it would be tax paid on depreciation recovery income if the asset was disposed of. The third limb reflects the “no double-counting” purpose of the exclusion. If the valuation of an asset already reflects the limited amount of depreciation available for tax purposes, it is not appropriate for the difference between accounting and tax depreciation to be taken into account again by way of the reduction in the thin capitalisation denominator for non-debt liabilities. For instance, in the case of a building which is revalued after buildings became depreciable at a rate of 0% (i.e. the 2011-12 income year), the accounting value of the building would be expected to recognise there are no depreciation deductions. For the avoidance of doubt, the third limb should not exclude a deferred tax liability relating to a building which was acquired before buildings became depreciable at a 36 rate of 0% (i.e. the 2011-12 income year), if the building has not been revalued in the financial statements since that time. In that case the value (say original cost) of the building in the financial statements reflects an assumption of depreciability, so it is reasonable that the deferred tax liability does reduce the thin capitalisation denominator. Example 8 D Co is currently recognising a deferred tax liability on its buildings of $4.2m calculated as follows: Accounting Base Tax Base Temporary Difference Tax Rate DTA/(DTL) 15m 0 15m 28% (4.2m) D Co purchased the building in 1995 for $20m. It claimed tax depreciation of $8m on the building until the depreciation rate was reduced to 0% from the 2011-12 income year. The building has not been revalued for accounting purposes since that time although accounting depreciation continues to reduce its carrying value which is currently $15m. This results in a deferred tax liability of $4.2m which is recognised in the financial statements. Question Can any of the deferred tax liability be excluded from being a non-debt liability under section FE 16B(1)(e)? Answer No. The accounting value of $15m has not been revalued to take into account the 0% depreciation on the building for tax purposes. Therefore, the third limb of section FE 16B(1)(e) is not met. Example 9 The facts are the same as above, except that the building has been revalued for accounting purposes post-the 2011-12 income year to $30m. The revaluation was undertaken on a discounted cash flow basis that reflects that there is no tax depreciation shield from the building. Accounting Base Tax Base Temporary Difference Tax Rate DTA/(DTL) 30m 0 30m 28% (8.4m) Can any of the deferred tax liability be excluded from being a non-debt liability under section FE 16B(1)(e)? Yes. The first limb is met as any deferred tax liability will fall within its ambit. The second limb is met to the extent that it reflects an untaxed capital gain if the building was sold for $30m (i.e. $2.8m, being $30m-$20m x 0.28). The third limb is met as the $30m valuation takes into account that tax depreciation on buildings is 0%. This means that $2.8m of the DTL of $8.4m will be excluded from being a non-debt liability under section FE 16B(1)(e). 37 Example 10 Y Co’s balance sheet is as follows: Assets 200 Interest-bearing debt 50 Deferred tax liability\* 30 Provision for dividends 15 Equity 105 \*The deferred tax liability may be split into $10 that meets criteria of section FE 16B(1)(e) and $20 that does not. The $10 deferred tax liability may reflect that the accounting value recognised in the financial statements for a particular class of assets already takes into account the level of tax depreciation shield available for those assets. Z Co’s debt for the purposes of the thin capitalisation rules is $50. Its total liabilities are $95, but $15 of this is a provision for dividend and $10 of the deferred tax liability meets the criteria of section FE 16B(1)(e). Both of these are excluded from being non-debt liabilities. Its non-debt liabilities are $20 and its thin capitalisation percentage under section FE 12 is 50 ÷ (200 - 20) = 27.8%. Note that Z Co may not wish to consider whether any component of its deferred tax liability meets the criteria of section FE 16B(1)(e). In such a case, it treats the full quantum of the deferred tax liability as a non-debt liability and it would calculate its thin capitalisation percentage under section FE 12 to be 50 ÷ (200 – 30) = 29.4%. Example 11 Z Co’s balance sheet is as follows: Assets 100 Interest-bearing debt 20 Non-debt liability – trade credits 10 Interest free loan from parent 20 Equity 50 Z Co’s debt for the purposes of the thin capitalisation rules is $20. Its total liabilities are $50, but $20 of this is an interest-free loan from Z Co’s parent company and $20 is debt, which are both excluded from being non-debt liabilities. Its non-debt liabilities are therefore $10 (trade credits) and its thin capitalisation debt percentage under section FE 12 is 20 ÷ (100 – 10) = 22.2 percent. Non-debt liabilities for worldwide group – sections FE 16B(2) and FE 18 For a worldwide group, non-debt liabilities means: • all liabilities (as shown in the entity’s financial statements) that are not counted as debt under section FE 18; less • any owner-linked debt that is excluded under section FE 18(3B), as such debt is treated as equity for the purposes of the worldwide group debt test. This is similar to the definition of non-debt liabilities for a New Zealand group, although there are fewer exclusions. 38 Consequential amendments to the CFC rules – sections EX 20D and 20E In calculating the net attributing CFC income or loss for a CFC, sections EX 20D and EX 20E outline rules to help determine the deductibility of interest expenditure for excessively-debt funded CFCs. The test for whether a CFC is considered to be excessively debt-funded is whether it has a debt-asset ratio, determined under section EX 20D(4), of more than 0.75 and also has a relative debt-asset ratio, determined under section EX 20E, of more than 1.10. Similar to the changes to the thin capitalisation rules in subpart FE, sections EX 20D and EX 20E have been amended to reflect that non-debt liabilities should be deducted from the denominator of the formula in calculating the CFC’s debt-asset ratio and the CFC’s relative debt-asset ratio. The meaning of non-debt liabilities for the purposes of these calculations is the total value of the non-debt liabilities determined under generally accepted accounting practice for the CFC and group respectively, as provided in sections EX 20D(8B) and (6B) respectively. De minimis for inbound thin cap Section FE 6(3)(ac)(i) provides a de minimis which means that a person subject to the outbound thin capitalisation rules does not derive an amount of income (equivalent to any disallowed interest) if they have a group finance cost for a year of less than $1 million. The de minimis reduces between $1 million to $2 million of group finance cost. This is achieved by section FE 6(ac)(ii) or (iii), which reduce the amount of income derived by an excess debt entity but only where paragraph (i) does not apply. Amendments to section FE 6(3)(ac) have extended this de minimis to a person subject to the inbound thin capitalisation rules unless they have owner-linked debt – that is debt from a person with an ownership interest in the entity – under section FE 18(3B). This change is intended to reduce compliance costs for smaller firms. Worldwide debt test for non-residents acting together The inbound thin capitalisation rules were extended with application from the 2015- 16 tax year to include New Zealand entities owned by non-residents that act together as a group in relation to the way they fund a New Zealand investment and own 50 percent or more of that entit y (we refer to these New Zealand entities as “group controlled”). The 2015-16 changes also tightened what is known as the “110 percent worldwide debt test” in the inbound rules, which compares the amount of debt in a group’s worldwide operations to the debt in their New Zealand operations. The effect of section FE 18(3B) is that owner-linked debt (as discussed above) is excluded when calculating the worldwide debt percentage. A New Zealand group’s allowable debt percentage under section FE 5(1)(a) is the greater of 60 percent of its assets and 110 percent of its worldwide debt percentage. For a group controlled New Zealand entity, the worldwide group is the New Zealand group itself under section FE 31D, as a company owned or controlled by a group of 39 non-residents acting together has no identifiable parent. As such, the 110 percent worldwide debt test is effectively a measure of the New Zealand group’s total debt relat ive to its third-party debt. This means that shareholders of group controlled entities with high levels of third- party debt were able to invest in New Zealand predominantly through owner-linked debt. For example, a project funded 90 percent with third-party debt could have 9 percent shareholder debt and only 1 percent equity without breaching the thin capitalisat ion limit. Sections FE 5(1)(ab) and FE 6(3)(e)(iii) require that when a taxpayer has a worldwide group given by section FE 31D, interest deductions will be denied if the entity has any owner-linked debt and its total debt level exceeds 60 percent. In effect, this means that its allowable debt level is the greater of 60 percent and 100 percent of its third-party debt rather than the greater of 60 percent and 110 percent of its third-party debt as was previously the case. Grandparenting For relevant ent it ies that are above 60 percent total debt and 100 percent of their third party debt, transit io nal provisio ns have been included in section FZ 8. In determining its allowable debt level, A group controlled entity can continue using its current percentage of its worldwide group debt percentage up to the 110 percent threshold for up to five years from the rules applying. The borrower’s current percentage of third party debt can be calculated at either the date of introduction of the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill (6 December 2017) or the thin capitalisation measurement date immediately prior to this. Example 12 On 30 June 2018, NZ Co’s worldwide group debt percentage is 70% and its debt percentage is 76.3% which is 109% of its worldwide debt percentage. NZ Co enters into a new loan with a third party in 2019y. As a result, its debt percentage as a percentage of its worldwide group debt percentage drops to 105% (because NZ Co’s related-party debt level has not changed since year 2018). NZ Co’s allowable debt level under the transitional provisions will stay at 109% of its worldwide group debt percentage. In 2020, NZ Co repays a number of large loans and, as a result, the debt percentage of its New Zealand group drops to 55%. NZ Co does not need to rely on its grandparented 109% of worldwide debt anymore, but is still covered by the grandparenting provisions for the remainder of the five-year period. This means that NZ Co will not be denied interest deductions if its debt percentage exceeds 60% in 2021 unless its debt percentage also exceeds 109% of its worldwide debt percentage. Asset valuation In general, the thin capitalisation rules are based on the value of a company’s assets as reported in its financial statements. However, a company may use the net current value of an asset as an alternative provided that would be allowable under generally accepted accounting principles. 40 Asset valuations reported in financial statements are subject to a higher level of scrutiny than asset valuations that are adopted solely for thin capitalisation purposes. Moreover, there was a concern that taxpayers may be valuing assets for thin capitalisation purposes without seeking an independent valuation. New section FE 16(1BAA) provides that taxpayers can only use the net current value of an asset if they have received a valuation from an independent valuer or the valuation methodology, assumptions and data have been approved by an independent valuer. This provision does not provide guidance on how frequently such a valuation must be undertaken. It would not be practical to expect a valuation to be undertaken for each period; however, times when a valuation may be necessary include where there is an impairment event for financial reporting purposes or if the taxpayer is seeking to increase the value. Anti-avoidance rule around measurement dates Section FE 8 provides a taxpayer’s assets and liabilities can be valued for thin capitalisation purposes on a daily, 3 monthly or annual basis. An annual measurement date is the simplest and most widely-used of these approaches. Annual valuation means taxpayers can use the annual measurement date to effectively breach the thin capitalisation debt limits for up to one year without facing any interest denial, by partly repaying a loan or converting it to equity on or before their balance date. Previously section FE 11 prevented taxpayers from benefitting from temporary increases or decreases in values if the change had a purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the thin capitalisation rules. However, this section only applied to changes between measurement dates and did not cover the initial year when an arrangement was entered into. Section FE 11 has been amended and new section GB 51B reconstructs certain situations, transactions or arrangements where a taxpayer subject to the thin capitalisation rules substantially repays a loan or, more generally, enters into a transaction near a measurement date with the purpose or effect of manipulating the thin capitalisation rules. Owner-linked debt when the borrower is a trust To reduce compliance costs, the owner-linked debt provisions in section FE 18(3B) only count debt as owner-linked if the owner has an ownership interest in a member of the group of companies of 5 percent or more. This test worked correctly when the entity was a company but not if it was a trust as settlements on a trust do not convey ownership interests. Amendments to section FE 18(3B) now count debt as owner-linked if the owner: • has a direct ownership interests in a member of the group of 5 percent or more; or 41 • has made 5 percent or more (by value) of the settlements on the trust. Worldwide group debt percentage and the on-lending concession Existing section FE 13 allows the debt percentage of a New Zealand group and a worldwide group to be reduced to the extent a person subject to thin capitalisation has provided funds to an unrelated party or is a trust with no property other than financial arrangements and incidental property. This is known as the on-lending concession. If a person (or group) who can rely on the on-lending concession has a mixture of funding from related and unrelated parties there was previously no guidance on which debt was reduced or how the reduction was allocated between the two sources of debt. This becomes a problem when the person is controlled by a non-resident owning body or trustee under section FE 31D so that the New Zealand group is the worldwide group. New section FE 18(3B) confirms that when a person applies the on-lending concession the proportion of related and unrelated party debt remains the same as prior to the on-lending concession being applied. 42 INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT FINANCE Sections CH 10B, FE 4B, FE 7B and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Amendments have been made that will provide entities carrying out eligible infrastructure projects a limited exemption from the thin capitalisation rules by allowing them to claim deductions on debt that exceeds the thresholds set out in section FE 5(1). The debt that is allowed to exceed the ordinary thin capitalisation thresholds under this rule is limited to third-party debt (or debt that is from an investor but is made in the capacity of a third-party lender) that only has recourse against the assets associated with the infrastructure project and the income arising from those assets. Background This measure is intended to deepen the market and improve the competitiveness in the bidding process for eligible infrastructure projects by ensuring that investors are subject to similar levels of thin capitalisation restrictions. New Zealand-owned entities have no thin capitalisat ion restrict ion on the level o f third party debt they can take on. Similarly, New Zealand entities owned by a group of non-residents (none of which have a controlling interest in their own right) are unrestricted in how much third-party debt they can take on (provided that debt is not guaranteed by the owners). The amendment effectively provides other entities (i.e. New Zealand entities controlled by a single non-resident) involved in eligible infrastructure projects with an exemption from the thin capitalisat ion rules if they only have third party debt. Key features The thin capitalisation rules have been amended to provide entities carrying out eligible infrastructure projects a limited exemption from the thin capitalisation rules by allowing them to claim deductions on debt that exceed the thresholds in section FE 5(1). The debt that can exceed the ordinary thin capitalisation thresholds under the exempt ion is limit ed to third-party debt (or debt that is from an investor but is made in the capacity of a third-party lender) that only has recourse against the assets associated with the infrastructure project and the income arising from those assets. Application date The amendments apply to income years starting on or after 1 July 2018. 43 Detailed analysis Public project assets This exemption will apply only to debt that relates to public project assets – defined in section FE 4B(1), which are assets arising from a project performed under a contract that meets the following criteria: • The project is established at the request of the New Zealand Government or a public authority. • The project is to provide, upgrade, or create assets in New Zealand and to operate or maintain those assets. • The contract is for a period of at least 10 years. • The public funding relating to the contract is approved by the Minister of Finance. • The contract provides that the assets are owned by the New Zealand Government or the public authority after the completion of the contract. Public project debt The exemption will apply only to public project debt – defined in section FE 4B(2). This debt must meet the following criteria: • The debt is applied to: – a project in order to give rise to public project assets, or income derived from public project assets; or – refinance a loan that was public project debt, including previous refinances of public project debt. • The debt must not be on-lent to a party that is not associated with the performance of the project, unless the on-lending is minor or incidental and the funds are still expected to be applied to the project. This is discussed further below under the heading on-lent funds. • The debt must give rise to interest expenditure that is incurred in New Zealand. Threshold debt amount The threshold debt amount is the amount of debt that an entity carrying on an eligible infrastructure project could have without being required to apportion its interest expenditure under section FE 6. It is calculated by multiplying the value of the public project assets and assets used in performing the project by the threshold debt percentage given by FE 5(1). If the amount of public project debt is less than this amount, all interest on the public project debt will continue to be deductible, even if the debt is of a type that is not intended to receive the benefit of this exemption (public project participant debt and unrestricted debt). If the amount of public project 44 debt exceeds this amount, only interest on debt that is intended to receive the benefit of the exemption will be deductible. Public project participant debt Public project participant debt, defined in section FE 4B(3) and used to define the item “member debt” in the formula in section FE 7B(4)(f), is public project debt issued by a participant in the infrastructure project that is made under an arrangement that has the purpose or effect of funding the project with debt equal to each participant’s interest in the project. Public project participant debt is not intended to get the benefit of the exemption. If this form o f debt was able to get the benefit of the exemption, it could result in some private investors being able to allocate more debt to the infrastructure project than is appropriate. Example Eleven is an example of where the partners in a partnership that is performing an eligible infrastructure project contract partially fund the project using debt in a way in which the debt is effectively a substitute for equity. Example 13 A Co, B Co and C Co, all of which are foreign companies, entered into a partnership called ABC Partnership. ABC Partnership entered into a contract with the New Zealand government to provide and maintain an asset for a 20 year period. All three partners have permanent establishments in New Zealand due to the activities of ABC Partnership. In order to carry out the project, ABC Partnership required $100 million. All three partners contributed $5 million of capital contribution. In addition, ABC Partnership received a loan from Bank Co of $70 million at an interest rate of 10% p.a. The final $15 million is provided in equal proportions by A Co, B Co and C Co by way of loans to ABC Partnership at a rate of 10% p.a. All of the $70 million debt from Bank Ltd will be considered public project debt. All of the $15 million from the three partners will also be considered public project debt. However, it will also be considered to be public project participant debt, because it was advanced under an arrangement between the three partners in a way that allowed them to fund the partnership in proportion to their interest in the partnership. Funding that is provided by a participant will not automatically be considered funding that is under an arrangement with a purpose or effect of allowing the participants to fund the project equal to their own ownership interests in the project. Examples Twelve and Thirteen provide two types of situations in which debt from an investor in a project will not be public project participant debt. 45 Example 14 A Co, B Co and C Co, all of which are foreign companies, entered into a partnership called ABC Partnership. ABC Partnership entered into a contract with the New Zealand Government to provide and maintain an asset for a 20 year period. All three partners have permanent establishments in New Zealand due to the activities of ABC Partnership. In addition to being a direct investor in infrastructure projects in New Zealand, C Co is also in the business of providing debt funding to a variety of New Zealand based projects. As a part of ABC Partnership’s process of procuring adequate debt funding for the project, it was decided that a combination of debt facilities from Bank Ltd and C Co was the best available funding option. Therefore, ABC Partnership obtained debt from Bank Ltd of $60 million at the beginning of the project at a rate of 10% p.a., with terms that gave Bank Ltd recourse solely to assets and income derived from the project. ABC Partnership also obtained debt from C Co of $15 million on the same terms as the debt facility from Bank Ltd. The funds provided under the debt facility from C Co are applied by ABC Partnership to give rise to public project assets, which means that the debt will be public project debt. However, it will not be considered to be public project participant debt. This is because the debt facility was only provided by one of the three partners (C Co). In addition, there is no evidence that this loan was made with the intent of being a substitute for C Co’s capital contribution to the project. Example 15 A Co, B Co and C Co, all of which are foreign companies, entered in a partnership called ABC Partnership. ABC Partnership entered into a contract with the New Zealand government to provide and maintain an asset for a 20 year period. All three partners have permanent establishments in New Zealand due to the activities of ABC Partnership. The partners agreed that capital contributions would be made once construction of the asset was complete. ABC Partnership obtained debt from Bank Ltd of $60 million at the beginning of the project at a rate of 10% p.a., with terms that gave Bank Ltd recourse solely to assets and income derived from the project. Before Bank Co would provide its debt facility, it required recourse to the capital contributions that all three of the partners would provide as a part of the project contract. Bank Ltd agreed that to secure this, each partner could provide a letter of credit, or provide the funds to ABC Partnership through a convertible debt instrument. At the beginning of the project, B Co and C Co provided letters of credit for the amount of their capital contribution. A Co decided to provide debt funding to ABC Partnership using a convertible debt instrument. That instrument provided for a fixed rate of return at an arm’s length price, and converted into A Co’s partnership interest at the same time that B Co and C Co put in their capital contribution. The convertible debt instrument is an arrangement that provides funding to the project, but it only provides funding from one of the partners (A Co). There is no evidence that the arrangement was designed with the purpose of allowing all of the participants to provide funding in proportion to their interests in the project. Further, rather than being a substitute for partnership interest, the convertible debt instrument is a substitute for the letters of credit provided by the other parties. As such, the convertible debt will not be public project participant debt. 46 On-lent funds A loan will not be considered public project debt if it is on-lent to a third party, unless that on-lending is simply due to a delay in the application of the funds to the project. This is to prevent an excess debt entity that has an interest in an eligible infrastructure project from taking on more debt than is necessary for the project and applying that debt to a separate project, while still getting the benefit of these measures. Depositing funds from a loan with a financial institution will generally be a delay in the application of funds to a project, unless it is intended that those funds will not be applied to the project. Unrestricted debt Unrestricted debt, defined in section FE 7B(4)(c), is public project debt that does not meet the definition of “public project participant debt” that is made on terms that give the creditor recourse that is not limited to the project. Recourse over public project assets, income derived from those assets and ownership interests in entities that are only involved in the infrastructure project will be recourse that is limited to the project. Unrestricted debt is not intended to receive the benefit of this concessionary rule. “Public project participant debt” is excluded from this definition to ensure that debt that meets both definitions does not have its interest deductions denied twice, as well as ensuring that an excess debt entity is still allowed an amount of debt that meets the threshold debt amount provided by the ordinary thin capitalisation rules. This principle is illustrated in Example Fourteen. Example 16 X Co, Y Co and Z Co are all foreign companies and are the only shareholders in XYZ Co, a company incorporated in New Zealand. X Co is a majority shareholder with 60% ownership interest, while Y Co and Z Co each have a 20% ownership interest. XYZ Co entered into a contract with the New Zealand Government to provide and maintain an asset for a 20 year period. In order to carry out the project, XYZ Co required $100 million. All three partners contributed $5 million of equity. XYZ Co also secured a loan from Bank Co of $50 million with an interest rate of 10% p.a. This loan only has recourse against assets and income associated with the project. XYZ Co also secured a separate loan from Bank Co of $20 million with an interest rate of 5% p.a. This loan had a lower interest rate because it was on terms that gave Bank Co recourse over specific assets held by the shareholders of XYZ Co. As this item of debt gave Bank Co recourse that was not limited to the project, it will meet the definition of unrestricted debt. The final $15 million is provided by X Co, Y Co and Z Co in proportion to their ownership interest by way of loans to XYZ Co with an interest rate of 15% p.a. These loans meet the definition of public project participant debt. Over the course of the first year of the project, XYZ Co spends all of the $100 million on constructing the asset for the New Zealand Government. XYZ Co has a $110 million asset in its financial statements, which incorporates the present value of the expected payments from the New Zealand government over the next 20 years. 47 For the purpose of section FE 7B, XYZ Co has a debt percentage of 77% (85 ÷ 110), assuming no non- debt liabilities for simplicity. In addition, XYZ Co has a worldwide group debt percentage of 50%. This means that it will have to apply the apportionment formula in section FE 7B(3). For the purpose of the apportionment formula, the value of public project participant (member) debt is $15 million and member interest is $2.25 million. Member excess is $15 million, because the amount of public project debt that is not public project participant debt is $70 million and the threshold debt amount is $66 million ($110 million x 60%). Unrestricted debt is $20 million and unrestricted interest on this debt is $1 million. Unrestricted excess will not be the whole amount of the unrestricted debt however, as the amount of public project debt that is not either public project participant debt or recourse debt is $50 million, which is less than the threshold debt amount of $66 million. The amount of unrestricted excess is instead $4 million, which is the amount that the public project debt that is not public project participant debt ($70 million) exceeds the threshold debt amount. The result of the formula will be ($1 million × $4 million ÷ $20 million) + ($ 2.25 million × $15 million ÷ $15 million) = $2.45 million of income derived by XYZ Co. Disposing of interest Section FE 4B(1)(b) provides that public project assets must not be able to be disposed of within 10 years from the beginning of the contract, unless it is to the Crown, a public authority, or another person performing the contract. By allowing public project assets to be disposed of to “another person performing the project”, it is intended that an investor in an eligible infrastructure project will be able to dispose of their investment to a separate investor who will step into their shoes. The intent of this provision is to ensure that the concessionary rules will only apply to projects that cannot be abandoned at the discretion of the private investor(s). It is not intended to prevent an investor from disposing of its interest in the project to a third party that intends to carry on the original investor’s obligations under the project contract. Scope of exemption Section FE 7B(1) provides that this exemption will only apply to entities controlled by a single non-resident, partnerships, and New Zealand resident entities subject to the outbound thin capitalisation rules. A similar exemption already applies (in effect) where a separate entity is controlled by a group of non-residents. Where a person has an interest in more than one eligible infrastructure project, each project will be treated separately under section FE 7B(5). This bifurcation will prevent the debt that is related to one infrastructure project that is denied a deduction from mixing with a low debt project. Option of applying the rule Each excess debt entity that is required to apply the thin capitalisation rules in relation to public project debt has the choice of whether to apply the ordinary thin capitalisation rules, or to apply the special rules for eligible infrastructure projects. 48 Section FE 7B(1)(c) allows an excess debt entity to choose whether or not they want to apply the concessionary rule. An election to apply the concessionary rule must be made at the time that the excess debt entity is first able to apply the concessionary rule to public project debt associated with the project. Once an election is made to apply the concessionary rule to a project, the excess debt entity must continue to use that approach for the life of the project. If an excess debt entity applies the ordinary thin capitalisation rules to the first calculation for public project debt that relates to the project, then that entity will be unable to utilise the concessionary rule. However, if the concessionary rule was not in place before the first time in which the thin capitalisation rules are applied to the project, then the concessionary rule can still be applied to the project after the application date for the rule. Each excess debt entity that is applying the thin capitalisation rules for a specific infrastructure project will be able to make its own election. In addition, if an excess debt entity disposes of its interest in an eligible infrastructure project to a new investor, that new investor will have the opportunity to make an election at the time in which it is first required to make a thin capitalisation calculation that relates to the project. 49
