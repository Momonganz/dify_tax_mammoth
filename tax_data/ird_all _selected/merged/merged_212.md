Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department IN SUMMARY IN SUMMARY New legislation Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act 2020 The new legislation contains measures aimed at modernising and improving the settings for the administration of social policy by Inland Revenue as part of the Government’s programme of transforming the tax system. This includes measures to simplify and modernise the administration of the KiwiSaver and student loan schemes. The other major aspect of the new Act is to extend the refundability of research and development tax credits, to support Government objectives relating to increasing business expenditure on research and development. 2 Legislation and determinations Determination G31: NZX Milk Price Futures Contracts: an expected value approach This determination provides the method that must be used by a Farmer who enters into an NZX MKP Milk Price Futures Contract (MKP Futures Contract) to calculate the income derived and the expenditure incurred over the term of that contract. 108 Determination FDR 2020/01 – A type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund for which a person may not use the fair dividend rate method (Vanguard Ethically Conscious Global Aggregate Bond Index Fund (Hedged) – NZD Hedged) Any investment by a New Zealand resident investor in units in the Vanguard Ethically Conscious Global Aggregate Bond Index Fund (Hedged) (“the Fund”) is a type of attributing interest for which the investor may use the Fair Dividend Rate method to calculate Foreign Investment Fund income from the interest. 118 Product Ruling Notice of withdrawal of product ruling Product ruling BR Prd 20/01 is withdrawn due to the proposed arrangement not proceeding. 120 BR Prd 20/01: Vital Healthcare Property Trust This ruling concerns the proposed separation of Vital Healthcare Property Trust’s New Zealand and Australian real estate investments into separate holding vehicles. 121 Legal decisions - case notes – Recent Case Summary Supreme Court refuses leave to appeal in child support judicial review litigation. The Supreme Court declined P’s application for leave to appeal to that Court about P’s entitlement to receive child support.

NEW LEGISLATION ON-PAYMENT OF KIWISAVER EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS Sections 4, 71, 73, 74, 76, 78, 95B, 95C, 95D, 96, 98, 98A, 99, 101, 101AA, and 221B of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 The KiwiSaver Act 2006 has been amended to allow Inland Revenue to pay employer contributions to a member’s KiwiSaver scheme provider based on employment income information, in advance of the employer paying the contribution to Inland Revenue. Background Inland Revenue on-pays employee contributions to a member’s KiwiSaver scheme provider as soon as practicable after receiving payday employment income information that an employee contribution amount has been deducted from the member’s salary and wages. As employment income information is due to Inland Revenue prior to the due date for payment of these deductions, employee contribution can be on-paid to scheme providers sooner than they otherwise would be. However, the law previously provided no comparable arrangement for employer contributions. Instead, when Inland Revenue received employment income information relating to an employer contribution, the employer contribution was not on-paid to the KiwiSaver scheme provider until the contribution amount had been paid to Inland Revenue by the employer. This made it difficult for members to reconcile the amounts in their KiwiSaver account with the contributions listed on their payslips. It also meant employer contributions were not invested by scheme providers as soon as employee contributions were. Key features The amendments allow Inland Revenue to pay KiwiSaver employer contributions to scheme providers before the contribution has been received by Inland Revenue. Employer contributions will be paid to providers as soon as is practicable after employment income information is filed with Inland Revenue indicating that an employer contribution has been made for a pay period. Along with other KiwiSaver amendments in the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act 2020, the change will improve the administrative efficiency of KiwiSaver as it facilitates the earlier transfer of employer contributions to KiwiSaver scheme providers. This results in a member’s employer contribution being invested by their scheme provider sooner. Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 2020. Detailed analysis All section references are to the KiwiSaver Act 2006. Amendments to Inland Revenue KiwiSaver Holding Account Rules (Part 3, subpart 2) Under section 72, Inland Revenue is required to establish a memorandum account. This is called the “Inland Revenue KiwiSaver Holding Account”. All contributions made under the Act must be paid into this account in the first instance. The Act contains a provision which allows Inland Revenue to pay employee contributions to a KiwiSaver scheme provider based on employment income information, before the contribution is paid to Inland Revenue by the employer. Section 73(3) provides that after being paid into the Inland Revenue KiwiSaver Holding Account, these contributions must be paid out of the Holding Account to a KiwiSaver scheme provider as soon as practicable. In addition to the existing power to on-pay employee contributions, amendments to subsections 73(1) and (2) now allow Inland Revenue to on-pay employer contributions to scheme providers under section 73(3). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 2 NEW LEGISLATION The amended section 73(1) provides that before on-paying the contribution amount to the scheme provider, Inland Revenue must be satisfied that the contribution has actually been deducted from salary and wage or, for employer contributions, that the employer can make the contribution at the time it is reported in employment income information. However, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, Inland Revenue can assume that this is the case if an amount has been reported on employment income information. The entitlement for Inland Revenue to make this assumption about employee contributions was previously included in section 73(6), but has been moved to new section 221B and extended to cover employer contributions. Amended section 73(1) also clarifies that section 73 only applies to employee and employer contributions on-paid to a KiwiSaver scheme provider by Inland Revenue, before the contribution is paid to Inland Revenue by the employer. Employee and employer contributions that are not on-paid to a scheme provider before the contribution is paid to Inland Revenue, are treated as being held on trust by Inland Revenue under section 74. In addition, contributions received by Inland Revenue that are not employee or employer contributions will also continue to be subject to section 74 (for example, a contribution by a non- employer to a member’s KiwiSaver account via a payment to Inland Revenue). The Act contains a provision that prevents an employee being disadvantaged by their employer failing to make payments to Inland Revenue – previously this provision only applied to employee deductions. Amendments to section 78 extend this power to unpaid employer contributions, meaning Inland Revenue will be required to pay an unpaid employee deduction or employer contribution from a Crown Bank Account into the Inland Revenue KiwiSaver Holding Account if the employer had not paid the contribution amount by its due date. Section 76 has been repealed. This section allowed Inland Revenue to delay on-payment of an employer contribution until a member’s next employee contribution was on-paid to their KiwiSaver scheme provider. As the amendments allow employee and employer contributions to be on-paid to a KiwiSaver scheme provider at the same time, this provision is no longer necessary. Cross referencing and nomenclature amendments have been made to sections 71 and 74(3). Amendments to employer contribution rules (part 3, subpart 3) Sections 98 and 99 have been repealed. These sections set out how part payments of employer contributions to Inland Revenue were treated. Part payment rules are no longer necessary as employer contributions will now always be able to be on-paid in full to a KiwiSaver scheme provider. Instead, new section 95B specifies when an employer contribution shown on employment income information is deemed to be received by Inland Revenue, in instances where the contribution is not paid to Inland Revenue by or before its due date. This provision is consistent with the existing rule for employee contributions in section 69. The amendments to section 73, which require the on-payment of employer contributions to a KiwiSaver scheme provider as soon as practicable after they are paid into the Inland Revenue Holding Account, are subject to the new sections 95C and 95D. Where an employer fails to provide information required by Inland Revenue about an employer contribution reported in employment income information, new section 95C allows Inland Revenue to wait to on-pay the contribution until the member it should be attributed to can be established. New section 95D provides that such a contribution is not deemed to be received by Inland Revenue until the date the person to whom it is attributable is established. These provisions are consistent with the existing rules for employee contributions in sections 70 and 71. New section 101(1B) specifies that where an employee opts-out after an employer contribution has already been on-paid to a scheme provider the amount must be refunded to Inland Revenue. While new section 101AA provides where this amount has been paid out of a Crown Bank Account and the amount has not subsequently been received from the employer, the employer contribution must be refunded to a Crown Bank Account. This ensures that an employer is not refunded an amount they have not paid. The amendments to the opt-out refund rules only have limited application, in circumstances when the late opt-out rules have been applied. This is because employee and employer contributions made by new KiwiSaver members are generally held by Inland Revenue for the duration of the standard opt-out period. The opt-out period ends 55 days after a person has been automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver, while the holding period for initial KiwiSaver contributions is 62 days. A similar amendment to the one which applies to the opt-out refund rules has not been made for refunds resulting from a person being invalidly enrolled in KiwiSaver. Existing section 59D(4) already allows refunds of contribution amounts (without reference to the specific contribution type) to the Crown, where appropriate, in invalid enrolment situations. Cross-referencing and nomenclature amendments have also been made to sections 93(5), 96 and 98A. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 3 NEW LEGISLATION OTHER KIWISAVER ADMINISTRATIVE REFINEMENTS Sections 4, 18, 22, 23, 34, 38, 39, 48, 51, 56, 57, 59B, 59C, 59D, 63B, 64, 69, 75, 81, 85, 88, 93, 103, 104, 105, 107, 108, 112B, 226 and schedule 1, clause 8 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006; schedule 4 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 A number of technical amendments have been made to the KiwiSaver Act 2006 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. These seek to enhance Inland Revenue’s administration of KiwiSaver, to ensure members receive the correct contribution amounts and facilitate the faster transfer of contributions to KiwiSaver scheme providers. Key features • • Reducing the KiwiSaver provisional period (during which individuals who are automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver are provisionally allocated to a default KiwiSaver scheme) and initial holding period from three months to two months. • • Aligning the date KiwiSaver contributions are treated as received by Inland Revenue with a member’s payday. • • Reducing the maximum period within which a scheme provider has to send information and funds to a new provider when a member transfers schemes from 35 days to 10 working days. • • Allowing members to change their contribution rate through their KiwiSaver scheme provider or Inland Revenue, in addition to through their employer. • • Removal of requirements to report employer name and address details to Inland Revenue in certain circumstances. • • Minor amendments to reporting address requirements for new members. • • Requiring employers to provide Inland Revenue with information about an employee’s KiwiSaver salary and wages. • • Removing the three months grace period for members who have been incorrectly enrolled in KiwiSaver, to gain New Zealand residence. Application date The amendments allowing a member to change their contribution rate through their KiwiSaver scheme provider or Inland Revenue will apply from 1 April 2022 or an earlier date set by Order in Council. All other amendments apply from 1 April 2020. Detailed analysis All section references are to the KiwiSaver Act 2006 unless otherwise stated. Reducing the KiwiSaver provisional period and initial holding period (sections 4, 18, 48, 51, 57, 59B, 64, 75, 81, 88, 104, 108, 112B and 226) Amendments to section 51(4)(a) and (b) reduce the duration of the provisional period from three months to two months. Section 75 has also been amended so the initial holding period for new member’s contributions has been reduced from three months to two months as well. Where an individual has been automatically enrolled, opted-in via their employer or is no longer eligible to be a member of their existing KiwiSaver scheme, they will be provisionally allocated to a default KiwiSaver scheme under section 50. If an individual does not make an active choice to join another KiwiSaver scheme before the provisional period ends, they are treated as having accepted the offer of membership to the scheme they were provisionally allocated to. A member’s initial contributions are held by Inland Revenue for the duration of the provisional period, before being on-paid to the member’s KiwiSaver scheme provider (that is, because the provisional period was previously set at three months, the initial holding period was also three months long). As the amendments will result in them receiving a member’s initial contributions earlier, KiwiSaver scheme providers will be aware they have been allocated a default member sooner and will be able to engage with the member about their investment options earlier. It will also mean a member’s initial contributions will be invested by their scheme provider sooner. Members will still be able to transfer to a different scheme after the provisional period ends if they wish to do so. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 4 NEW LEGISLATION As a result of reducing the initial holding period, an amendment has also been made to section 81(1) so that in addition to being required to refund overpaid contributions to Inland Revenue, a scheme provider will also be required to refund contributions to Inland Revenue when a member opts out. This provision will apply where the KiwiSaver late opt-out rules have been used, which can be up to three months after a person has been automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver (previously such a rule was not necessary as the late opt-out period ended at the same time as the holding period). A similar amendment has been made to the employer contribution specific refund rules and is discussed in the section of this Tax Information Bulletin entitled “on-payment of KiwiSaver employer contributions”. Where section 4(3) of the Act earlier defined “3 months” to mean 92 days, section 4(3) has now been repealed and references in the Act to “3 months” have now been replaced with “92 days”. Instead of being expressed as “2 months”, section 51(4) now refers to “62 days”. Consequential amendments to sections 48(1)(d), 56(4) and 226(1B) and (1C) have also been made to align with the reduced provisional and holding periods. Aligning the date KiwiSaver contributions are received with member’s payday (sections 4, 69, 78, 85 and schedule 1, clause 8 and new sections 95B and 221B) Previously employee contributions were treated as received by Inland Revenue on the 15th day of the month they were deducted from the member’s salary or wages. Sections 69(2), 78(b), 85(1) and schedule 1, clause 8 contained a 15th of the month timing rule for employee contributions. These provisions are relevant for determining when unpaid employee contributions are treated as received, when employee contributions are treated as received for the purpose of calculating interest and when employee contributions are treated as received for the purpose of the KiwiSaver first home withdrawals rules. Previously section 85(3) provided that employer contributions were treated as received on the first of the month that Inland Revenue received payment for the contribution. The reason employer contributions were treated as received on a different date from employee contributions was due to an inability to on-pay employer contributions to a scheme provider until the contribution amount had been paid to Inland Revenue. If interest was calculated from the 15th of the month and there was a delay in the employer contribution amount being paid to Inland Revenue, then Inland Revenue risked having to pay interest on those contributions for an extended period. However, the on-payment of employer contributions amendments included in the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act 2020 means it is no longer necessary to treat employee and employer contributions differently for timing purposes. These timing rules for employee and employer contributions reflected the fact that Inland Revenue previously did not have sufficient information to determine the date of an employee’s payday. However, the rules were unsatisfactory as, amongst other things, they resulted in the under and over-payment of interest on employee contributions and underpayment of interest on employer contributions. As part of changes to employment income information requirements, which came into effect from 1 April 2019, employers are now required to report the date of their employee’s payday to Inland Revenue. To reflect this, sections 69, 78 and 85 have been amended so that employee contributions can be treated as received by Inland Revenue on the date of the member’s payday as reported by the employer. Similarly, the amended section 85 and new section 95B(2) (which relates to the date employer contributions are treated as received for the on-payment of employer contributions amendments above) specify that employer contributions are also treated as received on the date of the member’s payday. All the amendments include a carve out stating that where an employer has not provided information to Inland Revenue about an employee’s payday, both employee and employer contributions are treated as received on the 15th of the month that the employee contribution was deducted/employer contribution relates to. This covers situations in which Inland Revenue has granted an employer a variation for employment income information requirements which results in them not being required to report the date of their employee’s payday. Sections 69 and 85 provide that Inland Revenue needs to be satisfied that an employee contribution had actually been deducted from salary and wages for these sections to apply. Amended section 85 and new section 95B, introduce a similar rule for employer contributions. The amendments require Inland Revenue to be satisfied that the employer can make the contribution at the time it is reported in the employment income information for these sections to apply. The new section 221B entitles Inland Revenue to assume that these requirements are met where an amount is included in employment information (unless there is evidence to the contrary). An amendment has also been made to section 4 to clarify that “payday” has the same meaning as it does in the Tax Administration Act 1994. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 5 NEW LEGISLATION Transfer of member’s information and funds to a new scheme provider (sections 56 and 57) Section 56(4) specifies the maximum transfer period KiwiSaver scheme providers have to send a member’s funds and relevant information to a new scheme after receiving notice from a member that they have opted to transfer schemes. This section has been amended to reduce this transfer period from 35 days to 10 working days. The section would continue to permit the transfer timeframe being exceeded, where this is agreed to between the old and new KiwiSaver schemes. KiwiSaver default providers’ instruments of appointment currently already require them to complete transfers within 10 working days of receiving notice that the member has transferred schemes. Therefore, the amendment results in the transfer time being aligned across all KiwiSaver scheme providers. A consequential amendment has also been made to section 57(5). Changing employee contribution rates (sections 38, 39 and 64) Section 64(2) has been amended so employees have the option of changing their KiwiSaver contribution rate by contacting Inland Revenue or their KiwiSaver scheme provider, in addition to their employer. This will reduce compliance costs for members who may be more likely to engage with Inland Revenue or their KiwiSaver scheme provider in the first instance about contribution rate changes. New section 64(2B)–(2D) outlines information a member or their scheme provider needs provide to Inland Revenue where a contribution rate change is made, and what information Inland Revenue would be required to subsequently provide a member’s employer(s) to ensure the contribution rate change is given effect to. Changes to employer name and address reporting requirements (sections 38, 39. 103, 105, and 107) Amendments have been made to requirements in the Act to report employer name and address details, to address issues arising where this information is incorrectly reported to the Inland Revenue. This commonly occurs where an employer’s trading name and address are different than their registered name and address. Reporting requirements where member enrolled directly with scheme provider Section 38 sets out what information a KiwiSaver scheme provider must report to Inland Revenue, when a person has enrolled in KiwiSaver directly with the provider. The requirement in section 38(2), for a scheme provider to report employer name and address details to Inland Revenue has been repealed. Instead, Inland Revenue will notify all active employers it has on record for the employee that the employee has enrolled in KiwiSaver. Consequential amendments have also been made to section 39(1). Reporting requirements where member applies for a savings suspension The general requirement in section 103(2)(c) for an employee who applies for a savings suspension to provide Inland Revenue with the names and addresses of the employers they wish the savings suspension to apply to, has been repealed. Instead this information would now only be required under section 103(2)(c) when requested by Inland Revenue. Amendments have also been made to sections 105(2) and 107(a), so that Inland Revenue would only be required to notify an employer that a savings suspension had been granted in respect of one of their employees, where it has requested the member provide employer name and address details. The intended operation of these amendments is member’s applying for a savings suspension via their myIR account would be able to select from a list of their employers, which they want the savings suspension to apply to (that is, in this situation Inland Revenue would be treated as requiring employer name and address details). For members applying for a savings suspension through other channels, the member would be sent a letter advising that they had been granted a savings suspension, which they could show to employers of their choice. Aligning employee address requirements in the KiwiSaver Act 2006 with the Tax Administration Act 1994 (sections 22, 23 and 34) Under schedule 4 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, an employer must provide a new employee’s contact address to Inland Revenue “as required” (that is, when such information is requested by Inland Revenue). However, under the KiwiSaver Act 2006 employers were always required to provide an employee’s contact address to Inland Revenue for new KiwiSaver enrolments. This created an inconsistency between the requirements of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the KiwiSaver Act 2006, in that even where Inland Revenue did not require a new employee’s contact address under the Tax Administration Act 1994, the employer would still be required to provide this information if the employee had also been enrolled in KiwiSaver. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 6 NEW LEGISLATION Sections 22, 23 and 23 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 have now been amended to clarify that an employer is only required to provide the contact address of an employee who has been enrolled in KiwiSaver if it is required by Inland Revenue. KiwiSaver income information (new section 63B of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 and schedule 4 of the Tax Administration Act 1994) As part of the KiwiSaver on-boarding process, employers are required to provide Inland Revenue with certain information about new enrolments to the scheme. To improve Inland Revenue’s ability to ensure members are receiving the correct KiwiSaver contribution amounts, new section 63B requires employers to report information to Inland Revenue on the amount of salary and wages a KiwiSaver deduction is made from for an employee, if there is a difference between amounts that an employer must treat as gross earnings for the purpose of calculating PAYE tax obligations and amounts they must treat as salary and wages for the purpose of calculating KiwiSaver contributions. If there is a difference between amounts that an employer must treat as gross earnings (for calculating PAYE deductions) and amounts they must treat as salary and wages (for calculating KiwiSaver contributions), then the employer must report the latter. As there are some amounts that are treated as income for PAYE that are exempt for KiwiSaver purposes, collecting this information will help Inland Revenue ensure that KiwiSaver contributions are being paid at the correct rate. Some examples of amounts included in gross income for PAYE that are not included within the definition of salary and wages for KiwiSaver are the value of accommodation, a benefit from an employee share scheme or a redundancy payment. Employers need not provide this information every payday. Instead, the employer is required to report to Inland Revenue about new employees or existing employees joining KiwiSaver for the first time. Consequential amendments have also been made to schedule 4 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. These clarify that the new reporting requirements fall within the ambit of what is considered employment information under that Act. KiwiSaver invalid enrolment residence grace period (sections 59, 59C, and 59D) Section 59A provides that when an individual does not meet the KiwiSaver residence requirement, the invalid enrolment rules will apply. However, under section 59B the member was treated as meeting the KiwiSaver residence requirement for the first three months after the invalid enrolment was discovered. Section 59C then provided if the person became someone who meets the residence requirement within this three-month period, the enrolment would be retrospectively validated and their KiwiSaver account would remain open. In practice, the three-month residence grace period did not operate as intended, as non-residents who have been invalidly enrolled in KiwiSaver typically do not intend to become a resident in the short-term (for example, individuals on temporary work visas). In recognition of this, new section 59B(2)(ab) has been inserted. This section will mean where an individual has been invalidly enrolled in KiwiSaver on the basis of not meeting the residence requirement, they will cease to be a member as soon as their scheme provider discovers, or is notified about, the invalid enrolment. Amendments to section 59C(1) clarify that where a person who did not meet the residence requirement was invalidly enrolled, this enrolment could not be retrospectively validated. Amendments to section 59D(1) confirm that the refund process set out under this section for contributions that a person had made while invalidly enrolled apply if an individual’s account is closed on the basis of them not meeting the residence criteria when enrolled. The effect of the amendment is to remove the three-month residence grace period and means the member’s account will be closed immediately. The individual will then be able to open a new KiwiSaver account if they later become a resident. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 7 NEW LEGISLATION WITHDRAWAL IN CASES OF LIFE-SHORTENING CONGENITAL CONDITIONS Sections 101C, 228, 243 and schedule 1, clauses 12B and 13 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006; section MK 2 and schedule 28 of the Income Tax Act 2007 A new KiwiSaver withdrawal category has been introduced to allow members with life-shortening conditions to withdraw their savings before reaching the age of 65 in order to provide for themselves in retirement. Background The reason for this new category of withdrawal is to recognise that people with life-shortening congenital conditions may not live until the New Zealand superannuation qualification age (currently 65) – the age at which they would ordinarily be eligible to access their retirement savings. While there is an existing withdrawal category for KiwiSaver members who are seriously ill, this does not assist those with life-shortening congenital conditions. This is because the serious illness withdrawal category is only available where the member is totally and permanently unable to engage in work for which they are suited, or else has a condition which poses a serious and imminent risk of death. Key features A further ground for the early withdrawal of KiwiSaver funds has been added to schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006. KiwiSaver members with life-shortening congenital conditions are now able to withdraw their KiwiSaver funds before they reach the general withdrawal age of 65. Under the new withdrawal category, life-shortening congenital conditions named in regulations would automatically qualify for withdrawal. An alternative process is also available to people that have a life-shortening congenital condition that is not named in the regulations to apply to their KiwiSaver provider for a withdrawal. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2020. Detailed Analysis New clause 12B of schedule 1of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 introduces a new withdrawal category which allows members with life- shortening congenital conditions to withdraw their savings early in order to provide for themselves in their retirement. The newly enacted clause 12B(1) of schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 provides two avenues for members with a life- shortening congenital condition to withdraw their KiwiSaver funds. These are where the member has: • • a life shortening congenital condition which has been identified by regulation (a condition which has identified in this way is referred to as a “listed condition”); 1 or • • a congenital condition which is likely to reduce their life expectancy below the New Zealand superannuation qualification age for the member or for persons in general (this is referred to as a “non-listed condition”). A KiwiSaver member with either of the above categories of congenital condition which has existed from the date of their birth may apply under clause 13 to the manager or supervisor of their KiwiSaver scheme for a withdrawal. The amount of the withdrawal may be up to the value of their accumulation in the fund. An applicant with either a listed or non-listed condition must supply a medical certificate which verifies the member suffers from the condition. A medical certificate presented by an applicant with a non-listed condition must additionally verify that the condition the member suffers from is a life-shortening congenital condition for the member or for persons in general with the condition. A withdrawal application must also include a statutory declaration completed by the member, acknowledging that they understand the consequences of withdrawing their savings. New sections 101C(cb) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 and MK 2(cb) of the Income Tax Act 2007 provide that a member who has made a life-shortening congenital condition withdrawal will no longer be eligible for compulsory employer contributions or the annual Government contribution. This is consistent with how KiwiSaver members are treated when withdrawing for the purpose of retirement (that is, entitlement to compulsory employer contributions and the Government contribution generally cease when a member reaches the age of 65). 1 New section 228(1)(mb) inserts a regulation making power into the KiwiSaver Act 2006, to allow for a listed condition to be specified in regulations. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 8 NEW LEGISLATION Consequential amendments have also been made to the complying fund rules in schedule 28 of the Income Tax Act 2007, to ensure a life-shortening congenital condition withdrawal is also a grounds for early withdrawal under these rules. Transitional period for KiwiSaver scheme providers New section 243 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 grants transitional relief to KiwiSaver scheme providers who are non-compliant with product disclosure statement requirements or other requirements to file information on a relevant disclose register under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013, as result of the introduction of the new early withdrawal ground. This period of transitional relief comes to an end before 31 January 2021. LIMITING ABILITY TO REOPEN ANY REPAYMENT OBLIGATION RELATING TO YEARS PRIOR TO 1 APRIL 2013 Clauses 21–27 of Part 5 of schedule 6 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 Limiting the situations where either the Commissioner or the borrower can reopen a borrower’s repayment obligation for tax years prior to 1 April 2013. Background Inland Revenue was required to maintain the student loan rules back to 1992 when the scheme was introduced in case either the Commissioner or the borrower seeks to review a borrower’s repayment obligation. Retaining rules back to 1992 has increased the complexity of the scheme over time as changes have been made to the scheme in 21 of the last 26 years. Compliance costs for borrowers are high, as understanding changes to their loan balance is difficult due to historical rules applying for prior years. Administration costs for Inland Revenue are also high, as are the costs of building the rules back to 1992 into new systems and processes, with little benefit. As part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme, it is proposed that a simplified set of rules will apply for the period from 1992 to 1 April 2013. This will reduce compliance costs for borrowers, the administration costs for Inland Revenue, and the time and cost of implementing changes to the student loan scheme. The 1 April 2013 date was chosen as nearly all adjustments to borrowers’ repayment obligations have occurred within this timeframe and the rules applying from that date onwards are largely the same as applies today. Key features Schedule 6 of the Act is amended by introducing a new Part 5. This Part sets out the proposed new rules for tax years prior to 1 April 2013. For the purposes of clauses 23–27 of this Part, references to “Act” refer to either the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 or the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011, whichever is appropriate. A new definition of closed-off tax years applies to tax years from 1992 up to 1 April 2013. During this period both the Commissioner and the borrower are precluded from reopening any repayment obligation except where the borrower: • • becomes overseas or New Zealand-based; • • has committed fraud; or • • has not filed information (for example, an unfiled return) to the Commissioner when required to do so under the Act and it is cost effective for the Commissioner to reopen the repayment obligation. A savings provision enables the Commissioner to correct the position of any borrower who might be unduly disadvantaged by these proposals. Where a borrower considers that they are worse off, they can apply to the Commissioner and if the Commissioner agrees then their repayment obligation will be corrected. Residency changes If a change in a borrower’s residence status is identified after 1 April 2020 and the change relates to a closed-off tax year, a simplified set of rules will apply. Loan interest would be calculated on the borrower’s loan balance from the date the borrower went overseas, or loan interest would cease to apply from date they returned to New Zealand. Where a borrower goes from New Zealand-based to overseas-based during the closed-off period, no overseas-based borrower repayment obligation for the period will be imposed. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 9 NEW LEGISLATION Where a borrower goes from overseas-based to New Zealand-based during the period, overseas-based repayments would not be collected. Any payments already collected would go against the loan balance. However, changes to a borrower’s repayment obligations due to residency changes will apply from 1 April 2013 onwards. Example 1 Bob went overseas in April 2008 but did not advise Inland Revenue. Since 2008, Bob has been treated as a New Zealand- based borrower (so was not charged loan interest). Bob has not met his repayment obligations since 2008. In April 2021, Bob returns to New Zealand and Inland Revenue identifies that Bob has been overseas since April 2008. Bob’s obligations for the 2008–13 tax years can be reopened only to the extent that Bob must pay loan interest from April 2008. His repayment obligations for the 2008–13 tax years cannot otherwise be assessed or reassessed. Bob’s obligations for the 2014–21 tax years can be reopened in full (because those tax years are not closed off). For the period from 1 April 2013 until he returned to New Zealand, Bob may be liable to an overseas-based borrowers’ repayment obligation and loan interest. From 1 April 2013 onwards, associated late payment interest charges can apply. Example 2 Ngaire went overseas in April 2000 and advised Inland Revenue of her departure. Ngaire returned to New Zealand in July 2008 but did not advise Inland Revenue. Since April 2000, Ngaire has been treated as an overseas-based borrower (so was charged loan interest and assessed with an overseas-based repayment obligation). Ngaire has not met her repayment obligations since March 2000. In April 2021, Inland Revenue identifies that Ngaire returned to New Zealand in July 2008. Ngaire’s obligations for the 2008–21 tax years can be reopened. For the period from July 2008 to 31 March 2013, the loan interest charge, and any overseas-based borrower repayment obligations, can be reversed but no New Zealand-based repayment obligation can be assessed in its place. For the 2013–14 tax year and later tax years, Ngaire can be assessed with a New Zealand-based borrowers’ repayment obligation (because those tax years are not closed off). From 1 April 2013 onwards, associated late payment interest charges can apply. Example 3 Pip went overseas to work as a volunteer for a recognised charity in April 2008 and returned in April 2010. Pip could have applied to be treated as if still physically in New Zealand during the period of absence but did not. Pip’s obligations for the 2008–09 to 2009–10 tax years can be reopened if she makes an application. For the period of absence, the loan interest charge, and any overseas-based borrower repayment obligations, can be reversed but no New Zealand-based repayment obligation can be assessed in its place. Fraud or unfiled returns or information Where fraud is involved, or the borrower has failed to provide a return or information to the Commissioner, the borrower’s repayment obligation may be reopened during the closed-off period. In these situations, a simplified calculation would be used to calculate the borrower’s repayment obligation, namely, 10 percent of the difference between the income of the borrower that should have been used to calculate the repayment obligation and the income that was used less any unused repayment threshold. Other rules that applied in that year would be disregarded. A one-off penalty may also apply to penalise the non-compliant action. Late payment interest will not be imposed for the closed-off period. However, late payment interest may apply from 1 April 2013 onwards. Example 4 Chris fraudulently failed to declare a large source of income for the 2008–09 tax year. This has implications for both income tax and student loan obligations. The 4-year (statute bar) period for making changes to an income tax obligation after a return is filed does not apply where fraud is involved. Therefore, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue amends Chris’s income tax liability for the 2008–09 year and the student loan repayment obligation for that year is also amended. The reopened student loan repayment obligation is the difference between the previous income amount and the new income amount, less any unused repayment threshold, multiplied by the repayment percentage (which was 10% up to 1 April 2013). Chris could be considered for a shortfall or criminal penalty for not filing or for the fraudulent activity. Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 2020. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 10 NEW LEGISLATION REPLACING THE UNDERESTIMATION PENALTY WITH SHORTFALL PENALTY Sections 4, 146(3)(a)(ii), and 161A of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 Replacing the student loan underestimation penalty with a shortfall penalty to align it with the penalty imposed for underestimation of provisional tax for tax purposes. Background Borrowers who earn income other than salary and wages and whose end-of-year repayment obligation on this income is more than $1,000, are required to make interim repayments in the following year. A borrower can base these interim repayments on either the previous year’s assessed amount plus an uplift percentage or an estimate of the expected end-of-year repayment obligation. To ensure borrowers who choose the estimate option make an accurate estimate of their interim repayment obligations, a penalty is imposed on those who significantly underestimate their interim repayments. To provide consistency of penalties between underestimations of loan repayments and the underestimations of provisional tax, it is proposed that the current underestimation penalty be replaced with a shortfall penalty. Key features Sections 4, 161A, and 146(3)(a)(ii) are amended to reflect the repeal of the underestimation penalty. The current shortfall penalties that apply to other tax positions, actions, or omissions also include not making an accurate estimate of their interim repayment obligations. Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 2020. REPAYMENT OBLIGATIONS LIMITED TO CONSOLIDATED LOAN BALANCE Sections 191(1) and (3A) and 194(2) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 Enabling repayment obligations to continue until the consolidated loan balance (including unpaid amounts and interest) is repaid. Background The Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 defines the term “loan balance” as including core borrowing, loan interest charged and the administration fee, but not including unpaid amounts (which are defaults and late payment interest). The Act also defines the “consolidated loan balance”, which includes the loan balance and unpaid amounts. The Act previously limited a borrower’s repayment obligation to their loan balance, rather than their consolidated loan balance, meaning deductions from salary and wages could only occur until the loan balance has been repaid. This prevents salary and wage deductions from being made to repay unpaid amounts. The Act replaces “loan balance” with “consolidated loan balance” for the purpose of this limitation. The amendment will allow salary and wage deductions to continue until the consolidated loan balance is fully repaid. Example 5 Ben goes overseas with a loan balance of $7,000. Based on this loan balance he is required to make repayments of $1,000 per year but does not make any repayments while overseas. He then returns to New Zealand after 5 years overseas with a “loan balance” of $2,000 and unpaid assessments of $5,000. 2 Ben begins working in New Zealand, and his employer deducts loan repayments each payday until Ben’s $2,000 “loan balance” is repaid. At this point, Inland Revenue would be required to instruct the employer to stop making student loan deductions. Inland Revenue will seek repayment of the unpaid $5,000. If Ben does not repay, Inland Revenue would need to use other tools to get him to repay their loan. 2 For simplicity, the example ignores interest and the annual administration fee. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 11 NEW LEGISLATION Key features Section 191(1) and (3A) is amended by referring to consolidated loan balance instead of loan balance. Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 2020. REQUIREMENT TO DEDUCT REPAYMENTS FROM SCHEDULAR, ELECTION DAY, AND CASUAL AGRICULTURAL INCOME Sections 115, 118, 123, and 124 of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 Repealing the legislation requiring loan repayment deductions to be made from schedular, election day, and casual agricultural payments at source. Background Changes enacted as part of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 require student loan repayments to be deducted from schedular, election day, and casual agricultural income each pay day, with effect from 1 April 2020. These changes were introduced to benefit borrowers in reducing their loan balance and reducing compliance costs by making repayment deductions during the year. However, although consultation undertaken before enactment raised no compliance cost issues for employers, further consultation undertaken as part of implementing these changes has identified significant compliance costs for employers in implementing these changes. Therefore, the changes have been repealed with effect from 1 April 2020. Key features Sections 115, 118, 123, and 124 of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 are repealed. Application date This amendment applies from 31 March 2020. COMMISSIONER MAY NOTIFY EMPLOYERS WHEN LOAN BALANCE CLOSE TO ZERO Section 62A of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 Enabling Inland Revenue to notify employers of a borrower’s remaining loan balance when the borrower’s loan is close to being fully repaid. Background Currently, employers make salary and wage deductions from their employee’s wages at the rate of 12 cents in the dollar for every dollar over the repayment threshold. This continues until the loan is repaid. Inland Revenue contacts employers after loans are repaid to instruct them to cease making student loan deductions. However, as employers make deductions at a constant rate, employers often deduct more than the remaining loan balance. These overpayments often require contact between Inland Revenue and the borrower to resolve. This amendment is possible now because since 1 April 2019, employers have been required to provide information on employees’ income and deductions each payday giving Inland Revenue more timely and accurate information regarding an employee’s earnings. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 12 NEW LEGISLATION Key features A new section 62A is inserted into the Act. The section provides that Inland Revenue will notify 1 or more of the borrower’s employers of the borrower’s loan balance when the loan is close to being fully repaid. Where possible, Inland Revenue will also give the borrower a copy of the notification provided to the employer(s). Employers will need to reduce the amount of the final deductions so that the amount of the repayment is equal to the remaining loan balance, which will reduce the likelihood of overpayments being made. Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 2020. REDUCING ANNUAL NET INCOME THRESHOLD FROM $1,500 TO $500 Section 72 of Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 Background The Act contains a concession where a borrower with less than $1,500 of non-salary and wage income is not required to make loan repayments on this income. This threshold reflects the compliance costs associated with the requirements to file a return and/or notify Inland Revenue of any adjustments to income for student loan purposes. From the 2018–19 tax year, most salary and wage earners will have their tax automatically assessed. Therefore, as the compliance costs associated with complying with the filing requirements have been reduced, the threshold level has also been reduced from $1,500 to $500. Key features Section 72 of the Act is amended by replacing the references to $1,500 with $500 in both places where they occur. Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 2020. REPLACE REPAYMENT HOLIDAY WITH TEMPORARY REPAYMENT SUSPENSION Sections 106, 107, 107B, 108, 108A, 110, 115, and 182A of Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 Replacing the term “Student Loan Repayment Holiday” with “Student Loan Temporary Repayment Suspension”. The repayment holiday reduces a borrower’s overseas-based repayment obligation to zero. Renaming the repayment holiday will send a better signal to borrowers that their repayment obligations are only on hold. In practice, there will be no change to the effect of the policy on borrowers. Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 2020. DATE REPAYMENT DEDUCTIONS DEEMED TO BE MADE Section 195(3) and (3A) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 Changing the date that student loan repayment deductions are deemed to be made from the 15th of the month to the employee’s payday. Background Currently deductions are deemed to be made on one fixed date, the 15th of the month. This is because until 1 April 2019 Inland Revenue did not receive payday information for all employees and determining employees’ paydays would impose compliance costs on employers. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 13 NEW LEGISLATION The introduction of payday filing now enables Inland Revenue to deem deductions to be made on the employee’s payday. This should not have adverse implications for borrowers. Key features Section 195(3) and (3A) are replaced with a new subsection (3) which makes it clear that salary or wage deductions are credited on the day on which the deduction is made. All other payments (other than salary or wages) are credited on the date on which the payment is received by the Commissioner. Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 2020. NOTIFICATION OF INCOME BY OVERSEAS-BASED BORROWERS APPLYING TO BE TREATED AS NEW ZEALAND-BASED Sections 74(2) and 114(3) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 Clarifying that a borrower can notify the Commissioner of their adjusted net income at the time they apply for treatment as being physically in New Zealand or a later date. Background Borrowers can apply to be treated as being physically in New Zealand if the principal reason for not being in New Zealand is included within a list of categories in the Act, for example, as part of their New Zealand employment the borrower is posted overseas. If granted, borrowers’ repayment obligations are income contingent and the loan is interest free for the relevant period. Borrowers can apply for this treatment before, during or after being absent from New Zealand. As a condition of some of the listed reasons, borrowers must notify the Commissioner of their adjusted net income. However currently, it is unclear whether those borrowers who apply for this treatment after their absence must make a separate extension of time application, or whether they may notify the Commissioner of their income information at the time of application. Key features Sections 74(2) and 114(3) are amended to enable the borrower to advise the Commissioner of their income at the same time as they apply to be treated as a New Zealand-based borrower. Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 2020. INTEREST FOR NEW ZEALAND-BASED BORROWERS Clause 29 of Part 5 of Schedule 6 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 Removing the requirement to impose interest and then write it off for New Zealand-based borrowers, for reassessments prior to 1 April 2020. Background In the past Inland Revenue’s system limitations meant that the only way to impose interest on overseas-based borrowers was to impose interest on all borrowers and then to immediately write it off for New Zealand-based borrowers. This has caused confusion and concern to borrowers. Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme means that those systems limitations no longer exist going forward. However, if changes that apply to periods before 1 April 2020 are made to a borrower’s loan balance after 1 April 2020, the legislation technically requires interest to be imposed and written off for New Zealand-based borrowers. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 14 NEW LEGISLATION Key features A new clause 29 has been inserted into part 5 of Schedule 6 to provide that loan interest does not need to be charged for changes to a New Zealand-based borrower’s loan balance from 1 April 2012 onwards. Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 2020. ALIGNING THE WRITE-OFF RULES Sections 144, 146A, 161A, 189(1), 195(3), and 197(2) of Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 Amending the Act to enable the Commissioner to write off amounts of $20 or less. Background Currently, the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows the Commissioner to refrain from collecting tax of amounts not more than $20. In the Act the Commissioner may write off amounts less than $20. The amendment aligns these by changing the wording in the Student Loan Scheme Act to align with the Tax Administration Act 1994. This would provide consistency of treatment between small amounts of income tax and student loan obligation. This should not have a significant impact as it will adjust the threshold for a small balance write-off by one cent. Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 2020. EARLY ASSESSMENTS OF STUDENT LOAN ADJUSTED NET INCOME Section 191(2) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 Allowing valid returns filed before the end of the tax year to be finalised and the borrower’s repayment obligation to be calculated. Background Currently, the Act requires that a borrower’s end-of-year repayment obligation on their adjusted net income cannot exceed their loan balance on the last day of the tax year. In some cases, a borrower may file a return before the end of the tax year (for example, if they go overseas) and this requirement would delay Inland Revenue being able to complete this assessment until the end of the year. The amendment provides that where a return is filed earlier than the last day of the tax year, the assessment could be completed, and the borrower’s repayment obligation should not exceed their loan balance on the date the return is filed. If the borrower earns further income in the year, for example returns to New Zealand unexpectedly, their repayment obligation can be amended, and a further assessment issued. Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 2020. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 15 NEW LEGISLATION PAYMENT ORDERING RULES Section 194(1) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 Allocating payments against the oldest unpaid period, and within each period against interest first, then the principal. Background Currently, the Act requires that payments be offset first against interest on the loan, then against the principal, for non-salary and wage payments, where the borrower does not specify a treatment. Payments are generally allocated against the oldest unpaid assessment, and then against interest before principal within each period. This treatment is generally advantageous to borrowers as it will minimise any interest they are charged. The amendment reflects the period-based allocation of payments within the new system. Key features Section 194(1) is replaced to reflect the period-based allocation of payments. Application date The amendment applies from 1 April 2020. LOANS RESULTING FROM IDENTITY THEFT Section 146C and clause 28 of Part 5 of Schedule 6 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 Enabling Inland Revenue to write off loans taken out before 2000, where the Commissioner is satisfied that the borrower did not take out the loan, and the correct borrower cannot be identified. Background Inland Revenue manages loans that were taken out by borrowers before 2000. However, it does not have the legislative authority to write off loans where the borrower has been able to prove that they did not take out the loan and the correct borrower cannot be identified. Loans taken out from 2000 onwards are administered by MSD who do have the power to reverse loans if they cannot locate the correct borrower. Key features A new clause 28, is inserted in Part 5 of schedule 6 of the Act to allow Inland Revenue to write off loans that were transferred before 1 April 2000 where the Commissioner is satisfied that the person who has been allocated the loan did not take it out, and the correct borrower cannot be identified. Application date The amendment applies from 1 April 2020. OVERSEAS-BASED BORROWERS WITH SERIOUS ILLNESS OR DISABILITIES Section 25(2) and 26, 27, 176, and clause 11(1) of schedule 1 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 Background On application, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue may treat overseas-based borrowers who are unable to meet their repayment obligation as a result of a serious illness or disability as being physically in New Zealand. Key features The change provides a new circumstance for when a borrower can be treated as being physically in New Zealand. This means they could be eligible for an interest-free loan and have repayment obligations based on their income. Borrowers with a serious illness who are unable to meet their overseas-based repayment obligations will be able to be treated as physically in New Zealand for the purposes of determining whether they are New Zealand-based or overseas-based. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 16 NEW LEGISLATION The amendment will require the borrower to provide evidence of their medical and financial position as the Commissioner of Inland Revenue requires. Unlike for hardship relief, the borrower would not necessarily need to supply evidence annually. Instead they would need to do so as the Commissioner of Inland Revenue reasonably requires. The borrower will be required to notify the Commissioner of Inland Revenue of their annual adjusted net income. This is required of all borrowers who have repayment obligations based on their income. Application date The amendment applies from 1 April 2020. Detailed analysis The treatment will be available to borrowers who have an injury, illness, or disability that results in them being unable to engage in paid work, other than work for which the person is paid a token payment or a very low wage, or where that injury, illness or disability poses a serious and imminent risk of death. The proposed amendment will not change borrowers’ abilities to receive hardship relief. Example 6 Ben lives overseas and was seriously injured in a football game. After the accident Ben had to quit his job and he is now financially unable to meet his overseas-based repayment obligation. Ben is now working at his local community gardens, as part of the country’s welfare programme. As part of this welfare programme, Ben receives a payment for his work that is below the country’s ordinary minimum wage. He is eligible to apply to be treated as a New Zealand-based borrower, meaning he would have an interest free loan and repayment obligations based on his income. STUDENT LOAN SCHEME (DETAILS OF BORROWER’S CONTACT PERSON) AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2020 These regulations were made under section 215(d) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011. They amend regulation 3 of the Student Loan Scheme (Details of Borrower’s Contact Person) Regulations 2012 Background Under the Student Loan Scheme (Details of Borrower’s Contact Person) Regulations 2012, borrowers are required to provide the date of birth and IRD number of their alternative contact person when they apply for their student loan. However, at that time, no equivalent regulations were passed for when borrowers apply for a repayment holiday. The Student Loan Scheme (Details of Borrower’s Contact Person) Amendment Regulations 2020 align the information required about a borrower’s contact person when they apply for a student loan or a repayment holiday. Key features These regulations require that borrowers provide the date of birth and IRD number of their alternative contact person when they: • • apply for a student loan repayment holiday; • • update their contact person’s details; or • • nominate a new contact person. Application date These regulations came into force on 1 April 2020. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 17 NEW LEGISLATION REFUNDING R&D TAX CREDITS Sections LA 5(4B), (5B), (5C), (5D), LZ 14, and YA 1 (definitions of approved research provider, eligible research and development expenditure, ESCT, FBT, levy body researcher, PAYE, and refundability cap) of the Income Tax Act 2007 These changes affect the amount of R&D tax credits that can be refunded to a person. They replace the existing $255,000 refundability cap, corporate eligibility criteria, and R&D wage intensity test with new broader refundability rules. Background Refundability is intended to ensure that all claimants doing R&D can benefit from their R&D tax credits soon after the year their R&D takes place in. Without refundability, some claimants may not be able to benefit from their credits until a much later date (if at all, depending on the circumstances of each claimant). Refundable credits enable claimants in a tax loss position, or with insufficient income tax liability to use all of their R&D tax credits in the relevant income year, to benefit from their R&D tax credits sooner. In year 1 (the 2019–20 income year), limited refundability rules were introduced to enable some firms to access refundable credits. These rules were taken from the existing R&D tax loss cash-out regime, because tight timeframes meant there was not enough time to develop broader refundability rules. The Government committed to reviewing the refundability rules so that broader refundability would be available from year 2 of the credit (the 2020–21 income year). Note that this section of the Tax Information Bulletin also incorporates changes enacted by the COVID-19 Response (Taxation and Social Assistance Urgent Measures) Act 2020 (COVID-19 Tax Act), which amended R&D rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act 2020. Key features • • The Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act 2020 (the KSSLRM Act) introduces new broader refundability rules. • • The application date of these new rules was brought forward to the 2019–20 income year by the COVID-19 Tax Act. They were originally intended to apply from the 2020–21 income year, which is the second year of the R&D tax credit scheme. • • Under the broader refundability rules, eligible claimants can now receive refunds of their R&D tax credits up to a new refundability cap. The new rules also remove the previous corporate eligibility and wage intensity criteria. This means a business with surplus R&D tax credits only needs to satisfy the usual R&D tax credit eligibility criteria to be eligible for refundability – no special refundability eligibility criteria (aside from the new cap) apply. • • The new refundability cap is based on the amount of labour-related taxes (PAYE, fringe benefit tax (FBT), and employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT)) paid by a claimant in the relevant income year. Grouping rules apply to allow certain companies to allocate their labour-related taxes to other companies they control, or that sit within the same wholly- owned group. • • The cap does not restrict refunds for eligible expenditure on approved research providers or to levy body researchers (industry organisations to which a levy is payable under New Zealand statute, such as the Commodity Levies Act 1990). • • Any non-refundable R&D tax credits may still be carried forward to the next income year provided the shareholder continuity requirements in section LY 8 are met. • • The KSSLRM Act introduced a transitional provision that would have allowed claimants to include certain taxes paid in year 1 in their year 2 refundability cap. This transitional provision has been removed by the COVID-19 Tax Act, because this Act enables claimants to access the broader refundability rules in year 1. • • While the new broader refundability rules will apply from the first year of the tax credit by default, claimants who would prefer to apply the limited refundability rules can choose to apply these instead of the broader refundability rules. This needs to be signalled when a claimant is filing its R&D tax credit claim with Inland Revenue. Table 1 illustrates the key differences between the limited refundability rules with the new broader refundability rules. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 18 NEW LEGISLATION Table 1: Key differences between the limited refundability rules and the new broader refundability rules Limited refundability rulesNew broader refundability rules Eligibility criteriaMust satisfy the corporate eligibility criteria (section MX 2) – this includes a requirement that claimants must be companies, cannot be listed, and cannot be considered a tax resident of another jurisdiction under a double tax agreement. No corporate eligibility criteria. Must satisfy the wage intensity criteria (section MX 3) – this requires twenty percent of a firm’s labour costs to be on R&D labour. No wage intensity criteria. Exempt income exclusionMust not derive exempt income or be associated with a person who derives exempt income (unless the exempt income is from intercompany or foreign dividends under sections CW 9 or 10). No exempt income exclusion for refundability (but new exempt income exclusion applies in the R&D Tax Incentive general eligibility criteria from the 2020-21 income year – refer to page 54 of this TIB). Cap$255,000.The total labour-related taxes (PAYE, FBT, and ESCT) paid by the claimant (exceptions and grouping rules apply). AvailabilityIn the 2019-20 income year only (if a claimant opts to apply these instead of the new broader refundability rules – otherwise, the broader refundability rules apply by default). From the 2019-20 income year onwards (these rules now apply by default to any eligible claimants). Detailed analysis No separate eligibility rules for refundable R&D tax credits (sections LA 5(4B) and LY 3, and subpart MX) Under the new broader refundability rules, businesses do not need to satisfy the corporate eligibility or wage intensity requirements (these had to be satisfied under the previous limited refundability rules). This means that provided a business is eligible for the R&D tax credit, and is either in a tax loss position or has insufficient income tax payable to fully utilise all of its R&D tax credits in the relevant income year, the business may access refundable R&D tax credits up to its refundability cap. New refundability cap (sections LA 5(4B), (5B), (5C), and section YA 1) The new refundability cap replaces the previous $255,000 cap (which applies under the limited refundability rules). Under the new cap, a business that is unable to offset all of its R&D tax credits against its income tax liability may receive refundable R&D tax credits equal to or less than the amount of labour-related taxes (PAYE, FBT, and ESCT) they have paid for the relevant income year. That is, the maximum amount of refundable R&D tax credits the business can claim in an income year is the lesser of: • • the amount of labour-related taxes paid by the business for the relevant income year; or • • the amount of R&D tax credits claimed by the business. Example 7: Full refund of credits under the refundability cap In the year ended 31 March 2021, EmmaCorp has eligible R&D expenditure of $1 million, so it is eligible for $150,000 of R&D tax credits. The company has 12 employees and pays a total of $200,000 in labour related taxes (this amount is EmmaCorp's refundability cap). EmmaCorp has no income tax to pay in the 2020–21 income year. Because its R&D tax credits ($150,000) are less than its refundability cap ($200,000) for the year, EmmaCorp can receive a refund of all its R&D tax credits. Variation of facts: Partial refund of credits under the refundability cap If EmmaCorp had only 6 employees and paid a total of $100,000 in labour-related taxes for the year, it would have a refundability cap of $100,000. Only $100,000 of its R&D tax credits would be refundable. EmmaCorp meets the shareholder continuity requirements, so the remaining $50,000 of R&D tax credits can be carried forward to the 2021–22 income year. Levy body researchers and expenditure on approved research providers The new cap does not apply to refundable R&D tax credits paid to levy body researchers or derived from eligible expenditure on approved research providers. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 19 NEW LEGISLATION Example 8: Credits paid to levy bodies are fully refundable Levy Body A (LBA) is an industry organisation to which levies are payable under the Commodity Levies Act 1990. LBA incurred $1,000,000 of eligible R&D expenditure in the year ended 31 March 2021. It has no income tax liability and pays $50,000 of labour-related taxes for the year. LBA receives a full refund of its $150,000 R&D tax credits, because the new refundability cap does not apply to levy body researchers. Levy Body A – 31 March 2021 Eligible R&D expenditure$1,000,000 × 15% R&D tax credits claimed$150,000 Income tax liability$0 R&D tax credits refunded$150,000 Example 11 illustrates how the new broader refundability rules apply to eligible expenditure on approved research providers. Cap can include taxes paid by other companies The refundability cap has grouping rules, which allow certain companies to allocate labour-related taxes they have paid to other companies they control or that sit within the same wholly owned group. The formula for calculating the refundability cap is: O wn tax + other wholly owned tax + other controller tax − double-dip allocation Te r mDefinition Own taxThe labour-related taxes paid by a claimant for the relevant tax year. Other wholly owned taxThe total labour-related taxes allocated to the claimant that have been paid by a member of the claimant’s wholly owned group for the relevant tax year. Other controller taxThe total labour-related taxes allocated to the claimant that have been paid by a company that controls the claimant for the relevant tax year. Double dip allocationAny amounts included in the claimant’s refundability cap that have already been included in the refundability cap of another person (see explanation and example 10 below). Example 9 illustrates how the grouping rules apply. Example 9: Grouping rules Misto Labs is an R&D-intensive firm eligible for $400,000 of R&D tax credits in the 2021-22 income year. It is in a tax loss position, so does not have any income tax liability to offset its R&D tax credits against. Its refundability cap is made up of the following amounts: Misto's refundability cap for the 2021-22 income year Formula componentAmountExplanation Own tax$75,000PAYE, ESCT and FBT paid by Misto this year. Other wholly owned tax$100,000PAYE, ESCT and FBT paid by Zeus Industries this year. Zeus is a company in the same wholly-owned group as Misto. Zeus has $200,000 of its own labour-related taxes but allocates $100,000 to Misto. Other controller tax$100,000Total PAYE, ESCT and FBT paid by ZigCo this year. ZigCo controls Misto (it holds 65% of the shares in Misto). Double-dip allocation($0)No amounts allocated to Misto by Zeus or ZigCo have been used by, or allocated to, other businesses for the purposes of calculating a refundability cap. Misto's total cap$275,000 Since Misto has a refundability cap of $275,000, it can obtain an R&D tax credit refund for $275,000 of its credits. Its remaining $125,000 of R&D tax credits are non-refundable in the 2021-22 income year. Misto can carry these non-refundable credits forward to the 2022-23 income year provided it satisfies the R&D tax credit shareholder continuity requirements. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 20 NEW LEGISLATION The “double-dip allocation” part of the formula strips out any amounts allocated to a claimant that have already been allocated to another person. This prevents the same taxes going towards more than one claimant’s labour-related tax-based cap. It is important that any given amount of labour-related taxes is only allocated to one claimant. Example 10: Grouping rules with double-dip allocation Same facts as example 9, except ZigCo claims $100,000 of R&D tax credits, half of which it offsets against its income tax payable. As with the previous example, ZigCo has paid $100,000 of PAYE, ESCT and FBT for the year. ZigCo indicates in its supplementary return that it has a refundability cap of $50,000, and so receives an R&D tax credit refund of its remaining $50,000 of credits. Despite this, ZigCo informs Misto that it will allocate $100,000 of labour-related taxes to Misto. Because ZigCo has already used $50,000 of its own labour-related taxes for its refundability cap, the double-dip allocation rules apply. Misto's refundability cap for the 2021-22 income year (fact variation) Formula componentAmountExplanation Own tax$75,000PAYE, ESCT and FBT paid by Misto this year. Other wholly owned tax$100,000 PAYE, ESCT and FBT paid by Zeus Industries this year. Zeus is a company in the same wholly owned group as Misto. Zeus has $200,000 of its own labour-related taxes but allocates $100,000 to Misto. Other controller tax$100,000 Total PAYE, ESCT and FBT paid by ZigCo this year. ZigCo controls Misto (it holds 65% of the shares in Misto). Double-dip allocation($50,000)ZigCo has allocated $100,000 to Misto, of which it has already used $50,000 for its own refundability cap. The same amount of tax can only go towards one person’s refundability cap, so the $50,000 already used by ZigCo must not be included in Misto’s cap. Misto's total cap$225,000 The $50,000 “double-dip allocation” is subtracted from the other amounts included in Misto's refundability cap, because this amount has already been included in ZigCo's cap. After deducting the double-dip allocation amount, Misto's refundability cap is $225,000. Ordering rules for R&D tax credits (sections LA 5(4B) and LA 6(2)) Amended section LA 5(4B) retains a reference to section LA 6(2), which relates to the treatment of refundable tax credits. Any R&D tax credits claimed by a person must first be used to satisfy their income tax liability, if any, for the income year to which the credits relate (note that non-refundable R&D tax credits are applied to satisfy income tax liability before refundable R&D tax credits). Once a person has used their credits to satisfy their income tax liability for that year, different rules apply depending on whether any remaining R&D tax credits are refundable or non-refundable. Table 2: Rules for the treatment of remaining R&D tax credits Non-refundable creditsRefundable tax credits Any remaining non-refundable tax credits can only be offset against income tax liabilities in the current year and must then be carried forward. Before any remaining refundable R&D tax credits can be refunded, the credits must first be applied to any other liabilities in this order: • a n income tax liability for the current year; • a n income tax liability for a previous year; • an income tax liability for a future tax year; • a current provisional tax liability for a future tax year; and • a different tax period or type (as requested by the claimant, or as applied by Inland Revenue if the claimant has any other tax outstanding). Example 11 illustrates the application of the ordering rules. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 21 NEW LEGISLATION Example 11: Refundable credits from approved research provider expenditure and application of ordering rules In the year ended 31 March 2021, Kimmie’s Lab Ltd (KLL) incurred $50,000 of eligible R&D expenditure. Of the $50,000 of eligible R&D expenditure, $30,000 was incurred on eligible R&D activities performed by an approved research provider. KLL had $2,000 of income tax payable for the year and did not pay any labour-related taxes. KLL is eligible for $7,500 of R&D tax credits: • • $4,500 of refundable R&D tax credits ($30,000 of approved research provider expenditure × 15%); and • • $3,000 of non-refundable R&D tax credits ($20,000 of other eligible R&D expenditure). Before receiving an R&D tax credit refund, KLL’s R&D tax credits must first be offset against its income tax liability for the year. KLL offsets $2,000 of its non-refundable R&D credits against its income tax liability of $2,000. KLL receives an R&D tax credit refund of $4,500 for the income year. Its $1,000 of surplus non-refundable R&D tax credits can be carried forward to the 2021–22 income year provided KLL satisfies the R&D tax credit shareholder continuity requirements. Kimmie’s Lab Ltd – 31 March 2021 Eligible R&D expenditure on ARP$30,000 Other eligible R&D expenditure$20,000 Total eligible R&D expenditure$50,000 Eligible R&D expenditure not on ARP$20,000 × 15% Non-refundable R&D tax credits$3,000 Income tax liability$2,000 Less non-refundable R&D tax credits($3,000) Non-refundable R&D tax credits carried forward to 2021–22($1,000) Eligible R&D expenditure on ARP$30,000 × 15% Refundable R&D tax credits$4,500 The $50,000 “double-dip allocation” is subtracted from the other amounts included in Misto's refundability cap, because this amount has already been included in ZigCo's cap. After deducting the double-dip allocation amount, Misto's refundability cap is $225,000. The limited refundability rules (sections LA 5(5D) and LZ 14) Section LZ 14 provides the limited refundability rules (which were previously in LA 5(4B)), which businesses can choose to apply instead of the broader refundability rules, if this is their preference and they are eligible under the limited refundability rules. Under the limited refundability rules, a business may receive R&D tax credit refunds provided it is a company and: • • is in a tax loss position, or has insufficient income tax liability to utilise all of its R&D tax credits in the 2019–20 income year; • • satisfies the R&D tax loss cash-out corporate eligibility and wage intensity criteria in sections MX 2 and MX 3; • • does not derive exempt income, and is not associated with a person who derives exempt income; • • is not a listed company, and is not associated with a listed company; and • • does not have an outstanding tax liability. Only the first $255,000 of the business’s R&D tax credits is refundable, which is equivalent to $1.7 million of eligible R&D expenditure. Any remaining R&D tax credits may be carried forward to the 2020–21 income year if the shareholder continuity requirements in section LY 8 are met. Choosing between the year 1 and year 2 refundability rules Businesses may choose to use the limited refundability rules (new section LZ 14) or the broader refundability rules (section LA 5) in the 2019–20 income year, but they cannot use both. Only the broader refundability rules are available from the 2020–21 income year. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 22 NEW LEGISLATION Example 12: Applying the broader refundability rules Moppy’s Chicken Factory (“Moppy”) has brought forward tax losses from the 2018–19 income year to the 2019–20 income year. It claims R&D tax credits in the 2019–20 income year but does not have enough income tax to pay to use all of its credits. Moppy determines that it will be able to receive more refundable R&D tax credits if it applies the broader refundability rules, because it has $500,000 of surplus R&D tax credits and has paid $500,000 of PAYE in the 2019–20 income year (so its refundability cap is $500,000). Moppy files its income tax and R&D supplementary returns soon after 31 March 2020. It advises Inland Revenue that it would like to apply the broader refundability rules. Inland Revenue processes Moppy’s claim and refunds Moppy $500,000 of R&D tax credits. FOREIGN TERTIARY EDUCATION ORGANISATIONS AND CALLAGHAN INNOVATION NOT ELIGIBLE FOR R&D TAX CREDITS Section LY 3(2)(d)(iii) and (iv) of the Income Tax Act 2007 Foreign tertiary education organisations and Callaghan Innovation are excluded from the tax credit, as are their associates and any entities they control. These exclusions apply from the 2019–20 income year. Background The R&D tax credit regime is intended to encourage business R&D. Consequently, tertiary education organisations (as well as their associates, and any entities they control), are excluded from the regime. The amendment clarifies that overseas tertiary education organisations come within the scope of the exclusion. Callaghan Innovation is a Government agency and is helping Inland Revenue administer the R&D tax credit. For the avoidance of doubt, this amendment ensures that Callaghan Innovation, entities it controls, and any of its associates cannot claim the R&D tax credit. Key features Section LY 3(2)(d) is amended to exclude: • • foreign tertiary education organisations – section LY 3(2)(d)(iii); and • • Callaghan Innovation – section LY 3(2)(d)(iv). These exclusions apply from the 2019–20 income year, so that they can be incorporated into the processing and administration of year 1 claims. CERTAIN TAX-EXEMPT ENTITIES NOT ELIGIBLE FOR R&D TAX CREDITS Sections LY 3(2)(f), LY 8, and YA 1 (definitions of exempt income and levy body researcher) of the Income Tax Act 2007 Entities which receive exempt income under sections CW 38, CW 39, CW 40, CW 41, CW 42 and/or CW 55BA of the Income Tax Act 2007 are ineligible for the R&D tax credit from the 2020–21 income year. This exclusion does not apply to industry levy bodies. Background The aim of this exclusion is to prevent entities which already derive substantial benefits from the tax system, in the form of deriving mostly tax-exempt income, from accessing further benefits via the tax credit. Charities, which come within the tax- exempt entity exclusion, do not pay income tax, and receive additional Government support in the form of GST concessions, exemption from FBT, and the donor tax credit regime. Note that this section of the TIB includes amendments made by the COVID-19 Response (Taxation and Social Assistance Urgent Measures) Act 2020. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 23 NEW LEGISLATION Key features From the 2020–21 income year (“year 2”), entities which receive exempt income under these sections of the Income Tax Act 2007 are excluded from the R&D tax credit: • • section CW 38 (public authorities); • • section CW 39 (local authorities); • • section CW 40 (local and regional promotion bodies); • • sections CW 41 and CW 42 (charities); and • • section CW 55BA (tertiary education institutions and their subsidiaries). These excluded entities may be eligible in the 2019–20 income year. Therefore, any tax credits received by these entities for the 2019–20 income year that have not been offset against income tax payable, or refunded, for the 2019–20 income year are extinguished from the 2020–21 income year. Example 13: Charity's year 1 credits extinguished In the year ended 31 March 2020, Charity X claims $100,000 of R&D tax credits. As Charity X does not pay income tax, it has no income tax liability to offset its R&D tax credits against. It does not pay any labour-related taxes, so is unable to receive any R&D tax credit refunds. Charity X has a standard 31 March balance date. Its $100,000 of R&D tax credits from year 1 cannot be refunded in year 1, and also cannot be brought forward to year 2. They are extinguished from 1 April 2020. Charity X also ceases to be eligible for the R&D tax credit from this date. Some entities which receive tax-exempt income under these sections in subpart CW may not wholly sit outside the tax system and may perform business R&D. To allow these entities to claim (such as through an R&D performing taxpaying subsidiary), this exclusion does not include broader association rules. Entities associated with tax-exempt entities affected by this exclusion may still claim the credit, if they otherwise satisfy the credit’s eligibility criteria. Levy body researchers (defined in section YA 1 as industry organisations to which levies are payable under an Act) are not affected by this exclusion, so may be eligible even if they receive exempt income under any of the above sections. R&D performed by levy bodies is typically funded by businesses in the relevant industry for these businesses’ benefit, so levy body R&D is fundamentally business R&D. This exclusion does not include broader association rules in relation to entities excluded for deriving these kinds of tax-exempt income. A subsidiary taxpaying business is not ineligible for the credit merely because it is owned by an entity which derives excluded tax-exempt income. This means that an excluded entity which undertakes eligible R&D may set up a non-tax-exempt subsidiary to claim the credit. Example 14: Subsidiary not ineligible merely because parent derives exempt income Charitech is a charity which performs R&D to support its charitable work. It performs R&D on adapting traditional plant medicines so that they can be used alongside modern medicine to achieve better health outcomes. Charitech would like to claim the R&D tax credit for its R&D in the 2020–21 income year, but because it derives exempt income it is ineligible to claim the credit in its own right. Charitech establishes a subsidiary company and shifts its R&D activities, so that the activities are performed by the subsidiary instead. The subsidiary does not derive any exempt income, so is not excluded from the credit through the exempt income exclusion. Assuming the subsidiary satisfies the other R&D tax credit eligibility criteria, it will be able to claim the credit, even though its parent organisation receives exempt income. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 24 NEW LEGISLATION ALLOCATING CREDITS TO JOINT VENTURE MEMBERS Section LY 1(4) of the Income Tax Act 2007 The amendment changes the joint venture credit allocation rules, so that R&D tax credits must be allocated to a member of an R&D performing joint venture based on their interest in the joint venture. Background The joint venture allocation rules in section LY 1(4) previously required R&D tax credits to be allocated in accordance with a claimant’s interest in the income of an R&D performing joint venture. The rules now allocate credits in accordance with the claimant’s interest in the joint venture, without reference to income. This ensures the provision operates as intended for joint ventures regardless of whether they derive income. Key features Section LY 1(4) is amended to remove references to income. The onus is on joint venture members to use an appropriate methodology to determine their interests in the joint venture for the relevant income year. Application date The amendment applies from the 2019–20 income year. INTERNAL SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT CHANGES Section YA 1 (definition of internal software development expenditure) of the Income Tax Act 2007 The amendment broadens the definition of internal software development expenditure subject to the $25 million cap, so that it includes all software development expenditure that is not external software development or software development undertaken for the purpose of internal administration. Background The policy intent is for software development expenditure to come within the $25 million cap if it is not software development undertaken for the purpose of internal administration (which is completely excluded) or external software development (which is not limited by a special expenditure cap). Before this amendment, it was unclear whether the $25 million cap covered all internal software development expenditure. This amendment resolves this ambiguity by clearly bringing all expenditure on software development within the $25 million cap, unless the expenditure is on external software development or internal software development undertaken for the purpose of internal administration. Key features The definition of “internal software development expenditure” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 is amended to ensure the $25 million cap applies to all activities that normally considered internal software development (such as operational internal software development). The expanded definition covers any software development expenditure that is not: • • software development undertaken for the purpose of internal administration of a person’s business or their associate’s business (this comes within the existing definition of “ineligible internal software development” in section YA 1); or • • external software development expenditure. Application date The amendment applies from the 2019–20 income year. Detailed analysis A $25 million expenditure cap applies to all internal software development. This means that a person can only claim $25 million of expenditure on this kind of software development in their income year, regardless of how much they have actually spent. The cap applies to any software developed for internal purposes unrelated to administration. This includes such purposes as manufacturing, testing, quality control, or enhancing non-digital services to customers. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 25 NEW LEGISLATION Example 15: Software developed for non-administrative internal purposes Eugene works for a manufacturing company developing shatter-resistant glass for car windscreens. He develops software that can track stresses on the glass during impact testing in very fine detail, increasing the quality of the testing process. This satisfies the definition of internal software development expenditure, as the software being developed is solely for internal use in improving the quality of the testing process. As it is unrelated to back office administrative purposes, the expenditure Eugene's business incurred to develop the software is eligible - however, it is subject to the $25 million cap. Software that enhances non-digital services to customers A service is a non-digital service if the main reason why the person’s customers use it is to obtain the service, not to use the software (even though that service may be enabled, supported, or facilitated by the software). This type of expenditure comes within the $25 million cap, as it is considered expenditure on internal software development. Example 16: Software that enhances non-digital services to customers Mohammed runs a courier business and develops software that enables his customers to pinpoint the exact location and condition of their packages. This satisfies the definition of internal software development expenditure, because Mohammed's customers are using his services to receive the goods he delivers, not to use the software Mohammed has developed. The expenditure Mohammed's business incurred to develop the software is subject to the $25 million cap. Association rules apply to limit the amount claimable by associated persons The $25 million cap groups a person’s expenditure with internal software development already claimed by the person’s associates. The rationale behind applying the cap to associated persons is to prevent the cap from being circumvented by the person splitting their expenditure across associates to effectively exceed the cap. For partnerships and look-through companies, the cap is applied at the partnership or look-through company level (rather than the partner or individual owner level). Example 17: Associated persons with internal software development expenditure SL Ltd incurs $20 million of internal software development expenditure and XW Ltd incurs $11.5 million. SL Ltd and XW Ltd are wholly owned by NB Ltd. As XW Ltd and SL Ltd are associated persons for tax purposes, their combined claim may not exceed $25 million. This means that $6.5 million of their combined expenditure (which totals $31.5 million) is not eligible because it exceeds the internal software development cap. GENERAL APPROVAL OF SUPPORTING ACTIVITIES Schedule 21, part B, clause 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Businesses in the general approval regime must obtain approval of their supporting activities for these activities to be eligible for the tax credit. Background Various amendments were made to the Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Bill in response to submissions made to the Bill at the Select Committee stage. This included an amendment to the scope of general approval. In the Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Bill as introduced, general approval only applied to core activities. At the Select Committee stage, the Bill was amended following submissions requesting general approval be extended to cover supporting activities as well. This was to provide businesses with added certainty that their R&D would be eligible for the credit. A clause equivalent to schedule 21, part A, clause 24 should have been added into schedule 21, part B at the time these other changes were made – this was the policy intent. This amendment adds new clause 12 into schedule 21, part B, to ensure the legislation is consistent with the policy intent. This new clause clarifies that supporting activities are ineligible if they have not been approved. This amendment applies from year 2 of the R&D tax credit regime (the 2020–21 income year), so that it can be incorporated into the administration of the tax credit once in-year approval is rolled out in year 2. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 26 NEW LEGISLATION Key features This amendment adds clause 12 to schedule 21, part B of the Income Tax Act 2007, which lists activities that are excluded from the definition of supporting R&D activity. This clause provides that an activity is not eligible as a supporting activity if it has not been approved under the general approval regime (if the general approval regime applies to the person claiming the activity). Application date The amendment applies from the 2020–21 income year. GENERAL APPROVAL BINDS THE COMMISSIONER Section 68CB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 When an R&D activity is approved under the general approval regime, that approval is binding on the Commissioner. Background The general approval regime is intended to provide customers with certainty that their R&D activities will be eligible for the credit during (or soon after) the income year in which those activities take place. Prior to this amendment, general approval was not binding on the Commissioner. This meant she could change her view as to whether an activity was a core or supporting activity, even if she had approved the activity as part of the general approval process. The policy intent has always been for general approval to be binding on the Commissioner. To that end, once granted, approval by the Commissioner is binding provided all the conditions of the general approval legislation are met. Key features This amendment makes general approval (both for the pilot and for the full scheme) binding on the Commissioner, provided a claimant fulfils the requirements set out in section 68CB. Application date The amendment applies from the 2019–20 income year for the pilot and the 2020–21 income year for the full general approval scheme. CRITERIA AND METHODOLOGIES APPROVAL MANDATORY FOR SIGNIFICANT PERFORMERS Section 68CC of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Criteria and methodologies approval (“CAM”) is mandatory for a person who opts into the significant performer regime from the 2020–21 income year. Background From the 2020–21 income year, all businesses seeking to receive R&D tax credits are required to obtain general approval or, if they qualify, opt into the significant performer regime. A business can be eligible for the significant performer regime if it reasonably expects to have more than $2 million of eligible R&D expenditure for the relevant income year. The significant performer regime is intended to provide large R&D performers with an alternative to the general approval regime, because the compliance and administrative costs associated with obtaining general approval for large amounts of R&D activities may outweigh the benefit of the R&D tax credit for these businesses. Businesses who spend significant amounts on R&D will still want certainty regarding their R&D tax credit claims. This led to the creation of the CAM regime, which was (prior to this enactment) optional for businesses in the significant performer regime. This amendment makes the CAM regime mandatory, which should: • • Provide businesses who opt out of general approval (which is mandatory for businesses that are not in the significant performer regime) with more comfort regarding the eligibility of their activities and expenditure. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 27 NEW LEGISLATION • • Reduce the cost of obtaining R&D certificates (which businesses in the significant performer regime are required to obtain). This is because providing R&D certificates to businesses with CAMs requires significantly less work for R&D certifiers. This should reduce compliance costs for these claimants. • • Ensure businesses engage with officials regarding their R&D tax credit claims earlier in the claims process. This should reduce the need for later scrutiny and reduce the likelihood of claims being reassessed (and penalties and interest later being imposed). Key features A person who opts into the significant performer regime must now obtain criteria and methodologies approval for their R&D activity and expenditure. Application date The amendment applies from the 2020–21 income year. TIMEFRAME FOR COMPLETING DISPUTES PROCESS Sections 108(1E) and 113E of the Tax Administration Act 1994 This amendment allows the Commissioner to adjust a person’s R&D tax credit claim upwards if the person has initiated the disputes process through issuing a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) within four months of filing their income tax return or a year after their income tax return due date. Background A person can only file a NOPA to increase their R&D tax credit claim once for each R&D tax credit claim they make. Prior to this amendment, the legislation required the disputes process to be completed within a year of a person’s income tax return due date if the person sought to increase their R&D tax credit claim. This is contrary to the policy intent, which is that a person must initiate the disputes process within a year of their income tax return due date. These rules regarding initiating disputes are aimed at preventing the retrospective reclassification of expenditure. The retrospective reclassification of expenditure includes where R&D activities or expenditure are identified after the end of an income year. If a person receives R&D tax credits for R&D they were unaware of at the time the R&D activities took place, the R&D tax credit regime has not provided any incentive to the person to undertake additional R&D. The retrospective reclassification of expenditure has been problematic in other jurisdictions. The amendment will require a person to initiate the disputes process by filing a NOPA within a year of their income tax return due date but does not require the disputes process to be completed within this time frame. This time limit is intended to provide a person with enough time to prepare the required information to file a NOPA while nevertheless discouraging the retrospective reclassification of expenditure. Key features The amendments to sections 108(1E) and 113E allow the Commissioner to adjust a person’s R&D tax credit claim upwards, if the person has initiated the disputes process through issuing a NOPA before the earlier of: • • four months of filing their income tax return; or • • a year after their income tax return due date. Provided the NOPA has been filed within these timeframes, there is no specific deadline by which the disputes process must be completed. Application date The amendment applies from the 2019–20 income year, so that the policy intent is met for the administration of year 1 claims. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 28 NEW LEGISLATION APPROVED RESEARCH PROVIDERS MUST PERFORM CORE R&D ACTIVITIES Section 124ZH of the Tax Administration Act 1994 To become an approved research provider, a person must be able to perform core R&D activities. Background Businesses can access various concessions through approved research providers: • • A person needs to incur at least $50,000 of eligible R&D expenditure in an income year to claim the R&D tax credit. However, amounts under $50,000 may be eligible where the person uses an approved research provider to perform the R&D on their behalf. • • Eligible amounts spent on approved research providers may be refunded in full, if the person has surplus R&D tax credits (for example, if they are in a tax loss position or do not have enough income tax to pay to offset all their R&D tax credits against). The policy intent is for an organisation to only be eligible to become an approved research provider if they can perform core R&D activities. These are activities that involve attempting to resolve scientific or technological uncertainty. Previously, the legislation only required that an approved research provider be able to perform core or supporting activities for their clients. This meant an entity could become an approved research provider, even if it was only able to perform supporting R&D activities (which do not need to involve the resolution of any scientific or technological uncertainty, in and of themselves, to be eligible). This amendment changes the requirements to become an approved research provider, so that a person must be able to perform core R&D activities to become an approved research provider. Key features The requirements for approving a person’s application to become an approved research provider are amended to specify that, in addition to the other existing requirements, a person must be able to perform core R&D activities. Application date The amendment applies from the 2019–20 income year, so that it can be incorporated into the processing and administration of year 1 claims. DECLINING R&D CERTIFIER APPLICATIONS Section 124ZI of the Tax Administration Act 1994 The amendment clarifies the circumstances in which a person’s accepted R&D certifier application must be declined, by explicitly providing that the Commissioner must decline a person’s application where approving the person as an accepted R&D certifier would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system. Background Accepted R&D certifiers are able to provide R&D certificates to claimants in the significant performer regime. From the 2020–21 income year, all claimants will be required to either obtain activity approval under the general approval regime or opt into the significant performer regime. Significant performers must provide R&D certificates to the Commissioner with their R&D supplementary returns. The amendment provides the Commissioner with another ground for declining a person’s application to be an accepted R&D certifier. The amendment is consistent with the policy intent, which is that the Commissioner should be able to decline a person’s application where their status as an accepted R&D certifier would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system. It is arguable that the Commissioner already has this ability because of section 6 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. For the avoidance of doubt, however, this amendment clarifies that the Commissioner must decline a person’s application in these circumstances. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 29 NEW LEGISLATION Key features Section 124ZI of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is amended so that the Commissioner must decline a person’s application to become an accepted R&D certifier, where approving the person’s application would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system. Application date The amendment applies from the 2020–21 income year. REVOKING R&D CERTIFIER STATUS Section 124ZI of the Tax Administration Act 1994 The amendment extends the circumstances in which the Commissioner must revoke a person’s accepted R&D certifier status. The amendment requires the Commissioner to revoke a person’s approval as an accepted R&D certifier where the accepted R&D certifier has provided an R&D certificate to another person in the last 2 years who has entered into a tax avoidance arrangement for R&D tax credits, or where allowing the accepted R&D certifier to retain their R&D certifier status would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system. Background Claimants in the significant performer regime must obtain an R&D certificate from an accepted R&D certifier. The amendment to section 124ZI is consistent with the policy intent, which is not reflected in full by this provision as currently enacted. It provides the Commissioner with additional grounds to revoke a person’s approval as an accepted R&D certifier. Revoking approvals with adverse effect on tax system integrity As with the other remedial amendment to section 124ZI regarding declining a person’s application to be an accepted R&D certifier, the policy intent is that a person would have their approval revoked if their retaining it would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system. It is arguable that even without this amendment, the Commissioner already has this ability because of section 6 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. For the avoidance of doubt, however, this amendment clarifies that the Commissioner must revoke a person’s accepted R&D certifier status in these circumstances. Providing certificates to participants of tax avoidance arrangements The legislation already allows the Commissioner to revoke a person’s approval as an accepted R&D certifier if they have provided an R&D certificate in the last 2 years to a person who received shortfall penalties arising from tax evasion and taking an abusive tax position (this is through the references in section 124ZI(7)(b) to sections 141D and 141E). Tax avoidance may not always involve taking an abusive tax position, however, so this amendment makes it so that providing an R&D certificate to a person who enters into a tax avoidance arrangement is another ground on which the Commissioner must revoke a person’s approval. Key features Section 124ZI of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is amended so that in addition to the grounds under which the Commissioner could previously revoke a person’s approval, the Commissioner must also revoke a person’s approval as an accepted R&D certifier where: • • allowing the person to retain their approval would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system; or • • the person has provided an R&D certificate to another person, and that other person has entered into a tax avoidance arrangement for R&D tax credits within the last two years. Application date The amendment applies from the 2020–21 income year. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 30 NEW LEGISLATION CHALLENGING THE COMMISSIONER’S DECISIONS Section 138E of the Tax Administration Act 1994 The amendment prevents a person from challenging the Commissioner’s decisions made for the pilot approval scheme and exceeding the $120 million cap. Background Pilot approval scheme A pilot approval regime is in place in year 1 of the R&D tax credit scheme (the 2019–20 income year). The pilot is aimed at enabling the Commissioner to test and refine the in-year approval regimes before they are rolled out more broadly in year 2 (the 2020–21 income year). To take part in the pilot, both the Commissioner and a person must agree that the person will take part in the pilot. The person is required to submit an approval application by a prescribed date, which the Commissioner will then approve or decline. There is a legislative requirement that the Commissioner notify the person of her intent to decline their application before declining it. This is to provide the person with an opportunity to provide additional information in support of their application where appropriate. This amendment stops taxpayers from challenging the Commissioner’s decisions made for the pilot approval scheme, other than through judicial review. This is through adding sections 68CB and 68CC to section 138E(1)(e)(iv) from the 2019–20 income year. Exceeding the $120 million cap There is a cap of $120 million on the amount of eligible R&D expenditure for which a person can claim R&D tax credits. This equates to a cap of $18 million R&D tax credits. A person can apply to exceed the $120 million cap by applying for an approved R&D cap. The Commissioner can approve an application for an approved R&D cap if the Commissioner: • • is satisfied the relevant R&D activities give rise to substantial net benefit for New Zealand; and • • has consulted with the chief executive of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. The amendment stops taxpayers from challenging the Commissioner’s decisions regarding approved R&D caps. This is through adding section 68CD to section 138E(1)(e)(iv) from the 2019–20 income year. No right to challenge in other parts of R&D tax credit regime Section 138E already prevents a person from challenging the Commissioner’s decisions made about: • • approved research providers (sections 124ZH and 138E(1)(e)(iv)); • • R&D certificates and certifiers (sections 124ZI and 138E(1)(e)(iv)); • • general approval from the 2020–21 income year (sections 68CB and 138(1)(e)(iv)); and • • the significant performer regime from the 2020–21 income year (sections 68CC and 138E(1)(e)(iv)). Adding sections 68CB, 68CC and 68CD to section 138E(1)(e)(iv) from the 2019–20 income year is consistent with the approach taken in the rest of the regime regarding decisions made by the Commissioner. It is also consistent with the policy intent, which is for decisions made by the Commissioner regarding the R&D tax credit to be final and not subject to challenge other than through judicial review. Key features Decisions made by the Commissioner on the these matters cannot be challenged: • • participation in the pilot approval scheme (sections 68CB and 68CC); • • applications to exceed the $120 million cap on eligible expenditure (section 68CD). Application date The amendment applies from the 2019–20 income year. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 31 NEW LEGISLATION AMENDMENT TO PART-YEAR OVERRIDE OF SECTION LY 3(2)(B) Section LZ 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007 This amendment corrects a drafting error. It is intended to ensure that section LZ 13 operates as intended. Section LZ 13 relates to claimants with late balance dates who receive Callaghan Innovation Growth Grants in the 2020–21 income year. It enables these claimants to be eligible for the R&D tax credit for the part of that year, after 31 March 2021, for which they do not receive Growth Grant payments. Application date The amendment applies for the 2020–21 income year. OVERSEAS DONEE STATUS Schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007 These charities have been granted donee status from the 2019–20 and later income years: • • Little Brothers and Sisters International; • • Partners Relief & Development – New Zealand; • • Project Moroto; and • • UN Women National Committee Aotearoa New Zealand Incorporated. The Act also makes changes to other existing charities listed on schedule 32: • • “Hope Street Charitable Trust” replaces “Orphans Refugees and Aid (ORA International) of NZ Charitable Trust” with effect from 15 June 2019. • • “Onesight New Zealand” is removed with effect from 30 May 2019. Background New Zealand-based charities that apply some or all of their funds for overseas purposes and want donors to receive tax benefits in connection with any donations received, must be named as a donee organisation on the list of recipient of charitable or other public benefit gifts in the Income Tax Act 2007. Donee status entitles individual donors to a tax credit of 331/3 percent of the amount donated to these organisations, up to the level of their taxable income. Companies and Māori Authorities are eligible for a deduction for monetary donations up to the level of their net income. Application dates The new insertions apply from the 2019–20 and later income years. The other changes to the schedule apply from the dates specified above. REFUNDING OVERPAID PIE TAX Sections BC 7, CX 56, HM 6, HM 36B, LA 6, LS 2, YA 1 “PIE schedular income”, “residual income tax", “schedular income” of the Income Tax Act 2007 and sections 22C and 22D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 A number of amendments have been made to introduce a year end square up process for tax on individuals’ multi-rate portfolio investment entity (PIE) income, such as KiwiSaver schemes. This process uses individuals’ correct prescribed investor rate (PIR) to determine whether the right amount of tax has been paid on this income during the tax year. Individuals’ multi-rate PIE income is taxed separately as PIE schedular income at the PIR. An adjustment is made to the amount of the person’s income tax liability at year end for over- or under- payments of tax by the PIE during the tax year. This adjustment or PIE square-up will happen alongside the year-end process for income tax. Any refund due or tax payable resulting from over- or underpayment of tax on PIE income during the tax year is added to the investor’s end of year tax position and is either refunded, payable or reduces the person’s tax payable or reduces a person’s tax refund. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 32 NEW LEGISLATION Other miscellaneous amendments have also been made to ensure the new PIE rules are integrated smoothly into the tax system. All references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. Background The PIE tax rules apply to collective investment vehicles where investors combine resources to make different types of passive investments, for example a managed fund and KiwiSaver. A multi-rate PIE attributes income, losses and tax credits to investors. The tax rate applied to these types of PIEs varies from investor to investor and may vary from year to year for individual investors, depending on their income in the two previous tax years. The PIE pays tax on the PIE income of each investor based on the rate notified by their investor. If an investor does not notify a rate, the default rate of 28% applies. Previously, individuals’ income from multi-rate PIE investment was generally excluded income, unless the investor had underpaid tax on their PIE income because they notified their PIE provider with a rate that is too low. Where PIE tax has been underpaid (when the investor has notified a rate that is too low), the investor had to include their PIE income in their income tax return and it was taxed at the investor’s marginal tax rate, which may be up to 33%, whereas the top PIR is 28%. The investor has a tax credit in the year-end income tax calculation for tax already paid on PIE income during the tax year. When the correct PIR was used or where a too high rate had been used, income from a multi-rate PIE remained excluded income and did not flow through to the investor’s individual income tax return and assessment. This meant that where an individual has overpaid tax on multi-rate PIE income (for example, because the investor has notified a rate that is too high or has defaulted onto the highest PIR of 28%), the PIE investor could not get the overpaid amount refunded. The amendments ensure that individuals’ PIE income from multi-rate PIEs is taxed at individuals’ correct PIR with an adjustment to their terminal tax at year end for over- or under- payments of tax made during the tax year. Key features The changes to the PIE rules will mean that all natural person individuals with income from multi-rate PIEs will have an end of year square up of this income using their correct PIR. An adjustment to their terminal tax for the tax year is made for over- or under- payments of tax on that PIE income during the tax year. The key changes are as follows. • • Income of natural persons from multi-rate PIEs is no longer excluded income, but PIE schedular income. The tax rates applicable to this type of income, the prescribed investor rates under Schedule 6, clause 1, remain unchanged. • • Inland Revenue will add individuals’ income from a multi-rate PIE, which is added to the list of “reportable income”, to individuals’ pre-populated accounts alongside the other income information for the tax year. • • Inland Revenue will calculate the tax liability on attributed multi-rate PIE income using individuals’ correct PIRs based on the income information Inland Revenue holds and will make adjustments to account for any over- or underpayments that may have occurred in relation to the tax paid on that income by the PIE during the tax year. • • Inland Revenue will calculate any adjustment resulting in a refund or tax to pay in relation to PIE schedular income without the individual needing to do anything. Refunds will be paid out or will reduce their terminal tax payable without individuals having to request them and tax payable will be added to individuals’ income tax liability for the tax year. Application date The changes apply from 1 April 2020. Detailed analysis PIE schedular income The new rules apply to income derived by a natural person investor in a multi-rate PIE. This income is now schedular income under section BC 7. An amount of attributed multi-rate PIE income that a natural person who is an investor in a multi-rate PIE derives under section CP 1 (Attributed income of investors in multi-rate PIEs) to which the prescribed rates of tax set out in Schedule 6, clause 1 (Prescribed rates: PIE investments and retirement scheme contributions) apply is “PIE schedular income” (section HM 36B(6) and the definition of “PIE schedular income” in section YA 1). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 33 NEW LEGISLATION Calculation of PIE schedular income tax liability and adjustment The income tax liability on PIE schedular income is calculated under section HM 36B. This calculation determines whether an adjustment needs to be made by comparing the tax paid by the PIE, with the tax liability when using the correct PIR based on the income information Inland Revenue holds about an individual. The calculation also considers the tax already paid on the attributed income by the PIE as a tax credit and any credits used by the PIE to satisfy the investor’s income tax liability, such as foreign tax credits and imputation credits. This is to ensure that these tax credits are not double counted or taken away through the adjustment calculation. Multi-rate PIE income from individuals who have advised a notified investor rate that is lower than their prescribed investor rate will no longer be subject to the individual’s marginal tax rate, but will be taxed at the investor’s PIR (capped at 28%). Any amount of tax that has been under-paid (section HM 36B(4) Positive adjustment) is included in the investor’s schedular income tax liability for the tax year and modifies the investor’s income tax liability for the tax year (section BC 7). The amount of an adjustment under section HM 36B is not included in residual income tax, for a person and for a tax year, so that the residual income tax and provisional tax are not affected by the new PIE rules (see paragraph (f) in the definition of “residual income tax” in section YA 1). Any tax that has been overpaid (section HM 36B(5) Negative adjustment) is first applied to reduce the investor’s terminal tax payable (their tax bill) for the tax year. Any remaining amount is refundable under sections RB 4, RM 2 to 8, and RM 10 (which relate to refunds and their use). Year-end process Calculating PIE schedular income adjustments for natural person investors under section HM 36B is done as part of individuals’ year-end income tax process. However, the new PIE rules will not alter individuals’ year-end information and filing obligations. The income from a multi-rate PIE attributed to an individual has been added to the list of “reportable income” in section 22D(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The information on PIE income attributed to an individual investor for a tax year is provided to Inland Revenue by the multi-rate PIE and will then be included in individuals’ pre-populated accounts. Inland Revenue will calculate any adjustment to the person’s terminal tax for an amount of PIE schedular income derived for a tax year without the individual needing to do anything. Refunds will be paid out or will reduce their terminal tax payable without individuals having to request them and tax payable will be added to individuals’ income tax liability for the tax year. A “qualifying individual” under section 22D is an individual who only earns reportable income for an income year and has no other income information that must be provided to Inland Revenue. “Qualifying individuals” will continue to be generally not required to provide any income information to Inland Revenue and in most cases their tax position, including their PIE schedular income tax, will be squared up automatically, without them having to do anything. Inland Revenue will pay out refunds of overpaid tax on multi-rate PIE income without the individual having to provide information or confirm the tax position that Inland Revenue has calculated, unless the person is required to provide information or confirm for other reasons. An individual who earns both “reportable” and “other income” continues to be required to provide relevant information on the other income they earn and finalise their tax position themselves. They must ensure that the information included in their pre- populated account is correct and complete before they confirm their end of year assessment. If the individual wishes to file their return shortly after the end of the tax year, and before Inland Revenue will have received all reportable income information from the relevant third parties, including PIE schedular income information from a multi-rate PIE, they must ensure that they include this information in their tax return. It follows then that it may be easier for these individuals to wait until Inland Revenue has complete “reportable income” information before filing their return. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 34 NEW LEGISLATION WIDENING THE COMMISSIONER’S POWER TO PUT INVESTORS ON THE CORRECT PRESCRIBED INVESTOR RATE Sections HM 60B and HM 60 of the Income Tax Act 2007 The amendment widens the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s ability to provide a tax rate (prescribed investor rate) to a multi- rate portfolio investment entity (PIE) that it must apply to the investor’s attributed PIE income. Background The PIE tax rules apply to collective investment vehicles, including KiwiSaver schemes. A person investing in a multi-rate PIE is required to notify their PIE with a tax rate for the tax year, the notified investor rate. An investor’s correct PIE tax rate for a tax year is their prescribed investor rate (PIR), which approximates their marginal tax rate (capped at 28%) and is based on the lower of income in one of the previous two tax years. The multi-rate PIE pays tax on income attributed to individual investors based on the notified investor rate. Where the investor has not notified the PIE of a tax rate, the top 28% PIE tax rate applies by default. Changes made to Inland Revenue’s systems and processes as part of its Business Transformation programme mean that from 1 April 2019 Inland Revenue is now able to better identify instances where an investor’s PIE income is being taxed at an incorrect rate. Before the amendments, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue had an ability under section HM 60 to provide a PIE with a tax rate for an investor. However, this was limited to situations where the investor had provided the PIE with a notified investor rate and the Commissioner considered this notified rate not appropriate. It did not cover situations where the investor had not notified a rate and defaulted onto the top PIE tax rate of 28%. Key features New section HM 60B allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to provide multi-rate PIEs with their investors’ PIRs for the tax year where: • • Inland Revenue holds sufficient information to determine the investor’s PIR applicable for the tax year and the Commissioner of Inland Revenue considers the notified investor rate is inconsistent with the investor’s correct PIR • • the investor has not notified their multi-rate PIE with a tax rate. The PIE must apply the rate provided by the Commissioner to the investor’s attributed PIE income as soon as reasonably practicable after having been notified of the rate by the Commissioner. The primary responsibility for determining an investor’s correct tax rate and notifying it to the PIE to ensure their PIE income is being taxed correctly remain with the investor. The investor therefore has the ability to subsequently notify their PIE with a different rate which the PIE then has to apply. Amendments to section HM 60 clarify that the “notified investor rate” refers to the rate given by the investor to the PIE. Application date The changes apply from 1 April 2020. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 35 NEW LEGISLATION TAXATION OF TRUSTS Sections BB 2(5), CX 56(1C), FC 2(4), HC 2(2) and (3), HC 4(1) and (1B), HC 7(3), HC 10(1)(ab) and (3), HC 14(2), HC 15(5C), (5D) and (6), HC 16(2) and (5), HC 25, HC 26(1), HC 27(4) AND (6),HC 28(3) and (4), HC 31B, HC 33(1B), (1C), (3),(3B).

This review identified several areas in the current law that were unclear and did not appropriately reflect either the policy intent or how the Commissioner applies the law. These amendments to the trust rules address those concerns. The proposed amendments are: • • remedial in nature; and • • clarify the trust rules so that they work as intended, as described in IS 18/01. Background The amendments to the trust rules arise from an administrative review of the taxation of trusts. This review identified several areas in the current law that were unclear and did not appropriately reflect either the policy intent or how the Commissioner applies the law, as set out in IS 18/01: Taxation of trusts (IS 18/01). Many submissions were received in the process of developing IS 18/01, and were considered in formulating the amendments discussed in this Tax Information Bulletin item. Key features The amendments in the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters Act 2020) are consistent with the Commissioner’s application of law and with the policy intent. Application dates The application date for each amendment is set out in each of the following items relating to the taxation of trusts. CLARIFYING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SECTION BB 2 AND BF 1 OF THE INCOME TAX ACT 2007 Section BB 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 The amendment provides consistency in terminology used in both of sections BB 2 and BF 1 of the ITA 2007. Key Features The core provisions of the ITA (the core provisions) impose: • • income tax on taxable income, withholding taxes on some classes of income and other forms of tax (termed ancillary tax); and • • provide the method for calculating a person’s income tax liability links to parts of the Act that set out detailed mechanisms for calculating withholding tax and ancillary taxes. The amendment ensures that the wording in section BB 2(5) refers to both income tax and ancillary tax, to provide consistency in terminology between sections BB 2(5) and BF 1 (ITA 2007). Application date The amendment applies from 23 March 2020. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 36 NEW LEGISLATION RESIDENCE OF CO–TRUSTEES TREATED AS A NOTIONAL SINGLE PERSON Sections HC 2(2), (3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 Background In the ITA 2007, the term trustee is defined to include all co-trustees for the time being. Under section HC 2 of the ITA 2007, co- trustees are treated as a notional single person for satisfying the income tax obligations for trustee income of that trust. Prior to the amendments to HC 2, which relate to the tax residence of co-trustees, the Commissioner considered that co- trustees of a trust were resident in New Zealand if at least one of those co-trustees was a New Zealand resident in their personal capacity. 3 This view is consistent with the long-standing policy intent. The amendments address questions raised in submissions about residence for co-trustees circumstances during the review of the taxation of trusts. The amendments give taxpayers greater certainty, and are consistent with the policy intent. The amendments to section HC 2 confirm the Commissioner’s view on how the ITA 2007 applies to determine the tax residence of co-trustees in IS 18/01. Residence is an important factor for compliance with taxation obligations in New Zealand because: • • the trustee of the trust is the person responsible for calculating and satisfying the income tax liability; • • residence of the trustee is relevant for determining if certain tax credits can be used in satisfying the income tax liability of the trustee; • • payers of passive income need to know the residence status of an investor to determine the correct tax rate (for example, is the passive income subject to resident withholding tax or non-resident withholding tax); and • • the residence of the trustee is more certain when considering the application of a double tax agreement to trustee income derived by co-trustees. If a trust has a sole trustee, the residence of the trustee is determined under the residence rules in section YD 4, determining residence based on their personal capacity 4 . Having determined tax residence on this basis, the sole trustee has always been required to satisfy their tax obligations, in their trustee capacity separate from their personal capacity. Prior to these amendments to section HC 2, In IS 16/03 and IS 18/01, 5 the Commissioner considered that, for a trustee comprising of co-trustees, the trustee is resident in New Zealand if any one of the co-trustees is resident in New Zealand. This single notional person is also the person who: • • derives the trustee income of the trust; and • • satisfies all income tax obligations for that trustee income. Because a trustee is responsible for calculating the income tax liability for trustee income, it is necessary for the trustee to know their tax residence status to correctly apply: • • the global /gross approach in the core provisions of the ITA 07 for calculating taxable income relating to trustee income of the trust. The global/gross approach taxes income sourced from New Zealand and the world-wide income derived by a New Zealand resident; • • the rules in section HC 25 and HC 26 relating to foreign-sourced income derived by a trustee. These rules both require knowledge of the residence of the trustee; and the settlor of the trust; and • • the rules relating to tax rates for a trustee that are applied by payers of passive income and PIE entities. The amendments to section HC 2 clarify the treatment of co-trustees in relation to residence, consistent with how the Commissioner applies the law and the policy intent. Key Features The amendments to section HC 2 clarify that at any point in time, or for a period, the trustee (as a notional single person) is a New Zealand resident for income tax purposes if at least one of the co-trustees is resident in New Zealand at that time or for that period. 3 I nterpretation statement 18/01: Taxation of trusts (IS 18/01) and Interpretation statement 16/03: Tax residence (IS 16/03). 4 I nterpretation statement 18/01: Taxation of trusts (IS 18/01) and Interpretation statement 16/03: Tax residence (IS 16/03). 5 I nterpretation statement 18/01: Taxation of trusts (IS 18/01) and Interpretation statement 16/03: Tax residence (IS 16/03). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 37 NEW LEGISLATION Correspondingly, the trustee (as a notional single person) is a non-resident only if all the co-trustees are non-resident at that time or for that period. The amendments also clarify that the residence of co-trustees of a trust is determined for the purpose of: • • calculating the trust’s taxable income for an income year; • • providing a joint return of income for the trust for each income year; • • self–assessing the trust’s taxable income and income tax liability for each income year; • • determining the availability of foreign tax credits for foreign-sourced trustee income; • • satisfying the income tax liability on trustee income of the trust for each income year; • • satisfying withholding tax obligations for passive income distributed from the trust fund; • • complying with obligations for notifying tax rates to payers of passive income and under the PIE rules, in both cases relating to investments owned by the trustee; and • • satisfying the trustee’s obligations as an agent under section HC 32 for a distribution of beneficiary income and a taxable distribution. However, the amendments do not apply to a trustee comprised of co-trustees if that trustee has elected, under section HC 33 (the section HC 33 election), to pay New Zealand tax on the world-wide trustee income. A key effect of the section HC 33 election is that a trustee must determine their income tax obligations on the basis that the trustee and the settlor of the trust are resident in New Zealand (irrespective of the residence of the trustee). This obligation ensures that: • • foreign sourced income derived by the trustee is taxable in New Zealand; and • • passive income derived from New Zealand is subject to resident withholding tax. Application date The amendments apply for income years beginning on or after 23 March 2020. Detailed analysis The amendment to section HC 2(2) clarifies that treating a trustee comprising of co-trustees must meet all income tax obligations imposed under section BB 2 as a notional single person. Previously, this subsection only referred to the calculation of taxable income and satisfaction of the income tax liability for trustee income. New section HC 2(3) clarifies that, if a section HC 33 election is not made to pay New Zealand tax on world-wide trustee income, the single notional person (a trustee comprising of co-trustees) is a New Zealand resident if any one of the co-trustees is resident in New Zealand in their own capacity. Correspondingly, if none of the co-trustees are resident in New Zealand in their own capacity, then the single notional person trustee is not resident in New Zealand. Section HC 2, as amended, clarifies and provides consistency of treatment across several rules that require a trustee, as a notional single person, to comply with tax obligations imposed under the ITA 007, including: • • calculating and satisfying the income tax liability on trustee income. This includes the income tax liability arising following a section HC 33 election; • • access to certain tax credits such as the foreign income tax credit; and • • notifying banks and PIEs of the correct tax rate for passive income (that is, non-resident withholding tax rate or resident rate). In addition, under section HC 32 the trustee must also satisfy the income tax obligations for beneficiary income unless the Commissioner agrees that the beneficiary can assume that obligation. 6 6 Section HD 4(2)(b) ITA 2007. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 38 NEW LEGISLATION CORPUS OF A TRUST Sections HC 4(1), (1B), YA 1 “transfer of value” of the Income Tax Act 2007 The amendments to section HC 4 clarify the value of a settlement of property made on trust. Under general trust law, a settlement of property is treated as a single trust and the value of that property constitutes the corpus of that trust. Section HC 3 of the ITA 2007 modifies this general law to allow multiple settlements of property made to a trustee of a trust to be treated as being made on a single trust for income tax purposes. The amendments ensure that if multiple settlements are treated as being made on one trust, the value of the corpus of that trust is the aggregate value of those settlements. In addition, an unintended change in the rewrite of this provision relating to a transfer of value arising from a forgiveness of debt is corrected. The Income Tax Act 2004 included certain forgiveness of debt within the meaning of a disposition of property (which was included in the meaning of a settlement of property). This unintended change is corrected by amending the definition of “transfer of value” to include a “disposition of property”, as defined in the ITA 07. This ensures that the meaning of transfer of value is consistent with corresponding rules in the Income Tax Act 2004. Background Under trust law, each settlement creates a separate trust. For income tax purposes, this is modified to permit trustees to elect to treat multiple property settlements on the terms of a trust deed as being additions to corpus of the same trust (section HC 3 of the ITA). The aggregate value of multiple property settlements for such a corpus was not clearly identified in the law before this amendment. Key features The value of corpus for a single property settlement continues to be defined as equal to the market value at the time of the settlement. New section HC 4(1B)) clarifies that, when a trustee treats multiple property settlements as being on one trust, the total value of corpus is the aggregate value of each property settlement, with that value being determined at the time of settlement. This amendment: • • is consistent with commercial practice; and • • ensures that the ordering rules for distributions (section HC 16 of the ITA) are applied in a manner consistent with that practice. In the Income Tax Act 2004, a settlement and a distribution include a forgiveness of a loan, because they are included in the definition of “disposition of property” in the Income Tax Act 2004. The rationalisation of these various rules during the rewrite may have obscured this outcome. The amendment to the definition of transfer of value (section YA 1) in new paragraph (cb) clarifies that a forgiveness of a loan continues to be treated as a disposition of property for both a settlement on a trust and a distribution from the trust. Application date The amendments to section HC 4 and the definition of “transfer of value” in section YA 1 apply from 23 March 2020. CERTAIN SETTLEMENTS EXCLUDED FROM TRUSTEE INCOME Section HC 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007 The amendment to section HC 7 clarifies that certain settlements on a trust which are excluded from corpus and instead taxed to the trustee as trustee income, will not be included in trustee income if the settlement is distributed as beneficiary income. Background The proposed amendment is a response to a submission made during the administrative review of trust taxation that section HC 7 contained an unintended legislative change arising in the rewrite of this provision. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 39 NEW LEGISLATION Section HC 7 is intended to ensure that certain settlements excluded from corpus are taxed in the year of the settlement, to prevent a deferral of tax on undistributed income by resettling amounts on a sub-trust. Under the corresponding provisions in the Income Tax Act 2004, such a settlement could be taxed to either the trustee as trustee income or the beneficiary if distributed as beneficiary income. The rewritten provision did not give this outcome and is now corrected by this amendment. Key features Excluding certain property settlements from corpus under section HC 7(3) is to mitigate against a deferral of tax in situations where those settlements would, if they were distributed, be taxable to a New Zealand resident beneficiary. The proposed amendment clarifies that when a settlement is excluded from corpus it is included in trustee income for the income year in which the settlement occurred unless the income is distributed in the same income year to a beneficiary, either as beneficiary income or a taxable distribution. The proposed amendment applies to the following types of resettlements: • • A re-settlement by a trustee on a sub-trust that could otherwise have been distributed as income that would be taxable to a New Zealand resident beneficiary. • • A settlement that is an allowable deduction for the settlor (for example, an employer’s contribution to a trust that provides non-retirement benefits for employees). • • A settlement that would otherwise be income of the settlor and assessable for income tax in New Zealand. Application date The amendment applies from 1 April 2008, and validates tax positions taken on this basis, and is consistent with commercial practice. ELECTION TO PAY TAX ON WORLDWIDE TRUSTEE INCOME Sections CX 56(1C), HC 25()(c)(ii), HC 26(1)(ab), HC 33, HM 55D(9), HM 56, RF 2(2)(d) of the Income Tax Act 2007 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section 113F of the Tax Administration Act 1994 The amendments to section HC 33 and, consequentially, other related provisions clarify: • • the circumstances in which a person (either the trustee, settlor or beneficiary of that trust) may elect to pay tax on worldwide trustee income (a section HC 33 election); • • the basis for calculating and satisfying that tax obligation; and • • the consequences for distributions from trustee income derived before, on and after this election. In general, a section HC 33 election has effect from the date selected by that person (the effective date of the election). The effective date of the election may be retrospective, but: • • this is limited to a maximum of 4 years before the year in which the election is made; and • • is conditional on the income tax obligations being satisfied for the trustee income derived from the effective date of the election. The amendments are intended to allow a future distribution of worldwide trustee income from income derived after the effective date of the election to be made from a complying trust (that is, the distribution is exempt income). A section HC 33 election does not change the tax treatment of distributions made before 23 March 2020. Background In recent years, several situations were identified, including: • • a settlor of a foreign trust had migrated to New Zealand without an understanding of the effect that migration might have on future distributions from the trust; or • • a complying trust that ceased to have a settlor resident in New Zealand while deriving foreign-sourced income. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 40 NEW LEGISLATION For these situations, it was identified that a previous amendment to the definition of complying trust could be read, in some circumstances, as permitting some taxpayers to revisit past tax positions to gain complying trust status on a retrospective basis. However, that previous amendment did not clarify: • • whether, despite not being liable for tax on worldwide trustee income, a “late election” could be made to pay tax on such trustee income; and • • how distributions from trustee income derived before and after such a late election would be treated. As a result of this uncertainty, amendments have been made to the election rules in section HC 33. These amendments are consistent with the policy intent of both: • • the previous amendment to the definition of complying trust relating to the ability to pay tax on past year’s world-wide trustee income; and • • allowing a trustee to make tax free distributions from past year’s trustee income only if that trustee income has been fully subject to New Zealand tax at the trustee rate. Key features The amendments clarify: • • the circumstances in which a section HC 33 election may be made for a trust to pay tax on worldwide trustee income; • • the effect of that election on passive income rules, such as the non-resident withholding tax and the notified investor rate for PIEs; and • • the tax consequences for distributions from tax-paid worldwide trustee income before and after a section HC 33 election. For a section HC 33 election, other than one to which section HC 33(1B) applies, the effective date of the election is, at the option of person making the election, either: • • the date of the election; • • the beginning of the income year in which the election is made; or • • beginning of any of the four years preceding the income year in which the election is made. A deemed election to which section HC 33(1B) applies, also now extends to a registered foreign trust which is also a complying trust but is not required to file an annual return of income (for example, a charitable trust described in section HC 13). From the effective date of the election, the taxable income and income tax liability for the trustee must be calculated on the basis that both the trustee and settlor of the trust are a New Zealand resident. This has a consequential effect on the non- resident withholding tax rules and the notified PIE investor rate rules for trusts that have a non-resident trustee. Section 113F of the TAA authorises the Commissioner to make an amended assessment to a trustee’s return of income for any year as a result of a section HC 33 election being made having a retrospective effective date. Penalties and interest will not apply to such an assessment unless the trustee had adopted, for that year, either: • • an unacceptable tax position; or • • an abusive tax position; or • • a tax position for which the trustee is liable for a shortfall penalty for evasion or similar action. The notification rules in subpart 2D of the TAA provide the framework for making a section HC 33 election. However, the election referred to in section HC 33(1B) has its own notification rule. Application date The amendments apply from 23 March 2020. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 41 NEW LEGISLATION Detailed analysis Categories of election There are three separate categories of a section HC 33 election. These are set out in the amended section HC 33(3), and are summarised as follows: • • an election made by giving notice to the Commissioner within the election expiry period described in section HC 30 (section HC 33(3)(a)). This election may be made by any of the trustee, settlor or a beneficiary of that trust; • • any other election made by giving notice to the Commissioner along with the date from which the election is to apply (section HC 33(3)(b). This election may be made by any of the trustee, settlor or a beneficiary of that trust; and • • a notice given in either a return of income or the annual return required under section 59D of the TAA (section HC 33(3)(c)). This election is made by the person liable to file the return of income or the return under section 59D of the TAA. Giving notice to the Commissioner Section 14C in Subpart 2D of the TAA sets out how notice of the election is to be given to the Commissioner. Notifying the Commissioner through a MyIR account would meet the requirements of this provision. Effective date of election HC 33(3)(a) – election to which section HC 30 applies For an election to which section HC 33(3)(a) applies, the date of the election is the effective date. The effective date is important for applying the rules in section HC 30(3) in relation to a distribution. The amendments to section HC 33 do not change the effect of these rules. HC 33(3)(b) – at choice of electing person For an election to which section HC 33(3)(b) applies, the effective date is at the choice of the taxpayer either: • • the date of the election; or • • the beginning of the income year in which the election is made; or • • the beginning of any one of the four income years preceding the year of election. This clarification is intended to reduce compliance and administration costs for trusts when considering the tax effects on future distributions from trustee income derived in past years when the trust is not a complying trust. HC 33(3)(c) – deemed election For the election to which section HC 33(3)(c) applies, the effective date of the election is from the beginning of the year in which the trust ceased to be a complying trust (that is, it is not liable for New Zealand tax on worldwide trustee income). This notice is made when filing a return of income or, for a registered foreign trust, in the annual return required under section 59D of the TAA. This deemed election continues to be effective until a year in which the trustee either: • • does not meet their tax obligations for worldwide trustee income; or • • does not comply with the notice requirements set out in section HC 33(1B)(1)(c). Amended assessments New section HC 33(4) applies if a section HC 33 election is made. The person making the election is required to provide the Commissioner with all relevant information to allow the Commissioner to make an amended assessment under section 113F of the TAA. New section HC 33(6) also provides that an amended assessment for a prior year that gives rise to an increased income tax liability on the worldwide trustee income will not be subject to penalties and interest unless the original tax positions taken were either: • • an unacceptable tax position; • • an abusive tax position; or • • a tax position that causes the trustee to be liable to pay a shortfall penalty for evasion or a similar action. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 42 NEW LEGISLATION Section HC 33 election, income tax obligations, passive income, and PIE entities Calculation of trustee’s income tax liability on worldwide trustee income From the effective date of the election: • • the trustee must calculate their taxable income and income tax liability for trustee income for each income year; • • this obligation must be satisfied on the basis that both the settlor and the trustee of the trust are resident in New Zealand (sections HC 33(1C) and (2)); and • • a trust having a non-resident trustee who relies on a double taxation agreement to relieve the trustee from New Zealand tax will not satisfy this obligation. If this obligation is not satisfied, the trust cannot be a complying trust. This election and consequent obligations ensures that New Zealand tax is payable at trustee rate on the worldwide trustee income from the effective date of the election and that foreign tax credits are allowed for tax paid on foreign-sourced income. Passive income derived by a non-resident trustee The amendment to section RF 2 clarifies that, passive income derived from New Zealand by a non-resident trustee is no longer liable for non-resident withholding tax (NRWT). This is consistent with: • • the trustee’s obligation to calculate the trust’s income tax liability for world-wide trustee income on the basis both the settlor and the trustee are New Zealand resident; and • • consistent with the policy that tax on New Zealand sourced income should not be limited to the NRWT rate. As a result of this amendment, a trustee should notify a payer of passive income of the correct tax rate that should be applied in calculating resident withholding tax for future payments of passive income derived from New Zealand by the trustee. Trust investments in a PIE entity The amendments to section HC 55D and HC 56 of the ITA 07 clarify that, following a section HC 33 election: • • a non-resident trustee is no longer eligible for the notified foreign investor rate; and • • the determination of the prescribed investor rate excludes the effect of amendment assessments for past years. However, the transitional rule in section HC 55 ensures that the loss of eligibility for the notified foreign investor rate during an income year does not affect the PIE entity’s obligations to calculate tax on the trustee’s PIE income until the next income year. Distributions made before 23 March 2020 – no change Section HC 33(5)(a)) ensures that a distribution from trustee income before 23 March 2020: • • is treated as either beneficiary income or as a distribution from either a foreign, complying, or non-complying trust, determined at the time of that distribution; and • • ignores the effects on the status of a trust resulting from a section HC 33 election made on or after 23 March 2020. Distribution made on or after the effective date of election The ordering of distributions from tax-paid trustee income is subject to the ordering rules in section HC 16 (the ordering rules). These rules treat a distribution from trustee income as being made on a first-in-first-out basis (FIFO basis) for all periods. Under the FIFO basis for ordering distributions from trustee income, the tax treatment of the distribution is determined by the status of the trust for the period in which the trustee income was derived (that is, either as a foreign trust, or as a non-complying trust or a complying trust). If a section HC 33 election has been made, the status of a trust for a distribution made on or after 23 March 2020 from trustee income is determined from the interaction of the ordering rules with: • • section HC 30 of the ITA 07 (no change in effect); or • • new section HC 33(5) of the ITA 07 (which applies to distribution made on or after 23 March 2020). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 43 NEW LEGISLATION If a section HC 33 election has not been made, the status of a trust for a distribution from trustee income is determined from the ordering rules. As no amendments affect this outcome, the tax obligations for a distribution continue to be determined from the interaction of: • • the ordering rules; and • • the definitions of complying trust, foreign trust, or non-complying trust; and • • the definitions of distribution, beneficiary income and taxable distribution. Election to which section HC 33(3)(a) applies For an election to which section HC 30(2) applies (that is, it is made within the election expiry period described in section HC 30), there is no change to the tax effects for a distribution made from trustee income derived before, on or after the effective date of the election. These tax effects are set out in section HC 30(3) of the ITA 07. Under this provision, the tax effects are determined from how the ordering rules for a distribution from trustee income interact with the date of the election and the definitions of complying trust, foreign trust and non-complying trust. Election to which section HC 33(3)(b) and (c) applies New section HC 33(5) provides the tax consequences for a section HC 33 election other than one to which section HC 30 applies. This new section ensures that, for a foreign trust of which at least one settlor has become a New Zealand resident: • • a section HC 33 election is effective if it is made after the election expiry period described in section HC 30 has ended; and • • these effects override the application of section HC 30(4) for periods from the effective date of the election. Under section HC 33(5), the tax effects for a distribution from such a trust made on or after 23 March 2020 are determined from how the ordering rules interact with the effective date of the election and the definitions of complying trust, foreign trust and non-complying trust. The tax effects on a distribution are illustrated in the following examples: Example 18: Inbound migrating settlor A settlor of a foreign trust has migrated to New Zealand and became a New Zealand resident on 30 September 2013 (after ceasing to be a transitional resident). All beneficiaries of the trust also migrate to New Zealand and become New Zealand residents from the same date. The trustee is not resident in New Zealand. This trust has both New Zealand sourced income and foreign sourced income and the trust has existed since 2008. No section HC 33 election is made by 30 September 2014, and the trustee was not aware they were required to pay tax on its foreign sourced income but has paid tax on all New Zealand sourced income . The balance date of the trust is 31 March. A distribution (not being beneficiary income) of $1M was made on 30 June 2016 to New Zealand resident beneficiaries. No New Zealand tax was paid on this distribution by the trustee or the beneficiaries. The trustee wishes to make a distribution on 30 June 2020 and has learned that amendments have been made to the trust rules that affect the taxation of distributions. As a result of this enquiry, the trustee learns that a retrospective section HC 33 election may be made to pay tax on world-wide trustee income. The trustee makes a section HC 33 election on 5 April 2020, to apply from the beginning of 1 April 2016. This is the beginning of the fourth income year prior to the income year beginning 1 April 2020. Tax effect on distribution made on 30 June 2016 Because the distribution on 30 June 2016 is made before 23 March 2020, it is necessary to determine under the ordering rules, the extent to which the distribution is made from trustee income or capital gains derived by the trustee: • • on or before 30 September 2014; or • • after 30 September 2014. This analysis reveals that the distribution of $1M comprised: • • $400,000 from trustee income derived before 30 September 2014 (a taxable distribution from a foreign trust); • • $250,000 from trustee income derived after 30 September 2014 (a taxable distribution from a non-complying trust); • • $300,000 from a capital gain derived before 30 September 2014 (a distribution of a capital gain from a foreign trust); and • • $50,000 from a capital gain derived after 30 September 2014 (a taxable distribution from a non-complying trust). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 44 NEW LEGISLATION In summary, this distribution is treated as follows • • $400,000 – as a taxable distribution from a foreign trust; and • • $300,000 – as a taxable distribution from a non-complying trust; and • • $300,000 – as a distribution of a capital gain from a foreign trust. For the taxable distribution of $400,000, the beneficiary is liable for tax at the beneficiary’s marginal rate for the year ending 31 March 2017, along with any penalty and interest assessed for the late payment of that tax. For the taxable distribution of $300,000, the beneficiary is liable for tax at the 45% rate imposed on a taxable distribution from a non-complying trust, along with any penalty and interest assessed for the late payment of that tax. No tax is payable on the distribution of the capital gain from a foreign trust. The amendments to the trust rules do not affect this outcome. Proposed distribution on 30 June 2020 However, because the trustee has made a section HC 33 election with effect from 1 April 2016 the proposed distribution can be treated as a distribution from a complying trust to the extent the distribution is from income derived on or after 1 April 2016. However, this is dependent on the trustee satisfying the tax obligations on the worldwide trustee income of the trust before the date of the distribution at 30 June 2020. The proposed distribution is $1.5 million and the analysis of the source of that distribution shows that: • • $450,000 is to be made from trustee income derived after 30 September 2014 but before 1 April 2016 (taxable distribution from a non-complying trust); • • $1.05 million is to be made from trustee income derived on or after 1 April 2016 (distribution from a complying trust). As a result of the analysis, and assuming the trustee has satisfied the tax obligations arising from the section HC 33 election for period from 1 April 2016, the trust is a complying trust in relation to a distribution of income from this period. This means that the trustee is liable to pay tax at 45% on the taxable distribution of $450,000 (distributed from trustee income derived before 1 April 2016) but the distribution of $1.05 million is exempt income of the beneficiary. This treatment in section HC 33(5)(b) for trustee income derived after 30 September 2014 overrides the effect of section HC 30(4) for those periods. These amendments also apply to the case of multiple non-resident settlors if only one of those settlors becomes a New Zealand resident. This is because the settlor regime taxes worldwide trustee income if at least one of those settlors is resident in New Zealand (HC 25). Outbound migrating sole settlor A sole settlor of a trust has migrated from New Zealand and ceases to be a New Zealand resident at 1 April 2016. The trustee of this trust is a non-resident and all beneficiaries are New Zealand resident individuals. From 1 April 2016, the trust continues to derive foreign sourced income and interest income from New Zealand. Under the settlor regime, the foreign sourced income is no longer liable for New Zealand tax (section HC 25 applies), and the interest income is liable only for non-resident withholding tax as a final tax. Consequently, the trustee is no longer liable for tax on worldwide trustee income and the trust becomes a non-complying trust in relation to any distribution made from trustee income derived after the date the settlor ceases being a New Zealand resident. It is proposed to make a distribution of $650,000 to the beneficiaries on 1 October 2020. As the trustee’s annual returns of income for the 2016–17 to 2018–2019 tax years did not include the foreign sourced income, the trust cannot be a complying trust for distributions of trustee income derived during those periods. However, the trustee includes the foreign sourced income in the 2019–20 return of income, ticks the return to indicate complying trust status and satisfies the New Zealand tax obligations on the world-wide trustee income for that tax year on 30 July 2020. Analysis of the ordering rules shows that the proposed distribution of $650,000 will be sourced from trustee income as follows: • • $200,000 from trustee income derived prior to 31 March 2016 (from a complying trust); • • $120,000 from trustee income derived from 1 April 2016 until 31 March 2017 (from a non-complying trust); • • $200,000 from trustee income derived from 1 April 2017 until 31 March 2019 (from a non-complying trust); • • $130,000 from trustee income derived during the 2019–20 income year (from a complying trust). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 45 NEW LEGISLATION The distribution therefore comprises of: • • a distribution of exempt income of $330,000 (distributions from income derived while the trust is a complying trust); and • • a taxable distribution of $320,000 from a non-complying trust, liable for tax at the rate of 45%. However, the trustee could also make a section HC 33 election (HC 33(3)(b) refers) prior to the proposed distribution on 1 October 2020. This would supplant but the deemed election in the return of income for the year ending 31 March 2020 and this would not affect complying trust status for this year. If this election had been made with effect from 1 April 2016, and provided the tax obligations for all prior periods are satisfied prior to 1 October 2020, the trust will be a complying trust in relation to the entire distribution which would be treated as exempt income of the beneficiary. DEFINITION OF COMPLYING TRUST Sections HC 10(1)(ab) of the Income Tax Act 2007 The proposed amendment to section HC 10(1)(ab) clarifies the point in time from when a trust may be treated as a complying trust if: • • an election has been made, under section HC 33 of the ITA 07 (section HC 33 election) to pay New Zealand tax on worldwide trustee income; and • • the trustee satisfies the New Zealand tax obligations for that trustee income. This amendment provides consistency with the amendments to section HC 33, which allow such an election, including a section HC 33 election that has retrospective effect for up to 4 years before the year in which the election is made. Background The policy intent is that, in relation to a distribution from a trust, a complying trust is one that has paid New Zealand tax on world-wide trustee income (tax-paid trustee income) and so is able to make a distribution (other than beneficiary income) that is not taxed to the beneficiary. The amendments to section HC 10 are consistent with the amendments to section HC 33 of the ITA 07. Those amendments clarify the extent to which any trust that is not a complying trust may make a section HC 33 election to pay tax on its worldwide trustee income to gain complying trust status for distributions made after 23 March 2020 from tax-paid trustee income. The ordering rules in section HC 16 of the ITA 07 determine whether a distribution has been made from tax-paid trustee income. Key features A section HC 33 election to pay tax on worldwide trustee income is intended to alter the tax effects on a future distribution from a trust which has not always had a New Zealand resident settlor over the life of the trust. For example: • • a trust, for which the settlor has migrated from New Zealand and is no longer resident in New Zealand; or • • a trust for which the settlor has migrated to New Zealand and become a New Zealand resident (whether or not an election is made by the election expiry date referred to in section HC 30). New section HC 10(1)(ab) clarifies that that such a trust can gain or retain complying trust status in relation to a distribution by making section HC 33 election as follows. A trust for which the settlor has migrated to New Zealand is a complying trust in relation to a future distribution of trustee income: • • the section HC 33 election is made within the election expiry period referred to in section HC 30; • • the trustee satisfies all New Zealand tax obligations for worldwide trustee income derived after the date of the election and before the date of the distribution; and • • the distribution is made from trustee income derived after the date of the election and before the date of distribution. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 46 NEW LEGISLATION Any other trust that has not always had a New Zealand settlor may gain complying trust status for a future distribution of trustee income if: • • the section HC 33 election is made before the distribution is made; • • the trustee satisfies all New Zealand tax obligations for worldwide trustee income derived after the date of the election and before the date of the distribution; and • • the distribution is made from trustee income derived after the date of the election and before the date of distribution. A trustee that obtains relief from New Zealand tax on New Zealand–sourced income under a double tax agreement (treaty relief) after the effective date of an election would result in: • • the trustee not satisfying the obligation to tax on worldwide trustee income from the effective date of the election on the basis both the trustee and settlor of the trust are resident in New Zealand (sections HC 33(1C); and • • such a trust not meeting the definition of a complying trust in section HC 10 for a distribution from a period in which the trustee had obtained such treaty relief. Application date The amendments to section HC 10 apply for an election made on or after 23 March 2020. Detailed analysis New Zealand resident settlor of a complying trust becomes non-resident New section HC 10(1)(ab) applies to a trust that ceases to have a New Zealand resident settlor (other than death of a natural person settlor) for which a section HC 33 election is made, either as: • • an election to pay tax on worldwide trustee income as described in section HC 33(3)(b); or • • a deemed election because the trustee continues to self-assess worldwide trustee income at the trustee rate, as described in section HC 33(3)(c); and • • for both cases, the tax obligations for trustee income are satisfied for all periods from the date the election applies from. The ability to make a retrospective election under section HC 33(3)(b) for a trustee that has not paid tax on worldwide trustee income after the trust ceases to have a New Zealand resident settlor: • • allows the trustee to correct past tax positions for up to 4 years before the year in which the election is made; • • ensures that a future distribution of trustee income (not being beneficiary income) from trustee income derived during the period after the effective date of the election is treated as a distribution from a complying trust. The amendments ensure that a trust that ceases to have a New Zealand resident settlor may continue to be treated seamlessly as a complying trust in relation to a distribution of income from periods for which the trust is a complying trust. Settlor of a foreign trust becomes a New Zealand resident and no section HC 33 election within election expiry period Section HC 30(4) applies to a trust of which the settlor has migrated to New Zealand and no section HC 33 election was made within the election expiry period. The consequence of not making this election is that such a foreign trust is a non-complying trust in relation a distribution from trustee income derived after that election expiry date. Several situations have been identified of a settlor of a foreign trust migrating to New Zealand and not understanding the effect the migration might have on future distributions from the trust. Before the amendments to section HC 33 and HC 10, it was unclear: • • whether this non-complying status could be remedied by a “late election”; • • how distributions from trustee income derived before and after such a late election could be treated. These issues are addressed in the amendments in section HC 33 (see earlier in this TIB item) relating to the ability to make a “late election”, and the effect for distributions from tax-paid trustee income derived in periods after such an election. Section HC 10(1)(ab) complements those amendments to section HC 33 by clarifying that a complying trust in relation to a distribution includes a trust which has either: • • ceased to have complying trust status because the trustee is no longer liable for New Zealand tax at the trustee rate on worldwide trustee income; or • • a settlor has migrated to New Zealand and no election to pay tax on worldwide trustee income was made within the election expiry date. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 47 NEW LEGISLATION These amendments do not apply to a trust with a New Zealand resident settlor that is a non-complying trust because the trustee has not satisfied their New Zealand tax obligations on world-wide trustee income. This non-complying status subject to the time bar in section 108 of the TAA, is able to be remedied by satisfying those past tax obligations including relevant penalties and interest before a distribution is made. If these past tax obligations are able to be satisfied for all prior periods the trust is a non-complying trust, complying trust status is restored for all those periods. Settlor of a foreign trust migrates to New Zealand and section HC 33 election made New section HC 10(1)(ab)(i) applies to a trust of which the settlor has migrated to New Zealand and makes a section HC 33 election within the election expiry period. This period is either: • • for a settlor that is not a transitional resident, the 12-month period from the day on which the settlor becomes a New Zealand resident; or • • for a settlor that stops being a transitional resident , the 12-month period from the day the transitional resident status ceases. Section HC 10(1)(ab) clarifies that the meaning of complying trust includes such a trust. The amendment arises from a technical submission on this point made during the Commissioner’s review of the taxation of trusts. This amendment does not give rise to any change in commercial practice or the Commissioner’s practice. Example 19: Inbound migrating settlor A settlor of a foreign trust has migrated to New Zealand and became a New Zealand resident on 30 June 2017 (after ceasing to be a transitional resident). This trust has both New Zealand sourced income and foreign sourced income and the trust has existed since 2008. No section HC 33 election is made by 30 June 2018 and the trustee was not aware they were required to pay tax on its foreign sourced income. The balance date of the trust is 31 March. Consequently, this trust is a non-complying trust for a distribution (other than a distribution of beneficiary income) made after 30 June 2018 which is made from trustee income derived after 30 June 2018. Such distributions to are taxed at 45%, applying the source and residence principles set out in the core provisions. However, the amendments to section HC 33 and HC 10(1)(ab) permits a retrospective election may be made after 23 March 2020. The trustee makes this election on 1 June 2020, with an effective date of 30 June 2018. The trustee files a corrected return of income for the 2018–19 year and pays the correct amount of tax assessed for that year and for the 2019–20 and later income, the trustee satisfies tax obligations on worldwide trustee income of that trust. Because of that election and satisfaction of the relevant tax obligations for the 2018–19 income year, a distribution after 23 March 2020 from trustee income derived after 30 June 2018 is treated as being made from a complying trust. This treatment is set out in section HC 33(5)(b), and is intended to override the effect of section HC 30(4). These amendments also apply to the case of multiple non-resident settlors if only one of those settlors becomes a New Zealand resident. This is because the settlor regime taxes worldwide trustee income if at least one of those settlors is resident in New Zealand (section HC 25). Outbound migrating sole settlor A sole settlor of a trust has migrated from New Zealand and ceases to be a New Zealand resident at 1 April 2018. The trustee of this trust is a non-resident From 1 April 2018, the trust continues to derive foreign sourced income and interest income from New Zealand. Under the settlor regime, the foreign sourced income is no longer liable for New Zealand tax (section HC 25 applies), and the interest income is liable only for non-resident withholding tax as a final tax. Consequently, the trustee is no longer liable for tax on worldwide trustee income and the trust becomes a non-complying trust in relation to any distribution made from trustee income derived after the date the settlor ceases being a New Zealand resident. However: • • If the trustee had continued to pay tax on world-wide trustee income at the trustee rate (full New Zealand tax) and indicated in the trust’s annual return of income (by marking the relevant check box) that the trust is a complying trust, the trust’s complying trust status is maintained from the date of migration on a seamless basis. This is provided for in section HC 33(1B) HC 33(3)(c) and HC 10(1)(ab) of the ITA 07. • • Alternatively, an election can be made under section HC 33(3)b) to pay full New Zealand tax on trustee income derived on or after the date of migration. This election can be retrospective within the time limit set out in section HC 33(b)(ii) and (iii). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 48 NEW LEGISLATION For both elections referred to above, the complying trust status is also conditional on: • • the election having been made before a distribution (not being beneficiary income) from trustee income derived after the effective date of the election; and • • the tax obligations on the worldwide trustee income are satisfied for periods after the effective date of the election. In addition, for both cases if a section HC 33 election is not made with effect from the date of the migration, the trust will be a non-complying trust in relation to a distribution (other than beneficiary income) of trustee income derived after the date of migration. For multiple settlors, this above example applies only if no settlor remains resident in New Zealand. If a settlor remains resident in New Zealand, then worldwide trustee income remains liable for tax at the trustee rate. If the trustee is a non- resident, then this resident settlor must satisfy the tax obligations on worldwide trustee income (section HC 29 refers). If these obligations are not satisfied the trust becomes a non-complying trust in relation to a distribution from the periods for which the tax obligations on worldwide trustee income are not satisfied. TRANSFER OF VALUE FOR DEFERRAL OR NON-EXERCISE OF RIGHT TO DEMAND PAYMENT Section HC 31B and section YA 1 “financial assistance” of the Income Tax Act 2007 New section HC 31B addresses questions raised during an administrative review of the taxation of trusts relating to the valuation of financial assistance provided if there is: • • an obligation to repay interest or principal on demand; and • • the right to demand repayment is not exercised or is deferred. Background The administrative review of the taxation of trusts identified that it was very difficult to value a settlement or a distribution relating to financial assistance provided by one person to another subject to an on-demand condition for principal and interest. In particular, the concerns raised related to: • • section HC 27(2)(b) that makes a person a settlor if such financial assistance is provided to the trust; and • • section HC 14 which defines a distribution as a transfer of value, which would include the value of the interest forgone on such financial assistance. The administrative review also concluded that to reduce administration and compliance costs in valuing such financial assistance, the legislation should provide a method to calculate this value. Key features The amendment addresses this issue by inserting a formula in new section HC 31B that applies when: • • financial assistance is given on an on-demand basis for either principal or interest or both; and • • not demanding the interest or principal gives rise to a transfer of value that comes within the meaning of distribution in section HC 14 or would make a person a settlor of a trust by virtue of section HC27(2)(b). The formula calculates the value of the distribution or the settlement for any period as the amount of interest that would be foregone if the demand had instead been exercised. The value is calculated as the difference between: • • the interest that would be payable on the principal at market rate or the prescribed rate (at the choice of the taxpayer) for that period; and • • the amount of interest accrued for that period on the principal amount owing. This includes an amount that would have accrued for that period if that amount had been included in a taxable distribution. The proposed formula is like the calculation of the value of a fringe benefit for on-demand shareholder current accounts and ensures that administration and compliance costs can be minimised when valuing such financial assistance. The definition of financial assistance formerly located in section HC 36(5) is relocated to section YA 1 and applies for the purpose of the trust rules. This amendment clarifies the meaning of financial assistance, consistent with the Commissioner’s Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 49 NEW LEGISLATION view, as set out in IS 18/01: Taxation of Trusts. Application date New section HC 31B applies to determine the value of financial assistance that would give rise to a distribution or a settlement on a trust on or after 23 March 2020, including financial assistance that exists before 23 March 2020. MEANING OF SETTLOR AND SETTLEMENT Sections FC 2(4), HC 27 and HC 28 of the Income Tax Act 2007 The amendments to section HC 27 and HC 28 clarify certain circumstances in which a person may become a settlor of a trust. These issues were identified in the administrative review of the taxation of trusts as: • • a potential for overreach in relation to indirect settlements; • • when a controlled foreign company (CFC) settles an amount (or has settled) an amount on a trust; and • • the interaction of section HC 27(6) with section HC 27(2) and (4). The amendment to section FC 2(4) clarifies that the rules taxing holding gains for property before it is gifted do not apply to determine whether a transfer of value is made to a trust as a settlement on the trust. Background The administrative review of the taxation of trusts identified some uncertainty in applying the rules defining a person as a settlor in relation to: • • a potential for overreach in relation to indirect settlements (section HC 27(4)); • • when a person having a control interest of 10% or more in a controlled foreign company (CFC) will become a settlor of trust for which the CFC settles an amount (or has settled) an amount on a trust (section HC 38(3), (4)); • • the overriding effect of section HC 27(6) with section HC 27(2) and (4) to exclude a beneficiary from being a settlor for amounts owed to the beneficiary on an on-demand basis; and • • the application of the rules in subpart FC when a gift is made to a trust as a settlement. Key features Potential for overreach in relation to indirect settlements The amendment to section HC 27(4) clarifies that a person may make an indirect transfer of value to a trust through one or more transactions. As set out in IS 18/01at paragraphs 2.60 to s.65, this rule is likely to be applied where: • • a person (person A) controls or influences the actions of another person (person B) for that transaction; and • • a result of that transaction is that a transfer of value is indirectly made to a trust. Trust settled by a CFC The amendments to section HC 28(3) and (4) clarify the time at which a person having a control interest of 10% or more in the CFC will be a settlor of that trust. For the person to be a settlor of that trust, the investor must have a 10% or more control interest in the CFC at the time the CFC settles an amount on that trust. Relationship of sections HC 27(4) and (6) The amendment to section HC 27(6) to cross-refer to section HC 27(2), clarifies that the exclusion under section HC 27(6) also applies in determining whether an indirect settlement has occurred. Interface of the meaning of a settlement with the subpart FC rules An amendment is made to section FC 2(4) to ensures that the value of a settlement on a trust is unaffected by the rules in subpart FC. The rules in subpart FC treat a gift as a purchase and acquisition transaction to ensure that holding gains derived by the donor , including those made on revenue property, cannot be avoided by the making of a gift. If this treatment were applied within the trust rules there could be no transfer of value from the gift. The amendment ensures that whether a gift is a transfer of value for the trust rules is not affected by the valuation and transaction rules in subpart FC. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 50 NEW LEGISLATION Application dates The amendment to section FC 2 applies from 18 March 2019, consistent with an earlier amendment that ensures that distributions as a transfer of value are unaffected by the rules in subpart FC. The amendments to sections HC 27 and HC 28 apply from 23 March 2020. FOREIGN-SOURCE INCOME DERIVED BY A TRUSTEE Sections HC 25 and HC 26 of the Income Tax Act 2007 The administrative review of the taxation of trusts identified that it was unclear how the rules relating to the taxation of foreign- sourced income derived by a trustee should be treated in the event either: • • no natural person settlor of the trust remained alive or the settlor had ceased to exist (for example, a corporate settlor); or • • a section HC 33 election has been made. Key features Testamentary or inter-vivos trust with resident settlor and a non-resident trustee The amendment to section HC 25 applies to a trust that has a corporate settlor that continues to exist after the natural person settlor of that trust has died. If that corporate settlor ceases to exist, and no settlor remains, the residence of the settlor will be determined by the residence of that corporate settlor when it ceased to exist. Trust with non-resident settlor and resident trustee The amendments to section HC 26 clarify that: • • The exempt income treatment for foreign-sourced income derived by the resident trustee does not apply for a distribution of minor beneficiary income which is taxed at 33% to the trustee as trustee income; and • • The exempt income treatment for foreign-sourced income does not apply if the trust has made a section HC 33 election. This is consistent with the trustee’s obligation to calculate their income tax liability on the basis the settlor and trustee of the trust are both resident in New Zealand. Application date The amendments apply from 23 March 2020. DISTRIBUTIONS Sections HC 14, HC 15, HC 16 of the Income Tax Act 2007 The amendments address some minor issues identified during the administrative review of the taxation of trusts. The amendments are consistent with the Commissioner’s view set out in IS 18/01. Background The administrative review of the taxation of trusts identified some minor interpretive uncertainty issues relating to: • • the payment of interest on amounts owed by a trustee to a beneficiary; • • identifying the source of capital gains and capital losses; • • the ordering of distributions; and • • the anti-avoidance rule relating to the ordering rules for distributions. Key features Distributions and payments of interest The amendment to section HC 14 clarifies that an amount of interest paid to a beneficiary under the terms of a loan is not a distribution (that is, it is not included in beneficiary income). However, if the amount of interest exceeds the amount determined under the terms of the loan agreement, the excess amount of interest is treated as a distribution. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 51 NEW LEGISLATION Source of capital gains and capital losses The amendments in sections HC 15(5C) and (5D) clarify how the source rules apply to a capital gain or capital loss that is taken into account as part of a taxable distribution. The source of the capital gain or loss is determined using the source rules in section YD 4. Ordering of distributions The amendment to section HC 16(2) clarifies the relative order for a distribution that is beneficiary income. This addresses a tension identified in the administrative review of the taxation of trusts. The anti-avoidance rule and the ordering rules for distributions Section HC 16(5) of the ITA prevents trustees using the ordering rule to manipulate the nature of a distribution for New Zealand tax purposes to stream income and capital to different classes of beneficiary (for example, resident and non-resident beneficiaries). The rule ignores the tax effect of an earlier distribution in determining whether a subsequent distribution would be treated as either beneficiary income or a taxable distribution. The amendments confirm that this rule does not apply to a genuine transaction that results in a distribution of beneficiary income or a taxable distribution not being placed beyond the control of the trustee. This ensures that the rule does not apply to the commercial practice of trustees crediting a distribution to a beneficiary’s current account. Application dates The amendments to section HC 15 apply from 23 March 2020. The amendments to section HC 16 apply for income years beginning after 23 March 2020. DEFINITIONS Sections HC 36, YA 1, ,“disposition of property”, “financial assistance” “transfer of value”, “transfer of company value”, “trust rules” and YD 3BA of the Income Tax Act 2007 A few definitions are amended consequential to amendments to the substantive trust rules. Key features The definition of financial assistance is relocated to section YA from section HC 36 and applies for the purpose of the trust rules and not just for section HC 36. The definition of transfer of value is clarified by: • • removing the elements that relate to dividends from companies (this now termed transfer of company value”; • • ensuring that a transfer of value includes an amount whether or not convertible into money, which is consistent with the Commissioner’s view in IS 18/01; and • • correcting an unintended change arising in the rewrite of the trust rules to ensure that the definition of a disposition of property is within the meaning of transfer of value. This ensures that forgiveness of a loan is treated in the same manner as under the corresponding provisions in the Income Tax Act 2004. The definition of trust rules is amended to include rules that apply only for trusts, consistent with their treatment under the Income Tax Act 2004, and now includes the new definition of resident of a trustee that has co-trustees (section YD 3BA) Application dates The amendments to the definitions apply from 23 March 2020 with the exception of the amendment to the trust rules relating to section BD 1(4)(c), which applies from 1 April 2008. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 52 NEW LEGISLATION MĀORI AUTHORITY DISTRIBUTIONS Sections LO 2 and OK 19 of the Income Tax Act 2007 The amendments clarify: • • the calculation of the tax credit for a Māori authority distribution; and • • correct unintended changes to the Māori authority credit account rules arising in the rewrite of these provisions. Background The amendments to section LO 2 and OK 19 correct an unintended legislative change in the rewrite of each of the provision. Key features The amendment to section LO 2 corrects the meaning of the parameter “person’s distributions” for the formula in section LO 2(2). This amendment: • • ensures that the pro-rating of Māori authority tax credits is made by reference to all distributions made to beneficiaries; and • • validates tax positions taken based on the pre-rewrite legislation from all distributions made from 1 April 2008. The amendment to section OK 19 restores the law to give the same outcome as the corresponding provision in the Income Tax Act 2004. This amendment restores the correct policy outcome. The rule now ensures that a Māori Authority Tax Credit (MATC) may only be retrospectively attached to a distribution from a Māori authority if the Commissioner has made an assessment under the transfer pricing rules to change the effect of a past transaction. Application dates The amendments to sections LO 2 and OK 19 apply from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. For both amendments, a savings provision protects a taxpayer who has taken a tax position based on the unamended legislation. ELIMINATING THE REQUIREMENT TO ESTIMATE AT THE FINAL INSTALMENT DATE FOR PROVISIONAL TAX Sections 120KBB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 This amendment removes the requirement for taxpayers to switch to the estimate method at the final instalment of provisional tax when they believe their residual income tax for the year will be less than the standard instalments and retain the interest concession contained in section 120KBB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 as long as their residual income tax is $60,000 or more. Taxpayers will continue to be able to pay what they consider is the amount remaining at the final instalment date without changing from the standard “uplift” method. This will reduce compliance costs to the taxpayer. Taxpayers who do estimate at any time during the income year will be subject to the standard use of money interest (UOMI) rules in section 120KB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and will potentially be subject to UOMI from the date of their first provisional tax instalment. In practical terms, this does not affect any taxpayers as they will continue to do what they always have, however, the method in which they do that will alter. Furthermore, the compliance costs of having to make an estimate will be removed. Background The interest concession rules are contained in section 120KBB of the Tax Administration Act 1994. These rules essentially allow those taxpayers who use the standard method and make the required payments to have no exposure to UOMI until the day after the final provisional tax instalment is due for the year. This rule also applies to taxpayers who make the first two instalments using the standard method and make their final instalment under the estimation method. This rule was included in the final amending act due to a number of submissions made to the Finance and Expenditure Committee which stated that if a person anticipated that their residual income tax (RIT) for the year in question was less than their uplifted provisional tax amount there was no legal ability for them to make a payment less than the standard instalment amount. This was notwithstanding the UOMI calculation would have calculated UOMI correctly and no late payment penalty would have been charged. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 53 NEW LEGISLATION Example 20 Cookie Monsters Limited (Cookie) is a provisional taxpayer on a 31 March balance date who uses the standard uplift method. For the 2020–21 income year their standard instalments are based on 105% of their CY 7 -1 RIT which was $200,000. This gives them 3 instalments of $70,000. They pay both the first and second instalments on time on that basis but by the time the third instalment is due Cookie has calculated that due to the ongoing pressure from anti-obesity campaigns the market for their high sugar and fat content signature biscuit, “The Clogger”, has dramatically reduced. Cookie’s estimate of their 2020–21 RIT is $63,000 for the year. Cookie decides to estimate their final instalment of provisional tax and make no payment. Cookie will still be able to use the interest concession rules even though they estimated at their final instalment date. UOMI will apply from the date of the final instalment where its tax liability is more than payments made. This creates a compliance cost on taxpayers who then must switch provisional tax methods at their final instalment date and file an estimate. It also potentially exposes them to penalties for lack of reasonable care in making a reasonable estimate. Key features These changes allow provisional taxpayers who estimate RIT of greater than $60,000 to use the standard method to pay provisional tax to pay an amount lower than the standard method obligation on the final instalment date without having to switch to the estimation method. Application date The amendment applies from the 2019–20 income year. Detailed analysis The amendment allows taxpayers who make provisional tax payments under the standard method to vary their final instalment payment from the standard instalment to whatever they consider is owing at that date without having to switch provisional tax methods as long as their RIT is above $60,000. Taxpayers who have an RIT of less than $60,000 will be better off using the safe harbour provisions in section 120KE of the Tax Administration Act 1994. As UOMI will apply to any shortfall from the final instalment date taxpayers are always incentivised to pay their “actual” liability at that date. Given the final instalment is some time after their balance date, taxpayers should be able to reasonably accurately approximate the final amount payable. The ability to use the estimation method is removed from the interest concession rules in section 120KBB. If a taxpayer estimates at any point during the year, they will be under the estimation method for the entire year and potentially subject to UOMI from the date of the first instalment. Practically, this will make no difference to taxpayers as they will continue to do the same as they always have but the compliance cost of switching provisional tax methods will be removed. Example 21 Grover Grapes Limited (Grape) is a provisional taxpayer on a 30 June balance date who uses the standard uplift method. For the 2020–21 income year their standard instalments are based on 110% of their CY 8 -2 RIT which was $140,000. This gives them 3 instalments of $51,333. It pays both the first and second instalments on time on that basis. However, by the time the third instalment is due Grape has calculated that due to the grape season being adversely affected by the great grape infection of 2020 its income will be well down on the standard uplift amount. Grape believes they will only have RIT of $76,000 for the year. Grape realises this about 3 weeks before the payment of their third instalment and decides to immediately file an estimate of the lower amount with Inland Revenue. By filing an estimate before the third instalment date Grape as thrown itself out of the standard method and will not be able to use the interest concession rules in section 120KBB. It will be subject to use of money interest from the first instalment date under section KB. Grape may also be subject to shortfall penalties if it did not take reasonable care in making its estimate for the year. 7 CY = Current year. 8 CY = Current year. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 54 NEW LEGISLATION CLARIFYING THE “LESSER OF” CALCULATION OF INTEREST FOR STANDARD “UPLIFT” TAXPAYERS Section 120KBB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 The amendment clarifies the legislation to reflect the application of the “lesser of ” calculation for standard “uplift” taxpayers to ensure this aligns with the way in which UOMI is calculated in Inland Revenue’s technology platforms. 9 Background For taxpayers who qualify to be able to use the interest concession rules contained in section 120KBB of the Tax Administration Act 1994, UOMI is calculated on a different basis than for other taxpayers. Generally, a taxpayer will be exposed to UOMI on the difference between their actual liability for the year divided by the number of instalments and what they paid. For example, a taxpayer who has residual income tax 10 (RIT) of $90,000 and has paid nothing will be charged interest on $30,000 at each instalment date (that is, $90,000 ÷ 3). The interest concession rules operate differently and calculate UOMI (and late payment penalties) based on a “lesser of ” rule contained in section 120KBB(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This calculates UOMI on the difference between the lesser of the amount of the standard method instalment and the actual liability, divided by the number of instalments. For example, if a taxpayer has an actual RIT of $40,000 at each instalment and their standard uplift instalments were $30,000 at each instalment date. UOMI for interest concession taxpayers will be charged on the $30,000 amounts less the amount paid at each instalment date (except for the final instalment which will have UOMI charged on the outstanding balance of RIT less payments made to date). Key features The amendment aligns the application of the “lesser of ” calculation of UOMI for standard “uplift” taxpayers with the way that Inland Revenue’s technology platforms have been calculating UOMI for those taxpayers. The amendment provides that less UOMI is calculated than under the previous legislation. Application date The amendment applies from the 2018–19 income year as the amendment aligns the legislation with the treatment within Inland Revenue’s systems. Detailed analysis The standard “uplift” provisional tax method allows taxpayers to base their provisional tax instalments for the year on 105% of the prior year’s (CY 11 -1) RIT or 110% of the year previous to the prior year (CY-2) dependent on when they have filed their CY-1 tax return. Up until the taxpayer files their CY-1 return a taxpayer will use 110% of the CY-2 RIT (initial uplift). When they file their CY-1 return and 105% of that RIT (the final uplift) is more than the initial uplift the system leaves the previous instalments at the initial uplift. The reason for this is that at that time the taxpayer made that payment, the only information they had to base the payment on was the initial uplift. However, if the taxpayer files their CY-1 return and the final uplift is less than the initial uplift the system overwrites the initial uplift amount and replaces it with the lower final uplift amount. This is on the basis that once the taxpayer has filed their CY-1 return there is no ability to use the initial uplift and the final uplift effectively replaces that. Logically these two rules make sense. If the initial uplift is lower than the final uplift, it should be used as it would be unfair to require a taxpayer to make a payment based on figures they had not yet calculated. Alternatively, if the final uplift is lower than the initial uplift that should replace the initial uplift as, firstly, the taxpayer would have used that amount if they had known it at the time and, secondly, once that final uplift is known the initial uplift technically is no longer available. This rule will apply to instalments prior to the date the taxpayer files their CY-1 return (that is, the return with the final uplift). 9 I nland Revenue’s technology platforms are FIRST (Future Inland Revenue Systems and Technology), the heritage platform, and START (Simplified Tax and Revenue Technology), the new platform. 10 R esidual Income Tax is the amount of tax liability after tax credits such as PAYE and RWT have been deducted. 11 CY = Current year. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 55 NEW LEGISLATION Prior to the introduction of the interest concession rules this rule generally only mattered for the calculation of late payment penalties. Since the interest concession rule was introduced, this distinction is more important as it affects the calculation of UOMI. As the lower of the two amounts is taken into account this treatment is taxpayer friendly, however, the distinction does matter when taxpayers transfer funds from a tax pool as they want to ensure they are making the correct transfer to avoid the payment of UOMI. Inland Revenue’s legal team determined that the legislation was not clear on this rule. The amendment clarifies the legislation to ensure that the lowest amount of the initial or final uplift is used for the purposes of calculating UOMI and late payment penalties for instalments made prior to the date the taxpayer files the CY-1 tax return. This rule does not change the obligation to pay either the initial or final uplift amounts in that if the taxpayer’s final uplift is less than their initial uplift they were still required to pay the initial uplift amount notwithstanding UOMI may not be charged on that basis. This will be important in determining if a taxpayer is an interest concession taxpayer if they are subsequently subject to a reassessment. Both the FIRST and START systems apply this rule and thus the amendment does not affect taxpayers, but rather aligns the legislation with the system and policy intent. Example 22 Brock Burgers Corporation Limited (Brock) is a fast food chain that specialises in plant-based burgers. It has three subsidiary companies Brock Burgers (Auckland) Limited (BBA), Brock Burgers (Wellington) Limited (BBW) and Brock Burgers (Stewart Island) Limited (BBS). Because of the seasonal demand for plant-based burgers Hadleigh, the owner of Brock, decides that the standard uplift is a perfect method for the group as it removes the risk of exposure to UOMI until the Group has a good understanding of the tax liability for a particular year. Brock also uses a tax pool to pay its provisional tax for the year. It files its 2019–20 income tax returns between the first and second instalment dates. For the 2020–21 income years Brock’s standard uplift calculation for the companies in the group is as follows: Table 3110% uplift RIT amount A 105% uplift RIT amount B First instalment amount Second instalment amount 12 Brock$21,000,000$15,000,000$7,000,000$3,000,000 13 BBA$12,000,000$10,500,000$4,000,000$3,000,000 14 BBW$24,000,000$27,300,000$8,000,000$10,200,000 15 BBS$4,200,000$1,800,000$1,400,000($200,000) 16 Total$20,400,000$16,000,000 The group pays the first two instalments into the pool as calculated above (including obtaining a repayment for the $200,000 for BBS from the pool) but at the third instalment realises that the RIT for the entities is very different from the uplifted amounts. For example, BBA has had a standout year following a celebrity endorsement from a Hollywood star visiting Auckland for filming. BBS, however, has not fared as well as a competing company has captured the burger market in Stewart Island with their Venison Game Burgers. The expected RIT for each of the companies for the 2020–21 income year and what Brock intends to pay for the third instalment to minimise any UOMI is as follows: Table 42020–21 expected RIT C 2020–21 instalments to date Third instalment Brock$20,000,000$10,000,000$10,000,000 BBA$35,000,000$7,000,000$28,000,000 BBW$27,300,000$18,200,000$9,100,000 BBSNIL$1,200,000($1,240,000) Total$82,300,000$36,400,000$45,900,000 12 Once the taxpayer files their prior year tax return the 110% uplift calculation is no longer available to them. 13 C alculated as ($15,000,000 × 2/3) − $7,000,000 = $3,000,000. 14 C alculated as ($10,500,000 × 2/3) − $4,000,000 = $3,000,000. 15 C alculated as ($27,300,000 × 2/3) − $8,000,000 = $10,200,000. 16 C alculated as (1,800,000 × 2/3) − $1,400,000 = ($200,000) BBS gets this amount refunded from the tax pool. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 56 NEW LEGISLATION Once the Brock group has completed it’s 2020–21 tax returns it proved their forecasting team was worth their weight in gold as the actual RIT for the year ended up being identical to the expected RIT for the year with the exception of BBW which only had actual RIT of $27,000,000 due to the cancellation of a vegan lifestyle conference in Wellington which reduced sales. Brock then calculates the transfers required from the tax pool. Hadleigh is keen to ensure that each company pays what they need to at each instalment to ensure that no UOMI or late payment penalties are incurred. This will mean determining the lesser of the RIT or the instalment amount (being the lower of the 105% uplift or 110% uplift amounts) and the balance of tax owing on the third. Hadleigh determines the amounts to transfer from the pool at the first two instalments as follows (the lowest being the shaded amount): Table 5110% instalment amount A 105% instalment amount B RIT instalment amount (C/3) Lowest Brock$7,000,000$5,000,000$6,666,667105% BBA$4,000,000$3,500,000$15,000,000105% BBW$8,000,000$9,100,000$9,000,000105%/RIT 17 BBS$1,400,000$600,000NILRIT The transfers required are as follows: Table 6First instalmentSecond instalmentThird instalmentTotal Brock$5,000,000$5,000,000$10,000,000$20,000,000 BBA$3,500,000$3,500,000$28,000,000$35,000,000 BBW$8,000,000$9,000,000 18 $10,000,000$27,000,000 BBSNILNILNILNIL Total$16,500,000$17,600,000$47,900,000$82,000,000 Brock arranges the transfers on that basis and sells the remaining $300,000 overpayment to other taxpayers within the tax pool. All of the companies in the Brock Group can use the interest concession rules in section 120KBB as all the members of the Group are using the standard uplift method, none have filed a provisional tax estimate, and none of the anti-avoidance provisions apply. This is notwithstanding the Brock Group has only transferred the minimum amounts required to ensure that no UOMI is incurred. However, if any of the Brock companies later receives a reassessment, UOMI could apply to the increased amount. For example, say BBS receives a reassessment two years later and some expenses claimed by BBS were capital in nature and it’s RIT instalment amounts should have been $625,000 it is potentially subject to UOMI on $600,000 per instalment (being the 105% uplift instalment amount) as it did not make any payments for the year. If Hadleigh had made the uplift payments required, no UOMI would apply to the reassessment until the final instalment. Note for completeness that this later reassessment of BBS does not mean the interest concession rules are no longer applicable for the other group companies. 17 T he lesser of instalment amount and RIT for the first instalment will be the 105% uplift but for the second instalment because BBW had filed its 2019–20 tax return prior to the second instalment the lesser amount for that instalment will be the RIT. 18 B ecause BBW had filed its 2019–20 tax return prior to the second instalment the 110% uplift amount is no longer available. If BBW had not filed until after the second instalment it would have still had the lesser of the two amounts available. However, its RIT is less than the 105% uplift amount which is the lowest amount. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 57 NEW LEGISLATION CLARIFYING THE APPLICATION OF LATE PAYMENT PENALTIES APPLICABLE FROM THE FINAL PROVISIONAL TAX INSTALMENT DATE Section 120KBB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 An inadvertent legislative change meant that late payment penalties were applied to a taxpayer’s total provisional tax liability for the year rather than an instalment amount on the final instalment date. This amendment aligns the legislation with administrative practice and with policy intention. As such, it will have no effect on taxpayers. Key features This change aligns the legislation with Inland Revenue’s systems to ensure that late payment penalties are only calculated on an instalment amount at the date of the final instalment of provisional tax for the year rather than on the total outstanding tax liability at that date. UOMI will continue to accrue on the total tax liability outstanding. This change aligns the legislation with the policy intent and the system configuration of Inland Revenue’s technology platforms. Application date The amendment applies from the 2017–18 income year to provide certainty to taxpayers. Detailed analysis The interest concession rules are contained in section 120KBB of the Tax Administration Act 1994, these rules essentially allow those taxpayers who use the standard method and make the required payments to have no exposure to UOMI until the day after the final provisional tax instalment is due for the year. When the interest concession rules were introduced it was seen as desirable to align the basis for the calculation of UOMI and late payment penalties. This was done in the legislation and for the instalments, other than the final one. This is working as intended as both UOMI and late payment penalties are calculated using the lower of the standard instalment (105% of CY-1 or 110% of CY-2) or one third of their current year RIT. However, on the final instalment the legislation required the same formula to be used to calculate UOMI and the late payment penalty amount. 19 For the calculation of UOMI all of the taxpayer’s remaining tax liability is deemed to be due at the date of the third instalment as UOMI applies to that amount from the day after that date. However, for late payment penalties this basis is inappropriate as charging a taxpayer for their entire RIT at that final instalment date is particularly unfair where they do not necessarily know the exact amount due. The basis for the penalty should be the lower of the instalment amount or one third of the taxpayer’s RIT. Previously, legislation did not support this. Late payment penalties should only apply to an instalment amount rather than the total tax liability at that point although UOMI should apply on the full shortfall. Inland Revenue’s systems were not configured to reflect the legislation but to reflect the policy intent to charge a penalty based on the lower of the instalment amount or one third of the taxpayers RIT – the same basis as the other instalments. The amendment aligns the legislation with the system in this case and changes the legal basis for the calculation of the penalty on the final instalment to be the lower of the standard instalment due or one third of the taxpayer’s RIT. In addition, the definition of RIT for the purposes of calculating UOMI is clarified to ensure it more clearly refers to the taxpayer’s current year RIT 19 Note that for the final instalment taxpayers cannot use 110% of the year previous to the prior year as they must have filed their prior year return before the date of this payment. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 58 NEW LEGISLATION Example 23 Fowls by Fowler Limited (FbF) runs a free-range chicken egg producing farm where consumers can follow the hens on live social media to ensure the eggs they purchase are produced by chickens living the high life in large fields and luxury egg laying suites. Josh the owner, and chicken fanatic, manages the provisional tax payments for the company. Because of the fluctuation in demand for eggs Josh uses the standard uplift method to pay provisional tax as, in the past, he has incurred UOMI costs for unexpected income received during the year. He calculates the standard uplift amount for the 2020–21 income year as being $210,000 and makes three payments of $70,000 to Inland Revenue on the required due dates. The 2020–21 year has been particularly good for FbF due to the introduction of their online serial featuring “Henny” one of the chickens on the farm who has taken a shine to the toys placed around the farm to keep the chickens busy. Sales of special “Henny Eggs” have skyrocketed. It turns out that the provisional tax payments made by FbF were insufficient and FbF should have made three instalments of $100,000. The following table sets out on what amount UOMI and LPPs would apply to FbF before and after the amendment. InstalmentUOMI beforeUOMI afterLPPs before 20 LPPs after 21 FirstNil – as FbF paid the required instalment in full and on time Same as UOMI before Nil – as FbF paid the required instalment in full and on time Nil – as FbF paid the required instalment in full and on time SecondNil – as FbF paid the required instalment in full and on time Same as UOMI before Nil – as FbF paid the required instalment in full and on time Nil – as FbF paid the required instalment in full and on time Third/FinalSubject to UOMI on $90,000 being the actual liability ($300,000) less payments made ($210,000) Same as UOMI before Subject to LPP on $90,000 being the actual liability ($300,000) less payments made ($210,000) Nil – as FbF paid the required instalment in full and on time REMOVING THE ABILITY FOR TAXPAYERS TO CHOOSE THE PROVISIONAL TAX INSTALMENT TO WHICH A PARTICULAR PAYMENT IS APPLIED Sections 120L of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Background The Tax Administration Act 1994 previously contained a provision that permitted a taxpayer to direct the application of a provisional tax payment made to a particular instalment. Prior to the introduction of the interest concession rules in section 120KBB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the removal of incremental penalties from income tax it was always beneficial for taxpayers to apply payments to the oldest debt first. Since the introduction of the interest concession rules and removal of incremental penalties this is no longer true. A taxpayer could inappropriately apply the payment to more recent debt in order to avoid late payment penalties. Removing the ability of taxpayers to choose the particular instalment to allocate a provisional tax payment eliminates this issue. This section also clarifies that the Commissioner is required to allocate the particular payment to the oldest debt first. Inland Revenue’s systems do not allow the allocation of a payment to particular payment dates when there is debt on a prior provisional tax date. This amendment does not impact most taxpayers but will prohibit non-compliant taxpayers from reducing their exposure to late payment penalties. Key features The ability for taxpayers to allocate their provisional tax payment to particular instalments has been removed and the Commissioner is required to allocate payments to the oldest outstanding provisional tax instalment. 20 Practically no one has been charged an LPP based on this calculation as Inland Revenue systems have been correctly calculating LPPs based on the policy intent. 21 Note Inland Revenue’s computer systems have always been calculating in this manner it is only the legislation that has been amended. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 59 NEW LEGISLATION Application date The amendment applies from the 2018–19 income year for integrity reasons. In the unlikely event of a taxpayer having previously requested and obtained a payment direction a savings provision preserves this treatment. 22 Detailed analysis The payment allocation rules for provisional tax payments are contained in section 120L of the Tax Administration Act 1994. These provide that if a taxpayer makes a provisional tax payment and does not specify which instalment it should be directed to, the Commissioner must apply the payment where she thinks the taxpayer would have applied it. 23 Or, if the taxpayer does specify which instalment, the Commissioner must apply the payment to that particular instalment. 24 Prior to the inclusion of the interest concession rules and removal of incremental late payment penalties 25 from income tax it was always beneficial to apply payments to the oldest debt first as this would reduce the taxpayer’s liability to both incremental penalties and UOMI. Since the interest concession rules were introduced it can be more advantageous for taxpayers to allocate their payments to specific provisional tax instalments to reduce their liability to late payment penalties on later instalments. Example 24 Grouchy Limited (Grouchy) is owned by Oscar and is a provisional taxpayer for the 2020–21 year. Its instalments are $25,000 at each provisional tax instalment. Oscar is a bit cash strapped and fails to pay the first instalment of provisional tax for Grouchy. Grouchy is charged a late payment penalty on the $25,000 debt of $1,250 as well as UOMI for that debt. At the second instalment date Grouchy has a spare $25,000 and decides to make a payment as provisional tax. Prior to the removal of incremental penalties and the interest concession rules it would be more beneficial for Oscar to allocate that payment of $25,000 to the first instalment of provisional tax to reduce both incremental penalties and UOMI on that outstanding debt. Subsequent to the changes Oscar now considers it more advantageous to allocate that payment to the second instalment. This will avoid any late payment penalties or UOMI arising on that payment. Given that there are no further late payment penalties on the debt from the first instalment and only UOMI is accruing on that, he will be $1,250 better off by allocating the payment to the second instalment. This example is not appropriate. It gives a benefit to taxpayers who have outstanding debt. In addition, both the FIRST system and the configuration of the START system cannot allocate payments in this manner. The amendment removes the ability for taxpayers to request which provisional instalment their payment is allocated to. This removes the ability for non-compliant taxpayers to reduce their exposure to late payment penalties and UOMI. A provision has also been added to the legislation to require the Commissioner to apply payments to the oldest unpaid instalment first. 22 T his is an unlikely event as the FIRST system does not support this type of payment allocation. 23 S ection 120L(2)(b). 24 S ection 120L(2)(a). 25 I ncremental late payment penalties applied at 1% for each month the debt was outstanding. These were removed from income tax from 1 April 2018. Thus, the only late payment penalties that apply to income tax are the initial penalty of 1% the day after the due date and 4% seven days after the due date. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 60 NEW LEGISLATION CLARIFYING THE WAY IN WHICH PROVISIONAL TAX IS TRUNCATED TO WHOLE DOLLARS Section 120KF of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Background It is Inland Revenue’s operational practice to truncate provisional tax amounts to whole numbers and its technology platforms have been designed in keeping with that practice. However, Inland Revenue’s legal team concluded that the way in which its technology platforms truncates instalments to whole numbers was not consistent with the legislation. Inland Revenue’s systems have been configured to apply these rules on truncated whole dollars and will not prevent taxpayers receiving a concession when partial dollars are truncated. The amendment confirms that configuration. In practical terms, this amendment will not affect any taxpayers. Key features The amendment confirms that where Inland Revenue's systems truncate provisional tax amounts to whole numbers, payment of those whole dollar amounts rather than the amount including cents will be considered to meet the requirements to take advantage of concessionary regimes such as the safe harbour in section 120KE. Application date The amendment applies from the 2017–18 income year. Detailed analysis Truncating to whole dollars for any instalment is beneficial to taxpayers both through simplicity and marginally financially. However, it can have negative consequences when assessing whether taxpayers meet certain requirements, such as the safe harbour 26 from UOMI. If cents are included and taxpayers pay the truncated whole dollar amount which the system has told them to pay, technically, they do not meet the requirements of the safe harbour. Inland Revenue's legal team reviewed the legislation that deals with the calculation of provisional tax instalments and the application of UOMI to any shortfalls. One of their conclusions was that the legislation and the system did not align for the way in which amounts are truncated. When provisional tax instalments are calculated under the standard method the legislation requires the uplifted amount to be divided into three equal instalments. For simplicity to taxpayers the system ignores, or truncates, any cents in that calculation. Example 25 Assume that Grover Limited (Grover) is a provisional taxpayer who uses the standard uplift method. Their RIT for the 2020– 21 income year was $124,567. This will make their standard method uplift amount for the following year $130,795.35. Grover’s three instalments will be calculated as follows: InstalmentCalculationAmount of instalmentTruncated amount 1$130,795.35 ÷ 3$43,598.45$43,598 2($130,795.35 × (2 ÷ 3)) − $43,598.45$43,598.45$43,598 3($130,795.35 − $43,598.45 - $43,598.45)$43,598.45$43,599 Total$130,795.35$130,795 However, to determine whether a taxpayer has met the criteria for the interest concession rules, for example, technically the taxpayer should have paid the instalment outlined in the amount of instalment column in the table, which is $43,598.45. The system does not use this amount and assesses the ability to use concessions based on the truncated whole number. This is a taxpayer friendly treatment and is much simpler. The amendment aligns the legislation with the system to ensure that taxpayers are not prohibited from using a concession because they have not paid the cents for an instalment. 26 T he safe harbour includes taxpayers with RIT of less than $60,000 who have made the required standard instalments. In this case UOMI will not start until the terminal tax date (usually 7 February the following year). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 61 NEW LEGISLATION Within Inland Revenue’s new technology platform, truncating now takes place at two points in calculating a taxpayer’s provisional tax instalments. In the majority of cases this process will give the same result as noted above. Diagrammatically the new truncation process can be illustrated as follows: Example 26 Recalculating the example above, Grover’s RIT for the 2020–21 income year was $124,567. This will make their standard method uplift amount for the following year $130,795.35. Grover’s three instalments will be calculated as follows (highlighted in grey): 105% uplift $130,795.35 Tr u n c a t e$130,795.00 Divided by three instalments$43,598.33 Tr u n c a t e$43,598.00 First Instalment$43,598.00 Second Instalment ($130,795.00 × (2/3) − ($43,598.00))$43,598.66 Tr u n c a t e$43,598.00 Third/Final Instalment ($130,795.00 − ($43,598.00 × 2))$43,599.00 NON-STANDARD PROVISIONAL TAX INSTALMENTS Section 139B(6)(bb) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Background An amendment was made to section 139B(6)(bb) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 when the interest concession rules in section 120KBB were inserted into the Tax Administration Act 1994 to ensure the definitions worked with the new rules. A taxpayer that has more or less than three instalments of provisional tax, was not correctly dealt with and this is corrected for clarity. Key features This amendment alters section 139B(6)(bb) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to account for taxpayers who have a non- standard number of instalments of provisional tax. Application date The amendment applies from the 2019–20 income year. Detailed analysis When the interest concession rules were introduced in the Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017 a late change was made to the legislation to deal with taxpayers who had more or less than three instalments of provisional tax. A number of references were correctly altered in the final Act to account for this change, however, one was missed. A definition in section 139B(6) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 was not updated for the inclusion of these taxpayers and still referred to three instalments of provisional tax. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 62 NEW LEGISLATION This has not adversely affected any taxpayers as Inland Revenue has applied that section as it was intended. However, the amendment updates the definition to account for taxpayers who have more or less than three provisional tax instalments from the 2019–20 income year. AMEND THE DATE A GOODS AND SERVICES TAX CREDIT BECOMES AVAILABLE FOR A TAXPAYER TO USE Section 173L of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Background This amendment moves the day a GST credit is available from the day after the return was filed, to the day the credit arises. As this amendment is minor and is taxpayer favourable this change has already been operationalised within Inland Revenues system and thus does not practically affect any taxpayers. Key features This amendment alters the date that a GST credit becomes available to a taxpayer when they file their GST return other than on the due date for the return. It moves the date the credit is available to be used from the day after the return is filed to the day the return is filed. Application date The amendment applies from the date the original change was made, for taxable periods on or after 1 April 2018, as practically this will have no impact on any taxpayer and it will protect those taxpayers who have already received credits at the earlier date. Detailed analysis The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Act 2018 made a change to the day on which a GST refund was available to a taxpayer. This more closely aligned the availability of a GST refund to when the taxpayer filed the return in which the credit arose. Credits were available on: • • the earlier of either the day after the taxpayer filed their return or the day after the GST period which the credit relates to if the taxpayer filed early, or • • the day after the end of the GST period to which the refund relates if they filed on the due date, or • • the day after they filed their return if they filed their return late. Having the credit available the day after it arises (that is, the day the return is processed, and the refund established) is problematic for administrative purposes. It is generally good practice to have the credit available on the same date that it arises within the system. As a consequence, the date in the legislation has been changed to the date the GST refund arises. As this change is taxpayer friendly and the issues that arose from treating the credit available the day after it was assessed were problematic this change has already been operationalised within Inland Revenues START environment. The legislative change has no practical effect on taxpayers. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 63 NEW LEGISLATION CLARIFICATION FOR TAXPAYERS WHO PAY PROVISIONAL TAX IN ONE OR TWO INSTALMENTS Sections RC 13(3) and RC 14 (2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 Background Section RC 9(4)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007 applies where a person is liable to pay provisional tax but has not provided a return in the preceding year and whose residual income tax (RIT) in the year before the preceding year is less than $2,500. Section RC 9(10) then states that sections RC 13(1)(b) or RC 14(1)(b) will apply so that provisional tax is payable in either two or one instalment(s), depending on when the prior year’s return is filed. There was an interpretation issue with sections RC 13(3) and RC 14(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 which reference section RC 9(9)(b) and (c). There was a missing link for these scenarios in sections RC 13(3) and RC 14(3) respectively. These sections referred only to “initial provisional taxpayers”, so taxpayers were not provided legislative guidance as to how many instalments to pay or how to apply sections RC 13 or RC 14 in other cases. Key features These changes remove the restriction to RC 9(9)(b) for sections RC 13(3) and RC 14(3) to more clearly provide legislative guidance for those taxpayers to whom section RC 9(4)(c) applies and how many provisional tax instalments they are required to make for a year. Application date The amendment applies from the 2020–21 income year. Detailed analysis The amendment removes reference to section RC 9(9)(b) from sections RC 13 and RC 14 which will now not restrict these to “initial provisional taxpayers”. Taxpayers’ and Inland Revenue’s administrative practice is to ignore the fact that section RC 9(9) only technically applies to initial provisional taxpayers and thus it is not expected this amendment will practically affect many taxpayers Although taxpayers to whom section RC 9(9)(b) does apply are only required to make one or two provisional tax instalments use-of-money interest will apply across three instalments rather than the number of instalments. However, the distinction is important when considering the application of late payment penalties and whether taxpayers have met conditions for interest concession rules, such as the safe harbour. CALCULATING STANDARD PROVISIONAL TAX INSTALMENTS FOR AMALGAMATED AND CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES Section RC 29 and RC 33 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Background Sections RC 29 and RC 33 of the Income Tax Act 2007 outline how a new consolidated group or amalgamated company should calculate their standard method uplift amount of provisional tax. These sections previously only referred to the year preceding the current tax year. This wording did not correctly deal with the situation where those amalgamating or consolidating companies have not filed their prior year tax returns. Key features The changes clarify that, when calculating provisional tax instalments for an amalgamated company or a consolidated group, the taxpayer can use the prior year or the year proceeding the prior year (as applicable) to calculate their standard uplift instalments. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 64 NEW LEGISLATION Application date The amendments apply for the 2020–21 and later income years. Detailed analysis The standard method uses either 105% of the preceding year current year-1 (CY-1) or 110% of the year prior to the preceding year (CY-2). Previously, both sections RC 29 and 33 only referred to the CY-1 calculation. The sections have been amended to refer to the CY-2 year where the entities forming the group or amalgamated company have yet to file their CY-1 tax return and can therefore only base their provisional tax on the CY-2 residual income tax. We understand taxpayers have practically been applying this rule so it should not have any practical effect on taxpayers. ENSURING THE PROVISIONAL TAX RULES APPLY APPROPRIATELY TO PARTNERS AND MEMBERS OF UNINCORPORATED BODIES Section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Background In determining whether a person has an initial provisional tax liability the definition of “taxable activity” is used to determine if someone has started a business. This definition refers to the definition in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 but currently excludes taxpayers who earn exempt supplies (that is, the initial provisional taxpayer rules apply to taxpayers who make exempt supplies). However, the definition excluded partners of partnerships and members of other unincorporated bodies as, for GST purposes, it is the partnership/unincorporated body which is carrying on the taxable activity. This appeared to be an omission which was not consistent with the framework of the provisional tax regime as these entities are look-through entities they are not themselves subject to provisional tax. Key features The definition of “taxable activity” in the Income Tax Act 2007 relating to provisional tax has been amended to include partners and members of unincorporated bodies within the definition of initial provisional taxpayer. Application date The amendment applies for the 2020–21 and later income years. Detailed analysis The amendment modifies the definition of “taxable activity” within section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to ensure that partners and members of unincorporated bodies are not excluded from the definition of an initial provisional taxpayer. ENSURING THE EARLY PAYMENT DISCOUNT APPLIES AS INTENDED Section RC 37 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Background “Small business persons” are entitled to an early-payment discount of income tax. The purpose of that discount is to encourage the payment of income tax in the income year before the income year in which the small-business person is required to pay provisional tax. Inland Revenue’s legal team identified an issue with the legislation and the application of the early payment discount to taxpayers who meet the criteria. Inland Revenue’s systems have been applying the law as it should apply, however, to improve certainty for taxpayers the legislation has been aligned with this practice. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 65 NEW LEGISLATION Key features Section RC 37 of the Income Tax Act 2007 has been amended to ensure that the early payment discount applies as intended by changing the wording “not liable to pay provisional tax” to “liable to pay provisional tax under section RC 3(1)(a) but not obligated to make any payments under section RC 3(3)”. Application date The amendment applies for the 2020–21 and later income years. CLARIFY THE DEFINITION OF PROVISIONAL TAX Section 120L of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Background Formerly, the wording of section 120L of the Tax Administration Act 1994 referred only to “provisional tax” which is not defined. This section has been amended to include both provisional tax and any late payment penalties on that provisional tax. Key features Section 120L of the Income Tax Act 2007 is amended to ensure that the term “provisional tax” includes any late payment penalties. Application date The amendment applies for the 2020–21 and later income years. ALIGN THE TREATMENT OF OVERPAID TAX BY A COMPANY USING THE ACCOUNTING INCOME METHOD (AIM) WITH TAX PAID ON BEHALF OF AIM SHAREHOLDERS Section RC 35B of the Income Tax Act 2007 Background There are two ways in which an AIM company can transfer overpaid tax to its shareholders. The first is where the company creates a provision for shareholder employees’ salary and pays tax on that on behalf of the shareholders to enable the company to take a tax deduction for the provision. In this situation the company acts as an “agent” for the shareholder employee and the tax is “transferred” as a tax credit reducing the shareholder employee’s residual tax liability. The second situation is where the company overpays tax most likely because shareholder remuneration is not deducted by the company until the end of the year in which case the overpayment transfers at the shareholder’s provisional tax dates. Key features This amendment standardised the treatment of overpayments by an AIM company so that in both situations the transfer will reduce the residual income tax of the shareholder employee (subject to the safeguards that already exist to reduce the ability to game the rules). Application date The amendment applies from the 2019–20 income year. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 66 NEW LEGISLATION INCLUSION OF A TOLERANCE FOR PROVISIONAL TAX INSTALMENTS Section 120KF of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Background The Tax Administration Act 1994 contains a safe harbour provision from the application of use-of-money interest (UOMI) to some provisional taxpayers. The safe harbour applies where a taxpayer has residual income tax that is less than $60,000, they have used the standard uplift provisional tax calculation method, and they paid all their instalments as required. The result of this concession is that no UOMI is charged on any unpaid tax until the taxpayer’s terminal tax date (which is generally February of the year after the income year where the liability arises). If the safe harbour does not apply, then UOMI would generally apply from the date of their final instalment of provisional tax for the income year in question. This is generally nine months earlier than the terminal tax date. Thus, the safe harbour provides a significant concession to those who fit the criteria. Some issues have arisen, the result of which is that a small underpayment is providing an adverse result to taxpayers that is disproportionate to the error being made. In one case a taxpayer who accidently underpaid their instalments by 30 cents resulted in a UOMI bill of $2,400 because of the loss of the protection of the safe harbour. Key features This amendment adds a tolerance in the legislation to deal with these issues. This tolerance allows taxpayers to retain the benefits of the safe harbour even though they underpaid by a small amount. The amount of the tolerance is $20 per instalment which aligns to the amount of the small balance write-off amount (for tax other than auto-calculation assessments). This will ensure that a person who underpays by small amounts will not be disproportionately penalised for that omission. Application date The amendment applies for the 2017–18 and later income years and retrospectively addresses the existing cases where taxpayers have been disadvantaged. Detailed analysis This amendment adds a tolerance to provisional tax payments which are slightly short paid. For payments made that are within $20 or less of the instalment amount the taxpayer will be deemed to have paid the instalment amount for the purposes of determining if the taxpayer has met the requirement of paying their instalments in full and on time to use the safe harbour concession. This change only allows a tolerance for the amount paid and not the date of the payment. Taxpayers who pay late will continue to fall out of the safe harbour. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 67 NEW LEGISLATION Example 27 Phyllis’ Bakers Limited (PBL) is a small bakery business based in Papakura. Phyllis is the owner of PBL and while she is a fantastic baker her accounting and tax skills are less so. She has We Get It Right Accountants Limited (WGRA) to do the accounting and tax work for her successful business. PBL is a provisional taxpayer with a 31 March balance date and for the 2019–20 income year is required to pay three instalments of $10,000 to Inland Revenue. Phyllis asks WGRA to make the required payments as and when they come due. WGRA makes the first instalment on 28 August 2019 for $10,000. But then for the second instalment on the 15th of January 2020 PBL is also required to pay a supplier an amount of $9,999.70. Due to a clerical mix up at WGRA the numbers for provisional tax and the payment to the supplier were transposed incorrectly. PGL only pays $9,999.70. On the third instalment date WGRA does pay the correct instalment of $10,000. When they get to the end of the year the residual income tax for PBL is $57,000. WGRA tells Phyllis that she will have to pay $27,000.30 27 on the 7th of Feb and no UOMI will be charged because she is in the safe harbour as her residual income tax for the year is less than $60,000. Unfortunately, one of the requirements to use the safe harbour concession is that payments are made full and on time. Because PBL paid their second instalment 30 cent less than the required instalment they will be charged UOMI from the third provisional tax instalment date. This equates to $1,678.25. However, because the payment made was made within $20 or less of the actual instalment amount the tolerance will ensure that PBL is deemed to have made the instalment in full and therefore they will meet the safe harbour requirements, no UOMI will be charged and WGRA does not have to have a courageous conversation with Phyllis explaining why she ended up with a large interest bill. AMEND THE DEFINITION OF “START TAX TYPE” IN THE TAX ADMINISTRATION ACT 1994 TO INCLUDE RELEASE 4 TAX TYPES Section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Background Release 4 of Business Transformation will migrate more tax types onto Inland Revenue’s new technology platform, START. Section 183C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 deals with rules around the cancellation of interest. These rules are specific to the START platform only and as taxes migrate to that platform the rules for cancellation of interest change over what was done in the old technology platform, FIRST. It was necessary to include those tax types that are being migrated to START as part of Release 4 in the definition of “START tax type” so that the cancellation of interest rules are applied correctly. Key features These tax types are now included in the definition of START tax types in the Tax Administration Act 1994: • • PAYE deductions; • • child support deductions made by an employer; • • student loan deductions made by an employer; • • KiwiSaver deductions made by an employer; • • compulsory employer KiwiSaver contributions; and • • specified superannuation contribution tax (SSCWT or ESCT or both). Application date The amendment applies from 1 April 2020. 27 R IT – payments to date = $57,000 − ($10,000 + $9,999.70 + $10,000). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 68 NEW LEGISLATION ADDING START TAX TYPES TO SECTION 184A(5) OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATION ACT 1994 Section 184A(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Background As part of Release 4 of Business Transformation, new tax types are being introduced into START. With the inclusion of the new tax types Inland Revenue is able to direct credit refunds through section 184A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. However, some of the tax types included in Release 4 did not fall within the definition of tax in section 184A(5). Key features The following tax types are now included in the definition of tax in section 184A(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994: • • reserve schemes (income equalisation schemes and environmental restoration account schemes); and • • unclaimed monies for the purpose of the Unclaimed Money Act 1971. Application date The amendment applies from the date of enactment. SELF-CORRECTING CERTAIN ERRORS IN SUBSEQUENT RETURNS Section 113A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Several amendments have been made to resolve ambiguities that were identified following changes made in 2019 to the rules that allow taxpayers to self-correct certain errors in returns for income tax, GST and FBT. Background The Tax Administration Act 1994 contains rules which recognise the compliance and administration costs associated with making amendments to returns and assessments which contain errors. These rules allow errors which do not breach certain prescribed thresholds to be corrected in the next return due, following discovery of the error. These rules are contained in section 113A and apply in respect of errors that relate to returns for income tax, FBT, and GST. These rules were amended in 2019 as part of a suite of changes made to modernise core components of the Act by the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019. Following enactment of the changes, several ambiguities within the application of the new thresholds were identified. The amendments made by the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act 2020 are intended to resolve these ambiguities to make the application of the thresholds clearer. Key features The key features of the amendments: • • confirm that the $10,000 limit in the materiality threshold test refers to the tax discrepancy caused by all of the errors in a return and not the amount of the individual errors themselves; • • ensure that there is no confusion between the application of the thresholds in section 113A of the Act and other provisions within the Inland Revenue Acts and associated regulations which allow for the self-correction of errors in relation to other tax types; and • • clarify that multiple errors that do not exceed the materiality threshold can be corrected, provided the total discrepancy caused by the errors do not exceed the threshold. Application date These amendments apply from 23 March 2020, the date of enactment. Detailed analysis Section 113A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows taxpayers to correct certain errors contained in returns for income tax, FBT, and GST, provided the total tax discrepancy of the errors do not breach prescribed thresholds. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 69 NEW LEGISLATION Subsection (2) provides that the rules contained in section 113A which enable taxpayers to self-correct errors within the prescribed thresholds do not apply to ancillary taxes (as defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007) other than fringe benefit tax. The amendment is intended to resolve a possible conflict between the rules in section 113A and rules which provide for the self-correction of errors for other ancillary taxes. 28 The prescribed thresholds in section 113A are contained in subsections (3) and (4). The $1,000 threshold is provided for in subsection (3). This allows errors which, for a single return, result in a total tax discrepancy of $1,000 or less, to be corrected in the next return due following discovery of the errors. Subsections (3B) and (4) contain the rules for the correcting errors which are, in relation to the taxpayer, not considered to be material errors. Errors which are not material can be corrected in the next return due following discovery of the errors. Subsection (4) provides the requirements for determining whether errors are material. Errors are not material for these purposes where the total tax discrepancy of all of the errors in a single return do not exceed both $10,000 and two percent of the person’s: • • annual gross income, 29 for errors relating to income tax and FBT; and • • output tax, for errors relating to GST. The following examples demonstrate how the rules are intended to apply. Example 28: Application of the $1,000 threshold for an income tax return Michael’s Fun Sails Ltd (MFS) is a company specialising in the development of cutting-edge and quirky boating apparatus. The in-house accountant determines that depreciation has been overclaimed on an industrial sewing machine. This error was included in the income tax return for the 2019–20 income year. The overclaimed depreciation amounted to $2,500. MFS is a close company which means the overclaimed depreciation represents a total tax discrepancy in the 2019–20 income tax return of $700 (that is, $2,500 x 28 percent). As the total tax discrepancy caused by the error is not more than $1,000, the error can be corrected in the next income tax return which is due following discovery of the error. Example 29: Application of the $1,000 threshold for a GST return Josh’s Flowers Ltd is a close company which is operated by Josh, the company’s sole shareholder and employee. The company is registered for GST and files its returns on a six-monthly basis. When reviewing the company’s accounts for the last six-monthly period, Josh identifies one month’s worth of taxable supplies had not been recorded in the GST return due to a glitch with his accounting package. The amount of missing supplies was $1,800. The total tax discrepancy in the return owing to the omitted taxable supplies is $270 (that is, $1,800 x 15 percent). As the total tax discrepancy caused by the error is not more than $1,000, the error can be corrected in the next GST return which is due following discovery of the error. Example 30: Application of the $1,000 threshold for an FBT return Claire’s Clown Cars Ltd (CCC) is in the business of leasing cars to circuses across New Zealand. CCC has a mixture of special vehicles which are used in circus performances as well as a fleet of ordinary vehicles. CCC allows its employees to use vehicles for private purposes and is accordingly registered for FBT. CCC’s accountant Patt Milkinton identifies an error in an FBT return which was filed two quarters ago. The error resulted in FBT not being paid on the value of fringe benefits provided to one of CCC’s employees, who had one of CCC’s ordinary vehicles for 15 days during the relevant quarter. The vehicle had a tax book value (including GST) of $15,000. The accountant notes that the amount of FBT that was not paid to Inland Revenue as a result of the error, and thus the total tax discrepancy caused by the error was $140.16. As the total tax discrepancy caused by the error is not more than $1,000, the error can be corrected in the next FBT return due following discovery of the error. 28 F or example, for errors relating to employment-related taxes such as PAYE, see the Tax Administration (Correction of Errors in Employment Income Information) Regulations 2019 and for errors relating to RWT and NRWT, see sections RA 11 and RA 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 29 “ annual gross income” is defined in section BC 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and applies for these purposes. This refers to a person’s total assessable income which is allocated to their corresponding income year. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 70 NEW LEGISLATION Example 31: Application of the $1,000 threshold with multiple errors in the same return When conducting a routine review of the GST returns for Bary’s Brownies and Liqourice Rolls Ltd the company’s bookkeeper Phil identifies that both the output tax and input tax deductions recorded in the company’s GST return for the taxable period ending 31 March 2020 were both understated. Phil determines that the output tax was understated by $2,000 and the input tax deductions were understated by $1,500. The total tax discrepancy caused by these two errors is $500 (that is, $2,000 of output tax minus the $1,500 of input tax deductions). As the total tax discrepancy caused by the errors is not more than $1,000, both errors can be corrected in the next GST return due following discovery of the errors. Example 32: Application of the materiality threshold for an income tax return The accountant at JASE Co Ltd, a close company, identifies an error with the depreciation calculations which resulted in an understatement of the company’s profit for the income year ending 31 March 2020. The error resulted in depreciation being overclaimed of $20,000. This represents a tax discrepancy of $5,200 (that is, $20,000 x 28 percent). The annual gross income as stated in JASE Co Ltd’s accounts for the 2019–20 income year is $300,000. Two percent of this is $6,000. As the total tax discrepancy caused by the error does not exceed both $10,000 and two percent of JASE Co Ltd’s annual gross income, the error can be corrected in the next income tax return due following discovery of the error. Example 33: Application of the materiality threshold for a GST return Laura’s Library of Books Ltd (LLB) is a company that comprises of a chain of bookstores specialising in contemporary fiction. Laura has 30 stores across New Zealand. After reconciling information provided by all of the stores to the head office in Wellington, the bookkeeper Matt realises that the Pahiatua store’s sales are missing from the GST return for the taxable period up to 31 March 2018 which has resulted in the incorrect amount of output tax being paid to Inland Revenue. The total omitted sales were $10,000. This represents a total tax discrepancy of $1,500 (that is,, $10,000 x 15 percent). The output tax that was paid to Inland Revenue for the period was $75,000 and two percent of the output tax for the period is $1,500. As the total tax discrepancy that was caused by the error does not exceed both $10,000 and two percent of LLB’s output tax for the period, the error can be corrected in the next GST return due following discovery of the error. Example 34: Application of the materiality threshold for an FBT return Ben and Ben’s Running Emporium Ltd (B&BRE) stocks rare and specialist running equipment. B&BRE also manufacture and sell high-end running gear to both New Zealand and international consumers. On occasion, some of the product B&BRE manufacture is sold to employees at a discount. Consequently B&BRE is registered for FBT and files returns on a quarterly basis. Thomas, the accountant for B&BRE realises that for the quarter ending 30 June 2020 an error was made in determining the amount of FBT it was liable for. The total taxable benefits B&BRE provided during the quarter was $14,000 to 28 of the store’s sales staff. B&BRE use the standard rate to determine the amount of fringe benefit tax payable and therefore the correct amount of fringe benefit tax payable for the quarter was $8,721.09. The amount shown on the return sent to Inland Revenue for the quarter however showed total taxable benefits of $10,000, with an amount to pay in FBT of $6,229.35. The total tax discrepancy caused by the error in the return is $2,491.74 (that is, the difference between the FBT that was originally declared as being payable and the correct amount of FBT that is payable). B&BRE’s annual gross income for the most recently completed income year was $150,000 and two percent of this is $2,500. As the total tax discrepancy caused by the error does not exceed both $10,000 and two percent of B&BRE’s annual gross income, the error can be corrected in the next FBT return due following discovery of the error. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 71 NEW LEGISLATION Example 35: Application of the materiality threshold with multiple errors in the same return Marley’s Poodle Grooming Services Limited (MPGC) files GST returns on a two-monthly basis. It operates poodle grooming services through multiple stores located all across New Zealand. Linda, the accountant, identifies multiple errors in the company’s GST return for the period ending 31 May 2020. The output tax as stated in the original return was $100,000. The errors resulted in output tax being understated by $4,000 and input tax deductions being understated by $2,000. The total tax discrepancy caused by the errors is $2,000 (that is, $4,000 of output tax minus $2,000 of input tax deductions). As the total tax discrepancy of the errors do not exceed both $10,000 and two percent of MPGS’s output tax for the return, the errors can both be corrected in the next return due following discovery of the errors. Minor amendments have been made to subsection (5) to reflect the fact that taxpayers do not make assessments for fringe benefit tax. The purpose of subsection (5) remains the same, which is to provide that a person cannot apply the materiality threshold if their main purpose for doing so is to delay the payment of tax. This is intended to ensure that the purpose of these rules is targeted at providing a mechanism to resolve genuine errors which are identified after returns have been submitted to Inland Revenue. AMENDMENTS RELATING TO THE BINDING RULINGS REGIME Sections 91EI, 9ESB, and 91FJ of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Several minor amendments have been made to the binding rulings regime in Part 5A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to ensure the rules operate as intended. Background The provisions that enable the binding rulings regime are contained in Part 5A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The purpose of the binding rulings regime is to provide taxpayers with certainty about the way the Commissioner will apply taxation laws and help them meet their obligations under those laws by enabling the Commissioner to issue rulings that will bind the Commissioner on the application of those laws. Several changes have been made to the scope of the binding rulings regime in recent years, including through the introduction of a new type of binding ruling – short-process rulings – and extending the scope of the binding rulings regime to enable the Commissioner to issue binding rulings for a broader range of matters, including those that do not require an “arrangement”. The amendments made by the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act 2020 ensure that the recent changes work as intended. Key features The key features of the amendments: • • Provide the Commissioner of Inland Revenue with the ability to withdraw short-process rulings. This is based on existing provisions which enable the Commissioner to withdraw other forms of binding rulings; and • • Enable a person who has a binding ruling that has been withdrawn to continue to rely on that binding ruling where the ruling was for a matter not involving an arrangement. Application dates The amendment that enables the Commissioner to withdraw short-process rulings applies from 23 March 2020 (the date of enactment), and an application provision has been included to ensure that there is no ambiguity as to whether the Commissioner can withdraw short-process rulings that have been issued before 23 March 2020 but prior to the passing of the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act 2020. The amendments that allow for continued reliance on withdrawn binding rulings apply from 18 March 2019. This is the date from which the Commissioner has been able to issue binding rulings in respect of certain matters not involving arrangements. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 72 NEW LEGISLATION Detailed analysis Ability to withdraw short-process rulings New section 91ESB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides the Commissioner with the ability to withdraw short-process rulings. It might be appropriate in the circumstances for the Commissioner to withdraw a short-process ruling where there is a change in the interpretation of the law by either the courts or the Commissioner, or where the relevant ruling needs to be replaced with a variation. For the Commissioner to withdraw a short-process ruling, the Commissioner must issue a notice informing the person to whom the ruling applies that the ruling is to be withdrawn. The Commissioner will do this by issuing a notice of withdrawal. The notice of withdrawal will also specify the date that the withdrawal takes effect, and this date cannot be earlier than the date on which the person could reasonably be expected to receive the notice of withdrawal. Where a short-process ruling for a person has been withdrawn, there are two circumstances in which the person can continue to rely on that ruling. These are where: • • The ruling relates to a matter involving an arrangement. In these circumstances, if the person has already entered into the arrangement before the ruling was withdrawn, the person can continue to rely on the ruling for the period specified in the ruling. If, however, the arrangement had not been entered into before the date the ruling was withdrawn, the ruling no longer applies. This is provided for in section 91ESB(3) of the Act. • • The ruling relates to a matter not involving an arrangement, for example where the ruling relates to a person’s status. 30 In these circumstances, if the ruling is withdrawn, the person can continue to rely on the ruling for the period specified in the ruling. This is provided for in section 91ESB(4) of the Act. Date withdrawal takes effect where ruling was for a matter not involving an arrangement Since March 2019 the Commissioner has been able to issue binding rulings for a broader range of matters which do not require the existence of an arrangement. Section 91CB of the Act enables the Commissioner to issue binding rulings on: • • a person’s status (for example, whether they are a resident or a non-resident for tax purposes in New Zealand); • • whether an item of property meets the definition of “trading stock” or “revenue account property” as defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007; and • • whether an amount derived by a person is income under certain provisions in subpart CB of the Income Tax Act 2007 relating to land transactions. The Commissioner can issue private and product rulings in relation to these matters. It was therefore appropriate that amendments be made to the provisions that enable the Commissioner to withdraw private rulings (section 91EI of the Act) and product rulings (section 91FJ of the Act) to ensure that where a ruling has been issued on such matters, the dates from which the ruling no longer applies is clear. The amendments provide that if a private ruling or a product ruling has been issued for such a matter as described above, and that ruling is subsequently withdrawn, the person to whom the ruling applies can continue to rely on the ruling for the period or tax year specified in the ruling. 30 F or a list of matters that the Commissioner is able to issue certain binding rulings in relation to that do not require an arrangement, see section 91CB of the Act. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 73 NEW LEGISLATION PROCESS FOR REMOVING A PERSON FROM THE LIST OF TAX AGENTS AND DISALLOWING STATUS AS A NOMINATED PERSON OR REPRESENTATIVE Section 124G of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Minor amendments have been made to the provision of the Tax Administration Act 1994 that enables the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to remove a person from the list of tax agents, or disallow their status as a representative or a nominated person. The amendment ensures the process operates as intended. Background A broader range of third parties and intermediaries who act on behalf of others have been recognised in the Tax Administration Act 1994 since March 2019, following amendments made by the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019. In addition to consolidating the provisions relating to third parties and intermediaries into new Part 7B of the Tax Administration Act 1994, 2 new types of third parties and intermediaries were added. This includes “nominated persons” and “representatives”. These are explained in further detail in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 4 at pages 67 to 70. Following enactment of the changes it was identified that the statutory rules which outline the process the Commissioner of Inland Revenue must follow to remove a person’s status as a tax agent (or disallow a person’s status as a nominated person or a representative) contained ambiguities as to the timing of certain actions that the Commissioner was required to take. These rules have therefore been amended to ensure the process the Commissioner must follow in the circumstances are clear. Key features The key features of the amendments: • • Provide that before the Commissioner removes a person from the list of tax agents or disallow a person’s status as a representative or a nominated person, the Commissioner must issue a notice to the person informing them of the Commissioner’s intent to remove them. An exception to this general requirement has been retained where the Commissioner considers it necessary in the circumstances to protect the integrity of the tax system; and • • Make it clear that the Commissioner is not required to disclose information that could, under other enactments, be withheld. Application date The amendments apply from 23 March 2020, the date of enactment. Detailed analysis The process that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue must generally follow when taking an action to remove a person from the list of tax agents or disallow a person’s status as a nominated person or a representative is as follows: • • The Commissioner must first issue a notice to the person informing the person that the Commissioner intends to remove them from the list of tax agents or disallow the person’s status as a nominated person or a representative. • • The Commissioner must then consider any arguments against the exercise of the discretion that are provided within 30 days from the date of the notice. A later period may be set by the Commissioner if appropriate in the circumstances. • • After having considered the arguments, the Commissioner will either be satisfied that the person can remain on the list of tax agents or have their status as a nominated person or a representative retained; or the Commissioner will issue a subsequent notice to the person informing them that they have been removed from the list of tax agents or had their status as a nominated person or a representative disallowed. The effective date of the removal or disallowance, as applicable, will be specified within this subsequent notice. The Commissioner is not required to follow this process if the Commissioner considers it necessary in the circumstances to protect the integrity of the tax system. If this is the case, the Commissioner will issue a notice to the person informing them that they have been removed from the list of tax agents or had their status as a nominated person or representative disallowed, and the effective date of the removal will be the date the Commissioner issues the notice informing the person that this action has been taken. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 74 NEW LEGISLATION An amendment was also made to make it clear that where the Commissioner is going to exercise the discretion to remove a person from the list of tax agents, or disallow a person’s status as a nominated person or a representative, that the Commissioner is not required to divulge information that could be withheld under other enactments, such as the Official Information Act 1982 for example. The Commissioner will, where practicable, notify the person of the reason or reasons for the exercise of the discretion (or proposed exercise of the discretion). EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEMES – DEFINITION OF MARKET VALUE Sections CE 7CB, CW 26DB, YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 New sections CE 7CB and CW 26DB and amended section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) expand the definition of ‘market value’ for the purposes of the employee share scheme (ESS) and exempt ESS rules to include a 5-day ‘volume weighted average price’ or an equivalent, and other methods accepted by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. This makes it easier for companies offering ESSs to value their shares, reducing compliance costs and improving accuracy of valuations. Background For the purposes of valuing listed shares, ‘market value’ is currently defined in section YA 1 of the ITA as the ‘middle market quotation’. This is the average of the best buying and selling prices quoted by market makers, taken at the close of the market each day. Obtaining this middle market quotation is reported to be difficult in practice, and a much more common and practical measure is a ‘volume weighted average price’. This is the total value of the shares traded divided by the number of shares traded over a particular time period. In her operational statement CS 17/01, the Commissioner accepts a 5-day volume weighted average price (amongst other methods) for valuing shares obtained under an ESS. 31 Expanding the definition of ‘market value’ for the purposes of the ESS rules to include these methods makes it easier for companies to value their shares, and reduces compliance costs. Key features New section CE 7CB provides that ‘market value’, for an employee share scheme: • • has the same meaning as in section YA 1 (Definitions), definition of market value, paragraphs (a) and (b); and • • includes, for a share or option quoted on the official list of a recognised exchange, at the time, an amount equal to the five-day volume weighted average price or any other method that is accepted by the Commissioner or is comparable to the five-day volume weighted average price, for such shares or options. New section CW 26DB provides the same as above, but for the exempt ESS rules. The definition of ‘market value’ in section YA 1 is amended to link to the new sections above. Application dates Section CE 7CB applies from 29 September 2018 – the date the reforms to the general ESS rules came into effect. Section CW 26DB applies from 29 March 2018 – the date the reforms to the exempt ESS rules came into effect. The amendments to section YA 1 have the same application dates as the sections they link to – the application dates for sections CE 7CB and CW 26DB respectively. 31 I t is intended that a refreshed Commissioner Statement will be released soon. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 75 NEW LEGISLATION EXEMPT EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEMES – TAKEOVERS AND SIMILAR REORGANISATIONS Section CW 26C(7) of the Income Tax Act 2007 Amended section CW 26C(7) adds an exception to the ‘period of restriction’ in the exempt ESS rules for takeovers and similar reorganisations. Background In order for an ESS to qualify as exempt, the terms of the scheme must provide that shares are held by the employee for a period of time – generally three years – before they are disposed of. This is to ensure the scheme achieves the objective of aligning employee and employer incentives, and also to prevent employers from granting employees shares which the employee can sell immediately to realise an untaxed cash benefit (when remuneration in cash would have been taxed). Exempt ESS trust deeds and similar constituting documents often provide for the sale of scheme shares pursuant to takeovers and other corporate reorganisations. If a takeover occurs, which can include the shares of minority shareholders being compulsorily acquired, this could breach the period of restriction requirement and mean the scheme fails to meet the statutory criteria; the shares may then become taxable. This is despite these events being outside the control of the employee. Adding to section CW 26C(7) an exception for transfers of shares to or by an employee before the end of the restricted period in the case of takeovers and similar reorganisations ensures that companies and participating employees are not penalised for selling their shares before expiry of the three-year period due to such uncontrollable events. The scheme will remain exempt. Key features Sections CW 26C(7)(a) and (b), after the words ‘disposed of ’, incorporate the words ‘other than as part of a takeover or similar share reorganisation’. Application date Amended section CW 26C(7) applies from 29 March 2018, the date the new exempt ESS rules came into effect. EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEMES – FLEXIBILITY TO ALLOW EMPLOYEES TO KEEP SHARES IF THEY LEAVE EMPLOYMENT Section CW 26C(8) and (8B) of the Income Tax Act 2007 New section CW 26C(8) allows for alternative approaches where the period of restriction ends because the employee leaves the company voluntarily. The employee may either have the choice to keep their ESS shares, or be required to return them to the company for the lesser of cost 32 or market value. 33 This update to the legislation allows alignment of the treatment of these so-called ‘bad leavers’ under the New Zealand exempt scheme rules with their treatment under the Australian exempt scheme rules, which will make it easier for trans-Tasman companies to offer the same scheme in both countries. Background Prior to this amendment, upon expiry of the ‘period of restriction’ in section CW 26C(7), ‘good leavers’ – employees whose employment ends due to their death, accident, sickness, redundancy, or retirement at normal retiring age – or their estate, could choose whether to keep their shares in the company or have them acquired for the lesser of cost or market value (under section CW 26C(9)). But ‘bad leavers’ – employees who leave for other reasons (for example, going to work for a competitor) – had to have their shares acquired for the lesser of cost or market value. There was no flexibility for the company to allow bad leavers to keep their shares. One objective of the 2018 amendments to the ESS rules was to allow trans-Tasman companies to offer Australian exempt schemes to their New Zealand employees. However, Australian exempt schemes may require that bad leavers have the choice to keep their shares. This was in conflict with New Zealand’s rule for bad leavers, making it difficult for trans-Tasman companies to offer the same scheme in both countries. 32 T he cost of the shares to the employee. 33 T he market value of the shares on the date the period of restriction ends. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 76 NEW LEGISLATION While Australian schemes could be amended for New Zealand employees, so as to comply with the New Zealand rules, this carried compliance costs and meant New Zealand employees could end up with a commercially less favourable exempt ESS than their Australian counterparts. Aligning New Zealand’s exempt scheme rules with Australia’s rules by allowing companies to choose whether bad leavers can keep their shares should make it significantly easier for trans-Tasman companies to offer their schemes in both countries. Key features New section CW 26C(8) provides two options for employers to choose from when designing the terms of an ESS arrangement with respect to the end of the ‘period of restriction’ for a bad leaver. First option (subsection CW 26C(8)) When the period of restriction ends, the shares are transferred to the employee if they have not already been transferred, or – if the employee chooses – the shares are acquired from the employee or trustee for the lesser of cost and market value. Second option (subsection CW 26C(8B)) When the period of restriction ends: • • If the employee is currently employed, the shares are transferred to the employee if they have not already been transferred, or – if the employee chooses – the shares are acquired from the employee or trustee for the lesser of cost and market value. • • If the employee is not currently employed, the shares are acquired from the employee or trustee for the lesser of cost and market value. This second option simply replicates the current law, so there is no need for schemes that are currently exempt to change. Application date New section CW 26C(8), and subsection (8B), apply from 29 March 2018, the date the current exempt ESS rules came into effect. Detailed analysis The first option is appropriate for employers that do not wish to make a distinction between the circumstances of an employee’s departure, and prefer to give all employees the choice between keeping their shares or having them acquired by the employer again. This option may make it easier for some Australian exempt schemes to be replicated in New Zealand. The second option is suitable for employers that do not want ‘bad leavers’ to have the choice to keep their shares. This arrangement replicates the law prior to this amendment. As part of the amendment, all instances of the word ‘purchased’ have been replaced with ‘acquired’. The reason for this change in terms is that the word ‘purchase’ implies an amount of consideration, whereas in some cases the employer may have granted the employee the shares for free, so ‘purchasing’ them back from the employee for the lesser of cost and market value will result in a purchase for nil consideration, which as a matter of strict interpretation might not be possible. The word ‘acquired’ is less problematic as it clearly covers both possibilities. RING-FENCING OF RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY DEDUCTIONS Sections EL 3, EL 4, EL 5, EL 7, EL 8, EL 15, EL 16, and EL 18 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Some remedial amendments have been made to the residential property deduction ring-fencing rules, to ensure they operate as intended. Background The new ring-fencing rules in subpart EL, which apply from the start of the 2019–20 income year, were introduced to limit deductions for residential property to income from the property. Before the introduction of these rules, loss-making investors could use the excess deductions from their rental properties to offset their income from other sources (such as salary and wages), thus reducing their income tax liability. A number of remedial amendments have been made to ensure the rules operate as intended. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 77 NEW LEGISLATION Key features The key remedial amendments ensure that: • • The carry forward of amounts that remain ring-fenced after a taxable property sale, because they have been transferred from another property which was not taxed on sale. • • It is clear that amounts of residential income can only be counted once in applying the ring-fencing rules. • • The interposed entity rules operate as intended. Application date The amendments came into force on 1 April 2019 – the date the ring-fencing rules in subpart EL came into force. Detailed analysis Unused excess deductions not released on taxable sale of portfolio or property Sections EL 5 and EL 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007 have been amended to ensure the carry forward of unused deductions that are not released on a taxable sale of a residential property or portfolio. If a property-by-property basis residential property is taxed on sale, or if all of the properties in a portfolio are sold and all sales were taxed, any excess deductions remaining (after use against the rental income and net land sale income) are released from the ring-fencing rules. This means those amounts can be used against income from other sources, such as salary and wages. However, if there has been an unused excess transferred to the property or portfolio from another property or portfolio that was not taxed (or not fully-taxed) on sale, the amount transferred is not released. These amendments ensure there is a mechanism for any unfenced amount remaining after a taxable sale to be treated as relating to (and transferred to) another property, consistent with the mechanism that does this for excess amounts remaining after non- taxed disposals. In making these amendments, the opportunity was also taken to incorporate what was section EL 8 (which dealt with the treatment of previously transferred amounts on a fully-taxed disposal) into sections EL 5 and EL 7, which deal with sales of portfolios and property-by-property basis residential properties, respectively. This amendment is a rationalisation of the provisions – it does not affect the way the rules operate. Operation of the interposed entity rules Sections EL 16 and EL 18, which may apply if residential property is held in a “residential land-rich entity”, have been amended to ensure they operate as intended. Section EL 16(2) suspends excess interest deductions related to investing in a land-rich entity. These are deductions that exceed the person’s share of the entity’s residential income, taking into account the level of capital used to acquire the residential property. Under the wording of these provisions as originally introduced, the suspended deductions would have been carried forward to a later income year in which the person derives residential income or a distribution from the entity (to the extent such distribution relates to residential land). But the excess deductions would then not have been used against either of those types of income, but rather added to the person’s interest expenditure and used against the person’s share (effectively) of the “entity’s net residential income”. As originally introduce, section EL 16(2)(b)(i) and (ii) therefore did not bear any relation to the income the excess deductions could be used against. Section EL 16(2)(b) has been amended so the excess deductions are carried forward to a later income year in which the entity derives residential income. Paragraph (b)(i) and (ii) do not serve any purpose and should be removed. There was a related issue in section EL 18(a) which has also been fixed up. In the wording of that provision as originally introduced, the person’s residential income for the year would have been treated as their share of “net residential income”. That is fine when the only residential property the person has is held in the entity. But the person may also hold other residential property directly. If they do, they should not be able to use excess interest deductions related to the investment in the entity against that other residential income. As such, section EL 18(a) has been amended so that the person’s residential income for the income year from the property held in the entity is what is treated as their share of net residential income. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 78 NEW LEGISLATION Clarifying that amounts of residential income can only be counted once An amendment has been made to clarify that amounts of residential income from residential property outside the ring-fencing rules can only be counted once for the deduction allocation rules. This clarification is required because a taxpayer may apply the ring-fencing rules on a portfolio basis for some properties and on a property-by-property basis for another property, or they may have 2 or more properties on a property-by-property basis. In these situations, the deduction allocation rule is applied to each property (or a property and the portfolio) separately. In section EL3, paragraphs (a) to (c) of “residential income” are amounts from the particular property or portfolio, so cannot be counted when looking at another property or portfolio. However, paragraph (d) includes amounts of income from property outside the rules. On the face of it, there was nothing to preclude a taxpayer counting such amounts more than once – for example, once in ascertaining their “residential income” for their portfolio, and once in ascertaining their “residential income” for a property-by-property basis property. This amendment clarifies that if an amount of residential income has been counted, it cannot be counted again for allocating deductions for another property. Clarifying that current year excess deductions can be transferred within a wholly-owned group An amendment has been made to clarify that current year excess deductions can be transferred within a wholly owned group under section EL 15. As originally introduced, the terminology in section EL 15 suggested that it was only excess deductions that had been carried forward from prior years that could be transferred within a wholly owned group. That was not intended, and the amendment ensures that current year excess deductions can also be transferred. Cross referencing errors corrected An amendment has been made to section EL 3, to correct a cross-referencing error in the definition of “residential land”. As the definition was originally worded, deductions for residential property in the ring-fencing rules could be used against income from the property (or portfolio) and against net rental income and net depreciation recovery income from residential property that is outside the rules because it is held on revenue account. This amendment ensures that deductions can also be able to be used against net sale income from such revenue account property. A cross-referencing error in the definition of “land sales provisions” in section EL 3 has also been corrected, to ensure that section CB 15 is included in that definition. TAXATION OF LIFE INSURANCE BUSINESS – TRANSITIONAL RELIEF Sections EY 30 of the Income Tax Act 2007; section 65 of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 Changes have been made to section EY 30 in response to submissions on the bill regarding remedial changes to the life insurance transitional rules made by the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019. The changes: • • Replace the current description of the CPI period being, “consisting of the last four quarters preceding the year”, with a reference to the CPI percentage change movement to the annual rate specified in the formula in the life policy. • • Revise the application section (section 65(4) of Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019) to ensure that life insurers wanting to use the amendment can do so. The changes respond to concerns raised by submitters that the legislative changes made by the earlier bill did not reflect life insurer practices regarding the calculation of CPI benefits, and that the savings provision that accompanied the legislative change was too limited in scope. Application date The amendments apply from 1 July 2010. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 79 NEW LEGISLATION EXEMPTION FOR CERTAIN GOVERNMENT GRANTS PROVIDED TO SOCIAL HOUSING PROVIDERS Section 5(6F) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Section 5(6F) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 has been amended to clarify that all types of payments by the Government to social housing providers under a tailored agreement to provide social housing are exempt from GST. Background Like other residential landlords, social housing providers are exempt from GST in respect of their supplies of accommodation in dwellings provided to their tenants. In 2015, a provision was added to the GST Act to ensure that payments made by the Government to social housing providers under reimbursement agreements and tailored agreements to provide social housing are treated as consideration for an exempt supply of accommodation in a dwelling. The tailored agreements that have subsequently been agreed include several types of payment; a rent subsidy, an operating supplement, and in limited cases, a capital grant. There was uncertainty as to whether or not all of these types of payment would qualify for the GST exemption in section 5(6F). This was because section 5(6F) originally required that the payment be for “the provision of accommodation in social housing.” It was unclear if this requirement would be met for the operating supplement and capital grant payments as these payments are only indirectly used to pay for the provision of accommodation. If the GST exemption was found to not apply to some types of payment, the Government would need to gross up these payments to social housing providers in order to subsidise the same amount of tenancies in social housing accommodation. The overall purpose of a tailored agreement is to provide social housing tenancies, so the intended policy is that all types of payments made under a tailored agreement should be deemed to be consideration for an exempt supply. The remedial change provides certainty and reduces compliance costs for social housing providers and the Government. Key features Section 5(6F) has been amended to remove the requirement that the payment must be for “the provision of accommodation in social housing”. This change clarifies that section 5(6F) applies to all types of payments made under either the reimbursement agreements or tailored agreements that are enabled by the Public and Community Housing Management Act 1992. Section 5(6F) deems these payments to be consideration for an exempt supply of accommodation in a dwelling. This means that the social housing providers which receive these payments will not be liable to return GST output tax on any of the relevant payments. Currently, there are 3 types of relevant payment; a rent subsidy, an operating supplement and a capital grant. However, if, in future, other types of payment are developed and paid under the relevant agreements, section 5(6F) would also apply to those new types of payment. Application date The remedial amendment applies from 28 May 2015 which is the date that section 5(6F) first took effect. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 80 NEW LEGISLATION GST DEDUCTIONS FOR CAPITAL RAISING COSTS OF PARTICIPATORY SECURITIES Section 20H of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Section 20H of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 has been amended so that the rules for allowing GST deductions for capital raising costs also apply when funding is raised using participatory securities. Background Section 20H allows GST-registered businesses to recover GST on their costs of raising capital to fund a taxable activity. This provision originally only applied to capital raised through equity or debt securities. Like equity and debt securities, participatory securities can be issued by businesses to raise capital. A remedial amendment has been made so that section 20H also applies to participatory securities. Key features Section 20H(1)(d) has been amended to add references to “participatory securities”, so these rules apply to debt securities, equity securities, and participatory securities. This remedial amendment allows GST registered persons which principally make taxable supplies to claim back the GST on the funding support services that they acquire when using participatory securities to raise capital for their taxable activity. Application date The remedial amendment applies from 1 April 2017 which is the date that section 20H first took effect. GST ON LOW-VALUE IMPORTED GOODS REMEDIALS Sections 8(4B)(bb), 10B(2)(b), 10C, 12(1B), 24(4)(g), 24(5D), 24BAB(2)(e), 24BAC, 60C(1)(ab), 60D(1)(ab), 77(3)(aa) and 85C of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985; and section 143A(1)(g) and (h) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Amendments have been made to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act) and the Tax Administration Act 1994 to address technical issues with the new GST on low-value imported goods legislation (referred to here as “the distantly taxable goods rules”) to ensure that these rules and similar GST rules applying to supplies of remote services work as intended. All legislative references are to the GST Act unless stated otherwise. Background From 1 December 2019 GST applies to goods valued at or below $1,000 that are imported from non-resident suppliers by consumers in New Zealand. The new rules require non-resident suppliers, as well as operators of electronic marketplaces and redeliverers to register and return GST on these supplies of “distantly taxable” goods if they exceed, or are expected to exceed, $60,000 in total over a 12-month period. Prior to these changes, GST was only collected on imported goods at the border by the New Zealand Customs Service (Customs). However, GST was not typically collected on imported goods below the customs de minimis of $60 of duty (this equated to a parcel with a value of $400 if GST was the only applicable duty). When GST was introduced in 1986, few New Zealand consumers purchased goods from offshore suppliers, and online shopping did not exist. At that time, the compliance and administrative costs that would have been involved in taxing imported goods under the de minimis outweighed the benefits of taxation. The new rules are intended to maintain the broad base of New Zealand’s GST system and level the playing field between domestic and offshore suppliers of low-value goods. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 81 NEW LEGISLATION Key features The following amendments have been made to the new distantly taxable goods rules and the remote services rules: • • The reverse charge in section 8(4B) has been amended to prevent potential double taxation from occurring when a GST- registered business imports goods for a mix of taxable and non-taxable use and pays GST to either Customs or to the supplier of the goods. • • The marketplace rules have been amended to ensure they do not apply when a New Zealand-resident supplies remote services through a marketplace operated by a New Zealand resident. The amendments ensure that the marketplace rules do not override existing agency rules that apply to these types of domestic arrangements. • • The Tax Administration Act 1994 has been amended to provide that a recipient or a non-resident underlying supplier of distantly taxable goods commits a knowledge offence if they knowingly provide false, misleading or altered information which results in GST not being charged on a supply when it should have been. • • Amendments have been made so that suppliers only need to take reasonable steps to ensure their GST registration number and information about whether GST was paid at the point of sale is made available to Customs when GST has been charged at the point of sale on all or some of the goods in the consignment. • • The requirement for suppliers of distantly taxable goods to include the amount of GST on receipts provided to consumers has been removed. This means that if GST has been charged on all the goods included on the receipt, the receipt requirements can be met by simply including the total GST-inclusive price on the receipt and stating that this price includes G ST. • • An amendment to section 10B(2)(b) clarifies the wording of the provision. • • An amendment to section 10C clarifies that the 75 percent test for an election to treat high-value goods 34 as distantly taxable goods is a self-assessed test. • • An amendment to section 77(3) clarifies that, when doing a foreign exchange calculation to determine the New Zealand dollar amount of GST required to be returned to Inland Revenue, the currency conversion can be done on the date the supply was made. • • Corrections have been made to cross-references in sections 12(1B), 24(4)(g), 24(5D) and 85C. Application dates The following amendments, which are either taxpayer-friendly in nature or mere clarifications of the policy intent, apply on and after 1 December 2019, the date that the distantly taxable goods rules came into force: • • amendment to the reverse charge provision (section 8(4B)(bb)); • • amendments to the marketplace rules (sections 60C(1)(ab) and 60D(1)(ab)); • • amendment to the reasonable steps requirements for reporting GST information to Customs (section 24BAC); • • amendment removing the requirement to state the amount of GST on a receipt (section 24BAB(2)(e)); • • clarification of wording of section 10B(2)(b); and • • insertion of cross-reference in section 85C. Savings provisions apply to protect tax positions taken by registered persons between 1 December 2019 and 23 March 2020 if those tax positions are consistent with either the reverse charge provision in section 8(4B) or the marketplaces rules in sections 60C and 60D, as the law originally stood on 1 December 2019. However, it should be noted that the savings provision relating to the reverse charge amendment is optional for taxpayers to apply. This means that if a taxpayer returned GST in accordance with the previous version of section 8(4B) and wishes to claim a refund of this GST based on the amendment, they can do so. The following amendments apply on and after 23 March 2020, being the date the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act 2020 was enacted: • • amendments to the knowledge offences in section 143A of the Tax Administration Act 1994; • • amendment clarifying that the 75 percent test for an election to treat high-value items as distantly taxable goods is a self- assessed test (section 10C); and • • amendments to cross-references in sections 12(1B), 24(4)(g), and 24(5D). 34 I tems valued above $1,000. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 82 NEW LEGISLATION The amendment to the currency conversion rules (new section 77(3)(aa)) applies on and after 1 October 2016, the date that the remote services rules came into force. Detailed analysis Amendment to reverse charge Except when a non-resident supplier has made a valid election to charge GST on business-to-business supplies below $1,000, GST does apply to distantly taxable goods supplied by non-residents to New Zealand GST-registered businesses. The rationale for this is that applying GST to business-to-business supplies is broadly revenue neutral, as GST-registered businesses purchasing goods and services will generally claim back any GST charged by the supplier as an input tax deduction. However, in some cases, a GST-registered person may purchase goods from a non-resident supplier for non-taxable use (for example, private use). Section 8(4B) was amended in 2019 to require a GST-registered New Zealand business to return GST under the reverse charge when they purchase distantly taxable goods from a non-resident supplier for partial private or exempt use. However, the scope of the reverse charge ended up being wider than was intended, creating the potential for double taxation to occur in the type of situation described in the example below. Example 36: Inappropriate application of reverse charge when goods are in New Zealand at the time of supply A Co, a GST-registered landscaping business, purchases landscaping and gardening equipment from B Co, a non-resident who is not registered for GST. The goods are already in New Zealand at the time of supply. A Co intends to use the goods for 20 percent private use and 80 percent taxable use. Under the previous version of section 8(4B) of the GST Act, A Co would be treated as making a supply to itself at the standard rate of 15 percent and would be entitled to an input tax deduction based on 80 percent of the purchase price. The issue is that B Co already paid GST to Customs on the importation of the goods into New Zealand and the price paid by A Co for the supply was marked up on account of this. This means that the private use of the goods by A Co has effectively been taxed twice. To rectify this, section 8(4B)(bb) has been inserted so that the reverse charge only applies to a supply of goods when: • • the goods are imported by the recipient of the supply in a consignment with a total value of $1,000 or less; and • • the recipient does not pay GST to Customs, or to the supplier of the goods. Example 37: Remedial amendment to reverse charge rule Consider A Co and B Co in the example above and assume the same set of facts applies as before. As a consequence of the remedial amendment, A Co is not treated as making a supply to itself (because A Co did not import the goods into New Zealand as required by new paragraph (bb)). This means that A Co is not required to account for output tax under the reverse charge. Marketplace rules – interaction with existing agency rules Prior to the distantly taxable goods rules, the marketplace rules in sections 60C and 60D only applied to marketplaces for remotely-supplied services and digital products (remote services) operated by non-residents. As part of extending the marketplace rules to supplies of distantly taxable goods, the requirement that the operator of the marketplace is a non-resident was removed. This means that, since 1 December 2019, New Zealand-resident marketplace operators are liable to return GST on supplies of remote services and distantly taxable goods made through their platforms by non-residents to consumers in New Zealand. An unintended consequence of this change was that the electronic marketplace rules also applied to arrangements that were purely domestic in nature and which were already covered by existing agency rules in the GST Act. Because there is only a very limited ability to opt out of the electronic marketplace rules, the effect was that the electronic marketplace rules trumped the existing agency rules as they applied to these domestic arrangements, which was not intended. To address this issue, new sections 60C(1)(ab) and 60D(1)(ab) require that if the marketplace is operated by a New Zealand resident, the underlying supplier must be a non-resident – otherwise the marketplace rules do not apply to a supply of goods or remote services. This means that if an underlying supplier is a New Zealand resident, they are liable to register and return GST – unless the underlying supplier and the New Zealand-resident marketplace operator have an arrangement whereby the marketplace operator makes the supply as an agent of the underlying supplier. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 83 NEW LEGISLATION Knowledge offence – providing incorrect or misleading information Section 143A(1)(g) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been amended so a recipient of a supply of distantly taxable goods commits a knowledge offence if they deliberately provide altered, false or misleading information to avoid being charged GST. This is a criminal penalty and a person convicted of a knowledge offence is liable for a fine of up to $25,000 for a first-time offence or $50,000 for repeated offences. Example 38: Consumer makes misrepresentations about GST registration status Luke purchases a number of distantly taxable goods online, including clothing, footwear, and nutritional supplements. Luke is not registered for GST. To avoid paying GST, Luke continually informs offshore suppliers he is GST registered and provides a false GST registration number. Luke has repeatedly committed a knowledge offence under section 143A(1)(g) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and, if convicted more than once, could be liable for a fine of up to $50,000 on the second conviction and any subsequent convictions. If convicted just once, Luke could be liable for a fine of up to $25,000. New section 143A(1)(h) provides that an underlying supplier of distantly taxable goods or remote services through a marketplace commits a knowledge offence if it knowingly provides altered, false, or misleading information relating to the country or territory in which it is resident, resulting in GST not being returned on the supply by the marketplace operator when it should have been. Unlike paragraph (g), paragraph (h) does not require the incorrect information to have been provided for the purpose of avoiding GST. This is because the underlying supplier’s intention may be difficult to establish in practice. Example 39: Underlying supplier makes misrepresentations about residency Jave Dordan, a non-resident underlying supplier on the NZ Marketplace website, deliberately provides false information about himself (including using a VPN to fake a New Zealand IP address, providing a false mailing address in New Zealand and falsely stating that the goods are shipped from New Zealand) with the intention of misleading potential customers in New Zealand. The fact that NZ Marketplace will not charge GST on the supply as a result of Jave’s deception is not Jave’s primary objective in making the misrepresentations, but is merely a secondary benefit from Jave’s perspective. Section 143A(1)(h) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 does not require that Jave’s purpose in providing the false information was to avoid GST. Therefore, it does not matter whether Jave had a purpose of avoiding GST—it only matters that he knowingly provided the incorrect information. Jave has committed a knowledge offence under section 143A(1)(h) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Reasonable steps requirement – providing GST information to Customs An amendment to section 24BAC provides that a supplier of distantly taxable goods is required to take reasonable steps to ensure that certain GST information is provided to Customs if GST is charged on the supply under section 8(1) at a rate greater than zero percent. For the purpose of preventing double taxation, section 24BAC requires a supplier of distantly taxable goods to take reasonable steps to ensure that its GST registration number is included in the import documentation, along with an indication of whether GST was paid at the point of sale for each item being shipped. This requirement previously applied to all supplies of distantly taxable goods – including supplies that are generally excluded from the requirement to charge GST at the point of sale, such as supplies to GST-registered businesses. The amendment ensures that suppliers of distantly taxable goods are not required to report GST information to Customs in relation to consignments of goods that have not had GST charged at the point of sale at the standard rate of 15 percent. Given that GST will be collected on these goods by Customs anyway, it is not necessary for the supplier to report its GST registration number to Customs in these cases. Removal of requirement to include amount of GST charged on receipt An amendment to section 24BAB(2)(e) has removed the requirement for suppliers of distantly taxable goods to include the amount of GST charged on receipts issued to consumers. For the purpose of preventing double taxation, section 24BAB requires a supplier of distantly taxable goods to issue a receipt if GST has been charged on a supply. This provides the consumer purchasing the goods with documentation that they can provide to Customs as evidence that GST was charged at the point of sale, so that Customs does not collect GST again when the goods are imported into New Zealand. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 84 NEW LEGISLATION This means that if GST has been charged on all the goods included on the receipt, the requirement in section 24BAB(2)(f) and (g) to indicate those items that had GST charged at the point of sale and those that did not can be met by simply including the total GST-inclusive price on the receipt and stating that this price includes GST. However, if GST was charged on only some of the goods supplied, this requirement is met by including the amount of GST for each of the goods. Clarification of wording – section 10B(2)(b) Section 10B(2) deals with the valuation of goods for the purposes of determining whether the goods are distantly taxable goods. The section sets out that the value of an item for these purposes will be the amount of consideration for the supply of the item, less the amounts referred to in paragraphs (a) to (c). Paragraph (b) as it was first enacted referred to “tax charged on the item under section 8”. Two separate technical issues with this wording were identified, as detailed below: • • The wording of the paragraph presumed that the supplier knew whether tax was charged on the item under section 8. However, at the time of doing the calculation, the supplier probably would not know whether tax was charged on the item under section 8, as the sole purpose of performing the calculation was to work out whether GST applied. • • The wording of paragraph (b) also did not work when a non-resident supplier (who had not made an election to treat high- value goods as distantly taxable goods) supplied goods to New Zealand consumers on delivered-duty-paid terms – meaning that the supplier charged the recipient an estimate of the customs charges (including any GST charged under section 12(1)) and paid these charges to Customs on the recipient’s behalf. In the second scenario described above, GST is charged under section 8(1) on items individually valued at $1,000 or less, but not on items valued above $1,000 unless the supplier has elected to treat high-value items as distantly taxable goods. Because the goods are supplied on delivered-duty-paid terms, the supplier will in all cases include an amount in the price to cover the amount of GST. However, when an item is valued over $1,000, the GST is not “tax charged on the item under section 8”, as it is tax charged under section 12(1). To address these technical issues, paragraph (b) has been amended so that it now refers to the amount of tax that would be chargeable on the supply of the item under section 8(1) if the supply was made by a resident and for the same consideration. Meaning of “tax chargeable on the supply of the item if the supply was made by a resident” Section 8(1) applies GST at the rate of 15% to supplies made in New Zealand by registered persons in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. Section 8(2) treats all supplies by New Zealand residents as being made in New Zealand. The reference to “the amount of tax that would be chargeable on the supply of the item under section 8(1) if the supply was made by a resident” in section 10B(2)(b) therefore requires the supplier to do the following: • • First, assume for the purpose of the calculation that GST is charged on the supply under section 8(1) (so the consideration for the supply includes a nominal amount of GST), regardless of whether GST is in fact charged on the supply. • • Second, subtract from the consideration, the nominal amount of GST (calculated by multiplying the amount of consideration by 3/23). This gives the value of the item for the purpose of determining whether it is a distantly taxable good (and therefore whether GST is required to be charged on the supply of the item under section 8(1)). 75 percent test for election to charge GST on high-value goods Amendments have been made to section 10C to clarify that the 75 percent test that applies for determining a supplier’s eligibility to elect to treat high-value goods as distantly taxable goods is a self-assessed test. Under the test, a supplier may make the election if it considers that 75 percent or more of the total value of goods 35 it will supply in the 12-month period starting on the first day the election is intended to be effective for, will consist of items each having a value 36 of $1,000 or less. Suppliers making an election under this test are only required to notify the Commissioner of the election. The introductory words of section 10C(2) previously stated that the Commissioner may agree with an election made under subsection (1). However, as mentioned above, the 75 percent test is a self-assessment test and was never intended to require the Commissioner’s agreement or consent. Suppliers making an election under this test are only required to notify the Commissioner of the election. To clarify that the 75 percent test is a self-assessment test, the introductory words of section 10C(2) now provide that an electing supplier may make the election if the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) are met. Other minor wording amendments to subsections (1), (2) and (3) have been made in support of this change. 35 E xcluding any alcohol or tobacco products. 36 Determined under section 10B(2). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 85 NEW LEGISLATION Currency conversion on date of supply When remote services or distantly taxable goods supplied to New Zealand consumers are priced in a foreign currency, the supplier of those goods or services will need to convert the foreign currency price to New Zealand dollars to determine the amount of GST required to be returned to Inland Revenue. Section 77(3) provides non-resident suppliers with a range of currency conversion options for these purposes, including allowing the supplier to do the currency conversion on the last day of its taxable period or on the date the return was filed. New section 77(3)(aa) has been inserted to clarify that the currency conversion can be done on the date the supply was made. Corrections of cross-references The following amendments to cross-references have been made: • • In section 12(1B), an incorrect cross-reference to paragraph (d) has been removed. • • Previously omitted cross-references to section 9(3)(aa) have been inserted into section 85C. • • In section 24(4)(g), a cross-reference to subsection (5BB) has been inserted. • • In section 24(5D), an incorrect cross-reference to section 8(4) has been removed. The provision now explicitly provides that the supply is treated as being made in New Zealand when the supplier has incorrectly treated the supply as made in New Zealand and opted to provide a tax invoice to the GST-registered recipient (so that the recipient can make an input tax deduction for the incorrectly charged GST). BRIGHT-LINE MAIN HOME EXCLUSION Sections CB 16A and FB 3A of the Income Tax Act 2007 The main home exclusion for the bright-line test requires that a person use the land as their main home for most of the time they own the land. The amendment aligns the period of ownership for the main home exclusion for the bright-line test with the period in the bright-line test itself. A further amendment clarifies when this period of ownership starts for land transferred on a settlement of relationship property as define in section FB 1B. Background The main home exclusion for the bright-line test in section CB 16A applies where land has been used predominantly, for most of the time the person owns the land, for a dwelling that was the main home for the period. “Own” is defined in section YA 1 for land as having an estate or interest land. “Estate or interest” is defined as including all estates and interests in land whether legal or equitable. Under these definitions, a person will typically own land from the date a binding contract to purchase the land is formed until the date of registration of the transfer on sale. However, this period can be different from the period that is counted for the purpose of the bright-line test. Under section CB 6A(1), a person generally acquires land for the purposes of the bright-line test on the date the instrument to transfer the land to the person is registered. Th bright-line test period ends on the “bright-line date”, which is defined in section CB 6A (7) as the earliest of the date the person enters into an agreement for the disposal of the land, or the date on which the land is disposed of (including by way of gift, compulsory acquisition or mortgagee sale). Because the period that a person “owns” land for the purposes of the main home exclusion can be different from the period that the bright-line test applies for, it is possible that taxpayers may not be eligible for the main home exclusion because, although they have used land as their main home for most of the period the bright-line test applies to, they have not used it a their main home for most of the time they owned the land. The opposite could also occur. Section FB 3A applies where residential land that may be subject to the bright-line test is transferred on a settlement of relationship property. It clarifies that the transfer will be treated as occurring for an amount equal to the cost of the land to the transferor, and at the date the transferor acquired the land. Section FB 3A currently applies for the purposes of section CB 6A (the bright-line test) but not for the purposes of section CB 16A (the main home exclusion for the bright-line test). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 86 NEW LEGISLATION Key features The amendment clarifies that, for the purpose of the main home exclusion for the bright-line test in section CB 16A, the period a person owns the land is the same as the period that the bright-line test applies for. It is consistent with the policy intent for the periods to be aligned. A further amendment clarifies that rules for residential land transferred on a settlement of relationship property in section FB 3A also apply for the purpose of the main home exclusion for the bright-line test in section CB 16A. Application date The amendments apply from the date of enactment. CONSIDERATION FOR GRANT OF EASEMENT AND OTHER LAND RIGHTS Sections CC 1 and CC 1B of the Income Tax Act 2007 The amendments to sections CC 1 and CC 1B of the Income Tax Act 2007 (‘the Act’) make two clarifications regarding the tax treatment of certain land use related payments. The first clarification is that a payment directly for the grant, renewal, extension or transfer of a land right (defined as a leasehold estate or a licence to use land) is taxable. The second clarification ensures that a one-off payment for the grant of a permanent easement is not taxable, as has always been intended. Background Grant, renewal, extension or transfer of a land right Before this amendment, section CC 1B was drafted in such a way that it only taxed consideration for the “agreement” by a payee to the grant, renewal, extension or transfer of a land right (that is, an inducement type payment). Section CC 1B did not tax consideration that was directly for the grant, renewal, extension or transfer of the land right. From a policy perspective it was intended that such payments were taxed under section CC 1. However, the Court of Appeal in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Vector Limited \[2016\] NZCA 396 concluded that was not the case. These payments should be taxable, because they can be a substitute for what would otherwise be an ongoing series of rental payments, which would be taxable. The amendment clarifies that these payments are income for the recipient. One-off payment for grant of a permanent easement A leasehold estate is defined in section YA 1 of the Act as any estate or interest in land other than a freehold estate. An easement is an interest in land and, therefore, a leasehold estate as defined in the Act. Easements can be permanent or non-permanent. A permanent easement is substantively equivalent to a freehold estate because it lasts indefinitely. Consideration for the sale of freehold land is in most cases not taxable under New Zealand income tax law. Therefore, it is appropriate that a one-off payment for the grant of a permanent easement is also not taxable. The Act contained an exception for such a payment in section CC 1(2C). However, the court in Vector found that a lump sum payment for the grant of an easement could not be taxable under section CC 1. This was because a one-off payment is a capital receipt and could not fall under ‘other revenues’ in section CC 1(2)(g), and none of the other amounts listed in section CC 1(2) was applicable. Therefore, a one-off payment for the grant of a permanent easement was not captured by section CC 1, and consequently section CC 1(2C), the specific exception for that type of amount, was redundant and could be repealed. The amendment to section CC 1B discussed in the previous section, if made by itself, would make consideration for the grant of all easements taxable. Therefore, section CC 1B is also amended to carve out one-off payments for the grant of a permanent easement, consistent with the policy intent. Key features Section CC 1B has been amended to: • • clarify that it includes as income consideration for ‘the grant, renewal, extension or transfer of a land right’ • • clarify that a one-off payment for the grant of a permanent easement is not taxable. A land right is a leasehold estate or licence to use land. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 87 NEW LEGISLATION Section CC 1 has been amended to remove subsection (2C), which provided the exception for a one-off payment for the grant of a permanent easement, as the decision in Vector made it clear that such a payment was never taxable under section CC 1. Application date The repeal of section CC 1(2C) applies from 1 April 2015, the date section CC 1(2C) was introduced. The new subsection CC 1B(6), which replicates the wording of the repealed section CC 1(2C), also applies from 1 April 2015. The substantive clarification of section CC 1B is achieved through two amendments: • • an amendment to the section as it existed from its introduction in 1 April 2013 up to 1 April 2015, when it was replaced (for reasons unrelated to the current amendment); and • • an amendment to the section as it has existed from 1 April 2015. Both amendments are subject to a savings provision which means they do not apply to an amount for which the person relies on a tax position taken by the person in a return of income filed with the Commissioner, or on a binding ruling issued by the Commissioner: • • in the period beginning with 1 April 2013 and ending before 23 August 2019; and • • that is inconsistent with the amendment. The savings provisions in the amendments to section CC 1B protect tax positions taken before the Minister of Revenue made a public announcement of the amendments on 23 August 2019. INTEREST LIMITATION REMEDIALS Sections FE 6, FE 16B, and GC 16 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Three changes have been made to the interest limitation rules which apply to cross-border related debt. These changes: • • remove the inbound thin capitalisation de minimis when the group has related party debt from a non-resident; • • exclude certain financial arrangements from being a non-debt liability in the thin capitalisation calculations where the funding is pro rata with a group member’s shareholding or by a group member with a substantial shareholding; and • • ensure the optional credit rating method can be calculated based on secured debt. Key features Inbound thin capitalisation de minimis The term “adjust” in section FE 6(3)(ac) is zero when the de minimis does not apply. Section FE 6(3)(ac)(i) has been extended to cover entities that have related party debt from a non-resident so that the de minimis is not available in this situation. Non-debt liabilities – shareholder loans Section FE 16B calculates non-debt liabilities by prescribing which amounts can be subtracted from the group’s liabilities. This section has been extended to ensure financial arrangements provided by a member of the worldwide group are excluded from non-debt liabilities when the funds are pro-rata with a shareholding. Restricted transfer pricing – optional credit rating method The word “unsecured” has been removed from section GC 16(5) which will allow a taxpayer to calculate the optional credit rating method based on long-term senior debt that is not related party debt whether it is secured or unsecured. Application date These amendments apply from 1 July 2018 to align with the original changes introduced in the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act 2018. Detailed analysis Inbound thin capitalisation de minimis The thin capitalisation rules contain a de minimis in section FE 6(3)(ac) of the Income Tax Act 2007 so that certain excess debt entities do not need to make adjustments upon breaching the thin capitalisation threshold. This applies when these entities have a group finance cost of up to $1 million and abates up to a group finance cost of $2 million. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 88 NEW LEGISLATION Changes in the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act 2018 extended this de minimis from the outbound thin capitalisation rules to also apply to the inbound thin capitalisation rules provided the borrower does not have any owner- linked debt. However, owner-linked debt, which is described in section FE 18(3B) of the Income Tax Act 2007, exists only where the borrowing is, directly or indirectly, from an owner who is not a member of the group. It was always intended that the de minimis should not be available where there was borrowing from a non-resident member of the same group. This is because a group with related party lending that does not have to apply thin capitalisation could have very high levels of debt in New Zealand and derive a return on their total investment without making any taxable profits due to high interest deductions. This is not appropriate, even where the interest expense is less than $1 million or $2 million. Therefore, access to the de minimis has been restricted to also not be available when the borrower has related party debt from a non-resident that does not have a New Zealand branch. Non-debt liabilities – shareholder loans Section FE 16B(1)(b) and (c) exclude certain shares and shareholder loans from being non-debt liabilities for thin capitalisation purposes. The intention of these sections is to exclude shareholder funding that is not within the definition of total group debt in section FE 15 (and is therefore not excluded from non-debt liabilities by section FE 16B(1)(a)) and is akin to group equity. The previous wording of section FE 16B(1)(b) applied only to certain financial arrangements entered into by a member of the group with a shareholder that was also a member of the group. This was narrower than the intended scope which was for certain financial arrangements entered into by a member of the group with a shareholder of the group DISREGARDED HYBRID PAYMENT RULE – EXCEPTION FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY EXPENDITURE Sections FH 5(2) and FH 5B of the Income Tax Act 2007 Remedial amendments to the hybrid and branch mismatch rules introduce a new exception to the disregarded hybrid payment rule in section FH 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007. This exception ensures the New Zealand branch of a non-resident company or New Zealand hybrid entity is allowed a deduction for a payment to the extent that: • • the payment reimburses a control group member for third-party expenditure; and • • the third-party expenditure is non-deductible (in New Zealand or in the foreign jurisdiction) because income of the branch or hybrid entity is not taxable in the foreign jurisdiction. All section references are to the Income Tax Act 2007. Background The disregarded hybrid payment rule in section FH 5 seeks to deny a deduction in New Zealand for a payment by a New Zealand resident or New Zealand branch, or charged by a New Zealand branch, if the payment is disregarded by the payee jurisdiction due to the status of the payer. The rule, therefore, addresses a situation where a deduction-no inclusion outcome would otherwise arise. However, the original design of section FH 5(2) meant a New Zealand branch of a non-resident company or a New Zealand hybrid entity would be denied a deduction for a payment that reimbursed a member of the non-resident's control group for third-party expenditure, where the member of the non-resident's control group was not allowed a deduction in the relevant foreign jurisdiction for the third-party expenditure. A foreign jurisdiction, such as Australia, might deny a deduction for third- party expenditure in such a situation if the expenditure relates to the exempt income of a New Zealand branch (i.e. the activities of the payer). This would mean a deduction would be denied in respect of a payment that does not produce the net deduction- no inclusion hybrid outcome section FH 5 is targeted at; the group would not be allowed a deduction in either jurisdiction for legitimate third-party expenditure. The exception introduced in this amendment addresses this situation. This outcome was also inconsistent with the treatment of third-party costs imposed on a New Zealand branch by way of a charge from the branch’s non-resident head office (rather than by a reimbursement payment to another member of the non-resident's control group). In this situation section FH 5(3) would apply and the New Zealand branch would be allowed a deduction for the third-party expenditure charge. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 89 NEW LEGISLATION Application date The amendments apply with retrospective effect for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018, to align with the general application date of the hybrid and branch mismatch rules. Detailed analysis To address the issue, section FH 5(2)(c) and section FH 5B establish a new exception to the disregarded hybrid payment rule in section FH 5. An exception to section FH 5 has been introduced for situations where a payment from a New Zealand branch or hybrid entity to a non-resident group member reimburses the payee for third-party expenditure. A key element of the new exception to FH 5 is that no deduction for the third-party expenditure is allowed in the payee jurisdiction because some part of the payer’s income (the income earned through a New Zealand branch or hybrid entity) is not taxable in the payee jurisdiction. The exception is drafted with a focus on the supply of goods and services that match the payments producing the tax outcomes. Section FH 5B(2) sets out the requirements a supply of goods or services from the payee to the payer must meet for the exception to apply. These requirements are: • • a supply of goods or services (referred to as the “prerequisite group supply”) is received and paid for by the payee, or a member of the payee’s control group who is also resident in the payee’s jurisdiction; • • the prerequisite group supply is made by a third-party (i.e. a person who is not a member of a control group including the payee or payer); • • the payment for the prerequisite group supply is non-deductible (nor is any equivalent tax relief available) in the payee jurisdiction on the basis that income of the payer is not taxable in the payee jurisdiction; and • • the payment is not deductible (nor is any equivalent tax relief available) in any other country or territory. If a supply of goods or services meets these requirements it will be deemed to be a “payer supply” for the purpose of section FH 5B. Expenditure excluded – one payer supply and one prerequisite group supply Section FH 5B(3) sets out the amount of expenditure that is excluded from the scope of section FH 5 where the payee, or a member of the payee’s control group, has made a single payer supply to the payer (i.e. there are not multiple supplies made in or before that income year meeting the requirements of sub-section (2)), and this relates to a single prerequisite group supply. In this situation the amount of excluded expenditure will equate to the lessor of the consideration for the payer supply or the amount that is non-deductible to the payee for the prerequisite group supply. Expenditure excluded – multiple payer supplies and/or prerequisite group supplies Section FH 5B(4) allows for expenditure to be excluded from section FH 5 where there are multiple payer supplies and/or prerequisite group supplies (i.e. where consideration for a payer supply reimburses for multiple prerequisite group supplies or where consideration for multiple payer supplies reimburses for a single prerequisite group supply). To satisfy this sub-section, the excluded amount for a payer supply, when taken in conjunction with any excluded expenditure relating to other payer supplies, must meet the following requirements: • • where a payer supply is linked to multiple prerequisite group supplies, the excluded amount must not exceed the consideration for the payer supply; and • • the total excluded amount must not exceed the amount for the prerequisite group supply that is non-deductible to the payee. Sub-section (4) also contains an ordering rule, which sets out how payer supplies and prerequisite group supplies should be prioritised for the purpose of determining which amounts of expenditure can be excluded from section FH 5. Payer supplies and prerequisite group supplies will be prioritised based on the order which they are made, or for payer supplies or prerequisite group supplies made at the same time, the order chosen by the payer. Design of the exception This amendment is intended to cover a broad range of intra-group payments for goods and services provided they have a connection to legitimate third-party expenditure. For instance, financing sourced from an external lender could count as a “prerequisite group supply” of services if that financing is advanced to the New Zealand branch of a non-resident company (that is, that it is a “prerequisite”) and the other conditions of this exception rule are met. Another example could be payments relating to goods sourced from an external supplier and sold in the New Zealand market. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 90 NEW LEGISLATION However, as outlined in the example below, a payment can only meet this exception to section FH 5 to the extent of the foreign non-deductibility. In a “mark-up” arrangement where the amount of the New Zealand branch intra-group payment exceeds the amount of external costs of the group which are being reimbursed, the “mark-up” component of the payment will be outside the scope of section FH 5B and will likely be a mismatch amount for which a deduction is denied under section FH 5. This aligns with the rule for branch charges in section FH 5(3). Where there are multiple payments and/or amounts of third-party expenditure, the amendment provides that an amount of non-deductible third-party expenditure can only be matched up to a payment it relates to once for the exception to apply. Example 40 Figure 1 ABC Co XYZ Co Third party XYZ Co NZ branch $5,000 Legal advice Advice $2,000 Jurisdiction A New Zealand XYZ Co, a resident of foreign jurisdiction A, operates a branch in New Zealand. XYZ Co is part of the same consolidated group as another company in jurisdiction A, ABC Co. ABC Co provides legal advice to XYZ Co. In the provision of this service ABC Co has to obtain specialist advice from a third- party law firm, which costs $2,000. XYZ Co is required to pay ABC Co $5,000 for this service. This represents the $2,000 worth of costs ABC Co incurred, plus an additional $3,000 arm’s length mark-up. XYZ Co on-charges the $5,000 to its New Zealand branch to pay. In jurisdiction A, transactions within a consolidated group are disregarded, meaning the amount paid by the New Zealand branch of XYZ Co to ABC Co will not be treated as income of ABC Co. ABC Co is not permitted a deduction for the third- party costs it incurred in the provision of the service to XYZ Co on the basis costs have been allocated to the New Zealand branch. (Income of XYZ Co earned through its New Zealand branch is not taxable in jurisdiction A because that jurisdiction’s tax law exempts income and expenditure of a resident company to the extent it is attributed to a foreign branch). The $2,000 cost component of the payment will satisfy the requirements of section FH 5B(2) and as it involves only one payer supply and one prerequisite group supply section FH 5B(3) would exclude it from the scope of section FH 5. However, the $3,000 profit component of the payment would not satisfy the requirements of section FH 5B and as such a deduction may be denied for this part of the payment under section FH 5. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 91 NEW LEGISLATION REVERSE HYBRID PAYMENT RULE – ALLOWING DEDUCTIONS WHERE PAYMENT IS TAXABLE IN NEW ZEALAND Section FH 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007 This amendment repairs an error in the reverse hybrid payment rule in that the rule would have denied a deduction to a New Zealand resident company for a payment to a related non-resident company if that payment was exempt under foreign tax law but taxable in New Zealand through the non-resident company’s New Zealand branch. Denying a deduction in this situation is not consistent with the policy intent of the rule which is to address deduction-no inclusion hybrid outcomes. The rule has now been amended for this situation. Payments subject to taxation in New Zealand are now removed from the scope of the rule under section FH 7(1)(d). Application date This amendment applies with retrospective effect for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018, to align with the general application date of the hybrid and branch mismatch rules. ADJUSTING PAYMENT DUE DATES FOR SOME TAX CREDIT RECIPIENTS Section 142AC of the Income Tax Act 2007 The amendment allows Inland Revenue to adjust the terminal tax due dates for some tax credit recipients, if their assessment cannot be finalised within 30 days of their payment due date because Inland Revenue needs to finalise their partner’s or ex- partner’s assessment first, to determine entitlement to tax credits. Background Eligibility for Working for Families (WFF) requires an assessment of family income. This requires both partners to be assessed for income tax. This can result in a timing issue when one partner has an extension of time for their tax obligations. This means that some peoples’ income tax assessments are unable to be finalised by their tax due date, because they are dependent on another person’s income tax assessment being completed first. Those people affected are: • • WFF recipients who had a partner at any time during the year; and • • Those with potential entitlement to the independent earner tax credit (IETC) who were a partner of a WFF recipient at any time during the tax year. Under current rules, any tax payable of $100 or more is subject to penalties and interest from the original payment due date. Some recipients were therefore subject to penalties and interest from a date that is earlier than when the result of the assessment was known. Key features The amendment allows Inland Revenue to adjust the payment due date for tax credit recipients who meet the following criteria: • • The person has an entitlement (or potential entitlement) to WFF or IETC; • • The person has met their own filing obligation (if any); • • Their assessment could not be finalised because Inland Revenue needs to complete another person’s assessment first to determine their entitlement to tax credits; • • The person’s assessment was finalised within 30 days of their terminal tax date, or after their terminal tax date; and • • The person’s assessment is a debit. The adjustment to the terminal tax date for those who meet the criteria above provides a further 30 days to pay a debit amount from the date the assessment was completed before it will be subject to interest and penalties. Credit assessments retain the current due date. This means that any credit interest payable will continue to be calculated from the original date and ensures that no person will be worse off because of this change. The change in due date impacts any payment due for that person on the terminal tax date, that is WFF, income tax, and student loan. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 92 NEW LEGISLATION Application date The amendment applies to assessments for the 2019–20 tax year onward. REINSTATEMENT OF ABILITY TO RECONCILE WORKING FOR FAMILIES FOR MSD RECIPIENTS Section MF 6 of the Income Tax Act 2007 The amendment reinstates the ability for Inland Revenue to choose to complete an end-of year Working for Families (WFF) tax credits reconciliation for recipients who received all their payments from MSD. Background The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 made significant changes to individual income tax provisions for the 2019 year onwards. As part of these changes the provision that allowed Inland Revenue to choose whether to not to complete a WFF reconciliation for a person who received all of their WFF payments from MSD was inadvertently not carried forward into the new provisions. Key features The amendment reinstates the ability for Inland Revenue to choose to complete an end-of-year WFF for recipients who received all their payments from MSD. Application date The amendment applies from 1 April 2019. RECIPROCAL EXEMPTION FOR INCOME FROM INBOUND INTERNATIONAL AIR TRANSPORTATION Sections CW 56 of the Income Tax Act 2007, CW 45 and OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004, CB 14 of the Income Tax Act 1994, and 64A of the Income Tax Act 1976 As a member of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), New Zealand is obligated to reciprocally grant a full income tax exemption to non-resident aircraft operators. New Zealand gives effect to this obligation in section CW 56 of the Income Tax Act 2007, first introduced in 1985 as section 64A of the Income Tax Act 1976. Previously CW 56 only permitted an exemption to be granted for income from outbound air transport. The amendment ensures an exemption can also apply to inbound air transport. Background ICAO member jurisdictions are obligated to reciprocally grant an exemption from income tax to international aircraft operators “to the fullest possible extent”. Members are primarily required to give effect to this obligation by including a reciprocal exemption mechanism in their double tax agreements (DTAs). As a backup, members are also required to include a domestic legislation provision that enables reciprocal exemptions to be granted in the absence of a DTA. As an ICAO member, New Zealand introduced a domestic legislative provision to give effect to the backup exemption mechanism in 1985. The provision is currently located at section CW 56 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section CW 56 is not an automatic exemption. Rather, to ensure reciprocity, the provision authorises the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to exempt income of a non-resident aircraft operator from New Zealand tax if the Commissioner is satisfied that in reciprocal circumstances the other jurisdiction will exempt the income of a New Zealand aircraft operator. The exemption is typically exercised by means of an exchange of letters, in which each side’s tax administration confirms that it will exempt the other side’s international airlines. The exemption mechanism only needs to be exercised on rare occasions, as most international air services to and from New Zealand are with jurisdictions with which New Zealand has a DTA. On the few occasions that it has been exercised, the Commissioner has granted full exemption (that is, for both inbound and outbound transportation). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 93 NEW LEGISLATION However, section CW 56 only expressly referred to income that is attributable to “carriage outside New Zealand by an aircraft of cargo, mail or passengers emplaned or embarked on the aircraft at an airport in New Zealand” (outbound transportation). The provision was silent about income from the carriage of cargo, mail or passengers into New Zealand (inbound air transportation). Income derived by an international airline from inbound transportation has a New Zealand source under section YD 4(2) or (3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 to the extent that it is attributable to business carried out in New Zealand or a contract made or performed in New Zealand. This means that at least some inbound air transportation is potentially taxable in New Zealand. Key features The amendment corrects a deficiency in section CW 56. As previously worded, the provision only permitted an exemption to be granted for income from outbound air transport when it should also apply to inbound air transport. To meet the ICAO obligation to grant an income tax exemption to the fullest possible extent, section CW 56 now expressly applies to inbound air transportation, to the extent there is reciprocity. Application dates The amendment applies retrospectively from 1 April 1984 for section 64A of the Income Tax Act 1976 (the application date of the original legislation). The application date of the amendments to equivalent provisions in subsequent Acts (the Income Tax Act 1994, the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007) are the original date of enactment of each of those Acts. Retrospective application ensures that any full exemption previously granted by the Commissioner under any Act has been granted correctly. INDIVIDUALS’ INCOME TAX REMEDIALS Sections 22H, 89C, 106, 120C, 141JA, and Schedule 8 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Several amendments have been made to the Tax Administration Act 1994 to ensure that the individuals’ income tax changes that were made in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 are aligned with the policy intent. The measures contained in that Act simplify individuals’ year-end income tax filing obligations and help them to use more appropriate rates of withholding during the year. All references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. Application date The amendments to sections 22H, 89C, 106, 120C, 141JA, and Schedule 8 apply retrospectively from 1 April 2019. Detailed analysis Finalising accounts (section 22H) Section 22H(2) has been amended to clarify that an individual can finalise their pre-populated account up to and including 7 July. A further clarification has been made in section 22H(4) to ensure that a taxpayer is allowed to finalise their account outside the due date, as this ability to late file had inadvertently been removed. Date interest starts (section 120C) The definition of “date interest starts” has been amended to ensure that an individual who is treated as a “qualifying individual” 37 for the purposes of the individuals’ income tax rules receives the same treatment as an individual that meets the definition of “qualifying individual”. Notices of proposed adjustment required to be issued by Commissioner (section 89C) This amendment clarifies that the Commissioner is not required to issue a notice of proposed adjustment before finalising the account of a qualifying individual under section 22H. 37 Under the individuals’ income tax changes, a “qualifying individual” is an individual who only earns reportable income for an income year and has no other income information that must be provided to Inland Revenue (see section 22D(2)). If the Commissioner treats an individual as a “qualifying individual” and that individual then turns out to have other sources of income, that individual should be afforded the same benefits as a “qualifying individual”. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 94 NEW LEGISLATION Appealing redundant provisions (sections 106(1C) and 141JA) Sections 106(1C) and 141JA have been repealed. Section 106(1C) is an unnecessary hangover from the previous regime of personal tax summaries. Existing provision 106(1A) is sufficient to give rise to a default assessment as intended, and therefore 106(1C) is unnecessary. Section 141JA deals with the application of penalties to non-filing taxpayers. This is redundant under the new individuals’ income tax regime as all taxpayers now have a square up at year end. Schedule 8 Schedule 8 now includes a rule, which applies retrospectively from 1 April 2019, to allow the Commissioner to write off small amounts of tax payable in certain circumstances. This change is necessary to support the operation of some of the other write off rules that were enacted as part of the individuals’ income tax changes. For example, one of the write off rules enacted as part of the individuals’ income tax changes ensures that an individual who derives income solely from an income tested benefit and has additional tax payable will have that tax payable written off (see schedule 8, part B clause 1). The amendment made in the KiwiSaver Act 2006 prevents the individual from being excluded from the income-tested benefit write off by virtue of deriving a small amount of interest income from a bank account. AMENDMENTS TO INVESTMENT INCOME WITHHOLDING AND REPORTING RULES Sections RE 4, RE 10C, RF 2, RF 4, and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007; sections 25B, 25E and 25MB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 These amendments clarify the application of the investment income withholding and reporting rules to custodial institutions. The amendments enable custodial institutions to access limited relaxations to the normal rules. Two remedial matters have also been addressed: • • a clarification of the error correction rules; and • • the inclusion of an additional foreign exchange rate for the calculation of resident withholding tax (RWT). These amendments are available to all payers of investment income, including custodial institutions. Background The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Act 2018 made changes to improve the administration of investment income information. The changes aimed to enable the pre-population of tax returns and to ensure that taxpayers’ tax obligations and social policy entitlements are calculated more accurately during the year. Monthly reporting of investment income is compulsory from 1 April 2020. Custodial institutions hold investment assets and undertake various functions including settlement services and asset management. As an intermediary entity, the custodial institution is a conduit between an investment income payer (for example, a company paying a dividend) and the final or “end” investor. As a result of its intermediary function, there are circumstances in which a custodial institution may be best placed to undertake withholding and reporting. Clear rules are necessary to reduce compliance costs and provide for simpler administration of investment income for tax purposes. Key features • • A definition of a “custodial institution” has been introduced for the purposes of the investment income withholding and reporting rules. • • The obligation to withhold and report investment income will pass from the investment income payer to a custodial institution that pays to an “end investor”. • • The investment income rules have been relaxed to allow a custodian who pays investment income to a non-resident custodial institution to: –withhold and report on an aggregate basis; and –treat the non-resident custodial institution as an end investor. • • The investment income reporting rules have been relaxed to allow a custodial institution that undertakes reporting to provide the information set out in rows 9, 17 and 20 38 only if the information is held by the custodial institution. 38 S ee schedule 6 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 95 NEW LEGISLATION Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 2020. Detailed analysis Where an investor invests directly with a payer of investment income, the payer is obliged to withhold tax and report the relevant information to Inland Revenue. Example 41 Gerda invests $5,000 in Jet Planes Incorporated (Jet), a publicly listed company on the NZ stock exchange. When Jet pays a dividend, it will withhold and report investment income to Inland Revenue in respect of Gerda. One or more custodial institutions may sit between the investor and the payer. Where this is the case, it is desirable to confirm which entity in the investment chain will be obliged to withhold tax and report to Inland Revenue. The rules introduced by the new Act are intended to provide the broad framework for withholding and reporting purposes: an entity that meets the definition of “custodial institution”; and pays investment income to an “end investor” will have an obligation to withhold and report investment income. That institution may make arrangements to outsource or transfer its obligations (as described below). The rules that require a payer to withhold where an investor invests directly with the payer will remain unchanged. Likewise, the specific provisions that allow “nominees”, “trustees”, and “agents” to undertake withholding will continue to apply to those entities. Definitions of “custodial institution”, “end investor”, and “investment income” New sections RE 10C of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section 25MB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 define key terms used in the withholding and reporting rules. Custodial institution A “custodial institution” is defined as: • • an entity that holds financial assets as a bare trustee on account for another person; and • • whose activities are supervised or regulated under prescribed New Zealand legislation. (This includes legislation that is substantially similar to the New Zealand legislation in other jurisdictions.) End investor An “end investor” is defined as an investor to whom a payment of investment income is made who is: • • a direct investor who is the beneficial owner of the investment; or • • a non-resident custodial institution. The definition of “end investor” also includes a trustee, PIE, or PIE proxy that is obliged to provide investment income information to the Commissioner. A trustee, PIE or PIE proxy is subject to its own obligations under existing law (such as the reporting obligations a PIE will have under the PIE rules). It is not expected that a custodial institution withholds or reports on the beneficiaries of a trust or investors in a PIE. The purpose of defining an “end investor” is to capture who the end recipient of the income should be for New Zealand tax purposes, regardless of the entities it may have passed through before reaching the person who is ultimately entitled to the income. Where the income is finally received by an individual, the information is pre-populated and reflected in the taxpayer’s income profile for the tax year. In most cases a non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) liability will be a final tax. Most non-residents are not required to file a New Zealand tax return nor will they have an Inland Revenue income profile. As such, less detailed information is required by Inland Revenue where the ultimate investor is tax resident outside New Zealand. The inclusion of a “non-resident custodial institution” as an end investor ensures that withholding and reporting for New Zealand tax purposes occurs on or before the investment income leaves New Zealand. Treating a non-resident custodian as an end investor also reduces the compliance burden on the custodian undertaking the withholding and reporting. This treatment confirms that the final New Zealand custodian does not have to “look through” the non-resident custodian to identify the ultimate investors. It is expected that non-resident custodial institutions are subject to regulatory requirements and reporting obligations under the Common Reporting Standard or US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 96 NEW LEGISLATION Investment income “Investment income” is defined as: • • resident passive income; or • • non-resident passive income subject to a withholding obligation and attributed income of investors in portfolio investment. Withholding obligations of custodial institutions Section RE 4 A custodial institution that pays or transfers an amount of investment income to an end investor has been added to the list of persons who have withholding obligations under section RE 4. Section RE 10C New section RE 10C sets out when a custodial institution will have an obligation to withhold tax. It also makes provision for the custodial institution to outsource or transfer that withholding obligation. The obligation will crystallise where the custodial institution that receives a payment of gross investment income pays or transfers the amount to an end investor. The obligation only applies to the extent that the correct amount of tax has not already been withheld. Section RE 10C overrides sections RE 7 and RE 8, which will still apply to amounts paid to trustees and nominees who do not meet the “custodial institution” definition. Example 42 Sarah is a New Zealand resident who makes investments via a managed fund. The managed fund invests into Savoury Mints Ltd (Savoury), a company listed on the New Zealand stock exchange, via a custodian and sub-custodian arrangement. The sub-custodian, custodian and managed fund each have RWT exempt status; 39 Sarah is the “end investor” and beneficial owner of the asset and does not have RWT exempt status. The managed fund is obliged to withhold RWT in respect of Sarah. Variation In this variation of the above scenario, the sub-custodian does not have RWT exempt status. Entities will determine whether they have to withhold RWT based on the RWT status of the entity receiving the payment. Savoury will withhold RWT in respect of the dividend and pay it to Inland Revenue. The sub-custodian will then pass the net dividend through the chain and the managed fund will pass this on to the end investor. The managed fund will have no obligation to withhold under RE 10C because the obligation exists only to the extent that RWT has not already been withheld. Agreement to transfer withholding obligations: outsourcing or passing the withholding obligation The purpose of sections RE 10C(4) and RE 10C(5) is to provide a custodial institution with the ability to outsource or transfer their withholding obligations. This allows custodial institutions to determine how the obligation will be performed; for example, they may make use of a shared services centre or a service provider. Under section RE 10C(4), a custodian that is required to withhold RWT may, before the date on which the payment is received by the institution, enter into an agreement with another person for that person to undertake the withholding obligation. The term “another person” is deliberately wide. This allows the custodian to outsource their withholding obligation to another entity that may not meet the stringent “custodial institution” definition (and hence be subject to the same level of regulatory oversight). In this circumstance, the legal liability for failure to withhold remains with the custodial institution. 39 An entity that has RWT exempt status will not have RWT withheld from payments it receives. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 97 NEW LEGISLATION Section RE 10C(5) allows a custodian that is paying to an “end investor” to enter into an agreement with another custodial institution for that custodial institution to take on the withholding obligation. In this circumstance, the withholding obligation passes to that institution which agrees to undertake the obligation and the obligation on the first custodian is discharged. The transfer of liability reflects the fact that “custodial institutions” may step into each other’s shoes for the purposes of meeting the withholding obligation. Withholding obligations of custodial institutions in respect of non-resident passive income Section RF 4 places withholding obligations on “agents and others” that receive a payment of non-resident passive income on behalf of another person, if some or all the amount of tax has not been withheld. This section has now been amended to include custodial institutions. Example 43 Ben, a US tax resident, is looking to invest some money into New Zealand equities. Ben invests $50,000 via a managed fund which invests into a diversified portfolio of New Zealand equities. The fund invests Ben’s money via a New Zealand custodian (NZ custodian). A portion of Ben’s $50,000 is invested into Kyle Raymond Industries (KRI), a company on the New Zealand stock exchange. When KRI pays a dividend, the gross income will pass in turn to the sub-custodian and NZ custodian, following their RWT exempt status. When New Zealand custodian pays the income to the managed fund, the nature of the income changes from resident to non-resident passive income: it is clear that the income has a New Zealand source and has been derived by a non-resident. At this point, as tax has not been withheld, the New Zealand custodian must deduct NRWT and pay the withheld tax to Inland Revenue. Agreement to transfer withholding obligations: outsourcing or passing the withholding obligation In line with the provisions for transferring an RWT obligation, section RF 4 has also been amended to allow a custodial institution that has an obligation to withhold NRWT to outsource or pass on that obligation. Where the obligation is outsourced, liability for any default remains with the institution. Where the obligation is passed by agreement to another custodian, the first institution discharges its liability for withholding. Aggregate level withholding and reporting Many global custodians will invest on behalf of a large number of investors. A new provision has been added to allow a custodian that is undertaking withholding to supply aggregated information when an end investor is a non-resident custodial institution. Section 25MB(6)(a) allows for the specific information required in schedule 6 in respect of various types of income to be provided in aggregate form where the end investor is a non-resident custodial institution. The example below demonstrates aggregate reporting and tax withholding. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 98 NEW LEGISLATION Example 44 Australasian Custodial Services (ACS) is a foreign custodian that operates out of Australia and specialises in investing in Australasian companies for its clients. Fifty investors comprised of individuals from the United Kingdom, China and Italy (countries that have a double taxation treaty with New Zealand) have all invested via ACS into KRI. Another fifty individual investors from Hungary, Pakistan and Greece (countries which do not have a double taxation treaty with New Zealand) have also invested into ACS for the purposes of investing into KRI. ACS has advised New Zealand custodian of the withholding rates for each pool of investors (treaty rates and non-treaty rates). When KRI pays a dividend, NZ custodian will withhold NRWT on the proportion of income payable to each pool of investors in accordance with the rates advised by ACS. Reporting obligations of custodial institutions Under the Investment Act, the original payer of investment income could not pass the reporting obligation on to a custodian, although in practice, the custodial institution, not the original payer, has access to the individual investor’s details. In line with the rules for withholding tax, the reporting rules have been clarified. Section 25B New subsection 25B(4) clarifies that a custodial institution that pays on or transfers an amount of investment income to an end investor is treated as a payer. Section 25E Section 25E sets out who must provide investment income information to the Commissioner. A custodial institution that pays on or transfers an amount of investment income to an end investor is required to report investment income information. By their nature, custodial institutions can be both a payer (in that they pay on or transfer income) and a payee. New section 25E(3) recognises this dual role. This means that a payer is required to report in respect of the investment income they have paid to the custodian. It is noted that this reporting will be much more limited in nature. Ultimately the custodial institution who is paying the end investor will be reporting in respect of the beneficial owners of the investment. Example 45 Sarah, a New Zealand tax resident, invests $10,000 via a mutual fund (custodian) into Savoury. When Savoury pays a $500 dividend, it will be required to report investment income information to the Commissioner in respect of the custodian (the payee). When the custodian pays the dividend to Sarah, it will undertake reporting in respect of Sarah as the end investor. The example above demonstrates that, because a custodial institution has sight of the underlying investors, they are often best suited to undertake reporting. If the payer was required to report in respect of the end investors, it would need to look through the custodian or have the custodian provide them with this information. A transfer of this information poses both confidentiality concerns and an administrative burden. Section 25MB New section 25MB prescribes the way in which reporting on investment income will be undertaken by a custodian that pays an end investor. It is similar to the rules prescribed for the purposes of withholding RWT and NRWT. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 99 NEW LEGISLATION When section 25MB applies Section 25MB sets out when a custodial institution will have an obligation to report investment income and also makes provision for the custodial institution to transfer that withholding obligation. Section 25MB will apply to a custodial institution that: • • receives a payment of investment income; and • • pays or transfers the amount to an end investor. Unlike section RE 10C which sets out when a custodial institution will have a withholding obligation for RWT, there is no requirement in section 25MB for the custodian to be RWT exempt. This is because section 25MB applies to the reporting of investment income information generally (that is, it does not matter whether the custodial institution receives gross or net income). Providing investment income information Under new section 25MB(3), a custodial institution that pays an amount of investment income to an “end investor” (as defined) must provide the information required under section 25E to the Commissioner. Example 46 A large number of individual investors invest their money into a managed fund (custodian), who then invests their money into Savoury Mints. In total, these investors invest $1000,000 into Savoury Mints. Savoury Mints pays a dividend of $20,000 and will undertake a simple line of reporting in respect of the custodian in accordance with the requirements in table 1 of Schedule 6 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. For illustrative purposes, an example including some of the fields that Savoury Mints would report is set out below: 40 RowItems 1The name of the payer: Savoury Mints ltd 2The tax file number of the payer: 123456 3The contact address of the payer: 1 Law Lane, Wellington NZ 4The name of the investor: Managed fund 5The tax file number of the investor, if held by the payer: 888888 6The contact address of the investor: 4 Potato Terrace, Auckland, NZ. 7The date of birth of the investor, if held by the payer: N/A 8The amount and type of income of the investor for the period: $20,000 dividend income. By contrast, when custodian undertakes its reporting in respect of its investors, it will have multiple lines to report in respect of every individual investor. Agreement to transfer reporting obligations: outsourcing or passing the obligations As with the obligation to withhold RWT or NRWT, there may be some circumstances where the custodian makes other arrangements for reporting. As is the case with the withholding rules, where the obligation is outsourced to another person, the custodial institution remains liable in the event of a default. In contrast, where the custodial institution enters into an agreement with another custodial institution, the reporting obligation passes to that institution and the obligation on the custodian that is paying to the end investor to report is discharged. 40 T here are more reporting fields than this as required by schedule 6 but these have not been included here as this is for illustrative purposes only. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 100 NEW LEGISLATION Limited information New section 25MB(6)(b) provides a reporting relaxation for custodial institutions in respect of lines 9 (in so far as it relates to approved issuer levy (AIL)), 17 and 20 of schedule 6 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Custodial institutions are only required to provide this information to the extent that it is held by the institution. Lines 9, 17 and 20 are as follows: RowItems 9The tax withheld on behalf of, or approved issuer levy paid in relation to, the investor for the period 17The number of shares for which the dividend is declared, or in the case of a dividend that is a bonus issue, the number of shares included in the bonus issue 20If the dividend is paid in Australian currency by an Australian ICA company, the exchange rate between the NZ dollar and the Australian dollar that was used to calculate the imputation ratio The purpose of these relaxations is to strike a balance between the information required by the Commissioner vis-à-vis the information that is available to custodians and costs that custodians may incur in obtaining this information. Remedial amendment A remedial amendment has been made to allow reporting and withholding using the foreign exchange rate on the transaction date. This amendment applies to both custodial institutions and other payers of investment income. Allowing reporting and withholding using the foreign exchange rate on the transaction date Section RE 4(7) provides the rules for converting an amount of foreign currency withheld for RWT to be paid to the Commissioner. An additional option has been added to the sub-section to allow RWT to be converted to New Zealand currency at the exchange rate on the date on which the payment of income is received by the investor. This amendment is intended to provide greater flexibility to the payers of investment income. It is expected that in most cases, using an exchange rate for the date on which the payment of the income is received will allow for the amount of investment income received by the investor and the amount of tax received by Inland Revenue to be more closely aligned. Example 47 Tūké Ares is a New Zealand tax resident whose marginal rate of tax is 33%. Tūké invests $1,000 via Squash Investments Ltd (Squash), a custodian operating out of New Zealand, into Oceanic Cotton Co (an ASX-listed company that is subject to the FIF exemption). Under the double tax agreement (DTA) that New Zealand has Australia, 15% withholding tax can be deducted from dividends paid. On 7 July Oceanic Cotton Co pays a dividend of $850 (net of foreign tax) in Australian dollars to Squash to be held on Tūké’s account. Squash then deducts another $180 for New Zealand tax due. As a result, Tūké has suffered 33% tax. Squash then uses the FX rate as at 7 July to advise Tūké of the net dividend he has received and pay him accordingly. The $670 net dividend in AUD works out to be $703.50 in NZD ($1 AUD is $1.05 NZD). Reporting using the exchange rate on the first working day of the month after the month in the day RWT was withheld Prior to this amendment, Squash was required to use the exchange rate on 1 August, when $1 AUD is $1.10 NZD. Using this method, the gross dividend reported to Inland Revenue is $1,100 and the net dividend is $737. These amounts are recorded in Tūké’s prepopulated account for the tax year. This means that, although Tūké has received a net dividend of $703.50 from his investment, he is liable for $737 for tax purposes. Reporting using the exchange rate on the date on which the income is received Using this method, when Squash used the FX rate on 7 July to advise Tūké of his dividend and make payment to him, the corresponding amount would also be reported to Inland Revenue and reflected in Tūké’s pre-populated account accordingly. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 101 NEW LEGISLATION INFORMATION SHARING PROVISION BETWEEN INLAND REVENUE AND THE SERIOUS FRAUD OFFICE TO BE REPLACED BY SHARING OF INFORMATION UNDER AN APPROVED INFORMATION SHARING AGREEMENT Schedule 7, Part A, clause 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 The legislative provision enabling Inland Revenue to share information with the Serious Fraud Office to assist the investigation of serious fraud, is repealed with effect from a date to be determined by Order in Council. The information sharing for serious fraud will now be allowed under the Serious Crime Approved Information Sharing Agreement (AISA) under Part 9A of the Privacy Act 1993. Repealing the current legislative provisions ensures that there is no overlap between legislation and regulations. Background Currently, there is a legislative provision under the Tax Administration Act 1994 (Schedule 7, Part A, clause 7) enabling the sharing of information between Inland Revenue and the Serious Fraud Office. The provision only enables sharing and use of the information for investigation or prosecution in relation to any suspected Inland Revenue offence. The Serious Crime AISA between Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Police has been extended to include information sharing with the Serious Fraud Office and the New Zealand Customs Service. Under the AISA, the Serious Fraud Office will be able to request information from Inland Revenue and Inland Revenue will be able to proactively share information in relation to any suspected offences that fit the definition of serious crime, not limited to Inland Revenue offences. The current legislation governing the information sharing between Inland Revenue and the Serious Fraud Office will need to be repealed with effect from the same date the AISA applies from, to avoid any overlap and conflict between legislation and regulation. Key features Clause 7 of Part A of Schedule 7 of the Tax Administration Act is repealed. Application date This legislative provision is repealed with effect from a future date to be determined by Order in Council. This date will align with the date the AISA comes into force. MEANING OF CHARITABLE OR OTHER PUBLIC BENEFIT GIFT Section LD 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007 The Income Tax Act 2007 has been amended to confirm that gifts made by way of debt forgiveness are not eligible for donation tax credits or gift deductions. Background On 17 December 2019 the Court of Appeal found in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Roberts that donation tax credits and gift deductions were available for gifts made by way of debt forgiveness. This was contrary to the long-standing policy that donation tax credits and gift deductions were only available for gifts paid in cash or by payment methods such as credit cards, electronic bank transfer, or cheque. Key features New section LD 3(1)(c)(ii) confirms that a gift made by forgiving some or all of a debt does not meet the definition of a “charitable or other public benefit gift”. As such, debt forgiveness does not qualify for either donation tax credits or gift deductions. Instead donation tax credits and gift deductions are only available for gifts paid in cash or by payment methods such as credit cards, electronic bank transfer, or cheque. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 102 NEW LEGISLATION Savings provision The amendment to the definition of charitable or other public benefit gift applies from the 2008–09 income year onwards. However, a savings provision applies to preserve positions taken no later than 16 December 2019. Therefore, a person is entitled to rely on the previous law if they filed a return or applied for a donation tax credit on or before 16 December 2019. Application date The section applies for the 2008–09 and later income years. A savings provision applies to positions taken on or before 16 December 2019. INCOME ATTRIBUTION RULE AND FOREIGN TAX CREDITS Sections GB 29 and LJ 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 The amendments to sections GB 29 and LJ 2 ensure that under the income attribution rules, if an associated entity of a working person pays tax overseas, a foreign tax credit (FTC) is available to the working person for the foreign tax paid. Background The income attribution rules apply when an individual (“the working person”) earns income from providing their own services to a buyer (“personal services income”) through an interposed entity (“the associated entity”) 41 that has one main source of such income. These rules disregard the entity and tax the working person directly, at the end of the income year, to prevent tax on income from the individual’s personal services being paid at the lower company rate (currently 28%) instead of at the working person’s higher marginal rate of tax (currently 33%). Under the income attribution rules: • • an amount attributed from the associated entity to the working person is income of the working person under section CE 8; and • • the associated entity is allowed a deduction for the amount attributed to the working person under section DC 8 so that the personal services income derived by the entity is not subject to double taxation. Under the policy framework for the availability of FTCs, if the associated entity pays tax overseas, either the entity or the working person should be entitled to an FTC for the foreign tax paid. However, due to the mechanics of the income attribution rules prior to these amendments, this was not possible. This is because an FTC is calculated in relation to a segment of net income of the person who paid the foreign tax. Because the associated entity is required to attribute all its personal services income to the working person at the end of each year, the entity never had net income on which it could claim an FTC, even though it paid tax on the income. Key features The following amendments to sections GB 29 and LJ 2 operate together to allow an FTC to the working person for the tax paid by the entity: • • New section GB 29(1B) clarifies that for the purposes of calculating the associated entity’s net income for the corresponding tax year in the application of section GB 29(1), section DC 8 is ignored; and • • New section LJ 2(8), (9) and (10) allows the working person an FTC for foreign income tax paid by the associated entity on an amount of attributed income. The amendments to section LJ 2 acknowledge that because the working person normally has control over the associated entity, they economically earn the income on which the foreign tax is paid, and so should enjoy the benefit of the FTC. Application date The amended sections GB 29 and LJ 2 apply for the 2008–09 and later income years. 41 ‘ Working person’, ‘associated entity’ and ‘personal services’ income are technical terms used in the legislative provisions for the income attribution rules. They are replicated in this TIB for precision. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 103 NEW LEGISLATION INCOME ATTRIBUTION RULE AND TREATMENT OF DIVIDENDS Section GB 27 of the Income Tax Act 2007 The amendment to section GB 27 ensures that under the income attribution rules, a dividend paid by a company that has been required to attribute income to an individual shareholder will be exempt. However, the exempt treatment applies only to the extent the dividend cannot be imputed and the company can show that the dividend has been paid out of income that has already been attributed to and taxed in the hands of the shareholder. Background The income attribution rules apply when an individual (“the working person”) earns income from providing their own services to a buyer (“personal services income”) through an interposed entity (“the associated entity”) 42 that has one main source of such income. The rules disregard the entity and tax the working person directly, at the end of the income year, to prevent tax on income from the individual’s personal services being paid at the lower company rate (currently 28%) instead of at the working person’s higher marginal rate of tax (currently 33%). The income attribution rules distinguish between two types of dividend paid by an associated entity to the working person: • • a dividend paid during the income year in which the income was derived and is to be attributed, or before the end of six months after the end of that income year (“in-year dividend”); and • • a dividend paid later than six months from the end of the income year in which the income was derived and attributed (“post-year dividend”). The distinction between the two types of dividend is intended to ensure that the working person is not subject to double taxation. This is achieved by: • • excluding an in-year dividend from the associated entity’s calculation of the amount of income to attribute to the working person; and • • treating as exempt income the amount of a dividend sourced from personal services income previously attributed to the working person (and taxed under the income attribution rules), but only to the extent the dividend is not fully imputed. However, the previous wording of section GB 27(4), which treats post-year dividends as exempt from tax, was not sufficiently clear that its application is limited to dividends paid out of income that has already been attributed. Key features • • Amended section GB 27(4) limits the exemption to post-year dividends. • • A requirement is included for the company to keep sufficient records to enable the Commissioner to verify the source of the dividend. Application dates The amended section GB 27 applies for the 2008–09 and later income years. However, there is a savings provision for tax positions taken between 1 April 2008 and the date on which the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill was introduced (27 June 2019) that relied on the previous law. The savings provision ensures those existing tax positions are not disturbed. 42 “ Working person”, “associated entity”, and “personal services” income are technical terms used in the legislative provisions for the income attribution rules. They are replicated in this TIB for precision. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 104 NEW LEGISLATION TAXATION (USE OF MONEY INTEREST RATES SETTING PROCESS) AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2020 Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates Setting Process) Regulation 1997 An Order in Council has been made to ensure that the Commissioner’s use of money interest paying rate cannot be set at a negative rate. The Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates Setting Process) Regulation 1997 outlines the methodology to be used when setting the use of money interest rates. This has been amended to specify that when setting the Commissioner’s paying rate, that it must be set at the higher of: • • the 90-day bank bill rate minus 100 basis points; or • • 0%. In effect, this prevents it being set at a negative rate. Background The use of money interest (UOMI) rates are a cornerstone of the tax compliance system in New Zealand. UOMI interest is paid by the taxpayer where tax has been underpaid and by the Commissioner where tax has been overpaid. The rate of UOMI payable for overpaid tax is referred to as the Commissioner’s paying rate. The legislated twin objectives of the UOMI provisions are to: • • fairly compensate the party (either the Crown or the taxpayer) that does not have the use of its money; and • • encourage taxpayers to pay the right amount of tax at the right time. The method used for setting the overpayment rate is outlined in the Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates Setting Process) Regulation 1997. This method uses the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) 90-day bank bill rate minus 100 basis points (1%). When the UOMI rates were last set, at the start of July this year, the UOMI for the Commissioner’s paying rate was reduced to 0.81%, as the 90-day bank bill rate was 1.81%. However, since then, the RBNZ has decreased the Official Cash Rate (OCR) further to 1.00. This has caused the 90-day bank bill rate to drop to 1.27% for the month of January 2019. Key features The measure prevents the Commissioner’s use of money interest paying rate being set at a negative rate. Application date The Order in Council came into force on 9 April 2020. TAX ADMINISTRATION (DIRECT CREDIT OF REFUNDS OF EXCESS FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND STUDENT LOAN PAYMENTS) ORDER 2020 Sections 184A and 184B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 An Order in Council has been made to include refunds for excess payments of financial support and student loan deductions as tax types refundable by direct credit under section 184A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The provisions in sections 184A and 184B require tax refunds to be paid via direct credit to a bank account nominated by the taxpayer and were introduced to benefit taxpayers by eliminating time delays associated with the postal system and costs related to cheques. Tax Administration (Direct Credit of Refunds of Excess Financial Support and Student Loan Payments) Order 2020 mandates the direct credit of refunds for excess payments of financial support and student loan deductions. Financial support means child support and domestic maintenance as defined in the Child Support Act 1991. Student loan deductions are salary or wage deductions as defined in section 4(1) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011. Section 184A still allows the Commissioner to provide an exemption when direct crediting would cause undue hardship or is impracticable. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 105 NEW LEGISLATION Background Compulsory direct crediting for income tax and gaming machine duty was implemented when their administration was moved to Inland Revenue’s new technology platform (START), which modernises and improves information flows, and enables more online self-service and automated processes. The administration of financial support and student loan deductions are to be moved to START in the next phase of Inland Revenue’s business transformation project, planned for April 2020. Whilst the intent was that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue would eventually be required to direct credit all refunds of excess tax paid, the progressive implementation for various tax types through Orders in Council was legislated for to allow Inland Revenue the necessary flexibility to choose the optimal dates to implement direct crediting of refunds for each tax type. Application date The Order in Council came into force on 9 April 2020. KĀINGA ORA–HOMES AND COMMUNITIES CONSEQUENTIALS Schedule 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Various references in the Income Tax Act 2007 have been updated to reflect the establishment of Kāinga Ora–Homes and Communities. Background The Kāinga Ora–Homes and Communities Act 2019 was enacted in September 2019. It established, from 1 October 2019, the Crown entity, Kāinga Ora–Homes and Communities. This new entity took over many of the functions of the former Housing New Zealand Corporation, plus several additional functions. As a result of this development, a range of references in the Income Tax Act to Housing New Zealand Corporation have been updated to now instead refer to Kāinga Ora–Homes and Communities. Application date The amendment applies from 1 October 2019. MAINTENANCE AMENDMENTS Summary of amendments The amendments reflect minor technical maintenance items arising from both the rewrite of income tax legislation and subsequent changes. Application dates Commencement dates for each proposed amendment are stated in table 7.

LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS Determination G31: NZX Milk Price Futures Contracts: an expected value approach 1 Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) When to use this determination 1. This determination provides the method that must be used by a Farmer who enters into an NZX MKP Milk Price Futures Contract (MKP Futures Contract) to calculate the income derived and the expenditure incurred over the term of that contract. 2. T his determination applies to a Farmer who: a. e nters into a MKP Futures Contract for the sole purpose of Hedging the price received for all or part of their anticipated milk solids production; and b. d oes not use IFRSs to prepare financial statements and to report for financial arrangements under the financial arrangements rules in the Act. 3. A F armer to whom this determination applies must use this determination for MKP Futures Contracts they enter into on or after 1 April 2020. What is an MKP Futures Contract? 4. An MKP Futures Contract is a cash-settled futures contract traded on the NZX Derivatives Market. It is a financial arrangement under the Act. 5. T he underlying asset of an MKP Futures Contract is the price for 6,000 kilograms of milk solids (one Lot) as set by reference to the Farmgate Milk Price. 6. A Farmer initiating a price hedge against all or part of their reasonably anticipated milk production for a Season will sell (short) one MKP Futures Contract for every 6,000 kilograms of anticipated milk solids (kg MS) that the Farmer wishes to hedge for that Season. 7. Each MKP Futures Contract is identified by a Contract Month, as specified in the Expiry Calendar. The month is September in the year of expiration. The contract may have a term of up to 5 years during which it may be traded before expiring. The Expiry Calendar identifies the significant dates corresponding to each Contract Month. For example, the Expiry Calendar for the September 2021 Contract Month, provides as follows: • • the first Trading Day was 17 September 2018 • • the Last Trading Day is 9 September 2021 • • the Expiry Date is 30 September 2021 • • the Settlement Day is 1 October 2021 8. A F armer enters into an MKP Futures Contract by placing an order, through a Broker, to buy or sell a contract. The Farmer will be required to pay an Initial Margin, as collateral for their obligations under the contract. The Initial Margin will be periodically recalculated and will typically reduce over time. The Farmer will also generally pay a fee to the Broker, which is not part of the Initial Margin. 9. D ue to the movement in the daily Closing Price over the term of an MKP Futures Contract, the parties to an MKP Futures Contract may be required to pay, or may receive, Variation Margin. • • The NZX clearing house, CHO, at the close of each business day during the term of an MKP Futures Contract calculates the Daily Settlement Price for the contract. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 108 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS • • CHO uses the Daily Settlement Price to calculate the daily Variation Margin for the contract. The Variation Margin is the difference between the Daily Settlement Price of a Lot at the close of the day of calculation and the Daily Settlement Price of a Lot at the close of the business day immediately prior to the day of calculation. • • Upon the calculation of the Variation Margin, CHO attributes the daily profit and loss amounts, with any profit an amount payable by CHO to a Clearing Participant and with any loss an amount payable by a Clearing Participant to CHO. • • The daily profit and loss amounts for all derivatives contracts in respect of which a Clearing Participant has an open position are netted between CHO and the Clearing Participant and a nett amount is settled between CHO and the Clearing Participant. • • Due to the complex of interrelated contracts relevant to an MKP Futures Contract any daily profit is an amount payable to the Farmer by their Broker and any daily loss is an amount payable by the Farmer to their Broker. 10. Farmers do not have direct access to CHO. They are required to place their trades with an NZX approved participant – a Broker. Where the Broker is a Clearing Participant the Broker clears the trades with CHO otherwise the Broker uses a Clearing Participant to clear the trades. A Broker may charge a Farmer an amount additional to the amount of Initial Margin or Variation Margin calculated by CHO. 11. The specific terms and administrative procedures that apply to and regulate MKP Futures Contracts are set out in the Contract Terms. 12. The rights and obligations relevant to an MKP Futures Contract are set out in a complex of interrelated contracts that create back-to back rights and obligations in relation to Initial Margin and Variation Margin such that a Farmer, as principal, has: • • an obligation to pay Initial Margin at the commencement of an MKP Futures contract; and • • an obligation to pay and the right to receive Variation Margin during the term of an MKP Futures Contract. Expected value approach 13. This determination applies an expected value approach to calculate the income derived or expenditure incurred by a Farmer under an MKP Futures Contract over the term of the contract. The income or expenditure over the term of an MKP Futures Contract is the total of the expected component and the unexpected component. 14. The expected component is calculated at the date the Farmer enters into an MKP Futures Contract and the amount is spread over the term of the contract. However, because the Trade Price will match the Forward Rate, and the Initial Margin will be offset by a matching amount at Maturity, there will be no expected component to spread. 15. The Initial Margin and any changes in that Initial Margin are not recognised until the income year of Maturity under a base price adjustment calculation. 16. The unexpected component is updated at the end of each income year, other than the income year the base price adjustment is calculated, to reflect the profit or loss realised through payment of the Variation Margin. This change in the unexpected component, through the receipt or payment of Variation Margin since the previous income year is income or expenditure in the income year it is calculated. 17. The final unexpected component is recognised when a base price adjustment is required to be calculated on the Maturity of the MKP Futures Contract. 18. The base price adjustment is income for the Farmer if it is a positive amount and is expenditure for the Farmer if it is a negative amount. The amount is allocated to the Farmer’s income year in which the calculation is required to be made. 2 Reference This determination is made under section 90AC(1)(d) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 3 Scope 1. This determination applies to the tax treatment of an MKP Futures Contract that is entered into by a Farmer, on or after 1 April 2020, for the sole purpose of Hedging if the Farmer does not use IFRSs to prepare financial statements and to report for financial arrangements under the financial arrangements rules in the Act. 2. U nder section 90AC(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, this determination is binding on a Farmer described in clause 3.1 who is subject to the financial arrangements rules in the Act and is required, under section EW 12 of the Act, to use a spreading method or is a cash basis person who has chosen, under section EW 61 of the Act, to apply a spreading method. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 109 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS This determination does not apply to a Farmer who is a cash basis person under section EW 13(3) of the Act unless they have elected to apply a spreading method under section EW 61 of the Act. 3. This determination applies only to a Farmer who is a person resident in New Zealand under section YD 2 or YD 3 of the Act. 4. T his determination does not apply to an MKP Futures Contract that is part of a wider financial arrangement. 5. This determination applies only to an MKP Futures Contract if the period between the first Trading Day and the Last Trading Day for the contract is 5 years or less. 6. F or the avoidance of doubt, this determination does not apply to any other derivative products trading on the NZX Derivatives Market or another market. In respect of the NZX dairy derivatives market as at the date of this determination, these other derivative contracts are entitled WMP Futures, WMP Options, SMP Futures, SMP Options, AMF Futures, BTR Futures and MKP Options. 4 Principle 1. An MKP Futures Contract is a financial arrangement under section EW 3(2) of the Act. 2. This determination applies an expected value approach to calculate the income derived or expenditure incurred by a Farmer under an MKP Futures Contract. 3. U nder this approach: • • The gross income derived or expenditure incurred by a Farmer under an MKP Futures Contract, over the term of the contract, is the total of the expected component and the unexpected component. • • The amount of the expected component: –Is determined at the date a Farmer enters into an MKP Futures Contract and spread with an amount allocated to each income year over the term of the contract except for the income year in which the Farmer is required to calculate a base price adjustment. –W ill, however, be zero. The Trade Price for the contract is the same as the Forward Rate for the contract, and the Initial Margin will be offset by a matching amount over the term of the contract. • • The unexpected component at the end of each income year is the total amount paid to, or received by, the Farmer as a Variation Margin for an MKP Futures Contract at the end of the last day of the current income year minus any amount paid or received in all previous income years. • • The final unexpected component is the difference between the Trade Price of the MKP Futures Contract and the Final Farmgate Milk Price for the Farmgate Milk Price Season minus any Variation Margins paid or received and returned in all previous income years and is recognised by performing a base price adjustment, under section EW 31 of the Act, on the Maturity of the MKP Futures Contract or when a base price adjustment is otherwise required to be calculated under section EW 29 of the Act. If the result of the base price adjustment is: –Positive it is, under section EW 31(3) of the Act, income of the Farmer derived in the income year for which the calculation is made. –N egative it is, under section EW 31(4) of the Act, expenditure of the Farmer incurred in the income year for which the calculation is made. 5 Interpretation In this determination (and in the explanation to this determination) – Act means the Income Tax Act 2007.

The gross income derived or expenditure incurred by a Farmer under an MKP Futures Contract over the term of the contract is the total of the expected component and the unexpected component. Determination of expected component 2. The amount of the expected component is determined and must be calculated as at the date in the income year a Farmer enters into an MKP Futures Contract. 3. T he expected component is the difference between the Forward Rate and the Contract Rate. 4. T here will be no expected component. The Trade Price and the Forward Rate are the same and the Initial Margin will be offset by a matching amount at Maturity. Spreading of expected component 5. As there is no expected component under an MKP Futures Contract there will be no amount to spread in the income years during the term of the contract. Unexpected component 6. The payment or receipt of a Variation Margin by or to the Farmer is an unexpected component. The total Variation Margin, less any amount returned in previous income years, is required to be returned as income or allowed to be deducted as expenditure at the end of each income year, or other period that the Farmer is required to file an income tax return. 7. The final unexpected component is recognised by performing a base price adjustment, under section EW 31 of the Act, on the Maturity of the MKP Futures Contract or when a base price adjustment is otherwise required to be calculated under section EW 29 of the Act. • • A positive base price adjustment is, under section EW 31(3) of the Act, income of the Farmer derived in the income year for which the calculation is made. • • A negative base price adjustment is, under section EW 31(4) of the Act, expenditure of the Farmer incurred in the income year for which the calculation is made. 8. Where an MKP Futures Contract is held to the Expiry Day and settled on its Settlement Day, the unexpected component will be the difference between the Contract Rate and the Final Farmgate Milk Price, on a per Lot basis minus any Variation Margin required to be returned as an unexpected component in previous income years. • • Any difference between the Contract Rate and the Final Farmgate Milk Price will be the Settlement Amount. • • The unexpected component will be the Settlement Amount minus any Variation Margin required to be returned as an unexpected component in previous income years, on a per Lot basis. This will be the amount of the base price adjustment calculation. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 112 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS 9. Where an MKP Futures Contract is Closed Out prior to the last Trading Day for the contract, the unexpected component will be the difference between the Contract Rate and the Closeout Price minus any Variation Margin required to be returned as an unexpected component in previous income years, on a per Lot basis. This will be the amount of the base price adjustment calculation. • • Any difference between the Contract Rate and the Closeout Price will be the Settlement Amount. • • The unexpected component will be Settlement Amount minus any Variation Margin required to be returned as an unexpected component and will be the amount of the base price adjustment calculation. 10. The base price adjustment formula from section EW 31(5) of the Act is as follows: consideration − income + expenditure + amount remitted Where, for each MKP Futures Contract: • • consideration includes: –t he Closeout Price minus the Contract Rate multiplied by 6,000 kg MS; and –the total of all Initial Margin paid or received • • income includes Variation Margin returned as an unexpected component in previous years • • expenditure includes Variation Margin deducted as an expected component in previous years 7 Examples In the following examples: • • a short contract refers to a futures contract under which the Settlement Amount received increases when the Final Farmgate Milk Price decreases, and decreases when the Final Farmgate Milk Price increases; and • • a long contract refers to a futures contract under which the Settlement Amount received increases when the Final Farmgate Milk Price increases, and decreases when the Final Farmgate Milk Price decreases. A farmer wanting to hedge the milk price risk of their anticipated production would enter into a short contract. Example A: Entering into an MKP futures contract for hedging On 1 June 2020, a farmer enters into 10 MKP Futures Contracts (that is, contracts hedging the prices of 10 Lots), each with a Contract Month of September 2021. As the farmer wants to hedge the milk price risk of their anticipated production, they enter into short contracts at a Contract Rate of $7.00 (that is, contracts for 60,000 kilograms of milk solids (kg MS) at $7.00 per kilogram). On the date on which the contracts are entered into, the Forecast Farmgate Milk Price for the 2021 Farmgate Milk Price Season is $6.75 per kg MS. The farmer must calculate the expected component for each contract at the date on which the contract is entered into. There is no difference between the prices because the Contract Rate (which is also known as the Trade Price) of $7.00 per kg MS is the same as the Forward Price of the contracts. The expected component is therefore zero and there is nothing to spread over the term of the contract. At the end of the farmer’s 2020-21 income year, September 2021 MKP Futures Contracts have a Forward Rate of $7.45 and the farmer has paid a total Variation Margin of $2,700 per MKP Futures Contract. The farmer’s unexpected component is calculated as follows: • • Variation Margin per contract = ($7.00 × 6,000) – ($7.45 × 6,000) = ($2,700) • • Total unexpected component = -$2,700 × 10 = ($27,000) The farmer is allowed a deduction for income tax purposes of $27,000 in their 2020-21 income year. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 113 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS Example B: Settlement price lower than final farmgate milk price The same farmer in Example A holds the 10 short contracts until they mature in September 2021. The Final Farmgate Milk Price announced by Fonterra for the Farmgate Milk Price Season ending 31 May 2021 (falling in the 2021-22 income year) is $7.50 per kg MS. The farmer has incurred a total loss of $0.50 for each kilogram of milk solids for which the price is hedged under the 10 contracts. The total loss under the 10 contracts is $30,000: • • Total gain/(loss) = (($7.00 - $7.50) × (10 × 6,000)) = ($30,000) • • The financial loss incurred under the 10 contracts is offset by the $7.50 per kg MS paid to the farmer for the actual amount of milk solids supplied that is hedged by the 10 contracts. • • The net effect of the contracts is that the farmer derives total revenue of $420,000 in relation to 60,000 kg MS supplied. The farmer can be confident, that on 1 June 2020 when the contracts were entered into the farming operation will earn exactly 1 $420,000 in relation to 60,000 kilograms of the farm’s milk production. The farmer must calculate a base price adjustment for each contract because the contracts have matured and have been settled. The base price adjustment corresponds to the final unexpected component minus the unexpected component already required to be returned for each contract. • • Unexpected component per contract = (($7.00 × 6,000) – ($7.50 × 6,000)) – (-$2,700) = ($300) • • Total unexpected components = (-$300 × 10) = ($3,000) –($27,000) of unexpected components relating to the Variation Margins on the 10 contracts were paid and returned in the 2020-2021 income year • • Base price adjustment = consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted –BPA = -$30,000 – 0 + $27,000 + 0 = ($3,000) • • As the base price adjustment for the 10 contracts is negative, this amount is expenditure and is allowed as a deduction allocated to the farmer’s 2021-22 tax year. The farmer’s $30,000 loss on the 10 contracts is offset by the additional $30,000 of income that the farmer receives for supplying 60,000 of kg MS at the Final Farmgate Milk Price of $7.50 per kg MS. 1 The average farmer in this situation supplying to Fonterra would earn exactly this amount but any individual farmer may earn slightly more or less depending on other factors such as when in the season the milk was supplied or whether they were supplying to another milk producer. For simplicity the examples ignore these factors. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 114 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS Example C: Multi-year contracts On 1 June 2020, a farmer enters into 10 MKP Futures Contracts (that is, contracts hedging the prices of 10 Lots), each with a Contract Month of September 2022. As the farmer wants to hedge the milk price risk of their anticipated production, they enter into short contracts at a Contract Rate of $7.00 (that is, contracts for 60,000 kilograms of milk solids (kg MS) at $7.00 per kilogram). On the date on which the contract is entered into, the Forecast Farmgate Milk Price for the 2022 Farmgate Milk Price Season is $6.75 per kg MS. The farmer must calculate the expected component for each contract at the date on which the contract is entered into. There is no difference between the prices because the Contract Rate (which is also known as the Trade Price) of $7.00 per kg MS is the same as the Forward Price of the contracts. The expected component is therefore zero and there is nothing to spread over the term of the contract. At the end of the farmer’s 2020-21 income year September 2022 MKP Futures Contracts have a Forward Rate of $7.45 and the farmer has paid a total Variation Margin of $2,700 per MKP Futures Contract. The farmer’s unexpected component for the year is calculated as follows: • • Variation Margin per contract = ($7.00 × 6,000) – ($7.45 × 6,000) = ($2,700) • • Total unexpected component = -$2,700 × 10 = ($27,000) The farmer is allowed a deduction for income tax purposes of $27,000 in their 2020-21 income year. At the end of the farmer’s 2021-22 income year, September 2022 MKP Futures Contracts have a Forward Rate of $7.30 and the farmer has paid a total net Variation Margin of $1,800 per MKP Futures Contract over the two income years (including the $2,700 paid in the 2020-21 income year). The farmer’s unexpected component is calculated as follows: • • Variation Margin per contract = ($7.00 × 6,000) – ($7.30 × 6,000) = ($1,800) • • Total net unexpected component = -$1,800 × 10 = ($18,000) –Total unexpected component (Variation Margins) paid and returned in the 2020-2021 income year was ($27,000) • • 2021-22 tax effect of unexpected component = -$18,000 – (-$27,000) = $9,000 The farmer is required to return $9,000 of income in their 2021-22 income year. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 115 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS Example D: Held to maturity The farmer holds the 10 short contracts until they mature in September 2022. The Final Farmgate Milk Price announced by Fonterra for the Farmgate Milk Price Season ending 31 May 2022 (falling in the 2022-23 income year) is $7.35 per kg MS. The farmer has incurred a loss of $0.35 for each kilogram of milk solids for which the price is hedged under the 10 contracts. The total loss under the 10 contracts is $21,000: • • Total gain/(loss) = (($7.00 - $7.35) × (10 × 6,000)) = ($21,000) • • The financial loss incurred under the 10 contracts is offset by the $7.35 per kg MS paid to the farmer for the actual amount of milk solids supplied that is hedged by the 10 contracts. • • The net effect of the contracts is that the farmer derives total revenue of $420,000 in relation to 60,000 kg MS supplied. The farmer could be confident, that on 1 June 2020 when the contracts were entered into, that the farming operation will earn exactly $420,000 in relation to 60,000 kilograms of the farm’s milk production. The farmer must calculate a base price adjustment for each contract because the contracts have matured and have been settled. The base price adjustment corresponds to the final unexpected component minus the unexpected component already required to have been returned for each contract in the previous two income years. • • Unexpected component per contract = (($7.00 × 6,000) – ($7.35 × 6,000)) – -$2,700 - $900 = ($300) • • Total unexpected components = (-$300 × 10) = ($3,000) • • Base price adjustment = consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted –BPA = -$21,000 – $9,000 + $27,000 + 0 = ($3,000) • • As the base price adjustment is negative, this amount is expenditure and is allowed as a deduction allocated to the farmer’s 2022-23 tax year. The farmer’s $21,000 total loss on the 10 contracts is offset by the additional $21,000 of income that the farmer receives for supplying 60,000 of kg MS at the Final Farmgate Milk Price of $7.35 per kg MS. Example E: Partial closeout On 1 October 2020 a farmer enters into 35 MKP Futures Contracts, each with a Contract Month of September 2021, at a Contract Rate of $7.25 per kg MS. On 5 January 2021, the farmer reduces the hedged position by 10 contracts because they expect that production will be lower than initially expected when the hedge contracts were made. The 10 contracts are Closed Out at a price of $7.20 resulting in a gain of $0.05 per kg MS hedged under the contracts. • • The total gain from the 10 contracts Closed Out on 5 January 2021 is $3,000 –Total gain/(loss) = (($7.25 - $7.20) × (10 × 6,000)) = $3,000 The farmer must calculate a base price adjustment for each of the 10 contracts that have been Closed Out and settled early. The base price adjustment will correspond to the final unexpected component minus the unexpected component already required to be returned (which in this case is zero) for each contract. • • Unexpected component = (($7.25 × 6,000) – ($7.20 × 6,000)) - $0 = $300 per contract • • Total unexpected components = ($300 × 10) = $3,000 • • Base price adjustment = consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted –B PA = $3,000 – 0 + 0 + 0 = $3,000 • • As the base price adjustment is positive, this amount is financial arrangement income allocated to the farmer’s 2020-21 t a x year. The farmer will calculate the expected component for their remaining 25 MKP Futures Contracts at the end of their 2020-21 year and the unexpected component and base price adjustment for their 2021-22 year. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 116 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS Example F: Long term hedge On 15 July 2021, a farmer enters into 20 short MKP Futures Contracts, each with a Contract Month of September 2024, at a Contract Rate of $8.00 per Lot (that is, 6,000 kg MS at $8.00 per kilogram). On the date on which the contracts are entered into, there is no Forecast Farmgate Milk Price for the 2024 production season. Fonterra had published a Forecast Farmgate Milk Price of $7.75 per kg MS for the 2022-23 season only. The expected component for each contract is zero because the Trade Price of $8.00 per kg MS is the same as the Forward Price. The farmer is required to calculate the unexpected component for each of the 2021-22 to 2023-24 years using the same method as example C. The final unexpected component will not be known until the contracts mature in 2024 or are Closed Out early when a base price adjustment must be performed. This determination is signed by me on the 10th day of March 2020. Chris Gillion Policy Lead, Policy and Strategy Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 117 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS Determination FDR 2020/01 – A type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund for which a person may not use the fair dividend rate method (Vanguard Ethically Conscious Global Aggregate Bond Index Fund (Hedged) – NZD Hedged) Reference This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Technical Specialist, under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Discussion (which does not form part of the determination) Units in Vanguard Ethically Conscious Global Aggregate Bond Index Fund (Hedged) (“the Fund”), an Australian Managed Investment Scheme, are an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (“FIF”) for New Zealand resident investors. The Fund is structured as a multi-class Managed Investment Scheme. New Zealand resident investors are required to apply the FIF rules to determine their tax liability in respect of their investment in units in the Fund each year. The Fund invests in a portfolio of global fixed interest securities and other financial arrangements. The Fund has on issue a number of unit classes including a class of units denominated in New Zealand dollars (“NZD Hedged Class”) that provide holders of that class of units with an interest in the pool of investments held by the Fund. Foreign currency hedging arrangements are in place which effectively provide investors in the NZD Hedged Class with a New Zealand dollar denominated return on the financial arrangements held by the Fund. Section EX 46(10)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007 does not apply to prevent the use of the fair dividend rate (“FDR”) method but would apply if the NZD Hedged Class was the only class of shares on issue. The policy intention is that the FDR method of calculating FIF income should not be applied to investments that provide a New Zealand resident investor with a return similar to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment. It is appropriate for the Commissioner to take into account the whole of the arrangement in ascertaining whether an investment in a FIF provides the New Zealand-resident investor with a return akin to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment. On this basis, where a New Zealand resident invests in the NZD Hedged Class units issued by the Fund, I consider that it is appropriate for the investor holding that investment to be excluded from using the FDR method. Scope of determination This determination is issued on the basis of information provided to the Commissioner before the date of this determination and applies to an attributing interest in a FIF held by New Zealand resident investors in a non-resident issuer where: 1. T he non-resident issuer: –Is an Australian Managed Investment Scheme; –Is known at the date of this determination as Vanguard Ethically Conscious Global Aggregate Bond Index Fund (Hedged); and –Is operated with separate classes of units; and 2. T he attributing interest consists of the New Zealand dollar denominated class of units issued in the Vanguard Ethically Conscious Global Aggregate Bond Index Fund (Hedged) – NZ Hedged, a class of units that provides exposure solely to the Vanguard Ethically Conscious Global Aggregate Bond Index Fund (Hedged) that predominantly (i.e. 80% or more by value at a time in the income year) holds financial arrangements such as international fixed interest securities; and 3. The investment assets attributable to the New Zealand dollar denominated class of units are subject to currency hedging arrangements undertaken by the non-resident for the purpose of eliminating exchange rate risk for New Zealand investors on a highly effective basis. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 118 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS Interpretation In this determination unless the context otherwise requires: “Fair dividend rate method” means the fair dividend rate method under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007; “Financial arrangement” means financial arrangement under section EW 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007; “Foreign investment fund” means foreign investment fund under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007; “Non-resident” means a person that is not resident in New Zealand for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 2007. Determination An attributing interest in a FIF to which this determination applies is a type of attributing interest for which a person may not use the FDR method to calculate FIF income from the interest. Application date This determination applies for the 2020 income year and subsequent income years. However, under section 91AAO(3B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, this determination does not apply for a person and an income year beginning before the date of the determination unless the person chooses that the determination applies for the income year.

Howard Davis Group Leader (Tax Counsel Office) Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 120 BINDING RULINGS BR Prd 20/01: Vital Healthcare Property Trust This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Vital Healthcare Property Trust (VHPT). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of ss CD 43(26), CX 56C and FL 2. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the proposed separation of VHPT’s New Zealand and Australian real estate investments into separate holding vehicles in the following manner: • • New Zealand assets are held through a New Zealand Portfolio Investment Entity (PIE) structure. VHPT will establish a New Zealand unit trust (Vital NZ) for this purpose. • • Australian assets continue to be held indirectly by VHPT through underlying Australian-managed investment trusts. VHPT will migrate its tax residence to Australia and be renamed Vital Australia (Vital Aus). Vital Aus will be a managed investment scheme registered with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), and will qualify as an Australian-managed investment trust for Australian tax purposes. Units in Vital NZ and Vital Aus will be stapled together so they cannot be traded separately. The stapled units will be dual listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZX) and the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. Current structure 1. VHPT is a New Zealand property unit trust, specialising in investment in healthcare properties, including surgical and medical hospitals and health support and health care facilities. VHPT has been listed on the NZX since 1999. For New Zealand tax purposes, VHPT is “New Zealand resident” (as defined in s YA 1) and a PIE. VHPT elected to become a “listed PIE” (as defined in s YA 1) effective from 1 October 2007. 2. VHPT indirectly owns properties in New Zealand and Australia from which it derives rental income. VHPT’s New Zealand properties are held by Vital Healthcare Property Limited (VHPL), and its Australian properties are held through two Australian unit trusts (which are managed investment trusts for Australian tax purposes): Vital Healthcare Australian Property Trust (VHAPT) and Vital Healthcare Investment Trust (VHIT). 3. O ver time, a large proportion of VHPT's investment opportunities have been located in Australia, contributing to approximately 75 percent of VHPT’s assets being based in Australia and approximately 25 percent being based in New Zealand (as at 31 December 2019). However, only a small proportion (approximately 8 percent) of VHPT’s unitholders are Australian. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 121 BINDING RULINGS 4. The following diagram summarises how the structure operates. NZ properties Listed PIE VHPL Aus properties Aus properties Unitholders Colma\* \*Holds ~0.01% and 0.2% in VHAPT and VHIT respectively NZ Aus VHAPT VHPT VHIT Proposed structure – steps 5. The seven steps to implement the proposed restructure are as follows: • • Step 1: Vital NZ, after establishment as a New Zealand “unit trust” (as defined in s YA 1), will issue 100% of its units to VHPT. Vital NZ will be a managed investment scheme under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013, with a licensed manager and supervisor (being the existing VHPT manager and supervisor). Vital NZ will join the VHPT tax consolidated group. • • Step 2: VHPL will transfer the New Zealand properties to Vital NZ for market value consideration. The market value consideration will be satisfied by: –V ital NZ taking assignment of an existing bank loan from VHPL; and –Vital NZ issuing units to VHPL. • • Step 3: VHPL will transfer the Vital NZ units to VHPT in consideration for and repayment of an intercompany debt that VHPT has with VHPL. • • Step 4: VHPT will distribute all of its units in Vital NZ to unitholders on a pro-rata basis. No consideration will be payable by unitholders for the distribution. At the same time, units in Vital NZ and VHPT will be stapled together so that they must be traded together. Vital NZ units and VHPT (to be Vital Aus) units will appear as a single security, under a single ticker code, that can be traded on the NZX and on the ASX. • • Step 5: VHPL and Colma (which holds one unit in VHAPT and six of 3000 units in VHIT) will migrate to Australia by transferring their place of incorporation to Australia. All directorial and managerial functions of VHPL and Colma will also move from New Zealand to Australia. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 122 BINDING RULINGS • • Step 6: VHPT will appoint an Australian responsible entity and become an Australian registered managed investment scheme and managed investment trust (Vital Aus). VHPT will cease being “New Zealand resident” (as defined in s YA 1) at this time. • • Step 7: Vital NZ will list on the NZX and ASX. Vital Aus will remain listed on the NZX throughout the transaction and will list on the ASX. Vital NZ will then elect to be a “listed PIE” (as defined in s YA 1). Following the above steps, only Vital NZ will be a New Zealand tax resident. VHPL, Colma and VHPT (Vital Aus) will become Australian tax residents. 6. To implement the proposed structure, the VHPT trust deed will be amended to allow the transaction to take place and establish the stapled group. Broadly, the amendments fall into three categories: • • Distribution amendments: These amendments allow VHPT to make distributions of Vital NZ units to unitholders (the current VHPT trust deed contemplates distributions of only cash). • • Stapling amendments: These amendments are the addition of clauses to provide for the stapling of Vital NZ units and Vital Aus units and to facilitate the operation of the stapled group. • • Australian migration amendments: These amendments allow VHPT to migrate to Australia and become Vital Aus, and to make other changes that are consistent with it transitioning to an Australian-managed investment scheme registered with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). For clarity, Vital NZ will be a New Zealand managed investment scheme registered with the Financial Markets Authority under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (as VHPT is currently). 7. T he proposed restructure does not involve changing: • • VHPT's underlying property assets, which will be split between Vital NZ and Vital Aus; or • • a unitholder’s proportionate beneficial interests in those underlying assets. 8. F or example, a unitholder who owns 1 percent of all VHPT units on issue has a corresponding 1 percent proportionate beneficial interest in VHPT's assets. Following the Arrangement, the unitholder would have 1 percent of the Vital NZ units and 1 percent of the Vital Aus units, giving them a 1 percent proportionate beneficial interest in the assets of Vital NZ and Vital Aus, being the same assets owned by VHPT before the Arrangement.

The following diagram summarises how the structure will operate after implementation of the Arrangement: Units in Vital Aus and Vital NZ stapled NZ properties Unitholders Colma\* \*Holds ~0.01% and 0.2% in VHAPT and VHIT respectively Aus NZ Custodial entity VHPL Aus properties Aus properties Vital Aus VHAPTVHIT Vital NZ Condition stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following condition: a) V HPT is a “listed PIE” (as defined in s YA 1). It will maintain “listed PIE” status at the time of distributing the units in Vital NZ and until the time it loses that status by reason of migrating its tax residence (as per step 6 at \[5\]). How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: a) T he amount derived by each VHPT unitholder when VHPT distributes all its units in Vital NZ (as per step 4 at \[5\]) is excluded income under s CX 56C(1) if the unitholder: • • is “resident in New Zealand” (as defined in s YA 1); • • is a natural person or a trustee; and • • does not include the amount as income in a return of income for the income year. b) If any one (or more) of the three criteria listed in a) does not apply to the unitholder, the amount derived by the unitholder when VHPT distributes all its units in Vital NZ (as per step 4 at \[5\]) is excluded income under s CX 56C(2) to the extent to which the amount is more than the amount that is fully credited as described in s CD 43(26). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 124 BINDING RULINGS c) The distribution in money each VHPT unitholder is treated as being paid under s FL 2 on migration of VHPT’s tax residence (as per step 6 at \[5\]) is excluded income under s CX 56C(1) if the unitholder: • • is “resident in New Zealand” (as defined in s YA 1); • • is a natural person or a trustee; and • • does not include the amount as income in a return of income for the income year. d) If any one (or more) of the three criteria listed in c) does not apply to the unitholder, the distribution in money the VHPT unitholder is treated as being paid under s FL 2 on migration of VHPT’s tax residence (as per step 6 at \[5\]) is excluded income under s CX 56C(2) to the extent to which it is more than the amount that is fully credited as described in s CD 43(26). The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 26 February 2020 and ending on 30 September 2021.

We've given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. Supreme Court refuses leave to appeal in child support judicial review litigation Case P (SC120/2019) v CIR & W & AG \[2020\] NZSC 22 Decision date18 March 2020 Act(s)Child Support Act 1991 KeywordsOngoing daily care Summary The Supreme Court declined P’s application for leave to appeal to that Court about P’s entitlement to receive child support. The Supreme Court considered the decisions in the Courts below (on the application of the Child Support Act 1991 to the facts) were not in error and there was no risk of a miscarriage of justice. Impact The impact of this decision is that the decisions in both the High Court and the Court of appeal are considered correct by the Supreme Court. This decision also ends P’s judicial review challenge to the CIR’s decision. Facts P was a receiving carer for A. W was the liable parent and lived in Australia. A left P’s care to live with W in Australia in December 2017. A remained in W’s care until at least June 2018 when A returned to P’s care. The CIR determined that A had left P’s care and that P’s ongoing daily care had dropped to nil while A was living in Australia. Based on this decision, P’s entitlement to child support was reduced to nil. P took a judicial review case about this decision. P argued that, because the period A was in Australia was split over two child support years, the CIR had to treat the time as two separate periods in two different child support years. Using this approach P calculated her on-going daily care of A did not drop below 73% in either child support year. P argued her entitlement to receive child support remained unchanged. P was unsuccessful at both the High Court (\[P\] v CIR \[2019\] NZHC 98, \[2018\] NZFLR 956 (Palmer J) and the Court of Appeal (P (CA85/2019) v CIR \[2019\] NZCA 531, \[2019\] NZFLR 322 (Courtney, Duffy and Wylie JJ)). In essence the lower courts dismissed the judicial review on the basis that P did not have the on-going daily care of A for the period A was in the care of W in Australia. Both lower courts thought the CIR’s approach was consistent with the Child Support Act 1991 and was not unlawful. P sought leave to appeal to the Supreme Court. Issues Should the Supreme Court grant P leave to appeal to the Supreme Court to argue in favour of P’s interpretation of the operation of the Child Support Act? Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 May 2020 Inland Revenue Department 126 LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE NOTES Decision The Supreme Court declined to grant P leave to appeal. The Supreme Court concluded: \[9\] ... Although the application relates to the interpretation of a statute on a point not yet examined by this Court, Ms P’s arguments do not have sufficient prospects of success to warrant us granting leave to appeal. Nothing raised in her submissions suggest a risk that the Courts below erred in their application of the legislation in the particular circumstances of this case. There is therefore no risk of a miscarriage of justice. \[footnote omitted\] About this document Case summaries are brief notes of decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, Court of Appeal, Privy Council, and the Supreme Court.

The Court of Appeal upheld the finding of Peters J that the Commissioner’s NOR was filed in time and there was no deemed acceptance of the Trust’s NOPA. 25 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 5 June 2020 Inland Revenue Department 1 N E W L E G I S L AT I O N This section of the TIB covers new legislation, changes to legislation including general and remedial amendments, and Orders in Council. NEW LEGISLATION COVID-19 RESPONSE (TAXATION AND SOCIAL ASSISTANCE URGENT MEASURES) ACT 2020 DEPRECIATION DEDUCTIONS FOR NON-RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS (Sections DB 65, EE 31, EE 35, EE 37, EE 38, EE 60, EE 61, EE 64, EE 67, EZ 13, EZ 14 and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007) These amendments reinstate a positive depreciation rate for long-lived non-residential buildings from the beginning of the 2020–21 income year. Background The depreciation rate for long-lived buildings was set to zero from the beginning of the 2011–12 income year. Long-lived buildings have an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. Buildings with a shorter estimated useful life have continued to be depreciable. The adjusted tax value of these buildings remained in the owner’s tax accounts. There was a transitional rule for building owners who had not previously separated out items of fit-out from the building. This rule allowed deductions for a portion of the building’s value each year. New Zealand’s position of a zero-depreciation rate for almost all buildings is unusual internationally. International studies have generally found that buildings do depreciate. The Tax Working Group reviewed and recommended changes to these tax settings. The Government has accepted the Group’s recommendation to reinstate depreciation for industrial and commercial buildings. However, the Government did not support reinstating depreciation on residential buildings because the data shows these buildings have a slower rate of economic depreciation. Key features Depreciation deductions for non-residential buildings are allowed from the beginning of the 2020–21 income year. The amendments apply to non-residential buildings owned at the beginning of the 2020–21 income year or acquired after the beginning of that year. This includes capital improvements. New definitions of “non-residential building” and “residential building” have been added. The depreciation rate for a building with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more is 2% diminishing value or 1.5% straight line. Application date The amendments apply for the 2020–21 and later income years. Detailed analysis Setting a positive depreciation rate reinstates depreciation deductions for long-lived non-residential buildings from the beginning of the 2020–21 income year. While these buildings have always been depreciable property, they were subject to a zero percent depreciation rate. From the beginning of the 2020–21 income year the depreciation rate for long-lived non-residential buildings is either 2% diminishing value or 1.5% straight line. Opening tax book value The depreciation rate for long-lived buildings was set to zero from the beginning of the 2011–12 income year. The adjusted tax value of such buildings was effectively suspended at this point. Now a positive depreciation rate applies to long-lived non- residential buildings, owners of these assets can begin to claim depreciation deductions. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 5 June 2020 Inland Revenue Department 2 NEW LEGISLATION For buildings acquired after the end of the 2010–11 income year, the opening value for the 2020–21 income year is the: • • adjusted tax value at the end of the 2010–11 income year, less fit-out deductions taken under the section DB 65 transitional rule (if applicable); plus • • non-deductible capital expenditure incurred on that building from the end of the 2010–11 income year to the start of the 2020–21 income year. For buildings acquired after the end of the 2010–11 income year, the opening value for the 2020–21 income year is the: • • cost of the building; plus • • non-deductible capital expenditure incurred on the building from the time it was acquired until the beginning of the 2020–21 income year. Depreciation recovery If a building is sold, the amount of depreciation recovery income continues to be calculated taking into account total depreciation deductions taken before 2011–12 (if any). As a result of these amendments, the depreciation recovery calculation for non-residential buildings disposed of after the beginning of the 2020–21 income year will also need to account for depreciation deductions in the 2020–21 and future income years. Non-residential buildings Section YA 1 is amended. Two new definitions have been inserted and the definition of “building” has been repealed. A “non- residential building” is any building that is not a “residential building”. A “residential building” is defined as: • • a “dwelling” as defined in Section YA 1; and • • a building in which accommodation is ordinarily provided for periods of less than 28 days at a time if the building, together with other buildings on the same land, has less than four units intended for separate occupation. The definition of “dwelling” encompasses owner-occupied houses and apartments, and houses and apartments subject to residential tenancies. The second limb of the definition of residential building ensures there is certainty that the definition of “residential building” includes buildings such as a bach that the owner uses but also rents out on a short-term basis, and also buildings used exclusively for short-term accommodation provided by owners such as Airbnb properties. These may be within the definition of “dwelling”, but this amendment puts beyond doubt that those buildings remain subject to the zero depreciation rate. The less-than four units provision excludes larger commercial premises such as motels from being treated as residential buildings. Repeal of the 2010 transitional rule As a result of reinstating a positive depreciation rate for non-residential buildings, the transitional building fit-out rule introduced as part of the 2010 reforms is no longer required. Accordingly, section DB 65 has been repealed. As noted above, the adjusted book value of the building is required to be adjusted for past section DB 65 deductions. Special depreciation rate The ability to apply for and be granted a special depreciation rate from the Commissioner has been restored for non-residential buildings. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 5 June 2020 Inland Revenue Department 3 NEW LEGISLATION INCREASE IN THE PROVISIONAL TAX THRESHOLD (Sections RC 3, RC 4, RC 6, RC 9, RC 13, RC 14, RC 16, RM 12, and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007) This amendment permanently increases the residual income tax threshold for being required to pay provisional tax from $2,500 to $5,000. As a result, a number of taxpayers are no longer required to make provisional tax payments throughout the year. This will assist those businesses with cashflow issues during the COVID-19 outbreak and beyond. Background Section RC 3(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007 previously provided that a person whose residual income tax in an income year is more than $2,500 was required to pay provisional tax. This threshold is used several times throughout subpart RC and elsewhere, such as for dealing with: • • voluntary provisional tax payments; • • the standard uplift method; • • provisional tax instalments; and • • the GST ratio method. The threshold referred to in these sections, and others, has been changed in accordance with the implementation of this measure (with the exception of a terminating provision in section RZ 1). Provisional tax is paid in three equal instalments over an income year. The requirement to make these payments imposes compliance costs on taxpayers. It also has an impact on cashflow as provisional tax instalments comprise cash that a taxpayer is unable to use during the year before terminal tax is due. This measure removes around 95,000 taxpayers from the provisional tax regime. Key features This measure changes the threshold for paying provisional tax so that fewer taxpayers are required to pay provisional tax instalments throughout the year. For taxpayers with residual income tax of between $2,500 and $5,000, instead of paying provisional tax throughout the income year, they will now only have to pay by 7 February following the end of the income year. Example 1: Increase in the provisional tax threshold Jenny is a tour guide who provides tours of the Lord of the Rings filming location sites around Wellington through her company Jenstar Tours Limited (JTL). She gets the majority of her customers from tourist ships visiting Wellington. In the 2019–20 income year, JTL’s tax liability was $8,000, but because of the recent changes to restrict tourist ships in response to COVID-19, JTL’s tax liability in 2020–21 is expected to be half of that amount. The Government’s change to the provisional tax threshold from $2,500 to $5,000 means that JTL is not a provisional taxpayer for the 2020–21 income year. Instead of paying tax in instalments throughout the 2020–21 income year, JTL will not have to pay tax until 7 February 2022, which improves its cashflow during the year. Application date The amendment applies for the 2020–21 and later income years. INCREASE IN THE LOW-VALUE ASSET WRITE-OFF THRESHOLD (Section EE 38(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007) This amendment temporarily increases the low-value asset write-off threshold from $500 to $5,000 in the short term before decreasing this threshold to $1,000 on a permanent basis. This allows taxpayers to immediately deduct expenditure on assets that cost up to $5,000 (and subsequently $1,000) rather than depreciating them over the life of the asset. This will decrease the tax liabilities of taxpayers in the short term and therefore assist with cashflow including during the COVID-19 outbreak. It may also encourage continued investment by businesses in the short term. Background Since 2005, the threshold value in section EE 38(2)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2007 for low-value asset write-offs had been $500. Assets costing up to this threshold could be immediately expensed, which provides all of the tax benefit in the year the asset was purchased. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 5 June 2020 Inland Revenue Department 4 NEW LEGISLATION For example, capital expenditure on property that costs $2,000 exceeded the previous low-value asset write-off threshold and so was required to be depreciated over a number of years. Expenditure on an asset costing $300, however, could be immediately deducted so that all of the tax benefit was generated in the year of purchase, even if the asset lasts much longer than one year. Key features This measure increases the value of property that is eligible to be written off in the year of purchase from $500 to $5,000, before decreasing that threshold to $1,000. This means that expenditure on assets costing up to the new threshold can be deducted immediately, so that all of the tax benefit is claimed up front. This will provide increased cashflow in the short term. Example 2: Increase in the low-value asset write-off threshold Capes Comics Limited (Capes) is a comic store that sells comics and comic-related merchandise. The store’s owner, Clark, wants to expand by investing in two new display cabinets worth $4,600 in total. Clark believes that this will increase his sales of high-value action figures. However, with the COVID-19 restrictions, he is anxious about investing $4,600, especially given that he can only deduct the cost of the cabinets over time through tax depreciation (rather than immediately). The Government’s change to the low-value asset write-off threshold means that Capes can claim an immediate deduction for the cost of the cabinets. This allows Capes to reduce its tax paid this year by $1,288 (28% of $4,600), instead of that amount being spread over a number of years. Application dates The amendment to increase the low-value asset write-off threshold to $5,000 applies for property purchased on or after 17 March 2020. The amendment to subsequently lower this threshold to $1,000 will apply for property purchased on or after 17 March 2021. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDITS – BROADER ACCESS TO REFUNDS (Sections LA 5 and LZ 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007) The amendment to section LA 5 brings forward the application date of new broader refundability rules, so that these can apply from the first year of the R&D Tax Incentive scheme. Background COVID-19 has caused significant disruption to all businesses in New Zealand. There is a significant risk that this disruption could cause many R&D-performing businesses in New Zealand to reduce or stop their R&D. While ceasing R&D saves businesses money now, it means some New Zealanders will lose their jobs, fewer innovative products will be developed, and there will be a deeper and more protracted decline in economic activity. This weakens our economy’s ability to recover once the global economy has stabilised. The Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Act 2019 introduced an R&D Tax Incentive regime from the 2019–20 income year (“year 1”). The R&D Tax Incentive was developed under tight timeframes, so there was insufficient time to develop comprehensive refundability rules before the legislation was enacted. As a consequence, in year 1 of the Incentive, limited refundability rules (based on another R&D scheme, the R&D Tax Loss Credit) were put in place to provide refundable credits for a small portion of eligible R&D tax credit claimants (“year 1 limited refundability rules”). The Government reviewed the R&D Tax Incentive’s refundability rules in 2019 and developed some new, broader refundability rules. These new rules were put into place by the recently enacted Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act 2020, and were originally intended to apply from the 2020–21 income year (“the year 2 broader refundability rules”). To provide cash to businesses now and encourage them to continue with their R&D despite COVID-19, this amendment brings the application date of the year 2 broader refundability rules forward to the 2019–20 income year. This is intended to enable more businesses to access refundable R&D tax credits, and provide some businesses with larger refunds than they would have obtained under the year 1 limited refundability rules. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 5 June 2020 Inland Revenue Department 5 NEW LEGISLATION Key features The amendment to section LA 5 changes the rules for R&D tax credit refunds in the 2019–20 income year, to make refundable credits more accessible for businesses. It does this by bringing forward the application date of year 2 broader refundability rules to the 2019–20 income year (year 1 of the R&D Tax Incentive scheme). These rules would otherwise have applied from the 2020–21 income year (year 2 of the R&D Tax Incentive scheme). Prior to this amendment, limited refundability rules applied in the 2019–20 income year, which only allowed businesses who met certain prescriptive criteria to access refundable credits. A $255,000 cap also applied to limit the total amount of credits that could be refunded. The year 2 broader refundability rules, which now apply from the 2019–20 income year, remove the prescriptive refundability eligibility criteria and replace the $255,000 cap with a new refundability cap based on labour-related taxes. These new rules are aimed at enabling more businesses to access R&D tax credit refunds, and allowing more of these businesses to access greater amounts of refundable credits. The year 2 broader refundability rules now apply by default to all claimants in the 2019–20 income year. Businesses have the option of using the previous year 1 limited refundability rules if they prefer. When filing an R&D supplementary return, each business will be asked to confirm which set of refundability rules they intend to apply to their claim. From the 2020–21 income year onwards (year 2 of the R&D Tax Incentive scheme), all businesses are required to use the year 2 broader refundability rules. Detailed analysis The amendment brings forward the application date of the year 2 broader refundability rules introduced in the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act 2020. Instead of applying from the 2020–21 income year, these new rules will apply from the 2019–20 income year. The broader refundability rules (default option) The year 2 broader refundability rules now apply from the 2019–20 income year (sections LA 5(4B), (5B) and (5C)). They apply by default, unless a business chooses to apply the limited refundability rules in section LZ 14 (section LA 5 (5D)). Under these rules, a loss-making business (or a business with insufficient income tax to pay to offset its R&D tax credits against) can be eligible for R&D tax credit refunds provided it is eligible for the tax credit more generally. It can obtain R&D tax credit refunds up to a new labour-related tax cap. The cap is made up of any labour-related taxes (PAYE, ESCT, and FBT): • • paid by the business, and • • paid by companies the business is controlled by or which sit within the same wholly-owned group, if these companies have allocated amounts to the business for the purposes of the cap. No cap applies to refundable R&D tax credits paid to levy bodies, or derived from eligible expenditure on approved research providers. Transitional 2020–21 amount deleted This amendment deletes the “transitional 2020–21 amount” portion of the refundability cap formula (see section 101 of the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans and Remedial Matters) Act 2020). The “transitional 2020–21 amount” is no longer needed because businesses can apply the year 2 broader refundability rules if they provide a better outcome for them in the 2019–20 income year. Eligibility of tax-exempt entities for refundability The amendment to LA 5(4B) means that tax exempt entities that otherwise satisfy the R&D Tax Incentive’s general eligibility criteria may now be eligible for refundability in the 2019–20 income year. These entities and their associates were previously largely ineligible for refundability under the limited refundability rules. Note that from the 2020–21 income year, entities which receive income that is tax exempt under sections CW 38, 39, 40, 41, 42 and/or 55BA of the Income Tax Act 2007 will be ineligible for the R&D tax credit. Refer to the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans and Remedial Matters) Act 2020 for more information on this exclusion. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 5 June 2020 Inland Revenue Department 6 NEW LEGISLATION The limited refundability rules New section LZ 14 sets out the limited refundability rules, which businesses can choose to apply instead of the broader refundability rules if they prefer (section LA 5(5D)). A business can obtain R&D tax credit refunds under the limited refundability rules, provided it is a company and: • • is in a tax loss position, or has insufficient income tax liability to utilise all of its R&D tax credits in the 2019–20 income year; • • satisfies the R&D tax loss cash-out corporate eligibility and wage intensity criteria in sections MX 2 and MX 3; • • does not derive exempt income (other than certain exempt income from dividends), and is not associated with a person who derives exempt income; • • is not a listed company, and is not associated with a listed company; and • • does not have an outstanding tax liability. Only the first $255,000 of the business’s R&D tax credits is refundable, which is the equivalent of $1.7 million of eligible expenditure. Any remaining R&D tax credits may be carried forward to the 2020–21 income year if the entity is eligible for the Incentive that year and the shareholder continuity requirements in section LY 8 are met. Choosing between the year 1 and year 2 refundability rules Businesses may choose to use the limited refundability rules or the broader refundability rules in the 2019–20 income year, but they cannot use both. Only the broader refundability rules are available from the 2020–21 income year. Example 3: Applying the broader refundability rules Moppy’s Chicken Factory (“Moppy”) has brought forward tax losses from the 2018–19 income year. It claims R&D tax credits in the 2019–20 income year, but does not have enough income tax to pay to use all of its credits. Moppy determines that it will be able to receive more refundable R&D tax credits if it applies the broader refundability rules, because it has $500,000 of surplus R&D tax credits and has paid $500,000 of PAYE in the 2019–20 income year (so its refundability cap is $500,000). Moppy files its income tax and R&D supplementary returns soon after 31 March 2020. It advises Inland Revenue that it would like to apply the broader refundability rules. Inland Revenue processes Moppy’s claim and refunds Moppy $500,000 of R&D tax credits. USE OF MONEY INTEREST REMISSION (Section 183ABAB of the Tax Administration Act 1994) Use of money interest (UOMI) is charged when a taxpayer fails to make a payment of tax on time. This measure adds to existing legislative mechanisms that allow UOMI to be remitted. However, these pre-existing legislative mechanisms are not fit for purpose to respond to an event such as COVID-19. The amendment allows Inland Revenue to remit interest on a late payment if the taxpayer’s ability to make the payment on time was significantly adversely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. This would include both when a taxpayer is physically unable to make a tax payment on time and when a taxpayer’s financial capability to pay tax on time is adversely affected because of the economic nature of the COVID-19 outbreak. Background The purpose of UOMI is to encourage taxpayers to pay their tax on time and compensate the Government for the loss of use of money from taxpayers underpaying their tax. It applies to all tax types administered by Inland Revenue, including income tax and GST. UOMI also applies to underpayments of tax that are withheld at source, such as PAYE and RWT. UOMI also applies to Working for Families debt. In certain circumstances the Commissioner may remit UOMI on a late tax payment. For the remission of interest in response to emergency events, the pre-existing rules provided for an Order in Council process to allow the Commissioner to remit UOMI where a taxpayer is “physically prevented” from making a payment. However, the Commissioner could not remit interest for a taxpayer that was financially unable to make a payment on time because of the emergency event. The pre-existing rules around remitting UOMI in emergency events were directed at situations or events where public safety is of paramount concern because of the risk of injury or death, typically due to a natural disaster. This statutory framework was not fit for purpose to respond to the nature of the economic shock of COVID-19 where a taxpayer may be financially unable to pay their tax on time. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 5 June 2020 Inland Revenue Department 7 NEW LEGISLATION Key features Interest remission New section 183ABAB allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to remit use of money interest if a taxpayer’s ability to make a tax payment on time is significantly adversely affected by an outbreak of COVID-19. This includes both where a taxpayer has been physically unable to make a payment on time, for example, because they have been quarantined and do not have the ability to make the payment electronically while quarantined, and where a taxpayer’s financial capability to make a payment on time has been adversely affected because of the economic impacts of COVID-19. For interest to be remitted the taxpayer must ask for it to be remitted and the Commissioner must be satisfied that the taxpayer has asked for the relief as soon as practicable and made the payment of tax as soon as practicable. The interest would not be remitted until the core tax debt has been paid. Further guidance on how the Commissioner will determine if a taxpayer’s ability to make a payment on time has been significantly adversely affected by COVID-19 is available at ird.govt.nz/covid-19/manage-my-tax/penalties-and-interest Sunset provision The Commissioner’s ability to remit interest only applies for the 24 months following the enactment date of 25 March 2020. However, this period can be extended by an Order in Council made on the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue. This Order in Council would need to be made within the initial 24 months during which the Commissioner can remit interest. The extension to the time limit would expire after the period given by the order or 6 months after the order came into force if the order did not specify a time limit. However, the time limit could be extended further by subsequent Orders in Council so long as they are made before the date on which the preceding order would expire. In recommending the making of an Order in Council, the Minister of Revenue would need to be satisfied that the ability of taxpayers to pay tax on time is likely to continue to be significantly adversely affected by COVID-19 beyond the expiry of the time limit. Application dates The Commissioner’s ability to remit interest has applied since 25 March 2020. However, the Commissioner may remit interest that has accrued on tax payments due on or after 14 February 2020. Unless extended by Order in Council, the Commissioner’s ability to remit interest will expire after 24 March 2022. INFORMATION SHARING (Schedule 7, part C, clause 23B Tax Administration Act 1994) The amendment enables Inland Revenue to share taxpayer information with other government departments to assist the efficient and effective delivery of the Government’s COVID-19 response. Background Currently, tax legislation requires Inland Revenue staff to keep taxpayer information confidential unless a specific legislative exception authorises the disclosure. Current exceptions in the tax legislation enable Inland Revenue to share information with specific agencies. These existing exceptions will be used, where possible, to share information with other agencies to assist in the response to the COVID-19 outbreak. However, there may be situations where, as a result of the outbreak, it is desirable for Inland Revenue to share information with other agencies with which Inland Revenue does not have any existing arrangements or where the existing arrangements are not flexible enough to allow the required sharing to occur. A similar provision to this one applied during the Canterbury earthquake and allowed Inland Revenue to share information with other government agencies as part of the government’s response to the Earthquake. This amendment is modelled on that provision. Key features The amendment inserts a new clause 23B into schedule 7 of the Tax Administration Act to allow Inland Revenue to share information with other government agencies in order to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak. This provision is targeted, time limited, and only used when existing legislative provisions are not adequate to share information. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 5 June 2020 Inland Revenue Department 8 NEW LEGISLATION The other agencies Inland Revenue could share information about persons or entities with are government departments, the New Zealand Police, ACC, and Kāinga Ora – Homes and Communities. The information would only be shared for the purpose of enabling those agencies to provide assistance to individuals and businesses, to fulfil any obligation or function, or exercise any power in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The information shared would not be available for use in administering other assistance not related to COVID-19. The information that could be shared would be both individual and non-individual information and may include, but is not limited to, identifying information, contact and location information, financial information, and family information. The provision would also enable information to be shared to enable the government agency to undertake compliance activity related to that COVID-19 assistance. This provision will be used, for example, to share information with the Ministry of Social Development to assist in determining employers’ entitlement to the wage subsidy and in auditing claims to counter fraud. Currently, tax legislation requires those persons who have access to taxpayer information to keep that information confidential and not disclose or use it for a purpose other than that for which it was provided. This requirement would also apply to the information sharing to assist the response to the COVID-19 outbreak. As a safeguard, Inland Revenue retains a discretion as to whether to share information and sharing would only occur where the information is readily available, it is reasonable and practicable to share, and it is not undesirable to share the information. Application dates The amendment applies from the date of announcement of the change, being 17 March 2020. The amendment will apply for a period of two years only unless extended by an Order in Council. This would allow the Government to continue sharing information, if required, in response to COVID-19 after the two-year period. REMOVAL OF HOURS-TEST FROM THE IN-WORK TAX CREDIT (Sections MA 7, MD 9, MD 10 & YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007) The In-Work Tax Credit is an income-tested cash payment of $3,770 per year to working families with children (plus an additional $780 per child for 4th and subsequent children). This amendment will remove the requirement for recipient families to normally be working at least 20 hours per week as a sole parent or a combined 30 hours per week as a couple. Background Currently, families that work a fluctuating number of hours from week-to-week or are unable to increase their hours of work do not receive the In-Work Tax Credit for weeks that they do not work – 20 hours for sole parents or 30 hours for couples. The number of families working reduced hours, or an unpredictable and varying number of hours, will increase as New Zealand’s economy feels the impact of COVID-19. Application date The amendments apply from 1 July 2020. Detailed analysis The hours-test Recipients of the In-Work Tax Credit are currently required to normally be working at least 20 hours per week as a sole parent or a combined 30 hours per week as a couple. This can result in families losing their entitlement to the In-Work Tax Credit in weeks where their hours have been reduced or families with unpredictable and varying hours, such as shift workers and those with multiple jobs, only being eligible for the credit in some weeks. Removing the hours test will ensure families that have their hours worked affected by COVID-19 will continue to receive the In-Work Tax Credit if they do not go onto an income tested benefit or student allowance and are earning some employment income. Example 4 Janice is a sole parent who works two jobs and receives the In-Work Tax Credit. She is employed for 15 hours per week in one job, and 10 hours per week in another, working a combined 25 hours per week. Janice’s second employer ceases operations and she is now only working 15 hours per week for the foreseeable future. From 1 July 2020 onwards, Janice would continue to receive the In-Work Tax Credit despite her weekly hours of work being reduced below 20. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 5 June 2020 Inland Revenue Department 9 NEW LEGISLATION WORKING FOR FAMILIES TAX CREDITS ENTITLEMENT FOR EMERGENCY BENEFIT RECIPIENTS (Section MC 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007) The amendment allows people on a temporary visa who would not otherwise meet the Working for Families (WFF) residency criteria, to qualify for WFF, if the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) has granted them an emergency benefit. This ensures that people on a temporary visa who are granted an emergency benefit will qualify for the same WFF components as other beneficiaries. Background Prior to the amendment, emergency benefit recipients with dependent children and who are on a temporary visa, did not qualify for WFF tax credits. This was because they did not meet the residency criteria for WFF. The result was a difference in the financial support that these families could access, compared with other main benefit recipients with children. In general, to receive a main benefit (including an emergency benefit) a person must be a New Zealand citizen or permanent resident and have resided in New Zealand for at least two years since becoming a citizen or resident. However, MSD has discretion to grant an emergency benefit in other circumstances 1 when those residency criteria are not met. Existing WFF legislation did not contain any comparable discretion. The WFF residency requirements can be met by the child or the parent. The WFF residency requirements can be met by the child if: • • the child is ordinarily resident in New Zealand; and • • is present in New Zealand for the period of entitlement. The WFF residency requirements can be met by the parent if: • • the parent is ordinarily resident in New Zealand; and • • has been in New Zealand for 12 months continuously at any time. Those on a temporary visa are specifically excluded from the definition of New Zealand resident for WFF. This exclusion was intended to prevent short-term visitors from accessing WFF but not those in exceptional circumstances. The amendment ensures that families on a temporary visa who are granted an emergency benefit are able to access a comparable level of financial support to other recipients of main benefits. Key features If MSD grants an emergency benefit, to a person on a temporary visa, that person will qualify for the same WFF payment as other beneficiaries. That is, they could qualify for the family tax credit and Best Start, assuming they meet the other qualifying criteria. They will not qualify for the In-Work Tax Credit or minimum family tax credit because these payments are not available to a person receiving a main benefit. Application date The amendment applies from 1 April 2020. 1 These circumstances can include not being eligible for another benefit, that they are in hardship and unable to earn a sufficient livelihood. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 5 June 2020 Inland Revenue Department 10 NEW LEGISLATION GST ON COVID-19 RELATED SOCIAL ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS (Section 89 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985) The amendment provides that payments made by the Ministry of Social Development in relation to wages or other income, or leave taken, as a consequence of COVID-19, are not to be regarded as taxable grants and subsidies for the purposes of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Background The Goods and Services Tax (Grants and Subsidies) Amendment Order 2020 (2020/44) added two new COVID-19 related payments made by the Ministry of Social Development to the schedule of non-taxable grants and subsidies contained in the Goods and Services Tax (Grants and Subsidies) Order 1992. The purpose of this Order was to ensure that GST-registered businesses that received these payments from the Ministry of Social Development did not need to return GST on them. This Order came into force on 24 March 2020, and consequently did not apply in respect of payments made by the Ministry of Social Development before that date. New section 89 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 is intended to ensure that GST-registered businesses that received these payments from the Ministry of Social Development before 24 March 2020 do not need to return GST on them. Application date The amendment came into force on 25 March 2020, the date of enactment. The amendment applies retrospectively to payments made from 17 March 2020. WINTER ENERGY PAYMENT (Schedule 4, Part 8, Clause (1)(a), (b) and (c) of the Social Security Act 2018) This amendment reduced the rates of winter energy payment for 2021 and later years to $450 for single people with no dependent children (down from $900) and $700 for couples or single people with dependent children (down from $1,400). This restored the 2019 rates after a temporary doubling in the rates for 2020. Background In response to the economic impacts of COVID-19, the Government agreed that the annual rates of winter energy payments for 2020 would be $900 for single people with no dependent children, and $1,400 for couples or single people with dependent children. The increase is double the normal rate and was only intended to apply for the 2020 winter period (1 May to 1 October) when the impacts of COVID-19 are likely to be most pronounced. Key features The amendment ensures that the doubling of the winter energy payment rates for 2020 as part of the COVID-19 Recovery Package is only temporary. It reduces the rates back to their previous amounts of $450 and $700 for 2021 and later years. Application date The amendments to the winter energy payments rates come into force on 1 May 2021. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 5 June 2020 Inland Revenue Department 11 NEW LEGISLATION PARTICIPATING JURISDICTIONS FOR THE CRS APPLIED STANDARD Determination New Zealand’s list of participating jurisdictions for the purposes of the Common Reporting Standard (CRS rules) and requirements under Part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been amended with effect from the 1st of April 2020 as follows: Jurisdictions to be added BahrainBrunei DarussalamDominica GhanaMonacoSaint Lucia Full list of participating jurisdictions from 1 April 2020 Additions are highlighted in bold italics.

Reportable jurisdictions are relevant to the Common Reporting Standard (CRS rules) which was enacted in New Zealand in 2017 as part of New Zealand’s implementation of the G20/OECD Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters, or AEOI. Reportable jurisdictions are territories to which Inland Revenue (IRD) will provide certain information on non-residents that is reported to IRD by financial institutions in accordance with the CRS rules. Pursuant to section 226D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the Act), additions and deletions to the list must be made by Order in Council. The Tax Administration (Reportable Jurisdictions for the Application of CRS Standard) Amendment Regulations 2020 add the following six jurisdictions to New Zealand’s existing list of 90 reportable jurisdictions: Albania Ecuador Kazakhstan Maldives Oman Peru A full listing of reportable jurisdictions can be found on the IRD website and the Order in Council can be found at legislation.govt.nz Application date The additional six jurisdictions are reportable jurisdictions for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2019. Section 226D(2) of the Act allows for the retroactive application of these regulations. DOUBLE TAX AGREEMENTS (GUERNSEY) AMENDMENT ORDER 2020 DOUBLE TAX AGREEMENTS (SWITZERLAND) ORDER 2020 New Zealand’s Double Tax Agreement (DTA) with Switzerland and Tax Information Exchange Agreement (TIEA) with Guernsey have been updated. These updates are part of a wider programme to include provisions designed to prevent abuse and improve dispute resolution across New Zealand’s wider double taxation agreement network. These provisions arose from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) initiative. New Zealand ratified the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (the MLI) in 2018. The majority of New Zealand’s double taxation agreements were updated under the MLI’s mechanism. However, the Switzerland DTA and the Guernsey TIEA fell outside of the scope of the MLI. New Zealand has therefore signed Protocols amending the DTA with Switzerland and the TIEA with Guernsey. The Protocols relate solely to BEPS minimum standards and best practice provisions and update these agreements bilaterally. They include model treaty provisions to prevent tax treaty abuse and to improve dispute resolution as recommended by the OECD and G20. Application date(s) The Double Tax Agreements (Guernsey) Amendment Order 2020 and the Double Tax Agreements (Switzerland) Order 2020 entered into force on the 26th of March 2020. The Protocols will enter into force through the exchange of diplomatic notes between the parties. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 5 June 2020 Inland Revenue Department 13 NEW LEGISLATION Detailed analysis New Zealand-Switzerland Double Taxation Agreement This Protocol ensures that the DTA meets the BEPS minimum standards and contains best practice provisions. In particular, the new Protocol includes the following: • • A five-year time limit on profit adjustments attributable to associated enterprises or permanent establishments. The restriction will not apply in cases of fraud, gross negligence or wilful default. • • A requirement for tax authorities to make corresponding transfer pricing adjustments. • • An ability for taxpayers to present their case to the tax authority of their residence jurisdiction. • • The introduction of a principal purpose test, which will deny the benefits where one of the principal purposes of a tax arrangement is to benefit from the DTA. • • An update to the provisions relating to the elimination of double taxation to ensure that Switzerland is not required to provide an exemption from Swiss tax for New Zealand sourced income that is exempt or subject to a lower withholding rate under the provisions of the DTA. • • The introduction of arbitration provisions to support the existing mutual agreement procedure. New Zealand-Guernsey Tax Information Exchange Agreement This Protocol ensures that the DTA meets the BEPS minimum standards and contains best practice provisions. Important features of the new Protocol include: • • An amendment to broaden the availability of the mutual agreement procedure and to enable the taxpayer’s case to be presented to the competent authority of the jurisdiction in which they are resident; and • • The introduction of a principal purpose test, which will deny the benefits where one of the principal purposes of a tax arrangement is to benefit from the TIEA. CHANGES TO USE OF MONEY INTEREST RATES The use of money interest rates on underpayments and overpayments of taxes and duties have changed in line with market interest rates. The new rates are: • • Underpayment rate: 7.00% (previously 8.35%) • • Overpayment rate: 0.00% (previously 0.81%) The new rates came into force on 8 May 2020. The Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates Setting Process) Amendment Regulations 2020 came into force on 9 April 2020 and prevented the overpayment rate from going negative. The use of money interest rates are reviewed regularly to ensure they are in line with market interest rates. The new rates are consistent with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s floating first mortgage new customer housing rate and the 90-day bank bill rate. The rates were changed by Order in Council on 4 May 2020. Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates) Amendment Regulations 2020 (LI 2020/76) FORESTS (PAYMENT OF MONEY) ORDER 2020 A payment to landowners for permanently protecting native forest with high conservation values on their land can be exempted from income tax if the appropriate Order in Council is made. An Order in Council, made under the Forests Amendment Act 2004 (see Tax Information Bulletin Vol 16, No 8, p19), grants an income tax exemption in relation to payments made by the Nature Heritage Fund to the owner of blocks of land in the Rowallan Survey District and Alton Survey District. The payments, made over the course of October 2016 to November 2019, were in exchange for the owner entering into a conservation covenant over the blocks of land. The Order in Council, which came into effect on 23 April 2020, is part of the Government’s SILNA (South Island Landless Natives Act 1906) Policy Package announced in 2002. (Forests (Payment of Money) Order 2020 (2020/46)) Addendum to Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4 - Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act 2020 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 5 June 2020 Inland Revenue Department 14 NEW LEGISLATION DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION ABOUT REPRESENTATIVES Addendum The following item was omitted from coverage of the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act 2020 in the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 4. Schedule 7, part A, clause 3(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 The provision that enables the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to disclose information to associations or groups that represent tax agents has been extended to also allow the Commissioner to disclose information about representatives to associations or groups that represent them. Background The Tax Administration Act 1994 imposes an obligation on the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to keep sensitive revenue information confidential. This means that the Commissioner is not able to disclose sensitive revenue information unless the disclosure meets the requirements of one of the permitted disclosures under the Tax Administration Act 1994. The Commissioner has been able to disclose information about tax agents (or persons purporting to be tax agents) to associations and groups that represent them in certain circumstances. This reflects the fact that the Commissioner, in her interactions with tax agents in administering the tax and social policy systems she is responsible for administering, may become aware of information that the associations and groups that represent tax agents are not aware of. The Commissioner can therefore share this information in defined circumstances, which helps protect the integrity of the tax system. The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 introduced “representatives” as a new category of third party and intermediary to the Tax Administration Act 1994. Representatives are defined in section 124D of the Tax Administration Act 1994, and are intended to include the likes of bookkeepers, who may represent their clients for PAYE and GST related matters (but not for income tax). At the time this category was introduced, no corresponding amendments were made to expand the scope of the permitted disclosure that enables the Commissioner to disclose information about tax agents to also allow the Commissioner to disclose information about representatives to associations and groups that represent them. There is no reason that representatives should be treated differently to tax agents in these circumstances. Key features The key feature of the amendment enables the Commissioner to disclose information relevant to a decision to remove a person’s approval as a representative under the Tax Administration Act 1994 to professional bodies. Application date The amendment applies from 23 March 2020, the date of Royal assent. Detailed analysis Clause 3(3) in part A, schedule 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 enables the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to, despite the general requirement that she keep sensitive revenue information confidential, disclose information about a person to an association or group if all of the following criteria are met: • • the person is, or purports to be, a member of an association or group as a representative in terms of section 124D(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994; • • the members of the association or group are subject to a professional code of conduct and a disciplinary process that enforces compliance with that code of conduct; and • • the information being disclosed by the Commissioner is relevant to a decision of the Commissioner to either disallow, or refuse, a person’s approval as a representative (or is information that would, in the Commissioner’s opinion, be relevant to such a decision). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 5 June 2020 Inland Revenue Department 15 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation and depreciation determinations, livestock values and changes in FBT and GST interest rates. LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS Determination EE002: Payments to employees for working from home costs during the COVID-19 pandemic Application This Determination is a temporary response to the COVID-19 pandemic and applies to payments made for the period from 17 March 2020 to 17 September 2020. Background Some employers have made, or intend to make, payments to employees to reimburse costs incurred by their employees as a result of the employees working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. Inland Revenue has been asked to clarify the tax treatment of such payments. It is also acknowledged that many employers will not be in a financial position to make additional payments to employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. This Determination is not intended to suggest that employers should make such payments to employees. Under s CW 17 of the Income Tax Act 2007, such payments may be exempt income for the employees. The amount that can be paid as exempt income for expenditure incurred by an employee depends on various factors. One of the factors is the extent to which the employee would be able to claim a deduction for the expenditure if the employment limitation did not apply. The employment limitation is the rule that prevents an employee from claiming most deductions for expenditure incurred in deriving employment income. This deductibility test means that there needs to be a connection between the expenditure and the performance of the employee’s job. It also means that the expenditure cannot be private expenditure or expenditure of a capital nature (however, an amount can be paid for depreciation loss). Employers may find it administratively difficult to establish the extent to which expenditure is incurred by employees in deriving employment income or is private in nature. Employers may also find it difficult to establish or estimate the expenditure each employee has incurred or is likely to incur. This Determination is intended to remove some of this difficulty and reduce compliance costs for employers by providing some safe harbours. You do not have to apply this Determination. You can calculate tax-free allowance and reimbursement amounts under s CW 17 based on your own reasonable estimates or actual employee costs. Last year (December 2019), the Commissioner issued Determination EE001, which provides guidance on arrangements where employees agree to use their own telecommunication devices and usage plans (or just their usage plans) for their employment. EE001 sets out proportions of expenditure or loss that the Commissioner will accept as being exempt income of an employee. The proportions differ depending on whether a device or usage plan is used by the employee principally for employment. EE001 also provides a de minimis rule which treats a payment made to an employee of up to $5 per week as exempt income of the employee. All that is required for this de minimis rule to apply is that there is an arrangement where the employee will provide their own telecommunications tools and usage plan, or just their usage plan, and the employee agrees to use these for their employment. Determination EE001 can be used in relation to payments made to employees for mobile phone and internet costs incurred by employees working at home. This Determination (Determination EE002) applies to working from home costs not already covered by Determination EE001. Determination EE002 can be relied on in addition to Determination EE001. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 5 June 2020 Inland Revenue Department 16 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS As noted above, this Determination is a temporary response to the COVID-19 pandemic only. It applies for a 6-month period and the treatment it provides depends on an employee continuing to work from home (in a more than minor way) as a result of COVID-19. Determination This Determination (EE002) is made under s 91AAT of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and s CW 17(2C) and (2D) of the Income Tax Act 2007. For this Determination to apply: • • An employer must make a payment to an employee. • • The payment must be for expenditure or a loss incurred (or likely to be incurred) by the employee. • • The expenditure or loss must be incurred by the employee in deriving their employment income and not be private or capital in nature (the capital limitation does not apply to an amount of depreciation loss). • • The payment must be made because the employee is doing their job and the employee must be deriving employment income from performing their job. • • The expenditure or loss must be necessary in the performance of the employee’s job. • • The expenditure or loss must be incurred by the employee as a result of the employee being required to work from home because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This Determination can apply to an employee who is partly working from home and partly outside of their home, provided that the home-based work is more than minor. For example, the Determination can apply to an employee who works at the employer’s premises on alternative days to cater for physical distancing policies. Exclusions This Determination does not apply to: • • Expenditure on account of an employee. • • Any payments made for a period after an employee ceases to work from home. • • An amount paid under a salary sacrifice arrangement. • • To a payment made to an employee to compensate the employee for the conditions of their service. This Determination is not binding on employers or employees This Determination is not binding on employers or employees. An employer or employee may treat a different amount paid to the employee as exempt if they have evidence to demonstrate that in their circumstances some other amount is appropriately treated as exempt income. Weekly threshold Under this Determination, where an employer pays an employee who is working from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic (an “affected employee”) an allowance, up to $15 per week of the amount paid can be treated as exempt income of the employee. The same treatment can be applied to an equivalent amount paid for a different period of time, eg $30 per fortnight or $65 per month. This amount is in recognition of general expenditure (eg, additional heating costs) that an affected employee may incur when working from home, other than: • • Depreciation loss, which is separately addressed in this Determination. • • An expenditure or loss covered by Determination EE001. The treatment of this weekly threshold amount can apply in addition to both the treatment of an amount paid in accordance with Determination EE001 and the treatment of the cost of furniture and equipment that applies under this Determination. For example, if an employer pays an employee $20 per week for working from home expenses, $15 of this can be treated as exempt income under this Determination (EE002) and $5 can be treated as exempt income under Determination EE001 (if the de minimis option in EE001 is chosen). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 5 June 2020 Inland Revenue Department 17 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS For this treatment to apply, the employer does not need to collect information about the actual expenditure incurred by the employee or make any estimate of expenditure incurred or likely to be incurred by the employee. Payments for the cost of furniture and equipment The following recognises that an employee might incur a depreciation loss on home office furniture or equipment, which the employee would be able to claim as a deduction, but for the employment limitation. Because of the low-value asset rule, for many assets, the depreciation loss is likely to be equal to the cost of the asset. Note that the threshold for low-value assets was recently amended. For assets purchased before 17 March 2020 the threshold is $500. For assets purchased on or after 17 March 2020 and before 17 March 2021 the threshold is $5,000 (note that the threshold will decrease to $1,000 on 17 March 2021). This Determination provides two options. An employer may apply either: • • the safe harbour option, or • • the reimbursement option. Safe harbour option Under the safe harbour option, an employer can treat up to $400 of an amount paid to an employee for furniture and equipment costs as exempt income. The safe harbour option saves an employer from having to identify the costs that their employees have or are likely to incur and from having to make judgements about the extent to which the furniture or equipment is used by employees for their employment. If an employer adopts this safe harbour option, it cannot treat any other allowance or reimbursement payment for furniture or equipment as exempt income. The reimbursement option The following applies to reimbursement payments made to employees for the cost of furniture or equipment purchased by employees. Under this reimbursement option, an amount paid by an employer to an affected employee will be exempt income of an employee if: • • The amount is for furniture or equipment purchased by the employee. • • The amount is equal to or less than the deduction that the employee could have for depreciation loss on the asset (or the cost of the asset, in the case of a low-value asset) for the income year, but for the employment limitation. The deduction that the employee could have for an asset and, therefore, the amount that can be paid as exempt income, depends on the extent to which the employee uses the asset for their employment. This means that the amount that can be paid as exempt income will be equal to a proportion of the depreciation loss on the asset (or a proportion of the cost of the asset in the case of a low-value asset). Applying s CW 17, where there is evidence that an asset will be used exclusively for employment purposes, 100% of the depreciation loss on the asset (the cost of the asset, in the case of a low-value asset) can be paid as exempt income of the employee. Further, under this Determination: • • For an employee who uses an asset principally for their employment, an amount of up to 75% of the depreciation loss on the asset (the cost of the asset, in the case of a low-value asset) can be paid as exempt income of the employee. • • For an employee who does not use an asset principally for their employment, an amount of up to 25% of the depreciation loss on the asset (the cost of the asset, in the case of a low-value asset) can be paid as exempt income of the employee. The reimbursement option will require an employer to identify the cost of the asset for which the reimbursement is paid so that they can calculate the above proportion. An employer will also need to determine whether the asset is being used exclusively, principally or less than principally for employment. For assets that are not low-value assets (which are likely to be uncommon), the employer will also need to apply the relevant depreciation rate to calculate the depreciation loss. Whether an asset is used exclusively for employment purposes will depend on the circumstances. Employers need to use their judgement. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 5 June 2020 Inland Revenue Department 18 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS It is acknowledged that the reimbursement option could be onerous in some cases, eg where an employer has many employees. That is why the safe harbour option has also been provided. A written statement (an email or expense claim application is sufficient) from an employee to their employer that the employee intends to use an asset for their employment, and whether principally or not, will be sufficient to establish such use. Overlap with Determination EE001 For depreciation losses on telecommunications devices, employers cannot apply the reimbursement option in this Determination (EE002) in addition to the treatment available in Determination EE001. Summary of options available under Determinations EE001 and EE002 The options available under Determinations EE001 and EE002 are summarised in the following table. Note that the table does not detail all the requirements of the Determinations. The table must be read together with the Determinations themselves. What is the payment for? How much is treated as exempt income? When can I use this option?What evidence do I need to keep?

For items that are not low-value assets, the percentage is applied to the amount of depreciation loss. This Determination is signed by me on the 24 th of April 2020. Susan Price Group Leader Tax Counsel Office Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 5 June 2020 Inland Revenue Department 19 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS S63: Spreading of income and expenditure under an agreement for the sale and purchase of assets This Determination may be cited as Special Determination S63: Spreading of income and expenditure under an agreement for the sale and purchase of assets. 1 Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) 1. The Vendor and the Purchaser entered into an agreement for the sale and purchase of assets and an interest in a joint venture (the Agreement) on 2 December 2019. 2. The Agreement provides for the consideration to be calculated quarterly and by reference to: • • a fixed instalment amount; plus • • an amount based on volume of outputs produced by the assets; plus • • a share of revenue from the sale of products generated from, or use of, the assets; less • • certain costs incurred in holding the assets and in deriving revenue. 3. The total consideration payable by the Purchaser and the duration of the Agreement are unknown, due to the uncertain nature of outputs produced by the assets and the unique nature of the Agreement. 4. An adjustment calculated by reference to net working capital and employee entitlements was required to be calculated and paid by the Vendor to the Purchaser or by the Purchaser to the Vendor soon after the completion date (the Adjustment). 5. This determination prescribes the method for spreading the payments made under the Agreement. 2 Reference This determination is made under s 90AC(1)(bb) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 3 Scope of determination 1. This determination applies to the Purchaser and the Vendor in relation to the Agreement. Under the Agreement the Purchaser acquired certain assets and an interest in a joint venture (the Property) in consideration for a quarterly payment calculated by reference to: • • a fixed instalment amount; plus • • an amount based on volume of outputs produced by the assets; plus • • a share of revenue from the sale of products generated from, or use of, the assets; less • • certain costs incurred in holding the assets and in deriving revenue. 2. The total consideration payable by the Purchaser and the duration of the Agreement are unknown, due to the uncertain nature of outputs produced by the assets and the unique nature of the Agreement. The Agreement can result in payments being made by the Vendor to the Purchaser. 3. The Agreement also provided for the acquisition of other specific assets (which are not part of the Property referred to in para 3.1) by the Purchaser in exchange for a one-off Adjustment to be paid soon after the completion date. 4. The Purchaser and the Vendor both use International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) to prepare financial statements and to report for financial arrangements. 5. Both parties must apply the method specified in this determination. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 5 June 2020 Inland Revenue Department 20 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS 4 Principle 1. The Agreement is a “financial arrangement” under s EW 3 and is an “agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services” under s YA 1. The Agreement is not an “excepted financial arrangement” under s EW 5. 2. The Adjustment is an “excepted financial arrangement” under s EW 5(22). Any amount that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement described in ss EW 5(17) to (25) that is part of a financial arrangement, is an amount that is taken into account under the financial arrangements rules (s EW 6(3)). This determination specifies that amounts payable in relation to the Adjustment do not need to be spread under the financial arrangements rules. 3. Section EW 15C(1) does not apply to the Agreement, because the financial arrangement is an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services that is not a “foreign ASAP” (as defined in s YA 1). Accordingly, one of the methods in s EW 151(2) must be used to allocate an amount of income or expenditure to an income year. A method that is available under s EW 151(2)(c) is a determination made by the Commissioner. 4. The parties have agreed a lowest price for the Property. This is the value of the Property for the purposes of s EW 32. The lowest price has been separated into: • • a lowest price for the Property (the Property Lowest Price); and • • a lowest price for the Adjustment (the Adjustment Lowest Price). 5. Under s EW 29, in the income year in which the final payment is due under the Agreement, each Party will be required to undertake a base price adjustment (BPA) calculation. 5 Interpretation In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires: • • All legislative references in this determination are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated. 6 Method 1. The Adjustment amounts do not need to be spread under the financial arrangements rules. 2. In each income year prior to the year in which a BPA is required, each Party is only required to recognise income under the Arrangement to the extent that: • • the Party receives a net payment from the other Party in that income year; • • the payment received by the Party is not the Adjustment; and • • the cumulative net amount of all of the consideration received and paid by the Party in that income year and all preceding income years for the Property (excluding the Adjustment) exceeds the Property Lowest Price. 3.

Howard Davis Group Leader, Tax Counsel Office Inland Revenue Kilometre rates for the business use of vehicles for the 2020 income year Instead of making a claim for the business use of a motor vehicle based on the actual costs, a taxpayer may elect to have a deduction for the business use portion based on a kilometre rate method. In accordance with Section DE 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007, the Commissioner can to set the kilometre rates for the business use of vehicles as an alternative method for business to claim motor vehicle running costs. As the Commissioner relies on third- party information to set the kilometre rates and that information is not yet available to us due to COVID-19, we cannot review the present rates. The 2019 kilometre rates will continue to apply for the time being. We will review the rate once we get the information from our third-party. Meantime, taxpayers can file returns and if there is a material change once we do set the new rates, they may adjust their 2020 motor vehicle expense claims under s 113 or s 113A. Employers may continue to use the current rates as a reasonable estimate of expenditure incurred by an employee for the business use of a private motor vehicle, until these rates are reviewed. The current rates are: Vehicle typeTier one rateTier two rate Petrol or diesel79 cents30 cents Petrol hybrid79 cents19 cents Electric79 cents9 cents Operational Statement 19/04 provides further information on the use of the kilometre rates.

We've given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. Court of Appeal upholds High Court decision that clarifies when Commissioner’s Notice of Response is due following s 89K decision Case Peter William Mawhinney as Trustee of the Doug Vesey Trust v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2020\] NZCA 112 Decision date29 April 2020 Legislative References Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Tax Administration Act 1994, ss 89AB, 89AC, 89D(5), 89H(2), 89K, 138P Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994, s 26A Interpretation Act 1999, ss 7, 18 Legal termsDeemed acceptance; response period Summary The Commissioner’s Notice of Response (“NOR”) was filed within two months of the decision by the Taxation Review Authority (“the Authority”) that the Commissioner should have accepted the Doug Vesey Trust’s (“Trust”) Notice of Proposed Adjustment (“NOPA”) out of time pursuant to s 89K of the Tax Administration Act (“TAA”). The Court of Appeal upheld the finding of Peters J that the Commissioner’s NOR was filed in time and there was no deemed acceptance of the Trust’s NOPA. Impact The judgment makes it clear the Commissioner’s NOR is not required until two months after the conclusion of s 89K challenge proceedings. There is no valid NOPA until the hearing authority determines that the Commissioner should have accepted a taxpayer’s NOPA out of time. The Commissioner is not required to issue a “protective” NOR in these circumstances. Facts A GST return was filed by the Trust on 5 November 2008 for the period ended 31 October 2008, claiming a refund of $625,000. On 16 April 2013, the Commissioner issued a Notice of Assessment (NOA) in respect of that return. She assessed the refund due for the period as “nil”. In order to be within the four month response period the Trust was required to issue a NOPA in response by 16 August 2013. A NOPA was not issued until 30 March 2015 but was accompanied with a request under s 89K that the Commissioner accept the NOPA out of time. By letter dated 29 April 2015, the Commissioner notified the Trust that she refused to accept the NOPA and that, as a consequence, the Trust was deemed to have accepted the Commissioner’s NOA. In May 2016 the Authority held that the Commissioner ought to have not refused the Trust’s late NOPA and set aside the Commissioner’s refusal. The Commissioner then issued a NOR within two months of the Authority’s decision. This led to the second hearing before the Authority. The Trust argued that the Commissioner’s NOR was out of time and, by s 89H(2), the Commissioner was deemed to have accepted the Trust’s NOPA and must refund the GST claimed. Amendments to ss 89AB and 89AC of the TAA came into force on 24 February 2016 (amendments). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 5 June 2020 Inland Revenue Department 25 LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE SUMMARIES The Authority held the amendments applied and were determinative of the issues. Peters J upheld that decision. The Trust appealed that decision to the Court of Appeal. Issues Whether the Commissioner’s NOR was issued in or out of time. That depends on when the Commissioner’s two-month response period started to run – from 30 March 2015 as the appellant claims, or from May 2016 as the Commissioner claims and as the Authority and High Court held. The Trust argued that s 89AC may not be given retrospective application, for to do so would be to deprive it of a right to which it was entitled under the pre-amendment legislation. Decision The Court stated that on its face, s 89AC took effect on 24 February 2016, before the Authority revived the Trust’s NOPA. The question is whether the amendment ought to be interpreted to exclude cases where a taxpayer’s NOPA had already been issued but was late, and hence ineffective. The Court referred to the Court of Appeal decision in Foodstuffs (Auckland) Ltd v Commerce Commission which held that the general approach to retrospectivity strikes a balance between giving effect to reforms and protecting vested rights, if any, that are in jeopardy by the new legislation, \[2002\] 1 NZLR 353 (CA). The Court then referred to the Court of Appeal decision in Crown Health Financing Agency v P which held that the law adopts a general principle that the presumption against retrospectivity applies to substantive rights but not those that are procedural in nature, unless a contrary intention is expressed in the legislation itself, \[2008\] NZCA 362. The Court stated that it cannot be doubted that the legislation in this case preserved the Trust’s substantive right to have its claim to a GST refund determined on the merits and noted the Trust did not dispute this. The Trust’s argument was that what it lost was the right to invoke s 89H(2), under which the Commissioner is deemed to accept an adjustment contained in a NOPA when she fails to reject it within time. The Court found this argument wholly without merit for two reasons: • • First, s 89AC is procedural in nature. Therefore there in no good reason to limit its application to disputes commenced after it came into force, because it does not deprive taxpayers of the substantive right to have their tax liabilities determined on the merits. • • Second, s 89AC achieves no more than what it implicit in the scheme of the TAA. The Commissioner was not required to file a NOR by 30 April 2015. At that date her obligation to do so or face the consequences had not been triggered, for the appellant’s NOPA was late and of no effect. The much later decision of the TRA excused the taxpayer’s failure to file its NOPA in time. It would be remarkable if the legislature intended that a decision relieving the taxpayer of the consequences of its own failure to act within time should deny the Commissioner the right to contest the taxpayer’s claim.

It is intended both to provide direction to those Inland Revenue staff delegated to use the discretion in s 113 and to give guidance to taxpayers and their advisors in formulating requests for amendment. This Statement applies from 2 June 2020 and replaces SPS 16/01: Requests to amend assessments published in Tax Information Bulletins Vol 28, No 4 (May 2016): 12 and Vol 29, No 3 (April 2017): 43. 11 Interpretation statement IS 20/02: GST - supplies by New Zealand hunting outfitters and taxidermists to overseas hunters This interpretation statement considers the GST treatment of supplies made by New Zealand hunting guides or outfitters and taxidermists to overseas hunters. It explains which supplies of goods and services to overseas hunters are standard-rated and which are zero-rated for GST purposes. The statement is accompanied by three fact sheets setting out the most important information from the statement for the different parties – outfitters, taxidermists and overseas hunters. You can find the fact sheets at www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz (keyword: IS 20/02 fact sheet). 28 IS 20/03: Income tax – sections GB 3B and GB 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007 – temporary loss carry-back regime The COVID-19 Response (Taxation and Other Regulatory Urgent Measures) Act 2020 introduced a temporary loss carry-back regime into the Income Tax Act 2007 as part of changes made because of COVID-19. This enables a business to carry-back and offset a loss in a particular year against its taxable income for the 2018–19 or 2019–20 income years and receive a refund of any tax paid. This interpretation statement considers the potential application of the specific anti-avoidance provisions relevant to companies using the temporary regime (that is, the new section GB 3B and the amended section GB 4). 58 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 1 IN SUMMARY (continued) IN SUMMARY Interpretation statement (continued) IS 20/04: GST treatment of short-stay accommodation This interpretation statement is the final item in a series of guidance on the income tax and GST consequences of providing short-stay accommodation through peer-to-peer websites such as Airbnb, Bookabach and Holiday Houses. The statement explains the GST treatment of supplying short-stay accommodation and confirms these supplies are not exempt supplies. The statement also discusses the requirements for registration, the main consequences of registration, change of use adjustments and what happens when the property is sold or the short-stay accommodation activity ceases. These latter topics will be useful in providing guidance to taxpayers of the options available where their short-stay accommodation activity has been affected by COVID-19. 69 Commissioner’s statement CS 20/02: Trophy hunting and the GST treatment of the “trophy fee” This Commissioner's statement clarifies the GST treatment of the “trophy fee” charged by outfitters and guides. It was published at the same time as interpretation statement IS 20/02: Goods and services tax - supplies by New Zealand hunting outfitters and taxidermists to overseas hunters. 107 Legal decisions - case summaries – Recent Case Summaries Court of Appeal decides that payments made in support of overseas mission services qualify for tax credits The Court of Appeal found that the High Court Judge was correct when she concluded that payments made by a missionary’s sibling and other more distant relatives, as well as unrelated members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints were gifts for the purposes of s LD 1(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007. The Court of Appeal found that the High Court Judge erred in concluding payments made by a missionary, their parents, guardians or grandparents were not gift. The Court of Appeal determined these payments were also gifts, making the payors eligible for donation tax credits. 110 Taxpayer ordered by Court of Appeal to pay increased security for costs In the underlying substantive matter, the appellant, Mr John Alfred Dowden (“Mr Dowden”), appealed the High Court decision that he is liable for unpaid PAYE, GST and income tax for the period from April 2003 to November 2011 in respect of two businesses conducted by him. Mr Dowden applied for an order dispensing with security for costs for the appeal (which the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules set at $7,060). The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) cross-applied for an order increasing security for costs by $2,500 to $9,560. The Deputy Registrar declined Mr Dowden’s application and granted the Commissioner’s application. Mr Dowden then applied for review of the Deputy Registrar’s decision, which the Court of Appeal upheld. 112 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 2 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation and depreciation determinations, livestock values and changes in FBT and GST interest rates. LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS About this publication To help customers manage the impacts of COVID-19, the Commissioner now has a discretion to vary a requirement under an Inland Revenue Act (including for these purposes, the Unclaimed Money Act 1971). This discretion is found in ss 6H and 6I of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and applies from 17 March 2020 to 30 September 2021. This variation is an exercise of that power. COV 20/01: Variation to section HB 13(3)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2007 Variation The Commissioner of Inland Revenue has, under the discretion provided under section 6I of the Tax Administration Act 1994, made the following statutory variation: For an election to be an LTC (look-through company) for the 2019 income year for a company to which s HB 13(3)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2007 applies, the deadline by which that election must be received by the Commissioner is extended to include an election received by the Commissioner on or before 30 June 2020. Application date This variation applies from 1 April 2020 to 30 June 2020. Dated at Wellington on 13 May 2020. Martin Smith Chief Tax Counsel Inland Revenue Background (material under this heading does not form part of the variation) Summary of effect 1. Section HB 13(3)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that in the case of a company that has not previously been required to file a return of income prior to the year from which they wish to be treated as an LTC (look-through company), the election must be provided before the last day for filing that return. The due date for filing that election has been extended to 30 June 2020 using s 6I of the TAA. Provisions affected 2. Section HB 13(3)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2007. Application of variation 3. This variation applies to all companies who wished to elect to be an LTC and had not previously been required to file a return of income. It recognises that the impact of COVID-19 will have adversely affected some companies’ ability to file their election on time, and this will mean they are unable to be treated as an LTC for the year in question. For this reason, the due date for providing this election has been extended.

Application date This variation applies from 1 April 2020 to 30 June 2020. Dated at Wellington on 13 May 2020. Martin Smith Chief Tax Counsel Inland Revenue Background (material under this heading does not form part of the variation) Summary of effect 1. Section EI 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 allows a person to allocate income from the disposal of timber or right to take timber, or the disposal of land with standing timber, to previous income years. The income may be allocated between the income year in which it is derived and any 1 or more of the previous 3 income years. A person must apply in writing to the Commissioner no later than 1 year after the end of the income year in which they derive the income. The time for making that application, for income derived in an income year ending between 25 March 2019 and 31 May 2019, has been extended to 31 July 2020 using s 6I of the TAA. Provisions affected 2. Section EI 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Application of variation 3. This variation applies to a person who wishes to allocate to any 1 or more of the previous 3 income years timber income derived in an income year ending on a date between 25 March 2019 and 31 May 2019. Applications to allocate that income were due no later than one year after the end of the income year. The variation recognises that the impact of COVID-19 has adversely affected some taxpayers’ ability to make an application on time and would otherwise mean they are unable to spread the income to previous income years. For this reason, the due date for making the application has been extended.

This means that an election made before 30 June 2020 to change from a 6-month taxable period to a 1-month taxable period will take effect, under s 15D(2) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, from 1 April 2020. This variation is subject to the following conditions: • • The person notifies the Commissioner before 30 June 2020 that they wish their election to have this effect; and • • The person does not subsequently elect to change from a 1-month taxable period before 30 September 2020. Application date This variation applies from 6 June 2020 to 30 June 2020. Dated at Wellington on 06 June 2020. Martin Smith Chief Tax Counsel Inland Revenue Background (material under this heading does not form part of the variation) Summary of effect 1. Section 15(3) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 allows a person to apply to the Commissioner to have a one-month taxable period for GST. Under s 15D(2) of the GST Act, the change in taxable period takes effect at the end of the taxable period in which the person applies. For a person who had a six-month taxable period ending 31 March 2020 but who did not apply to change to a one-month taxable period before 31 March 2020, the time for making that application has been extended to 30 June 2020 using s 6I of the TAA. Provisions affected 2. Section 15D(2) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Application of variation 3. This variation applies to a person who wishes to change from a six-month taxable period to a one-month taxable period for GST. A person is permitted to do so under s 15(3) of the GST Act, but the change will take effect from the end of the taxable period in which they apply. For a person who did not apply before 31 March 2020, the change will not take effect until 1 October 2020. The variation recognises that the impact of COVID-19 means that some taxpayers may now wish to file on a one-monthly basis to provide earlier access to any GST refunds, but will not have been able to consider whether to apply, or make the application, before 31 March 2020. It allows the change of taxable period to take effect much sooner than would otherwise be the case.

Section EC 15 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (the Act) requires the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) to make a determination declaring the national average market values (NAMV) for an income year for each class of specified livestock set out in Schedule 17 of the Act. This determination is published in May each year. These NAMVs are used by taxpayers that are in the business of livestock farming to value their livestock on hand where the taxpayer has elected to use the herd scheme to value livestock in an income year. As the name of this determination suggests, NAMVs provide the national average market value of specified livestock classes. As such they may not always reflect the market value of the livestock of a particular taxpayer, or even of a particular region. This being so, the values are not intended to be used for any other purpose than that for which they are produced; valuing livestock of taxpayers who have elected to value their livestock under the herd scheme in the income year for which the determination relates. In order to ascertain the market value of the various classes of livestock the Commissioner contracts with a number of experienced livestock valuers situated throughout the country 1 . Each valuer is asked to provide the market value of the various specified livestock classes located in their region. There is generally more than one valuer contracted for each region. The market valuations required are for “good quality on-farm animals (capital stock)” as at 30 April. From these values the CIR then calculates the national average market value for each livestock class. In the case of sheep, beef, dairy cattle and deer (red, wapiti and elk) classes a weighted average is used (based on total livestock numbers for a type of livestock in that region compared to the national herd numbers for that type of livestock 2 ). Because of their comparatively low numbers, a straight average is used for the remaining livestock types. 1 38 valuations were obtained for the 2020 determination. 2 Numbers are based on data collated by Statistics New Zealand.

Rob Falk National Advisor Technical Standards, Legal Services Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 10 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS These statements describe how the Commissioner will, in practice, exercise a discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS SPS 20/03: Requests to amend assessments Introduction This Statement sets out Inland Revenue’s practice for exercising the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s (the Commissioner) discretion under s 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the TAA) to amend assessments to ensure their correctness. It is intended both to provide direction to those Inland Revenue staff delegated to use the discretion in s 113 and to give guidance to taxpayers and their advisors in formulating requests for amendment. All legislative references in this Statement refer to the TAA unless stated otherwise. Application This Statement applies from 2 June 2020 and replaces SPS 16/01 Requests to amend assessments published in Tax Information Bulletins Vol 28, No 4 (May 2016): 12 and Vol 29, No 3 (April 2017): 43. Standard practice Summary Section 113 and the Commissioner’s discretion 1. The Commissioner acknowledges that in a self-assessment regime, taxpayers will occasionally take an incorrect tax position and that correcting these positions is an integral part of tax administration. Section 113 contains a broad discretion allowing the Commissioner to amend assessments to ensure their correctness. 2. The Commissioner’s practice is generally to use the discretion to correct a tax position, subject to the criteria described in this Statement. 3. The criteria applied when determining whether to exercise the s 113 discretion are based on the care and management principles contained in ss 6 and 6A. Care and management of the taxes 4. Section 6 requires that the Commissioner’s best endeavours are used to protect “the integrity of the tax system”, including public perception of that integrity. In carrying out this function, the Commissioner is bound not only to protect the rights of taxpayers to have their liability determined fairly, impartially and according to law, but also to have regard to the responsibilities of taxpayers to comply with the law. Section 15B sets out taxpayers’ responsibilities. 5. To discharge her s 6A(2) duties, the Commissioner must compare the available courses of action with the likely effect on the amount of net revenue collected over time. To do this, the Commissioner must consider the short- and long- term implications of each course of action and have regard to all three factors listed in s 6A(2): available resources, the promotion of compliance (especially voluntary compliance) by all taxpayers and the compliance costs that they incur. 6. Inland Revenue has limited resources to undertake what can sometimes be a lengthy verification process to determine whether an assessment should be amended. Accordingly, it is consistent with the taxpayer obligation under s 15B and the Commissioner’s duty under ss 6 and 6A(2) to limit the amount of time and other resources that will be spent investigating amendment requests. Because of this, not all requested amendments will necessarily be made. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 11 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS The process for considering s 113 requests 7. In considering s 113 requests, the Commissioner must be assured that the amendment the taxpayer seeks will ensure the assessment is correct when amended, even if it was also correct beforehand. Where the Commissioner is not initially persuaded that the amendment requested will result in a correct assessment, a decision must be made whether to commit Inland Revenue’s limited resources to considering the request further. 8. Where the Commissioner does decide to commit appropriate resources to the issue and is satisfied that making the requested amendment will result in a correct assessment being made, the assessment will be amended. This is unless there is a residual reason, other than her limited resources, why the discretion should not be exercised. 9. The Commissioner’s process for considering requests under s 113 is carried out under four possible phases (see further at \[36\]): • • An initial examination of the request to see if the matter can be disposed of simply (either by making the amendment or not). • • If it cannot, consideration of whether the Commissioner should apply additional resources to consider the request f ur ther. • • Determine whether a correct assessment will result from the requested amendment. • • Finally, determine whether there is any residual reason (other than limited resources) why the Commissioner should not make the requested amendment. Considering simple amendment requests and voluntary disclosures 10. The Commissioner will follow the process set out in this Statement in determining whether the amendment requested will lead to the making of a correct assessment. 11. There may be very clear errors that require little consideration. For instance, if a request is made to correct an arithmetic, transposition or keying error made by either the taxpayer or the Commissioner, the correction will be made without further consideration. Factors the Commissioner may consider in more complex cases 12. When exercising the s 113 discretion in more complex cases, the Commissioner will evaluate any amendment request using the care and management principles. To best inform this care and management decision, the Commissioner will objectively consider the relevant factors discussed in this Statement (as required on a case-by-case basis). How does a taxpayer make a request to amend their assessment? 13. Requests to correct clear errors, such as arithmetic, transposition and keying errors, may be made to Inland Revenue by telephone or in writing. The term “in writing” includes a taxpayer modifying their tax return by using myIR, as well as other communication with the Commissioner by electronic means. 14. Requests to amend returns where the tax effect of the amendment requested is $10,000 or less may generally be made by telephone or in writing. 15. Requests to amend returns where the tax effect of the amendment requested is greater than $10,000 must be made in writing. 16. Taxpayers or their agents making amendment requests must supply the Commissioner with all relevant information to substantiate the merits of the amendment requested. How does s 113 reconcile with s 113A and the proviso to s 20(3) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985? 17. Where the taxpayer is able to make the required correction for themselves in a later period (under s 113A or the proviso to s 20 (3) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act)) the Commissioner’s practice is (generally) not to expend limited resources considering whether to exercise the discretion under s 113. This is because both s 113A and the proviso to s 20(3) of the GST Act provide a specific mechanism by which the taxpayer is able to self-correct the error: the taxpayer does not need to use s 113 to make the correction. This outcome is more consistent with the scheme of the legislation which requires that taxpayers take responsibility for ensuring they make correct assessments. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 12 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS What is the relationship between s 113 and s 22G of the TAA? 18. Section 22G(3) provides that a qualifying individual may amend the income information in their final account at any time before their terminal tax date for the tax year. The amended income information forms a new, original assessment and any earlier assessment for the tax year is regarded as not having been made. Because of this s 113 is not engaged in amending an assessment. 19. When a qualifying individual wishes to amend the information in their final account after their terminal tax date, or a taxpayer who is an “other income earner” wishes to amend their assessment after their account has been finalised, the taxpayer must either request an amendment from the Commissioner per s 113 or they may choose to issue a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) and enter the disputes process. Detailed discussion Section 113 and the Commissioner’s discretion 20. The Commissioner acknowledges that both taxpayers and the Commissioner will occasionally make errors and that correcting these is an integral part of tax administration. 21. Section 113 contains a broad discretion allowing the Commissioner to amend assessments to ensure their correctness. This Statement outlines the general principles that will be followed when a taxpayer requests that an amendment be made to their assessment. 22. The Commissioner will generally agree to amend assessments where the requested amendment is clearly correct. This is despite the fact that, as a matter of law, the Commissioner cannot be compelled either to investigate amendment requests or subsequently to amend the assessments. 1 23. In determining whether to exercise the s 113 discretion, the Commissioner will evaluate an amendment request using the care and management principles in ss 6 and 6A balanced with the obligations of taxpayers to make correct self-assessments. 24. The care and management principles are discussed below. More detailed guidance can be found in Interpretation Statement IS 10/07 Care and Management of the taxes covered by the Inland Revenue Acts – Section 6A(2) and (3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 2 Care and management of the taxes Section 6: Integrity of the tax system 25. Section 6 requires the Commissioner to use her best endeavours to protect “the integrity of the tax system”, including public perception of that integrity. In carrying out this function, the Commissioner is bound not only to protect the rights of taxpayers to have their liability determined fairly, impartially and according to law, but also to have regard to the responsibilities of taxpayers to comply with the law. Section 15B sets out taxpayers’ responsibilities and, in particular, the obligations to: (aa) if required under a tax law, make an assessment: (a) unless the taxpayer is a non-filing taxpayer, correctly determine the amount of tax payable by the taxpayer under the tax laws: (b) deduct or withhold the correct amounts of tax from payments or receipts of the taxpayer when required to do so by the tax laws: 26. Given this, the Commissioner may consider a taxpayer’s compliance history when deciding whether to exercise the discretion in s 113. Although not decisive, a particularly poor compliance history may support the Commissioner declining to make the requested amendment where, in her opinion, making such an amendment would not promote public perception of the integrity of the tax system or voluntary compliance. To decline a s 113 request in this circumstance will be a rare occurrence and will require the approval of a senior officer (see further at \[57\] and \[58\] below). Section 6A 27. Section 6A (together with s 6) was enacted to provide the framework within which the Commissioner administers the tax system. Section 6A(2) clarifies the Commissioner’s overall objective in carrying out those functions. 1 Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Wilson (1996) 17 NZTC 12,512 (CA); Lawton v Commissioner of Revenue (2003) 21 NZTC 18,042 (CA). 2 More information on this statement can be found at www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/ (search keywords: Care and management). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 13 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS 28. To discharge her s 6A(2) duties, the Commissioner must compare the available courses of action with the likely effect on the amount of net revenue collected over time. To do this, the Commissioner must consider both the short- and long- term implications of each course of action and have regard to all three factors listed in s 6A(2). These factors are: • • the resources available to the Commissioner (s 6A(2)(a)); • • the importance of promoting compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all persons with the Inland Revenue Acts (s 6A(2)(b)); and • • the compliance costs incurred by persons (s 6A(2)(c)). 29. The practical effect of these words is that the Commissioner can adopt courses of action that forgo the collection of the highest net revenue: • • in the short term, if it is considered that this will enable the collection of more net revenue in the longer term; and • • from particular taxpayers, if it is considered that this will enable more net revenue to be collected from all taxpayers. 30. The words “despite anything in the Inland Revenue Acts” in s 6A(2) mean that the Commissioner can carry out the course of action she considers will collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law, even if it results in less tax being collected than is imposed, or required to be collected, by another provision. However, the words “within the law” in s 6A(2) also mean that the Commissioner must act consistently with the rest of the Inland Revenue Acts. Resources available to the Commissioner 31. Inland Revenue has limited resources to undertake what sometimes could be lengthy verification processes to determine whether the proposed amendment would result in a correct assessment. While the Commissioner is obligated to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law under s 6A(2), the Commissioner must take into account the resources available, the promotion of compliance (especially voluntary compliance) by all taxpayers and any compliance costs incurred by taxpayers. 32. Accordingly, it is consistent with the obligation under s 6A(2) for the Commissioner to limit the amount of time and other resources that will be spent investigating amendment requests. Not all requested amendments will necessarily be made. Ensuring a balance between time spent considering an amendment request and other activities is also consistent with the obligation to protect the integrity of the tax system under s 6. 33. The Commissioner will be reluctant to agree to investigate the correctness of an amendment request that would require the application of disproportionate amounts of Inland Revenue resources (that is, excessive resources when compared to the amount of tax at stake). This is not to say that the Commissioner will only ever use minimal resources to determine the correctness of amendment requests or decline complex amendment requests. The extent and relevance of a taxpayer’s disclosure and the amount of tax involved will potentially indicate the amount of resources required to determine whether an amendment will result in a correct assessment. The process used to consider s 113 requests 34. As stated in Westpac Securities NZ Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue 3 (Westpac), “...the focus of the inquiry as to whether the power was available would be centred on whether the amendment the taxpayer seeks to have made will ensure the assessment is correct when amended, even if it was also correct beforehand”. 35. Once a taxpayer is able to show that making the requested amendment will result in a correct assessment being made, the next step involves “the Commissioner’s decision whether or not to exercise her discretion in a particular case”. 4 36. The Commissioner’s process for considering requests under s 113 is carried out under four possible phases: • • Phase one: An initial examination of the request. If it is clear that an error has occurred and that the error can be easily corrected, then the amendment will be made (subject to the application of phase four). In that case, the request will not have to progress through phases two and three. Conversely, if it is clear that agreeing to the request will not result in a correct assessment, the request will be declined at this point. • • Phase two: If it is unclear whether agreeing to the request will result in a correct assessment being made, the Commissioner will need to consider whether additional limited resources should be applied to consider the request f ur ther. • • Phase three: In cases where it is decided to apply further resources, the Commissioner will consider whether a correct assessment will result from the requested amendment. 3 Westpac Securities NZ Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2014\] NZHC 3377, (2014) 26 NZTC ¶21-118 at \[65\]. 4 Westpac at \[66\]. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 14 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS • • Phase four: Determine whether there is any residual reason (other than the Commissioner’s limited resources) why the Commissioner should not make the requested amendment. The following flowchart illustrates the progress of a s 113 request through the four phases: Section 113 request received by CIR Correct assessment cannot be made Phase One: CIR examines the merits of the s 113 request Correct assessment able to be made Unclear whether a correct assessment can be made Decline request CIR not willing to apply resources Phase Two: CIR considers whether to apply limited resources CIR willing to apply resources No Phase Three: Will a correct assessment result from the amendment requested? Ye s Ye s Phase Four: Is there any reason why the CIR should not make the assessment? No CIR agrees to amend assessment Each of these phases is summarised below: Phase One: Initial examination of request 37. At this phase, the Commissioner considers the appropriate merits of all s 113 requests. The Commissioner receives thousands of s 113 requests each year, pointing out errors that have been made by taxpayers or the Commissioner, and requesting that the appropriate assessment be amended. This consideration is based on the facts that are presented by the taxpayer (and those that may already be known to the Commissioner). In the vast majority of these cases the facts are clear that either making the amendment will correct an error and therefore result in a correct assessment or that the amendment will not result in the correct assessment. The aim of this phase is to act as a “filter” for a clearly correct/ incorrect request. Once the Commissioner has considered the merits of the request, the Commissioner will either decline the request or progress it directly to phase four (with the minimum use of the Commissioner’s resources possible). There can be a number of factors that determine whether a request is able to be progressed to phase four (or declined) at this point, for instance: • • If the amendment is being requested to correct an arithmetic, transposition or keying error made by either the taxpayer or Commissioner, the correction will be made without further consideration. See \[38\]. • • Has the taxpayer provided all the required information and has the request been made in the appropriate format? If not, the matter will not proceed unless the necessary information is provided. Note that this factor might also emerge at a later stage, when the Commissioner has begun to examine the question more closely, in which case the matter might not proceed further unless the necessary information can be easily provided by the taxpayer. See further at \[66\] to \[69\]. • • Is the taxpayer under investigation by Inland Revenue or involved is a dispute with the Commissioner? If so, the request is unlikely to proceed, subject to the outcome of any dispute. See further at \[46\] and \[77\] to \[80\]. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 15 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS • • Is the amendment able to be made by the taxpayer in a later period? See further at \[88\] to \[99\]. • • Is the period that the taxpayer wishes to have amended subject to a statutory time bar? For example, where the Commissioner is unable to refund an amount of tax because the period subject to the amendment request is time barred, resources will not be applied to considering the request for that statute-barred period further. See further at \[81\] to \[86\]. Arithmetic, transposition and keying errors 38. As already stated, if a request is made to correct an arithmetic, transposition or keying error made by either the taxpayer or the Commissioner, the correction will be made without further consideration. The Commissioner has made a decision, based on the care and management principles discussed above, to allocate resources to ensure these previously incorrect assessments are corrected. This is on the basis that the amendment is straight-forward and the amount of resources required is minor. Phase Two: Whether the Commissioner will apply resources to consider the request further 39. Given the correctness of the majority of requests are clear at phase one (see above at \[37\]), these will not need to be considered at phase two. Those cases that do need to be considered at phase two will be cases where, following the phase one consideration of the merits of the request, it remains uncertain whether acceding to the request will result in a correct assessment. These cases will be more complex. At this second phase, the Commissioner must decide whether to devote her limited resources to resolving a request when the correctness of that request remains uncertain after the initial examination. In some cases, a balancing of the factors set out below will mean that the Commissioner can simply decide under s 113 to take the matter no further. This is because the courts have recognised that the allocation of resources is a matter for the Commissioner, who is not obligated to allocate resources to determine whether a proposed amendment is correct. Resource consideration commences at this phase and continues throughout the s 113 process. 40. The more easily verifiable the correctness of the proposed amendment is, the more likely it will be that the Commissioner will allocate resources to making the requested amendment. Where the proposed adjustment is merely arguable (or involves disputed facts or statutory interpretation) it is less likely that the Commissioner will devote resources to processing the request further (see further at \[43\] to \[46\]). Factors the Commissioner may consider at Phase Two when determining whether to devote resources 41. In circumstances where the Commissioner is not immediately certain that making the requested amendment will result in a correct assessment, the Commissioner will consider whether the request justifies the commitment of additional resources. 42. When determining whether to apply the s 113 discretion to these more complex cases, the Commissioner will evaluate any amendment request using the care and management principles (discussed at \[25\] to \[33\]). These care and management factors (that will be relevant on a case-by-case basis) will each be weighed up in reaching a decision. This is a balancing exercise where it will be rare for one factor to be determinative. Even if it is decided to proceed, it may later be necessary to re-evaluate the position if, for example, further information is required or the issue becomes particularly difficult to resolve. The Commissioner may later determine that no further resources will be applied to the request. Primacy of disputes resolution process 43. Requesting an amendment under s 113 cannot be used to circumvent the statutory disputes procedure 5 . Further, the Commissioner does not consider it appropriate to use s 113 to amend assessments when the facts of a case or the interpretation of the law relevant to those facts is at issue. Disputed facts and statutory interpretation, or instances where the facts or law is unclear, should properly be considered using the disputes resolution process. 44. The Commissioner will consider whether a taxpayer was aware that they had the disputes resolution procedure available to them. A taxpayer who knowingly does not engage with the disputes process within the available time period, and then attempts to use s 113 to challenge an assessment outside the disputes process timeframe is something that the Commissioner will take into account in deciding whether to accept or decline a request. 6 45. To accede to a taxpayer’s amendment request in these circumstances would potentially mean treating that taxpayer more advantageously than other taxpayers who have appropriately followed the disputes process regime. Section 6(2)(c) requires that the Commissioner protect the rights of taxpayers to have their tax affairs treated with no greater or lesser favour than the tax affairs of other persons. As Wylie J observed in Arai Korp (at \[68\]); “A taxpayer who has sat on his or her hands and done nothing, is not entitled to expect preferential treatment”. 5 Tannadyce Investments Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2011\] NZSC 158, (2011) 25 NZTC 20-103. 6 Arai Korp Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2013\] NZHC 958, (2013) 26 NZTC 21,014. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 16 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS 46. As stated previously (at \[37\]) the Commissioner will not amend assessments while any item of those assessments remains the subject of a current dispute under Part 4A of the TAA. If the period and tax type relating to an amendment request is already under investigation, the Commissioner will make any appropriate consequential amendments at the conclusion of the investigation, or if the result of the investigation is disputed, at the conclusion of the dispute. That is, if the Commissioner is already devoting resources to verify the correctness of an assessment, all reasonable consequential effects of the investigation (including the amendment request) will be considered as part of that process. See \[77\] to \[80\] for further discussion. Whether the subject matter of the request could apply to other taxpayers 47. The focus of this factor is on whether the request could also have application for other taxpayers and, if so, the extent to which this would impact on the Commissioner’s resources. Commonly, in such cases, it will make sense for the matter to be considered further in order for the Commissioner to clarify the position for all taxpayers potentially affected. The more significant the precedential value, the more likely it is that resources will be applied. How similar requests have been treated by the Commissioner 48. Similarly, if the Commissioner has agreed to amendments that involve the same facts and legal analysis, then this would be a factor that would generally support exercising the discretion. However, if an assessment was previously amended under s 113 but that assessment was made on what the Commissioner now considers to be an incorrect basis, then that would not provide authority for treating similar requests in the same manner. Whether the request is a voluntary disclosure 49. The Commissioner will, as a matter of practice, always apply resources to considering a s 113 request that amounts to a voluntary disclosure (in that the request discloses a tax shortfall). This is on the basis that resources need to be applied to considering whether the disclosure is full and complete and whether a shortfall penalty should be imposed in accordance with the process set out in SPS 19/02 Voluntary disclosures. Therefore, the Commissioner is not applying any additional resources in considering the s 113 request. See further at \[73\] to \[75\]. Whether the taxpayer took their original position relying on advice from the Commissioner 50. As a matter of practice, the Commissioner will generally apply public statements. However, the Commissioner is not legally bound by such statements or other advice (unless the statements are binding rulings that apply to the particular taxpayer and arrangement). 7 51. From time to time, the Commissioner will take the view that advice that has previously been given is incorrect. This may occur, for example, where the court clarifies the law or the Commissioner takes a different view of the law. 52. Where the Commissioner has given incorrect advice (other than a binding ruling) this does not operate to change the amount of tax legally payable on the basis of the correct application of the law (because the Commissioner cannot simply choose to alter the statutory basis of an assessment 8 ). However, it may mean that an assessment previously made on the basis of that advice is now incorrect. Accordingly, that assessment may be corrected by the Commissioner following the application of the principles set out in this Statement. For example, the assessment may be corrected provided it is possible to establish the correct position without undue application of the Commissioner’s resources. 53. The Commissioner’s statement: Status of the Commissioner’s advice 9 fully sets out the status of advice that is given by the Commissioner. It discusses the circumstances in which a change of view will be applied retrospectively and may therefore result in the approval of a request to amend existing assessments made in reliance on the former view of the Commissioner. Whether there has been a delay in making the request 54. This factor relates to the length of time since the original position was first taken, when the taxpayer became aware of the issue, or between the taxpayer becoming aware of the issue and the s 113 request being made. 55. When a substantial amount of time has passed between the events relevant to the proposed amendment and the request, it may be difficult for the Commissioner to ascertain and/or verify the relevant facts. 7 Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Ti Toki Cabarets (1989) Ltd (2000) 19 NZTC 15,874 (CA); Lemmington Holdings Ltd (No 2) v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1983) 6 NZTC 61,576 (HC); Westpac Banking Corporation v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (2008) 23 NZTC 21,694 (HC). 8 Vestey v IRC (1979) 3 All ER 976 (HL); R v IRC, ex p Wilkinson \[2006\] 1 All ER 529 (HL). 9 More information on this statement may be found www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/ (search keywords: status of Commissioner’s advice). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 17 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS The size of the proposed amendment 56. If the size of the amendment is large in absolute terms or material for the taxpayer, this may support the Commissioner devoting resources to determine the correctness of the requested amendment. Conversely, very small amounts may not justify the allocation of resources when the care and management factors are viewed as a whole (unless the Commissioner considers that the matter is very straightforward). However, this factor should never be decisive. Taxpayer’s compliance history 57. The Commissioner may take a taxpayer’s compliance history into consideration when deciding whether to apply resources to an amendment request. Although rarely decisive, a particularly poor compliance history may support a decision not to devote resources to consider the correctness of the requested amendment. 10 This may occur, for instance, when a taxpayer’s compliance history means the Commissioner is unable to accept the evidence for the requested amendment at face value and considers that further investigation is required. 58. Agreeing to the requested amendment in this circumstance, without further investigation, could be seen as undermining public perception of the integrity of the tax system and voluntary compliance. Any other considerations relevant to the particular case 59. Recognising the broad discretionary power contained in s 113, the above list of factors is intended to be comprehensive, but not exhaustive. There may be other considerations arising out of a particular case that are relevant in determining what impact the proposed course of action for that particular case would have on voluntary compliance and on the integrity of the tax system, including public perception of that integrity. Phase Three: Whether a correct assessment will result from the requested amendment 60. Where it is decided to apply additional resources to consider the requested amendment (which will most often be the case), the Commissioner will then consider the merits of the request and proceed accordingly. This may require the taxpayer to provide further information and/or additional legal analysis. It is noted that this step may take some time. The position requested must be consistent with the Commissioner’s view of the law on the facts available. If, after examining the request, the Commissioner concludes that a correct assessment can be made, the request will be progressed to phase four. However, if the requested position is contrary to the Commissioner’s view of the law, or the Commissioner remains uncertain that a correct assessment can be made, the request will be declined. In addition, if the commitment of resources proves to be much greater than anticipated in the context of the matters raised during this phase, the request will revert to phase two and the issue of the Commissioner’s resources will be reconsidered. Phase Four: Final considerations: Whether the discretion will always be exercised 61. When the Commissioner is satisfied the amendment requested will lead to the making of a correct assessment, that assessment will be made unless circumstance exists that suggests that, on balance, the integrity of the tax system will be undermined by the making of that assessment. These circumstances can include, for example: (a) Where the request is, or is part of, a tax avoidance arrangement. This is because, while the requested adjustment may be a correct interpretation of the law when considered in isolation, the Commissioner would not be convinced that the resulting assessment would be correct if s BG 1 was applied. The Commissioner’s view of the law on tax avoidance is set out in Interpretation Statement IS 13/01 – Tax avoidance and the interpretation of sections BG 1 and GA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. (b) Where a taxpayer requests the Commissioner to amend an assessment from one correct tax position to another position that is also correct. When a taxpayer requests the Commissioner amend an assessment from one correct tax position to another tax position that is also correct, the fact the original position was correct is a factor the Commissioner may take into account in deciding whether to exercise the discretion in s 113. As stated by Clifford J in Westpac at \[67\]: There could be any number of valid reasons why the Commissioner may decline to exercise her discretion in situations of regretted correct tax positions including where the taxpayer appears to be gaming the system. ...The fact that Westpac, a well-resourced, sophisticated and well-advised taxpayer says that it “erred” when the relevant offset elections were made may be a proposition that the Commissioner will need to consider carefully when deciding whether or not to exercise her discretion. 10 Arai Korp: Charter Holdings Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (No 2) \[2015\] NZHC 2041, (2015) 27 NZTC 22-022. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 18 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS Two matters flow from these judicial comments. Firstly, whether a taxpayer erred in taking their original tax position is a factor the Commissioner may take into account in deciding whether to make the requested adjustment. A taxpayer could be said to have “erred” where they: (1) did not take the tax position they intended, through mistake or oversight, or (2) the tax position they took, though technically possible and therefore already correct, was not one they would have taken if they had been in possession of all the relevant facts at the time that the original tax position was taken. If the request arises from such a mistake or oversight, it is more likely the amendment will be made than if the request is simply the result of the taxpayer changing their mind. This is because the TAA places an obligation on taxpayers to make correct assessments and it is not contemplated that unlimited additional variations can be made at a cost to the Commissioner. Amendments should not be able to be made merely at will. On this basis, it is unlikely that the Commissioner will agree to on-going requests for changes to tax positions. The Commissioner may also take into account the fact a taxpayer is “well resourced, sophisticated and well advised” (per Clifford J) and therefore generally better equipped to be able to provide evidence that they erred in taking their original position. 62. To allow an amendment in these circumstances may have a negative impact on public perceptions of the integrity of the tax system, especially as they relate to the concepts of statutory timeframes, 11 certainty, and their own future voluntary compliance. In these instances, the decision not to apply the discretion will be made by a senior Inland Revenue officer, after advice from the Legal Services group. How does a taxpayer make a request to amend their assessment? Mode of request 63. A request to correct clear errors, such as arithmetic, transposition and keying errors may be made by telephone or in writing. For the purposes of this Statement the term “in writing” includes a taxpayer modifying their existing tax return by using myIR, as well as other communications with the Commissioner by electronic means. 64. A request to make adjustments other than for these errors must be made as follows: • • Requests to amend returns where the tax effect of the amendment requested is $10,000 or less may be made by telephone or in writing. However, where the request is made by telephone, Inland Revenue may ask that the request be put in writing, especially where, for example, there are consequential adjustments that may need to be made to other returns or taxpayers. • • Requests to amend returns where the tax effect of the amendment requested is greater than $10,000 must be made in writing. 65. To ensure there is a record of the amendment request made by a taxpayer, other than a request to adjust for a clear error (as provided in \[63\]) the ability to accept an amendment request by telephone is limited to calls that are received by Inland Revenue at a site that has call recording. That can be achieved by calling one of Inland Revenue’s 0800 numbers. Where a call is received by a site that does not have call recording, the taxpayer may be asked to put their request in writing. Information required with request 66. The onus is on the taxpayer (or their agent) making amendment requests under s 113 to supply the Commissioner with all relevant information to substantiate the merits of the amendment requested. This information will enable the Commissioner to consider the merits of the amendment request and verify that the amendment will lead to a correct assessment. Providing all relevant information at this early stage will help to have the request dealt with in the truncated phase one/phase four process (see further at \[37\]). 67. Information supplied with the s 113 request should include the following (as relevant): • • the tax types and periods containing the tax position that the taxpayer wishes to amend; • • the decrease in tax liability 12 that will result from any amendment; • • a description of the original tax position, including the background circumstances and the reasons the original tax position was taken; 11 Wilson; Charter Holdings Ltd. 12 An amendment request that results in an increase in the tax payable is a voluntary disclosure and will be dealt with by following the process set out in SPS 19/02 Voluntary disclosures. See \[73\] to \[75\] below Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 19 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS • • the nature of the amendment, including any relevant tax laws; • • how and why the need for the amendment was identified; • • details of any incorrect advice given directly to the taxpayer by Inland Revenue and how the taxpayer relied on that advice; • • the action required to ensure correctness; • • all relevant documents and records or other information supporting the amendment request; • • whether the taxpayer is aware of any relevant view published by the Commissioner and the extent to which the taxpayer’s amended tax position is consistent with that published view. Where an amendment request is made by a taxpayer to modify an existing return using myIR, much of the above information will be supplied while undertaking that modification. The additional information that is required can be provided by the taxpayer in the space that provides for the “description” of the “amendment information”. 68. If insufficient information is provided to enable the Commissioner to confirm that a correct assessment will result from the requested amendment, the request may be declined, or the taxpayer will be asked to supply the required information (if this is known). Where a request is declined because of insufficient information, the taxpayer is able to reapply once the requisite information is obtained. 69. As already stated, whether the Commissioner will devote resources to determine the correctness of the amendment requested is something that will continue to be considered throughout the verification process, using care and management principles. The Commissioner must make appropriate resourcing decisions using these principles, regardless of the effort and resources committed by the taxpayer. Amending assessments Advice to taxpayers 70. Where the decision is made to decline to amend the assessment, the Commissioner will advise the taxpayer or their agent of the decision and the reasons the request was declined. Where the request has been made by telephone, the decision to decline and the reasons for declining the request may be given during the telephone call. If a final decision cannot be given at the time the telephone call is received, the final decision (to decline the request, together with the reasons for declining) may be given either by a telephone call or in writing to the taxpayer (or their agent). Consequential adjustments 71. When amending an assessment, the Commissioner will ensure that all consequential adjustments to other tax types and/ or periods (including other taxpayer’s assessments) are made once they are confirmed by the affected taxpayers. That may mean that in some cases the Commissioner will require further information before making such consequential amendments. Fresh or increased liability 72. Under s 113(2), if any amended assessment imposes a fresh or increased liability, the Commissioner will give notice to the t a xp ayer. Voluntary disclosures 73. For the purposes of this statement, a “voluntary disclosure” is defined as any amendment request that, if accepted by the Commissioner, would result in an increase in the tax payable by a taxpayer or a decrease in the amount of any loss available to be utilised by the taxpayer. 74. Where a taxpayer makes an amendment request that is a voluntary disclosure, that disclosure must follow the process outlined in SPS 19/02 Voluntary disclosures 13 or any statement issued in replacement. Further information on the voluntary disclosure process may also be found in Parts 3 and 4 of the Guide: IR280 Putting your tax returns right. 14 75. Once a taxpayer’s voluntary disclosure has been accepted as being valid by the Commissioner, s 113 provides the legislative authority for effecting the reassessment. Generally, a similar approach to that outlined in this statement will apply, except that the Commissioner will always commit resources to the request (see \[49\]). 13 More information on this statement may be found at www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/ (search keywords: SPS 19/02). 14 More information on this guide may be found at www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword: IR280). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 20 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS Shortfall penalties 76. Where an amendment request that constitutes a voluntary disclosure imposes a fresh liability or increases an existing liability, the taxpayer may also be liable to a shortfall penalty. Whether a shortfall penalty will be imposed and whether the penalty will be reduced to take account of the voluntary disclosure are matters that will be considered as part of the voluntary disclosure process. This is discussed further in SPS 19/02 Voluntary disclosures. Related matters Investigations 77. Inland Revenue undertakes various types of investigation (or auditing) activities. For the purposes of this Statement, an investigation means any examination of a taxpayer’s financial affairs to verify that they have paid the correct amount of tax and complied with their tax obligations. 78. As previously stated (at \[48\]), irrespective of whether there is a current dispute, if the period and tax type relating to an amendment request is already under investigation, the Commissioner will make any appropriate consequential amendments. 79. The Commissioner may make any consequential adjustments (that is, adjustments not requested by the taxpayer under investigation) to the taxpayer’s other assessments or to other taxpayers affected by adjustments resulting from the investigation. The consequential adjustments could relate to the same or different tax types. 80. If the Commissioner agrees with the amendment request, then (subject to the limitations set out below) the amendments will be incorporated into the amended assessment arising from the investigation. The Commissioner cannot amend an assessment (to reflect an amendment request) before finalising the position for the other issues arising from the investigation that affect the assessment; the Commissioner cannot issue a partial assessment. The amendments requested under s 113 will be treated in the same way as any other agreed adjustments arising out of the investigation. Time limits on increasing assessments 81. Generally, the Commissioner cannot increase an amount previously assessed (or decrease the amount of a net loss) after the expiration of four years from the end of the tax year in which the income tax returns were provided (ss 108 and 108A). 82. As stated at \[73\], for the purposes of this Statement, a “voluntary disclosure” is defined as any amendment request that, if accepted by the Commissioner, would result in an increase in the tax payable by a taxpayer or a decrease in the amount of any loss available to be utilised by the taxpayer. Given this, whether the period subject to the voluntary disclosure is time barred is a matter that will be considered as part of that process. Time limits on tax refunds 83. Before the Commissioner is able to refund an amount of overpaid tax, the s 113 discretion must first be exercised. As already stated, where the Commissioner is unable to refund an amount of tax because the period subject to the amendment request is time barred, resources will not be applied to considering the request for that time barred period. Generally, the Commissioner is unable to refund an amount of overpaid tax where the 4-year period in s 108 has expired. For all taxes (other than GST) this rule, together with a number of exceptions to it, is set out in Subpart RM of the Income Tax Act 2007. Time limits on GST refunds 84. As with the refund of other taxes, before the Commissioner will make a refund of overpaid GST, the Commissioner must first decide whether to exercise the s 113 discretion. Where it is decided to apply resources, the general rule is that the Commissioner cannot refund an amount of overpaid GST after the expiry of the 4-year period in s 108A. The exceptions to this general rule are set out in s 45 of the GST Act. If the Commissioner is unable to refund an amount of tax because the period subject to the amendment request is time barred, resources will not be applied to considering the request for that time barred period. Amended assessments after expiry of the 4-year time limit for increasing assessments 85. As noted above, in some instances there are exceptions to the general 4-year time limit for the Commissioner either to increase an amount assessed or make a refund. When a taxpayer requests a refund after the 4-year limitation period, the Commissioner will also incorporate any debit adjustments that would have been made but for the application of the 4-year time limit in any consideration. This will ensure the correctness of the assessment. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 21 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS 86. Given that (generally) the Commissioner cannot increase an assessment outside the 4-year limitation period, if the amount of any required debit adjustment exceeds the refund requested by the taxpayer, the amendment will not be made. Default assessments 87. If the Commissioner has made assessments under s 106 (commonly known as default assessments) and the taxpayer subsequently files tax returns for the relevant periods outside the disputes resolution response periods, the Commissioner will treat the tax returns as requests under s 113. The Commissioner will generally amend the assessments under s 113 after confirming that the tax returns contain correct tax positions. In addition, if the taxpayer is within the relevant disputes resolution response periods, they should consider issuing NOPAs under s 89D(1) along with their tax returns to preserve their dispute rights in circumstances where the Commissioner declines to exercise the discretion in s 113. The relationship between s 113 and s 113A 88. Under s 113, errors are generally required to be corrected in the return period in which they arose. However, s 113A allows taxpayers to correct some errors made in income tax, FBT or GST returns “in the next return that is due after the discovery of the error”. See \[91\] for further discussion on how the Commissioner interprets this phrase. 89. The legislation is clear that s 113A only applies to allow a taxpayer to make an adjustment in their next return. Although s 113A is not available to the Commissioner as a means of amending a taxpayer’s return, a taxpayer may request that they make the adjustment themselves (using s 113A) rather than the Commissioner making any adjustment under s 113. However, when the Commissioner determines it is more appropriate to amend the assessment using s 113, she cannot be prevented from doing so merely because the taxpayer may prefer to use s 113A to make the adjustment in their next return. 90. Section 113A may only apply where the taxpayer has provided a tax return (in which the assessment of their liability contained one or more errors) and the taxpayer (or their agent) has subsequently identified an error, which, for a single return: • • The total discrepancy in the assessment caused by all errors is tax in the amount of $1,000 15 or less. When calculating the $1,000 16 discrepancy, income tax, FBT and GST returns are considered separately; or • • The total tax discrepancy in the assessment caused by all errors is equal to or less than the lesser of: • • $10,000; and • • 2% of the taxpayer’s annual gross income or output tax as applicable. 17 91. The Commissioner accepts that it may take a taxpayer some time to confirm that an error has occurred and the extent of that error. This being so, the phrase “the next return that is due after the discovery of that error” (see \[88\]) means the next return after the taxpayer has completed all the enquiries necessary to confirm the quantum and extent of the error and the reason that the error occurred. 92. An adjustment made under s 113 corrects the return in which the error appeared (the initial return), albeit that the error is physically corrected in a subsequent return. As the initial return is treated as having been corrected it cannot be subsequently amended by the Commissioner in respect of that same error using s 113. 93. While the Commissioner is not prevented from exercising the discretion under s 113 where the taxpayer is able to make the required correction themselves in a later period, the Commissioner’s practice is generally not to expend resources in these circumstances. This is because s 113A provides a specific mechanism by which the taxpayer is able to correct the error themselves. As such, the taxpayer does not need to request that the Commissioner amend an assessment under s 113 to make the correction. 94. Notwithstanding this, in certain circumstances the Commissioner will exercise the discretion under s 113, even where the taxpayer is entitled to make the required corrections using s 113A (per \[89\]). This will generally be when the taxpayer is either unable to make a subsequent adjustment or using s 113A to make that subsequent adjustment is not in the taxpayer’s best interests. For example: • • Where the error has occurred in a taxpayer’s final return for that revenue type and therefore there is no future return in which to make an adjustment under s 113A; • • Where not correcting the error in the earlier period using s 113 will negatively impact an entitlement of the taxpayer. For example, where making the amendment under s 113 will increase the taxpayer’s family tax credit entitlement from that earlier date. 15 Previously $500. Amended by s 112 of the Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017, with effect from 1 April 2017. 16 Above n 15. 17 Inserted by s 76 of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019, with effect from the ate of Royal assent; 18 March 2019. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 22 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS 95. Taxpayers are not required to notify the Commissioner of any correction made using s 113A. However, Inland Revenue may review these adjustments as part of its investigation activity to ensure that the adjustments were correctly made. Inland Revenue expects taxpayers to maintain sufficient records to substantiate any adjustments made and explain why the errors arose in the first place. The usual time bar rules apply to adjustments made under s 113A as apply to s 113. See \[81\] to \[86\] for further discussion. 96. Further information regarding the application of s 113A may be found in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31, No 4 (May 2019), at pages 64 – 66, and Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32, No 4 (May 2020) at pages 69 – 72. The relationship between ss 113, 113A and the proviso to s 20(3) of the GST Act 97. When a registered person has not claimed a GST input tax deduction in an earlier taxable period then the proviso to s 20(3) of the GST Act allows the person to claim that deduction in a later period. As discussed above (at \[88\]), a registered person is also able to use a future return to correct some errors (including input tax deduction errors) by using the provisions of s 113A. This contrasts with the treatment of the same error(s) under s 113, which would be to correct the earlier GST return to which the input tax deduction related. 98. It is the Commissioner’s view that where a registered person is seeking to correct input tax deductions that meet the thresholds set out in s 113A, that provision should be used. Any errors in input tax deduction errors that do not meet the threshold tests are more appropriately corrected under the proviso to s 20(3) of the GST Act. Notwithstanding this however, the Commissioner acknowledges that the use of either provision is discretionary and a registered person may use either s 113A or s 20(3) of the GST Act to correct an input tax deduction error. Accordingly, despite the Commissioner’s view on the appropriate approach, the Commissioner accepts that either provision may be used to correct these GST errors in a subsequent return (subject to the threshold tests). 99. While the Commissioner is not prevented from exercising the discretion under s 113, the presence of the specific provision in s 20(3) of the GST Act for this type of GST error means that the Commissioner’s practice is generally not to exercise the discretion in these circumstances. Because s 20(3) of the GST Act provides taxpayers with a specific mechanism to correct a GST input tax deduction error, the Commissioner’s view is that a general provision such as s 113 should not be used. For further guidance see QB 09/04 The relationship between section 113 of the TAA and the proviso to section 20(3) of the GST Act when a registered person has not claimed an input tax deduction in an earlier taxable period. 18 This outcome is considered to be more consistent with the scheme of the legislation and in particular s 15B of the TAA, which requires taxpayers correctly determine the amount of tax payable (and make an assessment). The relationship between s 113 and s 22G of the TAA 100. The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 introduced changes that simplified individuals’ year-end filing obligations and introduced a simplified method for correcting errors in some circumstances, without going through the formal disputes resolution process. Correcting pre- and post-assessment errors for qualifying individuals before their terminal tax due date 101. Section 22D(2) introduced a number of terms. The term “qualifying individual” means an individual who only earns “reportable income” for an income year and has no other income information that must be provided to Inland Revenue. “Reportable income” is defined in s 22D(3) and means income that Inland Revenue receives regular information about, typically from third parties (such as employers) during the income year or by 31 May following the end of the income year. This includes PAYE income payments, along with resident and non-resident passive income (where the third parties have the recipient’s tax file number). 102. Section 22G(2) provides that a qualifying individual (or an individual who has been treated as a qualifying individual) may amend the income information in their pre-populated account prior to an assessment. Section 22G(5) also allows the Commissioner to amend incorrect pre-assessment income information. 103. Once the Commissioner is satisfied that the income information is correctly and completely recorded, the Commissioner will finalise the taxpayer’s account for the tax year. 19 By virtue of s 22I, when the account is finalised the taxpayer is treated as having made a return of income that is a statement of the taxpayer’s tax position and an assessment under s 92 in relation to the return. 18 More information on this statement may be found at www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/ (search keywords: QB 09/04). 19 Section 22H. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 23 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS 104. Section 22G(3) provides that a qualifying individual may also amend the income information in their finalised account at any time before their terminal tax date for the tax year. Where the taxpayer’s final account is amended under s 22G(3), the amended information forms a new assessment and any earlier assessment for the tax year is regarded as not having been made. Because there is no prior assessment, s 113 is not engaged. This new process does not amend an assessment. It creates a new original assessment instead. 105. This means that when a taxpayer who is a qualifying individual (or is mistakenly treated as such), amends their final assessment under s 22G(3) prior to their terminal tax date, they will not be subject to penalties or interest (unless they are subject to the provisional tax regime). 106. Notwithstanding a taxpayer’s ability under s 22G(3) to correct their final account income information, s 22G(4) clarifies that if the Commissioner has reason to believe the amended income information is incorrect, the Commissioner can decide not to accept the taxpayer’s amendment and make a default assessment under s 106. This process protects the integrity of the tax system by ensuring that the Commissioner’s assessment is not immediately displaced with an incorrect assessment. Rather, disputed amendments of this nature are processed under the existing disputes rules. Correction of post-assessment errors by the Commissioner for qualifying individuals 107. Section 22G(6) provides that the Commissioner may amend income information in a qualifying individual’s final account for the tax year to correct errors in the information provided to a taxpayer at any time before the end of the time bar period in s 108(1), by notifying the individual of the amendment. This means that the Commissioner can correct the final accounts without first issuing a NOPA. Section 22G(6) is limited to qualifying individuals because it reflects the way in which qualifying individual’s assessments are finalised by the Commissioner. It does not apply to instances where the Commissioner disagrees with an adjustment proposed by a taxpayer (see \[105\] for this discussion). Later requests for changes by qualifying individuals 108. When an individual wishes to amend the income information in their final account after their terminal tax date, s 22G(8) provides that the individual may make a request to the Commissioner to amend their final account under s 113. Correction of post-assessment errors of “other income” earners 109. “Other income earners” are those taxpayers that have income other than reportable income, that must be provided to Inland Revenue. An individual who is an “other income earner” and has finalised their account (per s 22H(2)) but wishes to amend their assessment after the account has been finalised, must either request an amendment from the Commissioner under s 113, or they may choose to issue a NOPA if they are still within the applicable response period (s 22G(8)). Similarly, when the Commissioner wishes to make an adjustment in relation to an individual, other than a qualifying individual, s 22G(7) requires the Commissioner to first issue a NOPA under s 89B. Other matters 110. It is noted that the use of s 22G is discretionary: a taxpayer may use the section to amend income information. Given this, the Commissioner accepts that, provided the adjustment meets the threshold tests, taxpayers may use s 113A to correct errors in a subsequent return. 111. As stated previously (at \[103\]) once the Commissioner is satisfied that the income information is correctly and completely recorded, the Commissioner will finalise the taxpayer’s account for the tax year. 20 When the account is finalised, s 22I provides that the taxpayer is treated as having made a return of income, that is a statement of the taxpayer’s tax position, and an assessment under s 92 in relation to the return. Having taken a tax position, the shortfall penalty provision may have application to any incorrect tax positions taken by a taxpayer. 112. Further information regarding the application of s 22G may be found in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 312, No 4 (May 2019) at pages 6-15. Challenge rights 113. A taxpayer cannot challenge the exercise of the Commissioner’s discretion (or a decision not to exercise this discretion) under s 113 by commencing proceedings in a hearing authority. 21 However, any decision under s 113 may be subject to judicial review. 20 Section 22H. 21 Section 138E(1)(e)(iv). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 24 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS Reconsideration and complaint rights 114. If a taxpayer is concerned that their circumstances have not been given proper consideration, they should raise their concern with the staff member that considered their request and ask for the decision to be reviewed by a more senior officer. 115. If a taxpayer is still not satisfied with the level of service they receive, they can obtain more information about the Inland Revenue complaints management service at www.ird.govt.nz/contactus/complaints-disputes-compliments/complaints or phone 0800 274 138 (Monday to Friday, between 8am and 5pm).

Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 26 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS Section 113A: Correction of certain errors in subsequent returns (1) This section applies for the purposes of this Act and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 when- (a) A person- (i) has made an assessment of income tax or goods and services tax in a return that results in a tax liability for the person; or (ii) has provided a return that results in a liability for fringe benefit tax for the person; and (b) 1 or more errors in the assessment or return, as applicable, cause a tax discrepancy in the amount of the liability. (2) This section does not apply in relation to an assessment or return for an ancillary tax other than fringe benefit tax as described in subsection (1)(a)(ii). (3) If the total tax discrepancy amounts to $1,000 or less, the person may make correction in the next return that is due after the discovery of the error or errors. (3B) If the total tax discrepancy is caused by an error or errors that, for the person, is not a material error or are note material errors, the person may make a correction in the next return that is due after the discovery of the error or errors.

Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 27 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS This section of the TIB contains interpretation statements issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. These statements set out the Commissioner's view on how the law applies to a particular set of circumstances when it is either not possible or not appropriate to issue a binding public ruling. In most cases Inland Revenue will assess taxpayers in line with the following interpretation statements. However, our statutory duty is to make correct assessments, so we may not necessarily assess taxpayers on the basis of earlier advice if at the time of the assessment we consider that the earlier advice is not consistent with the law. INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS IS 20/02: Goods and services tax – supplies by New Zealand hunting outfitters and taxidermists to overseas hunters All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. Scope of this Interpretation Statement 1. This Interpretation Statement considers the GST treatment of supplies made by New Zealand hunting guides or outfitters and taxidermists to overseas hunters. It explains which supplies of goods and services made to overseas hunters are standard-rated and which are zero-rated for GST purposes. 2. This Interpretation Statement replaces three earlier public statements the Commissioner made on GST and hunting and taxidermy supplies to overseas hunters: • • “Trophies and animal products derived from the tourist, hunting and safari industry – zero-rating under GST” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 9, No 6 (June 1997): 1; • • “Trophies and animal products derived from the tourist, hunting and safari industry – zero-rating under GST” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 15, No 7 (July 2003): 23; and • • “QWBA 07/04: Trophies and animal products derived from the tourist, hunting and safari industry that are to be mounted in New Zealand – zero-rating” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 19, No 7 (August 2007): 19. Structure of this Interpretation Statement 3. This Interpretation Statement is summarised in \[4\] to \[12\]. A detailed legal analysis of the transactions between outfitters, taxidermists and overseas hunters is in \[13\] to \[139\]. Four examples then illustrate the application of the GST rules in a practical context (from \[141\]). Summary of this Interpretation Statement 4. For clarity, in this Interpretation Statement the Commissioner of Inland Revenue uses certain terms to assist with her analysis and explanations of how the GST rules apply to the industry. It is important this Interpretation Statement is read in the context of these terms: • • New Zealand hunting outfitters and guides who provide hunting experiences for overseas hunters visiting New Zealand are referred to collectively as “outfitters”; • • outfitters and taxidermists are referred to collectively as the “industry”; • • “trophy fee” refers to the amount paid by the hunter for the opportunity to hunt and kill the animal and for its souvenir parts. It is a separate amount from amounts paid by the hunter for accommodation, food and the like. • • “souvenir animal parts” refers to the parts of a trophy hunting animal killed by a hunter (for example, heads, shoulders, skins, antlers and bodies) that may later be expedited or mounted; • • “hunting souvenir” refers to the souvenir animal parts once they have been expedited or mounted by a taxidermist; • • “expediting” refers to the processes used by taxidermists to preserve and prepare souvenir animal parts ready for mounting; and • • “mounting” refers to the process used by taxidermists of using the expedited souvenir animal parts to create life-like hunting souvenirs. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 28 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 5. In the Commissioner’s view, for GST purposes, an outfitter makes: • • one composite GST supply to the hunter of a hunting experience in New Zealand; or • • two separate GST supplies where souvenir animal parts or hunting souvenirs are supplied by the outfitter, being: –a single composite supply of a hunting experience in New Zealand; and –the supply of souvenir animal parts or a hunting souvenir. 6. In the Commissioner’s view, the outfitter’s single composite supply of a New Zealand hunting experience to an overseas hunter is a standard-rated supply of goods and services. This means GST is charged on the supply by the outfitter at the standard rate of 15%. All the elements of the single composite supply will be standard-rated for GST purposes. A deposit triggers the time of supply. 7. Different GST treatments apply to the supply of souvenir animal parts or hunting souvenirs, depending on the circumstances and contractual arrangements between the parties. When a supply is referred to as being “zero-rated” that means GST is charged on the supply by the outfitter (or the taxidermist) at the rate of 0%. This Interpretation Statement sets out six scenarios involving supplies of souvenir animal parts or hunting souvenirs for export: • • Scenario 1 – No supply of exported wild souvenir animal parts by outfitter; • • Scenario 2 – Standard-rated supply of souvenir animal parts by outfitter; • • Scenario 3 – Zero-rated supply of hunting souvenir by outfitter using an independent taxidermist; • • Scenario 4 – Zero-rated supply of hunting souvenir by outfitter using an in-house taxidermist; • • Scenario 5 – Zero-rated supply of souvenir animal parts by outfitter and zero-rated supply of taxidermy services by taxidermist; and • • Scenario 6 – Zero-rated supply of hunting souvenir by taxidermist. 8. Before souvenir animal parts can be entered for export and exported to the overseas hunter they must at least be expedited by a taxidermist. That taxidermist might be employed by the outfitter or operate independently. Taxidermists usually process or work on souvenir animal parts owned by someone else, such as an outfitter or a hunter. Therefore, when they expedite or mount souvenir animal parts, they are providing a taxidermy service. Only when taxidermists sell hunting souvenirs they own themselves will they be making supplies of goods. 9. Once a taxidermist has completed working on the hunting souvenir, they will usually crate and pack it ready for shipping overseas. The GST treatment of the crating and packing services is the same as the GST treatment of the taxidermy services. However, the costs of arranging insurance and transport and of transporting goods overseas are zero-rated. 10. Where souvenir animal parts or hunting souvenirs are supplied by an outfitter to the overseas hunter and the outfitter in the course of, or as a condition of, the supply enters those parts or souvenirs for export and exports them within 28 days, the supply is zero-rated. On application by an outfitter (or their agent), an extension period for exporting will generally be allowed by the Commissioner. An outfitter may make one application for an extension of time for future supplies of souvenir animal parts or hunting souvenirs for export. If the Commissioner is satisfied a determination covering those future supplies is appropriate, she may make one. 11. Valuation of GST supplies is particularly important where a supplier is making a mixture of standard-rated and zero-rated supplies to an overseas person. The Commissioner considers a “trophy fee”, as that term is used in the industry, is for both the outfitter’s supply of souvenir animal parts or hunting souvenirs and the opportunity to hunt and kill a particular breed and quality of animal during the supply of a hunting experience. 12. The value attached to those separate supplies for GST purposes should properly represent the consideration paid for those separate supplies of goods and services. The onus is on taxpayers to show that a payment has been made in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of, a supply. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 29 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Introduction to the legal analysis 13. New Zealand outfitters supply hunting trips in New Zealand to overseas hunters. Overseas hunters who purchase these hunting trips usually come to New Zealand expecting to have the opportunity to hunt and kill particular breeds and quality of animals. If the hunt is successful and some souvenir animal parts are recoverable, then, in the absence of any other arrangements, the hunter may also expect those souvenir animal parts to be exported to them overseas. Hunting in New Zealand might take place on an outfitter’s game estate, private land with permission or Crown land with appropriate permits. 14. Outfitters supply a variety of goods and services to overseas hunters during their visit to New Zealand such as airport transfers and accommodation, guiding, licences, the use of firearms and, sometimes, helicopter flights. On some occasions, if the overseas hunter is a member of Safari Club International, an animal may be given a score before it is killed so a Safari Club International record book entry can be made. 15. After a hunt, if an animal’s carcass is recoverable and in a suitable condition, some souvenir animal parts may be taken from it. The GST treatment of the supply of those animal parts and the associated taxidermy depends on the contractual arrangements between the parties. For example: • • taxidermy and exporting of the souvenir animal parts as a hunting souvenir might be included in the outfitter’s package or it might be negotiated by the outfitter for an additional fee; • • the souvenir animal parts might be supplied for export by the outfitter, with the hunter contracting with a New Zealand taxidermist separately for the taxidermy; or • • the hunter might contract separately with a New Zealand taxidermist for expediting or mounting services, and on completion the hunting souvenir is exported to the hunter overseas by the taxidermist. 16. Overseas hunters may pay outfitters for an all-inclusive hunting package or the hunt price may be calculated using a price list for all the different goods and services supplied by the outfitter. Whatever the arrangement, it is usual for an overseas hunter to pay the outfitter a deposit at the time of booking to secure their hunt dates. Legislation 17. GST is a consumption tax. It is intended to tax supplies consumed in New Zealand. Generally, a GST-registered person making a supply in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity must charge GST at the prevailing standard rate on the supply (see s 8(1)). However, where the goods and services will not be consumed in New Zealand (for example, where goods are being sold and exported by the supplier to an overseas customer) the GST zero-rating rules apply to modify the general rule in s 8(1) by reducing the rate of GST that must be charged to 0% (see ss 11 and 11A). 18. To determine the GST treatment of supplies made by a New Zealand outfitter or taxidermist to an overseas hunter, two questions need to be answered: • • First, are the supplies made to the overseas hunter subject to GST under s 8(1)? • • Then, if the answer to the first question is yes, are those supplies zero-rated under s 11 or s 11A? Supplies subject to GST 19. Section 8(1) provides that GST is charged on the supply in New Zealand of goods and services by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person: 8 Imposition of goods and services tax on supply (1) Subject to this Act, a tax, to be known as goods and services tax, shall be charged in accordance with the provisions of this Act at the rate of 15% on the supply (but not including an exempt supply) in New Zealand of goods and services, on or after 1 October 1986, by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person, by reference to the value of that supply. \[Emphasis added\] 20. Accordingly, where supplies are made in New Zealand to an overseas hunter by a New Zealand outfitter or taxidermist and those supplies are made in the course or furtherance of their taxable activities, GST is chargeable on those supplies by reference to the value of the supply. It is assumed the New Zealand outfitter or taxidermist is registered for GST purposes and is carrying on a taxable activity in New Zealand. (The valuation of supplies is discussed at \[113\] to \[123\].) 21. Further, s 8(2) deems goods and services to be supplied in New Zealand, if the supplier is resident in New Zealand. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 30 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 22. Therefore, even though an overseas hunter might purchase their hunting package overseas, or might enter into a contract with the outfitter overseas, this does not prevent GST from being charged on the supply. This is because the supplies will be made in New Zealand by a New Zealand–resident, GST-registered person in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity. The place where the contract is entered into or where payment is made is not relevant to the GST treatment of the supply. 23. (Deposits, the time of supply and the impact of overseas intermediaries are discussed at \[125\] to \[135\].) Zero-rated supplies 24. The second question concerns the rate at which a supplier should charge GST on those supplies: the standard rate of 15% or the reduced rate of 0%. The residence of the customer or whether any goods supplied are being exported overseas by the supplier can be relevant factors when determining whether a supply of goods or services is zero-rated, as these factors might indicate that the goods and services will not be consumed in New Zealand. 25. The zero-rating rules are divided into two parts: s 11 addresses the zero-rating of supplies of goods and s 11A addresses the zero-rating of supplies of services. Zero-rating of goods 26. Paragraphs (a) to (eb) of s 11(1) are relevant to supplies of goods to overseas hunters. 27. Section 11(1)(a) to (eb) provides that a supply of goods that is chargeable with tax under s 8 must be zero-rated (and not standard-rated) in the following situations: (1) A supply of goods that is chargeable with tax under section 8 must be charged at the rate of 0% in the following situations: (a) the supplier has entered the goods for export under the Customs and Excise Act 1996 and the goods have been exported by the supplier; or (b) the goods have been deemed to be entered for export under the Customs and Excise Act 1996 and the goods have been exported by the supplier; or (c) the supplier has satisfied the Commissioner that the goods have been exported by the supplier to a place outside New Zealand; or (d) subject to subsection (4), the supplier will enter the goods for export under the Customs and Excise Act 1996 in the course of, or as a condition of, making the supply, and will export the goods; or (e) subject to subsection (4), the goods will be deemed to be entered for export under the Customs and Excise Act 1996 and will be exported by the supplier in the course of, or as a condition of, making the supply; or (eb) subject to subsection (4), the goods supplied— (i) are supplied to a recipient who is a non-resident; and (ii) have been entered for export under the Customs and Excise Act 1996 by the supplier or will be entered for export by the supplier in the course of or as a condition of making the supply; and (iii) are exported by the recipient; and (iv) are not intended by the recipient for later importation into New Zealand for use other than in making taxable supplies or exempt supplies, with the absence of such an intention being confirmed by the recipient in a document retained by the supplier; and (v) are not used or altered by the recipient before being exported, except to the extent necessary to prepare the goods for export; and (vi) leave New Zealand under an arrangement agreed by the supplier and the recipient at or before the time of the supply; and (vii) do not leave New Zealand in the possession of a passenger or crew member of an aircraft or ship; 28. It is assumed: • • the New Zealand outfitter or taxidermist is registered for GST purposes and is carrying on a taxable activity in New Zealand; and • • the overseas hunter is not GST registered and is not carrying on a taxable activity in New Zealand. 29. Essentially, s 11(1)(a) to (c) requires that: • • the supplier has entered the goods for export or the goods have been deemed to be entered for export; and • • the goods have been exported by the supplier; or • • the supplier has satisfied the Commissioner that the goods have been exported by the supplier to a place outside New Zealand. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 31 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 30. A supply of goods may also be zero-rated if s 11(1)(d) or s 11(1)(e) applies. Subject to s 11 (4), that is where: • • in the course of, or as a condition of, making the supply the supplier will enter the goods, or the goods will be deemed to be entered, for export under the Customs and Excise Act 1996; and • • the goods will be exported by the supplier. 31. Section 11(1)(eb) is essentially the same as s 11(1)(d) in that it requires a supply of goods to be zero-rated where the supplier will enter the goods for export in the course of, or as a condition of, making the supply but, under s 11(1)(eb) the goods are exported by the purchaser (not the supplier). This means that while the goods will be entered for export by the supplier, it is the customer who causes them to be removed from New Zealand and sent to another country. The provision was added to the Act to take account of goods being exported from New Zealand by an overseas customer on free-on-board terms (that is, where the customer (rather than the supplier) pays the cost of transporting the goods from New Zealand). Section 11(1)(eb) does not apply where the goods are delivered to the overseas customer in New Zealand before they are exported. 32. Paragraphs (d), (e) and (eb) of s 11(1) are each subject to s 11(4), so zero-rating does not apply unless the supplier exports the goods from New Zealand within 28 days from the time of supply (or such longer period allowed by the Commissioner). For GST purposes, the time of supply is usually the earlier of the time when an invoice is issued or the time any payment is received by the supplier (for example, when a deposit is received by the supplier (or their agent): see s 9(1)). 33. The Commissioner has a discretion to extend the 28-day period within which goods must be exported to allow zero-rating (see s 11(5)). For an extension, it must not be practicable for the supplier to export the goods within 28 days. Where an extension is granted, the supply can be zero-rated so long as export occurs within the term of the extension. (The Commissioner’s extension for hunting souvenirs is addressed at \[136\] to \[139\].) Zero-rating of services 34. Section 11A specifies those supplies of services that may be zero-rated for GST purposes. Of relevance to New Zealand outfitters and taxidermists are paras (k) and (m) of s 11A(1). 35. Section 11A(1)(k) provides that a supply of services that is chargeable with tax under s 8 may be zero-rated where the customer of the supply is a non-resident and is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed, unless one of the exclusions in subparas (i) to (iii) applies. Of relevance to New Zealand outfitters and taxidermists is subpara (ii): (k) subject to subsection (2), the services are supplied to a person who is a non-resident and who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed, not being services which are— (i) supplied directly in connection with land situated in New Zealand, or with an improvement to such land, or are supplied in connection with such land or improvement and are intended to enable or assist a change in the physical condition, or ownership or other legal status, of the land or improvement; or (ii) supplied directly in connection with moveable personal property, other than choses in action or goods to which paragraph (h) or (i) applies, situated in New Zealand at the time the services are performed; or (iii) the acceptance of an obligation to refrain from carrying on a taxable activity, to the extent to which the activity would have occurred within New Zealand ... \[Emphasis added\] 36. It is assumed that the overseas hunter is a non-resident in New Zealand for the duration of their hunt and is otherwise outside New Zealand. 37. Services provided to an overseas hunter while they are present in New Zealand are not zero-rated. Generally, services provided to an overseas hunter in connection with moveable personal property situated in New Zealand at the time the services are performed will not be zero-rated under s 11A(1)(k), even if the hunter is overseas at the time. This is because in both those circumstances the services are seen as being consumed in New Zealand, so are subject to GST at the standard rate. 38. However, services supplied directly in connection with goods, which are a zero-rated supply of exported goods under s 11(1)(a) to (eb), can be zero-rated under s 11A(1)(m) where the supply of services is made to a non-resident who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed: (m) the services are supplied— (i) directly in connection with goods, the supply of which was subject to any one of section 11(1)(a) to (eb); and (ii) to a recipient who, when the services are performed, is a non-resident and outside New Zealand; Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 32 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Identifying the GST supplies in a transaction 39. Before applying the GST rules in ss 8, 11 and 11A to outfitters and taxidermists, it is necessary to first understand the nature of the transaction being entered into by the parties. A transaction may comprise many different elements that together or separately may amount to supplies for GST purposes. The approach of the New Zealand courts when seeking to identify the GST supplies in a transaction has been to consider the true nature of the legal arrangements actually entered into and carried out by the supplier and the customer in light of the surrounding circumstances: Marac Life Assurance Ltd v CIR (1986) 8 NZTC 5,086 (CA); CIR v Gulf Harbour Development Ltd (2004) 21 NZTC 18,915 (CA). 40. Sometimes, where a transaction involves multiple elements, it might be unclear whether there is one composite GST supply (of multiple elements) or multiple separate GST supplies. In those circumstances, the transaction must be analysed to determine the supplies made for GST purposes. This can be important for several reasons, for example if there are multiple separate supplies, then some of those supplies might be standard-rated and others might be zero-rated. Also, separate supplies might have different times of supply, which can be important for knowing when GST needs to be returned, when currency conversions need to be made or when extensions of time for exporters expire. 41. Case law has established numerous principles to assist in determining the separate supplies made for GST purposes. These principles are discussed in detail, with practical examples, in “IS 18/04: Goods and services tax – single supply or multiple supplies” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 30, No 10 (November 2018): 5. 42. IS 18/04 summarises (at \[35\] to \[39\]) the leading New Zealand decision on single and multiple supplies (Auckland Institute of Studies Ltd v CIR (2002) 20 NZTC 17,685 (HC)). It sets out the approach to be taken when analysing a transaction to determine whether there is one composite supply (of multiple elements) or multiple separate supplies: 35. ... In Auckland Institute, Hansen J considered the GST treatment of supplies to international students studying in New Zealand. The taxpayer provided tuition services to students coming to New Zealand from overseas. An associated company provided pre-arrival services. The students paid a single “global fee” to the taxpayer for all supplies from both the taxpayer and the associated company. One of the issues before the Court was whether it was appropriate to split the supply to enable the pre- arrival services to be zero-rated. 36. Hansen J discussed the approach of the House of Lords in Card Protection Plan v Customs & Excise Commissioners \[2001\] 2 All ER 143. In that case, the House of Lords considered whether a credit card protection plan offered to cardholders was a single composite supply or two independent supplies comprising the supply of VAT-exempt insurance and a separate supply of VAT-chargeable card registration services. The House of Lords concluded the dominant supply was of VAT-exempt insurance and the supply of the card registration services was ancillary to the exempt supply. In Auckland Institute, Hansen J summarised the principles from Card Protection Plan for determining whether a supply could be separated into multiple supplies (at \[32\]): • Every supply of a service must normally be regarded as distinct and independent. • A supply which comprises a single service from an economic point of view should not be artificially split, so as not to distort the functioning of the VAT system. • The essential features of a transaction must be ascertained in order to determine whether the taxable person is supplying the customer, being a typical consumer, with several distinct principal services or with a single service. • There is a single supply in particular in cases where one or more elements are to be regarded as constituting the principal service whilst one or more elements are to be regarded, by contrast, as ancillary services which share the tax treatment of the principal service. A service must be regarded as ancillary to a principal service if it does not constitute for customers an aim in itself, but a means of better enjoying the principal service supplied. • Even if a single price is charged which may indicate a single supply, it must still be considered whether the arrangements indicated that the customer intended to purchase two distinct services. 37. After reviewing all the relevant authorities, Hansen J summarised the principles for determining whether a supply could be separated into multiple supplies (with one or more differing GST treatments) (at \[36\]): \[a\] In determining whether a supply may be apportioned for GST purposes, it is necessary to examine the true and substantial nature of the consideration given to determine whether there is a sufficient distinction between the allegedly different parts to make it reasonable to sever them and apportion them accordingly. \[b\] The enquiry is to determine whether one element of the transaction (or consideration given) is a necessary or integral part of another or whether it is merely ancillary to or incidental to that other element. \[c\] A service will be ancillary to a principal service if it does not constitute for customers an aim in itself, but a means of better enjoying the principal service supplied. 38. Based on these principles, the Commissioner considers it helpful to ask three questions when analysing the transaction: • What is the true and substantial nature of what is supplied to the recipient? • What are the relationships between the elements supplied? • Is it reasonable to sever the elements into separate supplies? 39. When answering these questions, it is important to consider the supply from the perspective of a typical customer. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 33 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Determining the GST supplies made by outfitters 43. In some arrangements, the outfitter and the hunter agree that, when recoverable, the outfitter will supply souvenir animal parts to the overseas hunter but the outfitter does not agree to export those parts or any hunting souvenir to the hunter. In that case, an outfitter’s transaction with an overseas hunter ends at the conclusion of the hunt with the delivery of any souvenir animal parts to the hunter. It then falls to the overseas hunter to arrange with a taxidermist for their souvenir animal parts to be expedited or mounted and exported overseas to them. Sometimes the outfitter might suggest a suitable taxidermist and deliver the hunter’s souvenir animal parts to that taxidermist, but the outfitter has no contractual responsibility to the hunter beyond the end of the hunt. 44. In other cases, the contractual arrangements between an outfitter and a hunter might specify that after the hunt the outfitter will supply and export to the overseas hunter: • • any souvenir animal parts recovered by the outfitter from the animal killed by the hunter; or • • a hunting souvenir expedited or mounted by the outfitter from the recovered souvenir animal parts. 45. To determine the GST supplies made by an outfitter to an overseas hunter, the transaction between them needs to be considered from the hunter’s perspective. In the Commissioner’s view, when a hunter visits New Zealand the hunter is seeking to obtain the following elements from the outfitter: • • the experience of hunting in New Zealand, including elements such as: –airport transfers to and from the hunting lodge; –accommodation and meals; –guiding services; –the opportunity to kill particular breeds and quality of animals; –transport around the hunting grounds; –licences and permits; –gun hire; –Safari Club International point scoring; and • • if the hunt is successful (which they invariably are), some souvenir animal parts taken from the hunted and killed animals (which may or may not form part of the hunt transaction agreed between the outfitter and the hunter). 46. The experience of hunting in New Zealand, in particular, the opportunity to hunt certain animals of a particular breed and quality, and the potential of taking home a hunting souvenir from an animal hunted and killed by the hunter, are the two key elements that an overseas hunter seeks when purchasing a hunt in New Zealand. Some hunters may be more focussed on enjoying the New Zealand hunting experience, while other hunters may be more interested in obtaining the hunting souvenir. However, whatever their motivation, to some extent both elements are supplied by outfitters to the hunter in New Zealand. 47. As explained in IS 18/04 at \[46\], when determining if the supply of those elements are separate GST supplies or a single composite GST supply what is important is not whether one element is ancillary or incidental to, or even a necessary or integral part of, the whole, but whether one element is merely ancillary or incidental to, or a necessary or integral part of, any other element of the transaction. 48. The hunting experience in New Zealand can occur without the hunter taking a hunting souvenir from an animal hunted and killed by the hunter. Accordingly, the Commissioner does not think a hunter would consider the hunting experience to be ancillary or incidental to the taking of a hunting souvenir. The hunting experience is an aim in itself, whether or not a hunting souvenir is taken. 49. In the Commissioner’s view the hunting experience includes the opportunity to hunt and kill animals of a certain breed and quality while in New Zealand. It is not possible for the hunter to enjoy that opportunity without participating in the hunting experience. Therefore, the hunter cannot have the desired hunting experience in New Zealand without: • • the outfitter doing its best to ensure the desired animals are available to be hunted; • • being transported and guided by the outfitter; and • • having somewhere to eat and sleep while hunting and transport to get to and from the hunting lodge. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 34 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 50. Accordingly, the Commissioner sees these elements as a necessary or integral part of the outfitter supplying a hunting experience in New Zealand to a hunter. Therefore, they are indicative of the supply of the hunting experience being a single composite supply. (In any event, in practice, all these elements have the same GST treatment, that is, they are all standard- rated as they are supplied in New Zealand.) 51. On the other hand, in the Commissioner’s view, the taking of any hunting souvenir is not incidental to or necessary to the supply of the hunting experience. It is acknowledged that a hunting souvenir cannot be supplied without the hunting experience occurring but taking a hunting souvenir is not an integral or necessary part of a hunting experience. An outfitter’s supply of any souvenir animal parts or a hunting souvenir from an animal killed by the hunter is a separate supply in its own right. In the case of overseas hunters, the supply of the hunting experience does not so dominate any supply of the souvenir animal parts or hunting souvenir that the supply of the parts or hunting souvenir loses its separate identity for fiscal purposes. 52. Given the somewhat uncertain nature of the supply of souvenir animal parts (that is, the outfitter and hunter do not know with certainty if and what souvenir animal parts will be able to be supplied until an animal is actually hunted and killed by the hunter), it is reasonable to sever the supply of souvenir animal parts from the supply of the hunting experience (and its associated elements). 53. As discussed in IS 18/04 at \[57\] and \[58\], the fact some outfitters may sell a hunter an “all-inclusive” hunt, including souvenir animal parts or a hunting souvenir, for a single payment does not mean that the outfitter is making only one single composite supply in that situation: 57. It appears from the cases cited above that the “reasonable” test focuses on the essential purpose of the transaction and on the elements themselves (whether there is a sufficient distinction between the elements to make it reasonable to sever them and apportion accordingly) rather than on whether a separate amount is charged for the element in question or on how easily a global fee can be apportioned. 58. Further, one of the principles from Card Protection Plan for determining whether a supply could be separated into multiple supplies (as summarised in Auckland Institute (at \[32\]) is: Even if a single price is charged which may indicate a single supply, it must still be considered whether the arrangements indicated that the customer intended to purchase two distinct services. 54. In reality, even when a package is sold as “all inclusive”, the initial price is only an estimate as there are usually additional payments that cannot be calculated until the conclusion of the hunt when it is known precisely what animals have been killed, what souvenir animal parts will be supplied and what additional elements relating to the hunt have been enjoyed in New Zealand. 55. Therefore, objectively, the Commissioner considers it would not be artificial where souvenir animal parts or a hunting souvenir are supplied together with the hunt to split the transaction into two separate supplies for GST purposes. 56. Taking all these matters into account, when the transaction between the outfitter and the hunter is looked at objectively, and from the hunter’s point of view, the Commissioner concludes for GST purposes an outfitter makes either: • • one composite GST supply to the hunter of a hunting experience in New Zealand; or • • where souvenir animal parts or a hunting souvenir are supplied by the outfitter along with the hunt, two separate GST supplies being: –a single composite supply of a hunting experience in New Zealand; and –the supply of souvenir animal parts or a hunting souvenir. Determining the GST supplies made by taxidermists 57. In addition to identifying whether a transaction comprises a single composite supply of multiple elements or separate supplies for GST purposes, it is also important to be clear whether a supply is a supply of goods or a supply of services. Usually this distinction is relatively clear, but sometimes it is not (for example, where work and materials are supplied together). This distinction is especially important when determining whether a supply is zero-rated because different zero- rating rules apply depending on whether the supply is a supply of goods (see s 11) or a supply of services (see s 11A). 58. Taxidermists usually process or work on souvenir animal parts like raw animal hides and antlers owned by their customer, such as a hunter or an outfitter. When souvenir animal parts are delivered to a taxidermist by a customer to be worked on, those parts will usually remain the property of the customer. The legal relationship between a taxidermist and their customer is one of bailment. This was confirmed in the Canadian decision Moher v Wildlife Originals by Clarence Kriaski \[2019\] AJ No. 16. While Moher does not address tax issues, it does address the issue of ownership of souvenir animal parts deposited with a taxidermist to be worked on: Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 35 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Particular kind of bailment 178 In this case, Moher did not deliver his hides to Kriaski simply to be stored i.e. for eventual redelivery in their original form. He delivered them instead to be altered i.e. to be tanned and mounted and then returned for display in Moher's trophy barn. This is still a bailment, as the definition's reference to "or an altered form" makes clear. 179 If it were necessary to categorize this arrangement under the traditional categories of bailment, the bailment here would be a location operis faciendi. As defined in Palmer on Bailment, this variety of bailment arises: ... when goods or chattels are delivered \[ ... and ...\] something is to be done about them, for a reward to be paid by the person who delivers them to the bailee, who is to do the thing about them. 180 In this case, the "something to be done about them" was the tanning and mounting work to be performed by Kriaski. 181 Palmer expands on such bailments: Locatio operis faciendi therefore contains two elements: a contact for services, coupled with a bailment of the article upon which those services are to be performed. The goods will remain in the bailee's possession until the work is completed and will then be returned to the bailor ... in accordance with his or her instructions. A wide range of everyday commercial activities, including dry-cleaning, laundering, repair, valuation, auctioneering, alteration and the treatment of sick animals, may therefore fall within this category of bailment. 182 To these examples, I would add taxidermy services, where animal hides or other "bases" are to be converted into trophies or other preserved forms. 59. This decision is consistent with New Zealand law on bailment. The fact some souvenir animal parts are less valuable to the customer and may be substituted with replacement parts if they are damaged, does not, in the Commissioner’s view, alter this legal relationship. Similarly, the fact a taxidermist can withhold (or if necessary, sell) the completed hunting souvenir to recover unpaid moneys owed by the customer does not alter this legal relationship. 60. Therefore, when a taxidermist expedites or mounts a customer’s souvenir animal parts, they are providing a taxidermy service and not supplying a good. In the Commissioner’s view, the materials a taxidermist uses to expedite or mount souvenir animal parts are incidental to the taxidermy services they supply and are not a separate supply of goods. Only when taxidermists sell expedited souvenir animal parts or hunting souvenirs created from souvenir animal parts that they themselves own will they be making supplies of goods. 61. The decision in Case 4/2013 (2013) 26 NZTC 16,027 supports the Commissioner’s view. In that case, Judge Sinclair held that metal spheres that had been originally intended for export to an overseas customer, but that were subsequently delivered to a different manufacturer in New Zealand and used in constructing a sculpture that was eventually exported to the overseas customer, were consumed in New Zealand (and, therefore, the supply of spheres was not zero-rated). This was on the basis that the supply of the spheres had been made in New Zealand. The spheres had lost their separate existence before being exported and had become an integral part of the sculpture. Additionally, the sculpture was eventually exported from New Zealand by someone other than the supplier of the spheres. In the Commissioner’s view, the mounting materials used by a taxidermist also lose their separate existence and, instead, form an integral part of the service being supplied by the taxidermist. 62. The view that taxidermists provide services when working on souvenir animal parts and mounting hunting souvenirs for overseas hunters is also consistent with the Canadian GST decision Robertson v Canada \[2002\] TCJ No 48 (TCC). In Robertson, the court held that a taxidermist was providing a supply of services when mounting an animal for an overseas hunter. Robertson was referred to in another Canadian decision Hawkins Taxidermists of Canada Ltd v Canada \[2005\] TCJ No 308 (TCC). As in Robertson, Hawkins Taxidermists concerned the zero-rating of taxidermy supplies made to non- resident hunters. 63. To determine the true nature of the supply for GST purposes (ie, whether it is a sale of goods or a supply of services) the courts begin by trying to identify which party supplies the “principal materials”. The courts acknowledge that where both the worker’s goods and the customer’s goods are essential and important in the creation of a product, the decision might go either way. In those circumstances, the courts’ decision will be influenced by the degree of work or skill involved in the making of the product. If the worker’s skill is important in the creation of the product then the contract will most likely be viewed as being “substantially” for the worker’s services, and not for the supply of goods. 64. In Hawkins Taxidermists, the judge focused on determining whether the materials the taxidermist used to mount the animal were the principal materials (so that the taxidermist was making a supply of goods overseas) or whether the nature of the taxidermist’s supply was a supply of services. The judge considered which was the principal materials: 24 When work is performed on the customer's goods, it is more likely a contract for work and materials even where relevant materials are added by the worker. This is confirmed in Crown Tire \[\[1984\] 2 FC 219 (FCA)\]. While that case drew from factors such as the absence of a material source of revenue from sales not connected with services, it does not offer a principle in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 36 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS respect of which different factors might be considered when determining the possibility that accession actually goes in the opposite direction which is, essentially, the Appellant's alternative argument. That is, where both the worker's goods and the customer's goods are essential and important in the creation of a product, accession might go in either direction. The worker's materials might merge into the customer's goods or the customer's goods might merge into the worker's tangible property supplies. 25 In Benjamin's Sale of Goods, 6th ed. at page 37, paragraph 44, it is noted that: Where an article is to be manufactured, and all the materials are supplied by the person for whom the work is to be done, it is obvious that there can be no sale unless there is a specific transfer of the materials followed by a repurchase of the product. Where each party provides some of the materials or components, the task of the court is to determine which of them has supplied the “principal materials”; it then follows that the materials supplied by the other vest by accession in the owner of the principal materials. It has been held that the question which are the principal materials depends on all the circumstances, and that their relative value is not conclusive. \[Footnotes omitted\] The authors go on to suggest an analogy that is noteworthy. Where an author brings a manuscript to a printer and the printer creates a book out of materials that are its property, is there a sale of property or a supply of work and materials when the finished product is delivered back to the author? The authors of Benjamin's Sale of Goods suggest that it is an extraordinary view to think that the printer has been engaged in a contract for the sale of goods. If the employer supplies the principal materials, the contract must be for one of work and materials. At paragraph 46 the authors go on to suggest that where work or skill is involved in the making of the goods delivered, it is possible, and often correct, to view the contract as "substantially" one for the worker's services. In my view, this general principle is helpful where both contractors supply materials that might be regarded as the \[principal\] materials in the performance of the contract. In such cases where a finding of \[principal\] materials is difficult to make, the importance of the skill and expertise of the worker might be determinative in finding that the supply is of a service. \[Emphasis added\] 65. The judge found that, in the case of hunting souvenirs, the principal material was the hunter’s souvenir animal parts. This decision was not based on the relative value of the hunter’s souvenir animal parts in comparison to the value of the taxidermy materials supplied, or on the relative size or volume of the goods. Rather, it was focussed on the significance of the souvenir animal parts to the finished product. The judge considered that the souvenir animal parts were the significant material used in the creation of a hunting souvenir, regardless of whether the taxidermist used a pre-moulded form or made their own mannequin. The judge was reassured that his finding was correct because of the importance of the taxidermist’s skill in creating the hunting souvenir. This finding of skill supported his decision that a taxidermist is supplying services when creating a hunting souvenir from a hunter’s souvenir animal parts: 28 I note that my finding, that the \[principal\] material in this case is the specimen, is not dependent on the relative value of inputs, the source of profit, who manufactured the components used by the Appellant to give “life” to the hunters' specimens or the extent of the Appellant's taxidermy supplies sales business. The test applied is simply to take into account the significance of the materials themselves. A fish mount is a sale of goods because the fish skin is not a \[principal\] material. Other wildlife mounts are a supply of work and materials because the specimens are the \[principal\] materials. If there is any doubt as to this conclusion, the importance of the skill of the worker in the case at bar would also lead to a determination that the supply of wildlife mounts is of work and materials. The materials employed by the Appellant are merely the means by which the taxidermist best gives expression to that skill and as such are incidental in nature. Accordingly, there is no sale of goods which is zero-rated under section 12 \[of the Excise Tax Act (GST Portions)\]. The supply of wildlife mounts is a service excluded from being zero-rated pursuant to paragraph 7(e). 66. The judge makes a distinction between a fish replica created by a taxidermist where the fish parts are not a principal material, and a hunting souvenir which includes the customer’s souvenir animal parts. The supply of the fish replica is a supply of goods, whereas the supply of a hunting trophy, which includes the customer’s souvenir animal parts, is a supply of services. 67. The judge in Robertson noted that treating taxidermists as supplying services (and not goods) when working on a customer’s souvenir animal parts was consistent with the treatment of taxidermists in most other jurisdictions: 133 The treatment of taxidermists in other jurisdictions is not determinative of the issues in this case but the majority of the other jurisdictions would appear to have treated the taxidermist as a person engaged in rendering a service. 68. The Canadian decisions of Robertson and Hawkins Taxidermists were largely based on the principles set out in the English decision in Robinson v Graves \[1935\] 1 KB 579 which involved determining whether a contract to paint a portrait was a sale of a good, or for work and materials. The courts have acknowledged that the Robinson v Graves decision is not an easy one, and it has not always been followed. Nonetheless, the decision and the principles flowing from it, continue to be referred to by the courts, including in New Zealand, when deciding if a contract is a sale of goods. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 37 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 69. For example, the High Court decision Whyte v Owl Electrical (1988) Limited \[1995\] 6 TCLR 299, considered whether a contract to supply and install electrical equipment was a sale of goods, or a contract for the supply of work and materials. In reaching his decision that the contract was one for the supply of work and materials, Barker J reviewed the established principles starting with Robinson v Graves, the commentary in Benjamin's Sale of Goods, (1992, 4 th ed) para 1-041, and relevant New Zealand, Australian and English authorities. Barker J took essentially the same approach as was taken by the courts in the Canadian taxidermy decisions when deciding if a transaction was a sale of goods or a contract for the supply of work and materials (ie, a focus on the nature of the work undertaken and the importance of the worker’s skill and expertise). Accordingly, in the Commissioner’s view, the legal analysis undertaken by the Canadian courts is consistent with the legal analysis that would likely be undertaken by a New Zealand court in determining the nature of a contract for the preparation of a hunting souvenir where the souvenir animal parts are owned by the customer. 70. Based on this case law, the Commissioner considers that treating taxidermists as supplying services and not goods to the hunters or outfitters when they expedite or mount souvenir animal parts owned by the customer is the correct interpretation. The position is different where a taxidermist creates a fish replica. In that case the taxidermist makes a supply of goods. Application of the law 71. In the Commissioner’s view, for GST purposes, an outfitter makes: • • one composite GST supply to the hunter of a hunting experience in New Zealand; or • • where souvenir animal parts or a hunting souvenir are supplied, two separate GST supplies, being: –a single composite supply of a hunting experience in New Zealand; and –the supply of souvenir animal parts or a hunting souvenir. 72. Different GST treatments apply to the supply of souvenir animal parts, depending on the circumstances and contractual arrangements between the parties. For example, souvenir animal parts may be entered for export and exported by an outfitter, by a taxidermist contracted to expedite or mount the parts, or by a shipping agent. Supply by an outfitter of a hunting experience in New Zealand 73. In the Commissioner’s view, the outfitter’s single composite supply of a New Zealand hunting experience to an overseas hunter is a standard-rated supply of goods and services. All the elements of the single composite supply will be treated the same for GST purposes. The goods and services are all consumed in New Zealand. No goods are exported to the hunter before being consumed and the services are not zero-rated under s 11A(1)(k) or s 11A(1)(m). Supply by an outfitter of souvenir animal parts or hunting souvenirs 74. If the outfitter agrees to supply souvenir animal parts to an overseas hunter, but those parts are not to be exported overseas to the hunter by the outfitter, then that is a separate standard-rated supply of a good consumed in New Zealand. The amount charged by the outfitter as consideration for the supply of the souvenir animal parts will attract GST at the standard rate. 75. Where souvenir animal parts or a hunting souvenir are supplied by an outfitter to the overseas hunter, and the outfitter, in the course of, or as a condition of, the supply, enters those parts or a hunting souvenir for export and exports them (within the requisite time), the supply of the souvenir animal parts or hunting souvenir is zero-rated under s 11(1)(d) or s 11(1)(e). Accordingly, any amount charged as consideration for that supply will attract GST at zero percent. (Where the consideration for that supply forms part of another amount paid by the hunter, only the portion of that amount that is attributable to the exported souvenir animal parts or a hunting souvenir can be zero-rated. See further at \[113\].) 76. Where an outfitter has contracted with an overseas hunter to export souvenir animal parts or a hunting souvenir, the outfitter must be the person who enters the goods for export for the supply of goods by the outfitter to be zero-rated. This means the outfitter’s name must appear on the New Zealand customs export documentation. The outfitter may appoint an agent to enter the goods for export and ship them to the overseas hunter on the outfitter’s behalf. However, whether that person is acting as the agent of the outfitter will depend on the legal arrangements entered into and carried out by the parties. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 38 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 77. The Taxation Review Authority in Case P55 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,382 confirmed that the zero-rated status of the supply depends on the supplier entering the goods for export. The customs documentation must support this. In Case P55, a New Zealand resident sold goods to a non-resident. The non-resident accepted responsibility for all freight, customs and shipping and was recorded as the party entering the goods for export in the New Zealand customs documentation. The supply was not zero-rated for GST purposes. No supply by an outfitter of souvenir animal parts when a wild animal is killed on Crown land 78. Souvenir animal parts of a wild animal killed on Crown land can never be supplied and exported by an outfitter to an overseas hunter for GST purposes. Wild animals are the property of the Crown and when killed on Crown land through the operation of statute they become the property of the hunter (s 9(1) of the Wild Animal Control Act 1977). 79. In that circumstance all amounts charged by the outfitter to the overseas hunter are consideration for the supply of the hunting experience. The souvenir animal parts are acquired by the hunter from the Crown, and not from the outfitter. Accordingly, any amount charged by an outfitter for assisting a hunter to kill a wild animal on Crown land should be standard-rated, as being consideration for services supplied by the outfitter in New Zealand. 80. Sometimes wild animals might cross into land where private landowners or game estates have been granted permits to take or hold them. Section 9(1) and (2) of the Wild Animal Control Act 1977 provides that in those circumstances the wild animals cease to be the property of the Crown and become the property of the owner or operator. 81. In those circumstances, souvenir animal parts or a hunting souvenir from the wild animals can be supplied and exported by an outfitter to an overseas hunter. Taxidermy services on souvenir animal parts supplied in New Zealand by an outfitter 82. Sometimes the expediting or mounting of souvenir animal parts occurs under a separate contractual arrangement between the overseas hunter and a taxidermist, after the hunt has ended. In that situation, while the outfitter may recommend a taxidermist to the hunter or provide a list of taxidermists in the area, the outfitter’s transaction with the hunter has ended with the field preparation and recovery of the souvenir animal parts and, possibly, their delivery to the hunter’s taxidermist. 83. In those circumstances, the supply of services by a taxidermist to an overseas hunter is standard-rated. This is because neither s 11A(1)(k) nor s 11A(1)(m) will apply to zero-rate the services. 84. Even though the taxidermist is providing taxidermy services to someone who is overseas at the time the services are being performed, s 11A(1)(k) will not apply to zero-rate those services for GST purposes because the services are performed in connection with moveable personal property situated in New Zealand at the time the services are performed (see s 11A(1) (k)(ii)). 85. Section 11A(1)(m) also will not apply to zero-rate the taxidermist’s services in those circumstances because the services are not supplied directly in connection with a supply of goods that will be entered for export as a condition of, or in the course of, making that supply (s 11(1)(d) to (e)). This is because the outfitter has not agreed to supply goods for export to the overseas hunter. 86. When the taxidermist completes their work and the hunting souvenir is exported overseas to the hunter, the exporting of the hunting souvenir is not a supply of goods in GST terms. It is simply the exporting of the hunter’s hunting souvenir overseas. The exporter in that case is not the outfitter. While the taxidermist may export the hunting souvenir to the overseas hunter (by completing the New Zealand customs process), the taxidermist does not perform the services in connection with an underlying supply of zero-rated goods, so the taxidermy services cannot be zero-rated. Taxidermy services on souvenir animal parts supplied for export by an outfitter 87. A taxidermist’s services can be zero-rated under s 11A(1)(m) where: • • the souvenir animal parts will be entered for export and exported by the outfitter in the course of, or as a condition of, their supply to the overseas hunter; and • • the taxidermy services are supplied directly in connection with the souvenir animal parts that will be exported by the outfitter; and • • the taxidermy services are supplied to the overseas hunter who is outside New Zealand when the services are performed. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 39 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 88. Taxidermy services performed to expedite or mount souvenir animal parts are supplied directly in connection with the parts. The remaining requirements for zero-rating are all dependent on the contractual arrangements and the outfitter agreeing that it will enter the parts for export and export them as a condition, or in the course of, supplying them to the hunter. 89. If the taxidermy services are supplied to the outfitter, or the outfitter cannot zero-rate its supply of the souvenir animal parts under s 11(1)(d) or s 11(1)(e), then the taxidermist cannot zero-rate the supply of their taxidermy services. The latter could occur where someone other than the outfitter enters the goods for export and exports them. Section 11A(1)(m) is not a stand-alone permission for zero-rating of services on any goods that will be exported by someone from New Zealand. There must always be an underlying zero-rated supply of goods for export that the services are performed in connection with for the services to be zero-rated. 90. If the taxidermist undertakes the exporting process as the outfitter’s agent, so that the outfitter’s supply of souvenir animal parts is zero-rated, then, in that situation, if the taxidermist supplies their taxidermy services to the overseas hunter (and not to the outfitter), the taxidermist can zero-rate their taxidermy services under s 11A(1)(m). This is because the services are performed in connection with an underlying supply of zero-rated goods. However, whether the taxidermist is acting as the agent of the outfitter will depend on the legal arrangements entered into and carried out by the parties. Sale and export of a hunting souvenir by a taxidermist 91. Where a taxidermist sells a hunting souvenir to an overseas hunter from their own trading stock of hunting souvenirs, that supply of goods may be zero-rated if the requirements of s 11(1)(d) or s 11(1)(e) are met. Similarly, where a taxidermist sells a fish replica the taxidermist makes a supply of goods. Crating and packing services supplied by a taxidermist 92. Once a taxidermist has completed working on the hunting souvenir, they will usually crate and pack it ready for shipping overseas. The GST treatment of the crating and packing services is the same as the GST treatment of the taxidermy services. This is because crating and packing are an ancillary part of the supply of the taxidermy services. Insurance and transport 93. Costs of arranging insurance and transport and transporting goods overseas are zero-rated (see s 11A(1)(a), (c) and (d)) regardless of whether the underlying supply of the good is zero-rated. Scenarios showing supplies of souvenir animal parts or hunting souvenirs for export 94. The following six scenarios diagrammatically show various GST supplies that can be made when an outfitter is able to recover souvenir animal parts and the overseas hunter decides to have the parts exported to them. Some of these scenarios necessarily include the taxidermist’s supply of taxidermy services, which are required for the parts to be exported. Scenario 1 explains the GST position when the souvenir animal parts exported come from a wild animal killed on Crown land. The other five scenarios all relate to animals on land controlled by outfitters. 95. Then, later in this Interpretation Statement (from \[141\]), four examples illustrate the application of the GST rules to outfitters, taxidermists and overseas hunters in a practical context. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 40 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Scenario 1 – No supply of exported wild souvenir animal parts by an outfitter 96. In this scenario (illustrated in Figure 1), the souvenir animal parts are from a wild animal killed by the overseas hunter on Crown land. There is no supply of a good (the souvenir animal parts) by the outfitter to the overseas hunter. Even if the outfitter assists the overseas hunter by delivering the souvenir animal parts to a taxidermist for the overseas hunter, that delivery is not a GST supply of the trophy by the outfitter. This is because the overseas hunter acquires the parts from the Crown when the animal is killed. 97. The taxidermist provides taxidermy services to the overseas hunter. Those services are not zero-rated as they are performed on moveable personal property (that is, the souvenir animal parts) in New Zealand. When the taxidermist has completed their work on the souvenir animal parts, the taxidermist will typically arrange for the hunting souvenir to be shipped overseas to the hunter. The taxidermist will enter the hunting souvenir for export either in their own right or as an agent for the overseas hunter. There is no taxable supply of goods for GST purposes under s 8 for s 11 to zero-rate. Therefore, s 11A(1)(m) cannot apply to zero-rate the taxidermy services. Figure 1: No supply of exported wild souvenir animal parts by an outfitter Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 41 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Scenario 2 – Standard-rated supply of souvenir animal parts by an outfitter 98. In this scenario (illustrated in Figure 2), an outfitter’s relationship with the overseas hunter ends on completion of the hunt. The outfitter does not agree to export the souvenir animal parts they have supplied to the overseas hunter. The outfitter might introduce the overseas hunter to a taxidermist and might deliver the parts to the hunter’s taxidermist but that is the end of the outfitter’s relationship with the hunter. 99. The souvenir animal parts are supplied to the overseas hunter in New Zealand. Accordingly, any fee charged by an outfitter for the supply of the souvenir animal parts is standard-rated, even if the souvenir animal parts are later exported to the overseas hunter by another party. 100. The taxidermist provides taxidermy services to the overseas hunter. Those services are not zero-rated as they are performed on moveable personal property (that is, the souvenir animal parts) in New Zealand. When the taxidermist has completed their work on the overseas hunter’s souvenir animal parts, the taxidermist will typically arrange for the hunting souvenir to be shipped overseas to the hunter. The taxidermist will enter the hunting souvenir for export either in their own right or as an agent for the overseas hunter. There is no taxable supply of goods for GST purposes under s 8 for s 11 to zero-rate. Therefore, s 11A(1)(m) cannot apply to zero-rate the taxidermy services. Figure 2: Standard-rated supply of souvenir animal parts by an outfitter Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 42 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Scenario 3 – Zero-rated supply of hunting souvenir by an outfitter using an independent taxidermist 101. In this scenario (illustrated in Figure 3), the outfitter and the overseas hunter agree for the outfitter to supply and export a hunting souvenir to the hunter overseas. The taxidermy is arranged by the outfitter, and the taxidermist supplies its services to the outfitter (and invoices the outfitter for the services they perform). The outfitter can zero-rate the amount paid by the overseas hunter in consideration for the supply and export of the hunting souvenir under s 11(1)(d) or s 11(1)(e), providing the outfitter exports the hunting souvenir within the export period allowed under s 11(4). (Where the consideration for that supply forms part of another amount paid by the hunter, only the portion of that amount that is attributable to the exported hunting souvenir can be zero-rated. See further at \[113\].) 102. The taxidermist contracts with the outfitter and supplies the taxidermy services to the outfitter. Those services are performed in New Zealand and the customer is the outfitter, a New Zealand resident. Accordingly, the services are standard-rated, and s 11A(1)(m) cannot apply to enable the taxidermist to zero-rate the supply of services. Even though the taxidermist services are directly in connection with a zero-rated supply of goods being exported by the outfitter, the customer is not a non-resident. 103. The taxidermist could enter the hunting souvenir for export and export it as the outfitter’s agent, but to ensure zero- rating of the outfitter’s supply of the hunting souvenir this agency relationship must be supported by the facts and by the legal relationships between the taxidermist and the outfitter . If an agency relationship cannot be established, then the outfitter’s supply of the hunting souvenir cannot be zero-rated as it will not have been entered for export or exported by the outfitter, and so the s 11 zero-rating requirements are not met (see Case P55). 104. The existence of an agency relationship in this situation will not enable the taxidermist to zero-rate the supply of its services to the outfitter. Section 11A(1)(m) will not apply in this case, even though the outfitter’s supply of the hunting souvenir is zero-rated. This is because, contractually, the services are provided by the taxidermist to the outfitter, a New Zealand resident. Figure 3: Zero-rated supply of hunting souvenir by an outfitter using an independent taxidermist Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 43 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Scenario 4 – Zero-rated supply of hunting souvenir by an outfitter using an in-house taxidermist 105. In this scenario (illustrated in Figure 4) the outfitter employs their own taxidermist, so the outfitter can expedite or mount hunting souvenirs for overseas hunters itself. This enables the outfitter to export a hunting souvenir to the overseas hunter, without the outfitter or the hunter needing to engage an independent taxidermist. 106. The outfitter can zero-rate the amount paid by the hunter in consideration for the supply and export of the hunting souvenir under s 11(1)(d) or s 11(1)(e), providing the outfitter exports the hunting souvenir within the export period allowed under s 11(4). (Where the consideration for that supply forms part of another amount paid by the hunter, only the portion of that amount that is attributable to the exported hunting souvenir can be zero-rated. See further at \[113\].) Figure 4: Zero-rated supply of hunting souvenir by an outfitter using an in-house taxidermist Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 44 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Scenario 5 – Zero-rated supply of souvenir animal parts by an outfitter and zero-rated supply of taxidermy services by a taxidermist 107. In this scenario (illustrated in Figure 5), the outfitter agrees with the overseas hunter to supply and export souvenir animal parts. The overseas hunter also agrees with a taxidermist for the taxidermist to provide taxidermy services on those parts before they are exported by the outfitter to the hunter. 108. The outfitter delivers the souvenir animal parts to the taxidermist, and when the expediting or mounting is completed the taxidermist returns the hunting souvenir to the outfitter. The outfitter then enters the hunting souvenir for export and exports it. The outfitter can zero-rate the amount paid by the hunter in consideration for the supply and export of the souvenir animal parts under s 11(1)(d) or s 11(1)(e). (Where the consideration for that supply forms part of another amount paid by the hunter, only the portion of that amount that is attributable to the exported souvenir animal parts can be zero-rated. See further at \[113\].) 109. The taxidermist can also zero-rate their supply of taxidermy services to the overseas hunter under s 11A(1)(m). This is because the taxidermy services are supplied to the non-resident, are performed when the non-resident is outside New Zealand, and are in connection with the outfitter’s zero-rated supply of the souvenir animal parts for export. 110. The taxidermist could enter the hunting souvenir for export and export it as the outfitter’s agent, but to ensure zero- rating this agency relationship must be supported by the facts, and by the legal relationships between them. If an agency relationship cannot be established between the taxidermist and the outfitter, then neither the supply of the souvenir animal parts nor the supply of the taxidermy services can be zero-rated as the hunting souvenir will not have been entered for export and exported by the outfitter, and so the s 11 zero-rating requirements are not met (see Case P55). Figure 5: Zero-rated supply of souvenir animal parts by an outfitter and zero-rated supply of taxidermy services by a taxidermist Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 45 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Scenario 6 – Zero-rated supply of hunting souvenir by a taxidermist 111. In this scenario (illustrated in Figure 6), a taxidermist makes a zero-rated supply of a good to an overseas hunter, rather than a supply of services. The situation envisaged is where a taxidermist performs taxidermy for their own account and sells hunting souvenirs to overseas customers. The taxidermist may purchase unwanted souvenir animal parts from an outfitter. 112. The supply of souvenir animal parts by the outfitter to the taxidermist would be a standard-rated supply of a good in New Zealand. The supply and export of the hunting souvenir by the taxidermist to an overseas hunter would be a zero- rated supply of a good entered for export under s 11(1)(d) or s 11(1)(e). Figure 6: Zero-rated supply of hunting souvenir by a taxidermist Valuation of supplies 113. Valuation of GST supplies is particularly important where a supplier is making a mixture of standard-rated and zero-rated supplies to an overseas person. The value attached to those separate supplies for GST purposes should properly represent the consideration paid for those separate supplies of goods and services. 114. In the hunting industry, an outfitter may agree to supply a hunting experience in New Zealand to an overseas hunter and to export souvenir animal parts or a hunting souvenir in the course of or as a condition of that supply. That is, the outfitter makes both standard-rated and zero-rated supplies to the overseas hunter. 115. The value of a GST supply is determined by reference to the consideration agreed between the parties. Section 10 sets out how to determine the value of a supply in various situations but typically, where that consideration is in money, the consideration is the amount of money the customer agrees to pay the supplier for the supply. Section 10(2)(a) provides: 10 Value of supply of goods and services (1) For the purposes of this Act the following provisions of this section shall apply for determining the value of any supply of goods and services. (2) Subject to this section, the value of a supply of goods and services shall be such amount as, with the addition of the tax charged, is equal to the aggregate of,— (a) to the extent that the consideration for the supply is consideration in money, the amount of the money: 116. “Consideration” and “consideration in money” are defined in s 2: consideration, in relation to the supply of goods and services to any person, includes any payment made or any act or forbearance, whether or not voluntary, in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of, the supply of any goods and services, whether by that person or by any other person; but does not include any payment made by any person as an unconditional gift to any non- profit body consideration in money includes consideration expressed as an amount of money 117. The Commissioner cannot interfere in commercial arrangements simply because the consideration for a supply appears to be too high or a transaction appears to be a poor deal. However, the onus is on the taxpayer to be able to show the Commissioner that a payment has been made in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of, a supply. If the Commissioner is concerned that artificial or contrived pricing is occurring that alters the incidence of tax, then there may be grounds for the transaction to be reviewed. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 46 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 118. The amount of money received by an outfitter is usually calculated by reference to the number of days hunting, the number of nights of meals and accommodation and the number, breed and quality of animals hunted and killed by the overseas hunter (that is, the “trophy fees”). It will also include additional amounts for items such as transport and, use of firearms. 119. On occasions, overseas hunters may have been charged GST at the standard rate on the hunting experience in New Zealand, and then the amount referred to as “trophy fees” by the industry has been zero-rated when some souvenir animal parts or a hunting souvenir has been exported. This is based on the assumption that a “trophy fee” is consideration only for the supply of goods being exported. 120. The Commissioner considers the better view is that a trophy fee is what a hunter pays for the opportunity to hunt and kill a particular breed and quality of animal, and, if the hunt is successful and some souvenir animal parts are recoverable, in the absence of any other arrangement, the hunter would also expect to pay for the souvenir animal parts. Accordingly, a trophy fee is in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of both the outfitter’s separate GST supplies (that is, the hunting experience in New Zealand and souvenir animal parts), and not only for the outfitter’s supply of souvenir animal parts for export. 121. This conclusion is supported by the facts: • • trophy fees are payable by the hunter even if the outfitter does not agree to export any souvenir animal parts from a recovered animal or a hunting souvenir (for example, where souvenir animal parts are supplied to the hunter in New Zealand, where the souvenir animal parts are retained by the outfitter, or where killed animals are unrecoverable); and • • where an outfitter agrees to supply and export a hunting souvenir using souvenir animal parts, usually some further consideration (in addition to the amounts already agreed) is negotiated to take account of the outfitter’s expediting and taxidermy services in connection with that supply. 122. In the Commissioner’s view, a hunter does not pay a trophy fee only to obtain the souvenir animal parts. If that were the case, an overseas hunter could simply arrange to purchase souvenir animal parts or a hunting souvenir without attending the hunt. Rather, in the Commissioner’s opinion the hunter wants both the experience and opportunity to hunt and kill a particular breed and quality of animal in New Zealand and to obtain souvenir animal parts to take home from their hunt. Some overseas hunters may value the souvenir animal parts more than the New Zealand hunting experience, while other hunters may be more interested in the hunting experience. 123. Therefore, it is appropriate for some of a trophy fee, as that term is used in the industry, to be recognised as being paid in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of, or the consideration for, an element of the supply of the hunting experience in New Zealand (that is, the opportunity to hunt and kill a particular breed and quality of animal). The balance of the trophy fee is to be treated as consideration for the supply (and sometimes, export) of souvenir animal parts. 124. The Commissioner has issued a Commissioners Statement CS20/02: Trophy hunting and the GST treatment of the “Trophy Fee” to assist outfitters determine a reasonable proportion of a trophy fee to be allocated to the supply of souvenir animal parts for export. The Commissioner has established some standard apportionment percentages for each type of trophy hunting animal in New Zealand. The percentages are intended to recognise the increasing value to the hunter of souvenir animal parts and hunting souvenirs as the quality and “uniqueness” of the trophy hunting animals increases. Outfitters may use these percentages to apportion their trophy fees when they export souvenir animal parts or hunting souvenirs, and those valuations will be accepted by the Commissioner. The use of these percentages is optional. Where an outfitter wishes to attribute a greater proportion of a trophy fee to the zero-rated supply than the standard percentages provide for, they will need to satisfy the Commissioner that their valuation is reasonable. The onus is on the outfitter to do so. Deposits and the time of supply 125. In the hunting industry, establishing the GST “time of supply” is important because it: • • determines the taxable period in which the supplier (that is, the outfitter or the taxidermist) must account for output tax (see s 20(4)); • • triggers the beginning of the period within which the trophy must be exported if the supply is to be zero-rated under s 11(1)(d) or s 11(1)(e)(see s 11(4)); and • • sets the date on which transactions denominated in foreign currency amounts are to be converted to New Zealand dollars (see s 77). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 47 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 126. Generally, the time of supply is determined by s 9(1). Section 9(1) provides that a supply is deemed to take place at the earlier of the time: • • an invoice is issued by the supplier or the customer for that supply; or • • any payment is received by the supplier for that supply. 127. A deposit constitutes “any payment”. Where a supplier receives a deposit under a contract, the time of supply will be triggered under s 9(1). This will be so even if the goods or services have not been physically supplied or performed at that time. 128. At the time of booking, an outfitter will usually offer an overseas hunter a hunting package or a hunt based on a pre-set price list. In reality, that price is usually only an estimate, with the final price of any hunt not being calculated until the end of the hunt based on the number of days the hunter spends hunting, the quantity, breed and quality of the animals hunted and killed by the hunter and any additional goods or services supplied by the outfitter over the hunt’s duration. The overseas hunter pays the outfitter a deposit at the time of booking (and sometimes a further deposit closer to the hunt date) that is calculated either as a fixed amount or is based on a percentage of the estimated price of the hunt. A final payment is made at the completion of the hunt when all the prices are known. 129. Because the hunting package price is only an estimate at the time the deposit is paid, the outfitter does not know exactly how much output tax they are required to pay. In that situation, the special rule in s 9(6) will apply to determine the time of supply. Section 9(6) provides a method for suppliers to account for GST on supplies of goods and services where the total consideration payable (and therefore the amount of GST that must be accounted for) is not known at the time of supply. A supply is deemed to take place, to the extent of the estimated price, at the earlier of when: • • a payment of the estimated price becomes due or is received; or • • the supplier or customer issues an invoice for the estimated price. 130. This means when a deposit for the estimated price becomes due or is received by the outfitter, the supply to the extent of the estimated price is deemed to take place for GST purposes. The amount of GST output tax that the outfitter is required to account for at that time depends on whether they are registered for GST on the invoice basis, payments basis or hybrid basis, and whether the supply is standard-rated or zero-rated. The outfitter should calculate the GST output tax on the basis that any souvenir animal parts or hunting souvenirs included in a package will be exported, if that is what has been agreed with the hunter. If the invoice basis is used, output tax is brought to account based on the estimated price in the taxable period in which the deposit is received. If the payments basis is used, output tax is brought to account only to the extent of the deposit relating to the standard-rated supply in the taxable period in which it is received. If the hybrid basis is used, output tax is brought to account on an invoice basis. 131. The output tax payable on the final payment will be brought to account at the earlier of when it becomes due or is received by the outfitter or the outfitter issues an invoice for final payment. This will generally be after the completion of the hunt. Overseas intermediaries 132. Often New Zealand outfitters travel overseas to trade fairs and hunting conventions to seek new customers and sell their hunting experiences. Sometimes New Zealand outfitters will engage the services of an overseas intermediary to sell hunting packages for them. The intermediary might collect deposits from overseas hunters who make hunt bookings and remit these to the New Zealand outfitters. Depending on the contractual arrangements between the parties, sometimes these intermediaries sell the hunting packages on a commission basis, deducting their commission from the hunter’s deposit before remitting it to the New Zealand outfitter. 133. For GST purposes, where the intermediary is acting as the commission agent of the New Zealand outfitter, the New Zealand outfitter must return GST output tax on the full estimated price of the hunting package for GST purposes, before deduction of any agent’s commission. 134. Where a deposit is paid for a hunt, and the deposit is received by the intermediary from the overseas hunter, then the date on which the intermediary receives the deposit (and not the outfitter) will determine the GST time of supply. The situation is different where the intermediary receives the deposit as a stakeholder – then the time of supply is not triggered until the intermediary releases the payment to the outfitter. 135. Further explanation on deposits and the time of supply is in Interpretation Statement IS 10/03 GST: Time of supply – payments of deposits, including to a stakeholder (2010, Inland Revenue), which is available on the Inland Revenue website. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 48 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Extensions of time for export of souvenir animal parts or hunting souvenirs 136. Generally, goods must be exported within 28 days of the “time of supply” for their supply to be zero-rated (see s 11(4)). However, on application by the supplier of the goods, the Commissioner may extend that qualifying period if circumstances beyond the control of the supplier and the customer prevent the goods or a class of the goods being exported within the 28 days or, due to the nature of the supply, it is not practicable for the goods to be exported within 28 days of the “time of supply” (see s 11(5)). 137. The Commissioner accepts that, generally, it is not practicable for souvenir animal parts or hunting souvenirs to be exported within 28 days of the time of supply. Therefore, on application, the Commissioner may grant a supplier an extension of time for the export of a specific supply of goods, or if the Commissioner determines it is appropriate in the circumstances may, on application, grant a supplier an extension of time for multiple future supplies of souvenir animal parts or hunting souvenirs for export by the supplier. 138. All applications for extensions of the 28-day period for exports of souvenir animal parts or hunting souvenirs by New Zealand outfitters under Scenarios 3 to 5, or exports of hunting souvenirs by New Zealand taxidermists under Scenario 6, should be emailed to GSTexportextensions@ird.govt.nz. Outfitters and taxidermists relying on time extension arrangements applied for and granted before the publication of this Interpretation Statement should re-apply to Inland Revenue, to check that the extension continues to be appropriate for their circumstances. Applications should include relevant documentation (such as the supply contract and the anticipated period of time required for the taxidermy services to be completed and for the goods to be exported). The application must be made before the end of the 28-day period for the relevant supply of goods. 139. The Commissioner will not approve applications for extensions of the 28-day period from taxidermists who are performing taxidermy services in New Zealand on souvenir animal parts being supplied by the outfitter (unless they are acting as the outfitter’s agent). This is because the exporter of the goods is the outfitter. However, if an extension is granted to the outfitter for the supply, the Commissioner accepts that the taxidermist may use the outfitter’s extension to zero-rate their services but only if the requirements of s 11A(1)(m) are met. 140. A taxidermist who is acting as the outfitter’s agent may make an application on behalf of the outfitter for an extension of time for goods being exported by the outfitter. However, whether the taxidermist is acting as the agent of the outfitter will depend on the legal arrangements entered into and carried out by the parties. Therefore, a copy of the agreement appointing the taxidermist as the outfitter’s agent in that matter should be included with the other relevant documentation when making an application. Examples 141. The following examples explain the practical application of the GST zero-rating rules to supplies made by outfitters and taxidermists to overseas hunters. Example 1 – Free-range tahr and chamois hunting trip 142. While attending a hunting convention in Las Vegas, Dwayne Redding, a Canadian hunter, meets Tom Bloke a New Zealand outfitter and the owner of Chamois Downs Ltd. Dwayne is so impressed with Tom’s operation he asks about booking a four-day wilderness hunt with Tom at Chamois Downs the following season, targeting free-range tahr and chamois. 143. Tom offers Dwayne the Chamois Downs’ Wilderness Hunt package and notes that the package includes: • • guiding; • • the opportunity to kill one tahr and one chamois; • • fully catered accommodation; • • transfers to and from Queenstown; • • use of firearms; • • field preparation of any recoverable killed game animals; and • • transport. 144. The package does not include any agreement for Tom to export souvenir animal parts or hunting souvenirs overseas to Dwayne in the course of, or as a condition of, the supply. The package is priced at NZ$8,000 excluding GST. 145. On 1 February 2018, Dwayne pays a 30% deposit (NZ$2,400) to secure his booking on the understanding that the final amount payable will be calculated at the conclusion of his hunt, based on the quantity, size and breeds of animals he actually kills and any additional services he enjoys during his stay. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 49 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 146. The following year Dwayne enjoys four days hunting at Chamois Downs. Tom recovers the head and cape from a tahr and a chamois killed by Dwayne as part of the package. Tom also recovers a red deer stag killed by Dwayne. In addition, Chamois Downs organises a 30-minute scenic helicopter flight for Dwayne. 147. Chamois Downs calculates, based on its price list, that Dwayne owes a final amount of NZ$14,850 including GST, on top of the 30% deposit he paid the previous year. On 25 April 2019, Chamois Downs prepares a GST invoice for Dwayne. 148. All the goods and services supplied by Chamois Downs to Dwayne are consumed by Dwayne in New Zealand. Chamois Downs does not export any goods to Dwayne overseas. Accordingly, all the elements of the supply are standard-rated for GST purposes. 149. Chamois Downs accounts for GST on a payments basis. This means Tom must account for the GST output tax of $2,250 at two different times: • • First, Tom must account for output tax of $313.04 on the $2,400 deposit in the GST period in which Chamois Downs receives the deposit from Dwayne. • • Then, the remaining GST output tax of $1,936.96 must be returned in the GST period when Dwayne’s final payment is received. Example 2 – Supply of taxidermy services to overseas hunter 150. Dwayne engages Gold Town Taxidermy Ltd near Queenstown to expedite and mount his three heads and capes as hunting souvenirs and export them to him. Chamois Downs agrees to deliver the heads and capes to Gold Town Taxidermy for Dwayne. 151. Gold Town Taxidermy offers its overseas clients, such as Dwayne, a full taxidermy mounting service, including crating and packing. On receiving Dwayne’s three heads from Chamois Downs, Gold Town Taxidermy processes and treats them before incorporating the treated skins and horns with other taxidermy components to create an artistic life-like rendering of the animals. 152. Once the hunting souvenirs are completed, Gold Town Taxidermy crates and packs them ready for collection by Dwayne’s shipping agent. The crated hunting souvenirs are collected from Gold Town Taxidermy by Mega Freight Ltd, which arranges for the hunting souvenirs to be exported to Dwayne. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 50 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 153. There is no supply of goods by Gold Town Taxidermy to Dwayne, only a supply of services. The supply of the taxidermy components that are incorporated with the treated skins and horns are ancillary to the supply of the taxidermy services, so are not a separate supply from the supply of taxidermy services, which is the dominant supply. 154. The taxidermy services and the packing and crating service are a single supply by Gold Town Taxidermy. The services are provided in New Zealand on property situated in New Zealand, so must be standard-rated. 155. The services provided by Mega Freight to Dwayne in collecting the hunting souvenirs from Gold Town Taxidermy and exporting them to Dwayne are zero-rated under ss 11A(1)(a), (c) and (d). Example 3 – Game estate outfitter supplies complete hunting package to overseas hunter 156. At the Nevada Hunting and Safari Show in July 2018, Maria McCarthy, a United States hunter, purchases a Silver Medal Red Deer hunting package with Hunt Away Tourism Ltd, a New Zealand game estate operator. The agreed purchase price of the package is NZ$20,000 inclusive of any GST, and Maria pays Hunt Away Tourism’s agent in Nevada a deposit of NZ$4,000 to secure her booking of the hunt. The Nevada agent is busy and remits Maria’s deposit to Hunt Away Tourism, less his commission of NZ$1,500, three months after the Hunting and Safari Show. 157. The Silver Medal Red Deer hunting package includes: • • one estate red deer stag (Safari Club International 340 - 379); • • four nights fully-catered accommodation at Hunt Away Lodge; • • professional guiding; • • assessment of the red deer stag by a Safari Club International-qualified measurer; • • return transfers between Hunt Away Lodge and Christchurch Airport; • • use of firearms, and • • a full in-house taxidermy service. 158. The agreement between Hunt Away Tourism and Maria specifies that after her hunt the souvenir animal parts from the animal she kills will be expedited, crated and then exported to her in the United States. Maria will pay separately for the international freight charges. 159. Even though Maria purchases the package in the United States through a United States agent, the GST rules still apply to the supplies being made by the outfitter. The place where the contract is entered into or where payment is made is not relevant to the GST treatment of the supply. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 51 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 160. Hunt Away Tourism recognises that the sale of the Silver Medal Red Deer hunting package comprises the supply of several different elements for GST purposes. For GST the elements supplied are: • • the supply of the hunting experience in New Zealand, including: –the opportunity to hunt and kill a silver medal red deer stag; –professional guiding; –transport for the hunter and guide; –use of firearms; –SCI-measurer services; –meals, accommodation and airport transfers; and • • the supply for export of expedited souvenir animal parts. 161. The supply of the hunting experience is a single composite supply for GST purposes. That supply (and all its elements) are standard-rated for GST purposes because the goods and services are supplied in New Zealand to Maria while she is in New Zealand. 162. Hunt Away Tourism agrees to export the expedited souvenir animal parts to Maria overseas in the course of, or as a condition of, the supply. This supply is treated as a separate supply for GST purposes from the supply of the other elements of the transaction. The supply of the expedited souvenir animal parts can be zero-rated providing they are exported within the requisite time for zero-rating. Previously Hunt Away Tourism has applied for and been granted a time extension for exporting expedited souvenir animal parts from the time of supply to the date the expedited souvenir animal parts are exported. 163. Because Hunt Away Tourism accounts for GST on an invoice basis and because the time of supply for the hunt was triggered when their Nevada agent received Maria’s deposit for the hunt package (and not when the agent remitted the deposit to them), Hunt Away Tourism must account for GST output tax on the standard-rated portion of the NZ$20,000 purchase price in the GST period in which the Nevada agent received the deposit. No deduction is made to the purchase price for the commission paid to the Nevada agent. 164. Maria hunts and kills a silver medal red deer stag with an SCI score of 365. The guides recover the stag’s antlers, head and cape. They are suitable for mounting and so are delivered to Hunt Away Tourism’s in-house taxidermist for expediting. Hunt Away Tourism then invoices Maria for the hunt package: Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 52 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 165. The portion of the package price attributable to the supply and export of the expedited souvenir animal parts is zero- rated, but the remainder of the package price is standard-rated. To determine the portion of the total package price that can be zero-rated Hunt Away Tourism uses the trophy fee quoted in its current price list for a red deer stag with a SCI score of 340 – 379 (NZ$9,000) and apportions that trophy fee by applying the 50% apportionment percentage recommended in the Commissioner’s Statement for a red deer with an SCI score below 400 (see CS 20/02). 166. Several months later, but before the time extension expires the expedited souvenir animal parts are crated and ready for shipping. Hunt Away Tourism engages Mega Freight as its agent to export the parts to Maria in the United States. Mega Freight collects the crate, enters it for export with the New Zealand Customs Service as agent for Hunt Away Tourism, delivers it to the international airport and arranges for it to be shipped to Maria. The supply of these services by Mega Freight are zero-rated under s 11A(1)(d). Example 4 – Outfitter supplies hunt and souvenir animal parts for export to overseas hunter; independent taxidermist supplies taxidermy services to overseas hunter 167. Bruce Murphy, an Australian hunter, books a hunt with Lonely World Hunting Ltd using their website. The booking is for four days hunting and three nights’ accommodation and meals in Faraway Lodge. In addition to the hunting and accommodation charges, Bruce agrees to pay a trophy fee for each animal he kills while hunting. The trophy fees are based on Lonely World Hunting’s price list. Bruce pays Lonely World Hunting a deposit of NZ$1,200 to secure his booking. 168. Bruce hunts and kills a red deer stag and an Arapawa ram. Lonely World Hunting agrees to export the souvenir animal parts in the course of, or as a condition of, the supply on the understanding that Bruce has arranged for Furs n Spurs Taxidermists to mount them ready for export. Lonely World Hunting invoices Bruce for the hunting experience in New Zealand and for the animals killed: Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 53 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 169. A portion of each trophy fee attributable to the export of the souvenir animal parts in the course of, or as a condition of, the supply is zero-rated. The remaining portion of each trophy fee is standard-rated. To determine the portion of each trophy fee that can be zero-rated Hunt Away Tourism applies the recommended apportionment percentage for each animal as set out in the Commissioner’s Statement for apportioning the value of a trophy fee (see CS 20/02). 170. Lonely World Hunting delivers the souvenir animal parts to Furs n Spurs Taxidermists. Four months later, Furs n Spurs Taxidermists lets Lonely World Hunting know that the hunting souvenirs are crated and ready for exporting. Furs n Spurs Taxidermists issues an invoice to Bruce for NZ$1,700 inclusive of GST at 0% for its taxidermy and packing services. 171. Lonely World Hunting then engages Tasman Freight as its agent to enter the hunting souvenirs for export to Bruce in Australia. Tasman Freight collects the crate from Furs n Spurs Taxidermists, enters it for export with New Zealand Customs as agent for Lonely World Hunting, and arranges for it to be shipped to Bruce. 172. As the agent of Lonely World Hunting, Tasman Freight invoices Bruce for transporting the hunting souvenirs to Auckland International Airport, arranging shipping and insurance, and completing the export procedures. The supply of these services by Tasman Freight is zero-rated under s 11A(1)(d). 173. Tasman Freight records the value of the hunting souvenirs for New Zealand customs purposes at its free-on-board value of $12,125 – being the value of the souvenir animal parts ($10,125) plus the taxidermy costs ($1,700) plus $300 for transporting the hunting souvenir to Auckland International Airport and arranging its shipping and insurance. The cost of shipping to Australia is not included in the free-on-board value.

Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 57 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS IS 20/03: Income tax – sections GB 3B and GB 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007 – temporary loss carry-back regime All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. Summary 1. The focus of this statement is to set out the Commissioner’s view of the application of the specific anti-avoidance provisions (ss GB 3B and GB 4) relevant to the temporary loss carry-back regime (s IZ 8). The regime allows a business to carry-back losses to a prior income year and receive a refund of tax paid. 2. The specific anti-avoidance provisions require: • • that a company share is “subject to an arrangement” (which includes “an arrangement directly or indirectly altering rights attached to the shares”); • • the arrangement “allows” the relevant company “to meet the requirements” of the temporary loss carry-back regime; and • • a “purpose” of the arrangement is “to defeat the intent and application” of the regime. 3. A share will be “subject to an arrangement” if the share or the rights attached to the share are the subject matter of the arrangement. An “arrangement” embraces all kinds of concerted action by which persons may arrange their affairs for a particular purpose or to produce a particular effect. It may involve more than one transaction or document and includes all steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect. 4. The arrangement must “allow” (ie, permit or enable) a company to obtain or maintain compliance with the ownership continuity or ownership commonality requirements during the relevant period, as required by s IZ 8. 5. If, objectively determined, the effect of the arrangement is that it defeats the intent and application of the temporary loss carry-back regime, then that will be a “purpose” of the arrangement. 6. The temporary loss carry-back regime concerns the treatment and use of tax losses. In general terms, rules around the use of tax losses are intended to ensure that the economic benefit of tax losses can only be obtained by the same people who effectively bore the direct economic burden of the losses. 7. The Commissioner considers that the test as to whether an arrangement “defeats the intent and application” of the temporary loss carry-back regime is, in effect, the same test as the parliamentary contemplation test under the general anti- avoidance provision (s BG 1), as set out by the Supreme Court in Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v CIR \[2008\] NZSC 115. Both tests are aimed at arrangements that in legal substance satisfy the requirements of a particular provision or regime, but when viewed in a commercial and realistic way, make use of (or circumvent) the provision or regime in a manner that is inconsistent with the provision or regime’s purpose. Introduction 8. The COVID-19 Response (Taxation and Other Regulatory Urgent Measures) Act 2020 introduces a temporary loss carry- back regime into the Income Tax Act 2007. This regime was introduced as part of a range of business tax changes in response to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 1 9. The temporary loss carry-back regime enables a person who has taxable income in the 2018–19 or 2019–20 income year and anticipates a net loss in the next income year to make an election to reduce the amount of the net loss and also reduce the amount of the person’s taxable income in the earlier year by the same amount. 10. The primary rule is in the new s IZ 8 (election that amount of net loss for the 2019-20 or 2020-21 income year be tax loss in preceding income year), with specific anti-avoidance rules in the new s GB 3B (arrangements for carrying back net losses: companies) and the amended s GB 4 (arrangements for grouping tax losses: companies). 11. This interpretation statement considers the potential application of those specific anti-avoidance provisions to the temporary regime. 12. The statement does not consider the potential for a “market value circumstance” (as defined in s YA 1) to exist or the potential application of the general anti-avoidance provisions (ss BG 1 and GA 1). Both these matters would need to be borne in mind if the application of the temporary loss carry-back regime is being considered. 1 For more details of the regime, see “COVID-19 Response (Taxation and Other Regulatory Urgent Measures) Act 2020, A special report” (Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue, June 2020). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 58 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Relevant legislation 13. Section GB 3B states: GB 3B Arrangements for carrying back net losses: companies When this section applies (1) This section applies when— (a) a share in a company (the loss company) or another company has been subject to an arrangement, including an arrangement directly or indirectly altering rights attached to the shares; and (b) the arrangement allows the loss company to meet the requirements of section IZ 8 (Election to use net loss for 2019–20 or 2020–21 year as tax loss in preceding year); and (c) a purpose of the arrangement is to defeat the intent and application of section IZ 8. Company treated as not meeting requirements (2) The loss company is treated as not meeting the requirements of section IZ 8 in relation to the shares. 14. Section GB 4 states: GB 4 Arrangements for grouping tax losses: companies When this section applies (1) This section applies when— (a) a share in a company (the offset company) or another company has been subject to an arrangement, including an arrangement directly or indirectly altering rights attached to the shares; and (b) the arrangement allows the offset company to meet the requirements of subparts IC and IP, and sections IZ 7 and IZ 8 (which relate to the use of tax losses by group companies), as applicable; and (c) a purpose of the arrangement is to defeat the intent and application of those provisions. Company treated as not meeting requirements (2) The offset company is treated as not meeting the requirements of subparts IC and IP and sections IZ 7 and IZ 8, as applicable, in relation to the share. 15. Section IZ 8 is reproduced in the appendix to this statement. 16. In summary, for current purposes, ss GB 3B and GB 4 each have the following three requirements: • • A share in the relevant company is “subject to an arrangement” (which includes “an arrangement directly or indirectly altering rights attached to the shares”). • • The arrangement “allows” the relevant company “to meet the requirements” of the temporary loss carry-back regime. • • A “purpose” of the arrangement is “to defeat the intent and application” of the temporary loss carry-back regime. Meaning of an “arrangement” 17. The first requirement of ss GB 3B and GB 4 is that there is an “arrangement”. An arrangement is defined in s YA 1 as follows: arrangement means an agreement, contract, plan, or understanding, whether enforceable or unenforceable, including all steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect 18. The definition of arrangement provides for varying degrees of formality and enforceability. For example, an arrangement may be: • • a legally binding contract; • • an agreement or plan that may or may not be legally binding; • • an understanding that may or may not be legally binding; or • • a contract that is not enforceable at law due to public policy, contractual incapacity or illegality. 19. The courts have considered the predecessor definitions of arrangement to that in s YA 1, particularly in the context of the general anti-avoidance provision. They described an arrangement as embracing all kinds of concerted action by which persons may arrange their affairs for a particular purpose or to produce a particular effect. 20. For example, in the Court of Appeal, Richardson P stated in CIR v BNZ Investments Ltd \[2002\] 1 NZLR 450: \[45\] The words contract, agreement, plan and understanding appear to be in descending order of formality. A contract is more formal than an agreement, and in ordinary usage is usually written while an agreement is generally more formal than a plan, and a plan more formal or more structured that an understanding. And it is accepted in the definition of arrangement that the contract, agreement, plan or understanding need not be enforceable. Section 99 thus contemplates arrangements which are binding only in honour. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 59 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS \[46\] In Jaques v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1924) 34 CLR 328 at p 359 Isaacs J said that arrangement in s 260 meant an arrangement which was in the nature of a bargain but which might not legally or formally amount to a contract or an agreement. And in Bell v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1953) 87 CLR 548 at p 573, the High Court of Australia described arrangement as extending beyond contracts and agreements “so as to embrace all kinds of concerted action by which persons may arrange their affairs for a particular purpose or so as to produce a particular effect”. \[Emphasis added\] 21. Richardson P was considering a previous definition of arrangement that listed the types of arrangement in descending order of formality. The current definition lists the same types of arrangement alphabetically, so that “agreement” comes before “contract”. Despite this slight difference, Richardson P’s point that the definition provides for varying degrees of formality and enforceability remains relevant. Arrangement may involve more than one transaction or document 22. An arrangement may involve more than one transaction or document. Whether two or more transactions or documents together constitute an arrangement is a matter of fact (Peterson v CIR \[2005\] UKPC 5 at \[33\]). This determination requires consideration of the nature and extent of the relationship between the transactions or documents. 23. For example, in CIR v Europa Oil (NZ) Ltd \[1971\] NZLR 641 at 651, the Privy Council considered that six agreements constituted a single agreement because they were “far too close, and far too carefully worked out” to isolate and treat as “a series of independent bargains”. The Privy Council considered an interdependence existed between the agreements because: • • they were made on the same date and some of them contained references to the other agreements; • • they indicated that one party never intended to bind itself without entering into the other agreements; and • • the effect of one of the agreements was to enable one party to sue for any breach of the other agreements. 24. In determining whether transactions and / or documents are part of an arrangement, the courts generally ask whether: • • the transactions or documents are: –sufficiently interrelated or interdependent (or both); –part of an overall plan to obtain a particular objective or outcome; or • • there is prior planned linking or sequencing (or both) of the documents or transactions. 25. However, a mere sequence of events is not sufficient to constitute an arrangement (AMP Life v CIR (2000) 19 NZTC 15,940 (HC) at \[125\]). As mentioned, an arrangement requires an overall plan or some prior planned linking or sequencing (or both) of transactions or documents. Arrangement includes “all steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect” 26. An arrangement, as defined, includes “all steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect”. The words “including all steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect” reflect that an “agreement, contract, plan, or understanding” may not describe all the practical steps and transactions needed to carry out an arrangement. 27. Therefore, the definition makes clear that an arrangement includes the various actions undertaken to carry the arrangement into effect even if the actions are not themselves an “agreement, contract, plan, or understanding”. 28. This interpretation is consistent with CIR v Penny \[2010\] NZCA 2,310 where Randerson J stated: \[78\] I am satisfied that an “arrangement” is not limited to a specific transaction or agreement but may embrace a series of decisions and steps taken which together evidence and constitute an agreement, plan or understanding. Any such arrangement may be continued in each of the income years in question or may be varied from year to year. Other aspects of an arrangement 29. Other aspects of an arrangement include the following: • • An arrangement is defined to include a “plan”, which could involve a single person (Russell v CIR (No 2) (2010) 24 NZTC 24,463 (HC) (footnote 33 at \[101\]) and Russell v CIR \[2012\] NZCA 128 (at \[54\]). • • An arrangement does not require a consensus or a meeting of minds of two or more persons so a taxpayer could be party to an “arrangement” even if they are not consciously involved in, or aware of, the details (see: Peterson v CIR \[2005\] UKPC 5 (PC) at \[34\]). • • An arrangement may consist of more than one agreement, contract, plan or understanding, so an agreement, contract, plan or understanding may be part of a wider arrangement as well as being part of a separate narrower arrangement. • • An arrangement includes steps and transactions that are entered into or carried out outside New Zealand (BNZ Investments Ltd v CIR (2000) 19 NZTC 15,732 (HC) at \[123\]). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 60 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Shares are “subject to” an arrangement, including “an arrangement directly or indirectly altering rights” 30. For ss GB 3B and GB 4 to apply, the shares in the relevant company (that is, the loss company, the offset company or another company) must be “subject to” an arrangement. A share will be subject to an arrangement if the share is the subject matter of the arrangement, meaning that the agreement, contract, plan or understanding concerns the share or the rights attached to the share. 31. Sections GB 3B(1)(a) and GB 4(1)(a) include “an arrangement directly or indirectly altering rights attached to the shares” as a type of arrangement that may be caught by the provisions. However, the alteration of rights is not a requirement of the provisions, and other types of arrangements concerning shares may be subject to the sections. Arrangement “allows” the company to “meet” the relevant “requirements” 32. Sections GB 3B(1)(b) and GB 4(1)(b) require that the arrangement “allows” the loss company to “meet” the requirements of s IZ 8. Section IZ 8 contains the requirements for persons to make an election to use the temporary loss carry-back regime. In brief, the relevant requirements of s IZ 8 for the purposes of ss GB 3B(1)(b) and GB 4(1)(b) are the 49% share ownership continuity requirement and the 66% ownership commonality requirement. 33. The ordinary meaning of the word “allow” (and “allows”) includes permitting something to happen. The Court of Appeal has stated that the meaning of “allow” can vary according to context (McKnight v NZ Biogas Industries Ltd \[1994\] NZRMA 258 (CA)). In the context of ss GB 3B(1)(b) and GB 4(1)(b), the arrangement must permit or enable a company to obtain or maintain compliance with the ownership continuity or ownership commonality requirements during the relevant period (as required by s IZ 8). Meaning of a “purpose” 34. Sections GB 3B(1)(c) and GB 4(1)(c) refer to “a purpose” of the arrangement. The section does not require that the purpose to defeat the intent and application of s IZ 8 be a dominant or main purpose, any such purpose will suffice. However, the purpose of the arrangement must be to defeat the intent and application of s IZ 8, and not simply to enable the company to meet the requirements of that provision. 35. The way in which a purpose test is to be applied and the factors that are relevant in ascertaining purpose depend on the statutory context (CIR v Haenga (1985) 7 NZTC 5,198 (CA)). 36. In an avoidance context, the courts have held that the “purpose or effect” of an arrangement is determined objectively and the motives or intentions of the parties are not relevant. The Privy Council in Ashton v CIR \[1975\] 2 NZLR 717 (PC) agreed with the earlier Privy Council decision in Newton v Commissioner of Taxation \[1958\] AC 450, \[1958\] 2 All ER 759, stating at 721: In Newton v Commissioner of Taxation \[1958\] AC 450; \[1958\] 2 All ER 759 the Privy Council had to consider s 260 of the Commonwealth of Australia Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act 1936–1951, a section very similar to s 108. In that case Lord Denning delivering the judgment of the Board said: “The word ‘purpose’ means, not motive but the effect which it is sought to achieve — the end in view. The word ‘effect’ means the end accomplished or achieved. The whole set of words denotes concerted action to an end — the end of avoiding tax” (ibid, 465; 763). And: “... the section is not concerned with the motives of individuals. It is not concerned with their desire to avoid tax, but only with the means which they employ to do it. It affects every ‘contract, agreement or arrangement’ (which their Lordships will henceforward refer to compendiously as ‘arrangement’) which has the purpose or effect of avoiding tax. In applying the section you must, by the very words of it, look at the arrangement itself and see which is its effect — which it does — irrespective of the motives of the persons who made it. Williams J put it well when he said: ‘The purpose of a contract, agreement or arrangement must be what it is intended to effect and that intention must be ascertained from its terms. Those terms may be oral or written or may have to be inferred from the circumstances but, when they have been ascertained, their purpose must be what they effect’” (\[1958\] AC 450, 465). These observations of Lord Denning in relation to s 260 of the Australian Act are equally applicable to s 108. 37. Similarly, in Glenharrow Holdings Ltd v CIR \[2008\] NZSC 116, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 359 (SC), the following was stated: \[35\] ... Secondly, the Commissioner must have been properly satisfied that the arrangement was entered into between the parties to it to defeat the intent and application of the Act or any provision of the Act. This does not mean that the Commissioner must have been satisfied that the parties subjectively had that defeating purposes, i.e that they were consciously trying to achieve the end of defeating the intent and application of the Act. ... \[36\] A natural and sensible reading of s 76, as it stood prior to 2000, is to read it as requiring the Commissioner to be satisfied that an arrangement has been entered into between persons “so as to” defeat the intent and application of the Act or any provision of the Act. That requires the Commissioner and the Court to ask what objectively was the purpose of the arrangement, which Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 61 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS in turn requires examination of the effect of the arrangement. Section 76, even in its pre-2000 version, therefore requires an examination of the purpose or effect of the arrangement, and in this respect the current version of the section has merely stated expressly what was implicit in the former version. ... \[38\] ... the general anti avoidance provision was concerned not with the purpose of the parties, but with the purpose of the arrangement. That is a crucial distinction. Once you put the purpose of the parties to one side and seek by objective examination to find the purpose of the arrangement, you must necessarily do that by considering the effect which the arrangement has had — what it has achieved — and then, by working backwards as it were from the effect, you are able to determine what objectively the arrangement must be taken to have had as its purpose. That approach is inevitable once any subjective purpose or motive is ruled out of contention, as the authorities say it must be. \[Emphasis added\] 38. While these cases relate to the general anti-avoidance provisions, the Commissioner considers that the same principles apply to ss GB 3B and GB 4. This means that if the effect an arrangement, determined objectively, is to defeat the intent and application of the temporary loss carry-back regime, then that will be the purpose of the arrangement. “Defeat the intent and application” 39. Sections GB 3B(1)(c) and GB 4(1)(c) require that a purpose of the arrangement must be to “defeat the intent and application” of the temporary loss-carry back regime. 40. The courts have considered the meaning of provisions with similar wording in Auckland Harbour Board v CIR (2001) 20 NZTC 17,008 (PC), Ch’elle Properties (NZ) Ltd v CIR (2004) 21 NZTC 18,618 (HC), Ch'elle Properties (NZ) Ltd v CIR (2007) 23 NZTC 21,442 (CA) and Glenharrow. 41. Auckland Harbour Board concerned the application of s 64J(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976 (now s GB 21), which stated: 64J Non-market dispositions (1) Where the Commissioner, having regard to any connection between the parties to the issue or transfer of a financial arrangement and to any other relevant circumstances is satisfied that the parties were dealing with each other in relation to the issue or transfer in a manner that has the effect of defeating the intent and application of sections 64B to 64M of this Act, the Commissioner may, for the purposes of calculating the assessable income or expenditure of the parties under section 64C or section 64D or section 64F or section 64I of this Act, deem the consideration for the issue or transfer to be equal to the consideration that might reasonably be expected for the issue or transfer if the parties to the issue or transfer were independent parties dealing at arm's length with each other in relation to the issue or transfer. \[Emphasis added\] 42. In Auckland Harbour Board, Lord Hoffmann made the following comments in relation to s 64J(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976: \[11\] ... The section appears to their Lordships to contemplate that the circumstances which justify its application will be specific to a particular transaction, arising out of the relationship between the parties and other relevant circumstances. In this respect it is similar to other anti-avoidance provisions such as s 99. Their Lordships do not of course suggest that the two sections necessarily cover the same ground, but what they have in common is that they are generally speaking aimed at transactions which in commercial terms fall within the charge to tax but have been, intentionally or otherwise, structured in such a way that on a purely juristic analysis they do not. This is what is meant by defeating the intention and application of the statute. \[Emphasis added\] 43. In summary, Lord Hoffmann considered s 64J(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976 to be in the nature of an anti-avoidance provision, which applied where a transaction fell within the charge to tax in commercial terms but had been structured in such a way that on a purely juristic analysis it did not. 44. Ch’ell e (HC and CA) was concerned with s 76 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (as it applied before 10 October 2000): 76 Agreement to defeat the intention and application of Act to be void (1) Notwithstanding anything in this Act, where the Commissioner is satisfied that an arrangement has been entered into between persons to defeat the intent and application of this Act, or of any provision of this Act, the Commissioner shall treat the arrangement as void for the purposes of this Act and shall adjust the amount of tax payable by any registered person (or refundable to that person by the Commissioner) who is affected by the arrangement, whether or not that registered person is a party to it, in such manner as the Commissioner considers appropriate so as to counteract any tax advantage obtained by that registered person from or under that arrangement. \[Emphasis added\] 45. In Ch’ell e (HC), Rodney Hansen J made the following comments in relation to s 76 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 at \[39\]: Section 76 calls for a more broadly based enquiry than is required to establish technical compliance. It is whether the arrangement has been entered into “to defeat the intent and application of the Act”. I agree with Ms Ellis that this goes beyond the technical legality of the constituent parts of the arrangement. It requires the arrangement to be assessed by reference to the principles which underly the Act. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 62 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 46. In Ch’elle (CA), Robertson J upheld the High Court’s judgment and confirmed at \[31\] that: \[i\]n order to assess whether s 76 \[of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985\] is triggered it is necessary to assess the scheme and purpose of the GST Act. He also stated at \[29\]: As with all general anti-avoidance provisions, its purpose is to strike down arrangements that frustrate the taxing regime, despite the arrangement's technical compliance with substantive taxing provisions. 47. Glenharrow concerned s 76 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (as it applied before 10 October 2000). In the Supreme Court decision, Blanchard J stated: The operation of s 76 ... \[34\] In order for the Commissioner to be able to invoke s 76 he must be satisfied that the arrangement which he wishes to treat as void has been “entered into between persons to defeat the intent and application” of the GST Act or of any provision of the Act. Consistent with the approach to interpretation of General Anti-Avoidance Rules (GAARs) in the income tax context, and as foreshadowed in the preceding paragraph, this determination requires an assessment that goes beyond the technical legality of the constituent parts of the arrangement. The onus is on the taxpayer to show that the Commissioner could not properly have been satisfied in terms of the section. ... The intent and application of the Act \[40\] The application to an arrangement of tax legislation such as s 76 of the GST Act is concerned with the “aim or end in view” of the arrangement. It is to be objectively assessed. And the assessment will principally be a matter of inference from the arrangement and its effect. The purpose of an arrangement will be deduced from the arrangement itself and its effect. The intention of the Act will be defeated if an arrangement has been structured to enable the avoidance of output tax, or the obtaining of an input deduction in circumstances where that consequence is outside the purpose and contemplation of the relevant statutory provisions. Lord Hoffmann in C of IR v Auckland Harbour Board (2001) 20 NZTC 17,008 (PC) commented that, generally speaking, GAARs were: “aimed at transactions which in commercial terms fall within the charge to tax but have been, intentionally or otherwise, structured in such a way that on a purely juristic analysis they do not. This is what is meant by defeating the intention and application of the statute. An arrangement of this kind is not in accordance with the overall purpose of the Act because it produces a “tax advantage” not within the contemplation of the statute. \[Emphasis added\] 48. Having regard to principles identified in Auckland Harbour Board, Ch’ell e, and Glenharrow, the Commissioner considers the test as to whether an arrangement “defeats the intent and application” of a particular provision under a specific anti- avoidance provision such as s GB 3B or s GB 4 is in effect the same test as the parliamentary contemplation test under the general anti-avoidance provision (s BG 1), as set out by the Supreme Court in Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v CIR \[2008\] NZSC 115. Both tests are aimed at transactions and arrangements that in juristic or legal terms (that is, in legal substance) satisfy the requirements of the particular provision but, when viewed in terms of their commercial and economic reality, make use of (or circumvent) the provision in a manner that is inconsistent with the purpose of that provision. 49. This means that when applying ss GB 3B and GB 4, it is necessary to consider: • • the purpose of the temporary loss carry-back regime; and • • whether the facts of the arrangement have the consequence (effect) that the arrangement’s purpose is inconsistent with the purpose of those provisions. 50. As mentioned, the temporary loss carry-back regime was introduced as a temporary response to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The intent and application of the regime (and the application of ss GB 3B and GB 4) must be interpreted in light of the reason for its introduction. 51. The temporary loss carry-back regime enables a person who has taxable income in the 2018–19 or 2019–20 income year and anticipates a net loss in the next income year to make an election to reduce the amount of the net loss and also reduce the amount of the person’s taxable income in the earlier year by the same amount. The temporary loss carry-back regime is intended to provide fast cash-flow relief for businesses that are in a loss position during the period affected by COVID-19. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 63 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 52. The temporary loss carry-back regime is one of a number of provisions in the Act that relate to the treatment and use of tax losses. In general terms, as they currently apply, those rules are intended to ensure that the economic benefit of tax losses can only be obtained by the same people who effectively bore the economic burden of the losses. The loss carry-back regime does not override the current rules that prevent the use of losses where ownership changes, albeit those rules apply to compare the loss year to the (earlier) profit year. The 49% ownership continuity requirement and the 66% ownership commonality requirement for grouping losses currently apply to prevent the use of losses by persons who were not connected in the way contemplated by the legislation with the loss-making business when the losses were incurred. The availability of relief under the temporary loss carry-back regime is subject to the same tests during the “offset ownership period” (as defined in s IZ 8(1)). 53. The intent and application of the temporary loss carry-back regime will be defeated by an arrangement that allows losses (and relief) to be claimed by businesses where, viewing the arrangement in terms of its commercial and economic reality, the required connection has not been or will not be maintained when comparing the loss year to the profit year. Examples 54. The following examples are intended to illustrate the general approach to the application of ss GB 3B and GB 4 only. As mentioned at \[12\], this statement, including the following examples, do not consider whether a “market value circumstance” (as defined in s YA 1) exists or whether the general anti-avoidance provisions (ss BG 1 and GA 1) would potentially apply. Example 1 55. A Ltd’s taxable income in the 2019–20 income year was $2 million. By August 2020, it becomes clear to the company’s directors that, due to the impacts of COVID-19 on the company’s trading activities, A Ltd is likely to have significant tax losses for the 2020–21 income year. The losses for the part-year to August 2020 are already $1 million. It is also clear to the directors that A Ltd needs a significant injection of funds to continue trading. The company directors identify a potential new investor (B Ltd). 56. The shares in A Ltd are 100% owned by Mr and Mrs X. After a period of negotiation, the directors of A Ltd and Mr and Mrs X conclude a memorandum of understanding with B Ltd under which B Ltd will provide the necessary debt financing in addition to acquiring a controlling interest of 60% of the ordinary shares in A Ltd. Mr and Mrs X will continue to hold the remaining 40% of the shares after the transaction is completed. 57. The parties realise that one effect of implementing this arrangement in August 2020 is that A Ltd would breach the continuity of ownership rules and therefore would not satisfy the requirements to permit an election under s IZ 8. This means that any losses incurred for the remaining part of the 2020–21 income year would be unable to be carried back. A Ltd’s ability to carry losses back to the 2019–20 income year under s IZ 8 and the consequent tax refund could be maximised if any change in ownership does not occur during the 2020–21 income year. 58. Accordingly, when the arrangement is implemented in August 2020: • • B Ltd unconditionally agrees to acquire 60% of the ordinary shares of A Ltd as at the end of the 2020–21 income year (1 April 2021) at the same price as originally contemplated in the memorandum of understanding but with an adjustment of 50% of the tax relief arising from any additional tax losses available to A Ltd attributable to the period 1 August 2020 to 31 March 2021; • • B Ltd agrees to provide the capital injection immediately by way of a loan on interest-only terms and at market rates in return for debentures issued by A Ltd with security over the assets of the company; • • the loan principal advanced is the same amount of consideration B Ltd is required to pay for the shares under the agreement for sale and purchase of 60% of the shares in A Ltd; • • the loan arrangement is made on usual commercial terms, including lender protection: • • to satisfy the share purchase price, B Ltd will assign the loan to Mr and Mrs X; • • the directors of A Ltd resolve immediately to appoint to the board a director nominated by B Ltd; and • • the shareholders of A Ltd, subject to the sale and purchase of the shares agreement with B Ltd, immediately enter into an agreement with B Ltd in which they agree not to exercise their shareholder decision-making rights in a way contrary to the directions and interests of B Ltd. 59. A Ltd’s net loss for the 2020–21 income year is $1.8 million. A Ltd elects to apply s IZ 8 to carry the loss back to the 2019–20 income year. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 64 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 60. This arrangement would be subject to s GB 3B. A Ltd is treated as not meeting the requirements of s IZ 8 from the date of the arrangement (while the losses up to the date of the arrangement may still meet those requirements). The shares in A Ltd are subject to an arrangement that enables the company to continue to meet the requirements of s IZ 8 for the entire 2020–21 income year. A purpose of the arrangement is to defeat the intent and application of s IZ 8 by preserving the ability to carry back the full amount of A Ltd’s loss for that income year, while the commercial and economic reality of the arrangement is that B Ltd has immediately acquired a controlling interest in A Ltd as though the share sale had already taken place. This defeats the intent and application of the temporary loss carry-back regime. Example 2 61. ABC Co and XYZ Co are wholly-owned subsidiaries of P Ltd and each operates a popular tourist attraction in Queenstown. 62. While both attractions have been operating profitably, P Ltd has been seeking a purchaser for ABC Co for some time. After extensive negotiations with Q Ltd, P Ltd and Q Ltd entered into a memorandum of understanding for the sale of the ABC Co shares in February 2020. The memorandum provided for the sale to take place on 1 June 2020 for a fixed price, determined by reference to an independent valuation undertaken in January 2020. 63. The COVID-19 lockdown occurred before the terms of the sale agreement could be finalised and entered into, which resulted in further negotiations between the parties taking place in April 2020. 64. In the 2019–20 income year, ABC Co made a profit of $1 million and XYZ Co made a profit of $100,000. However, due to the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on their businesses, for the 2020–21 income year, ABC Co expects to make a small profit of $50,000, while XYZ Co expects to make a substantial loss of ($500,000). 65. P Ltd would like to reduce the amount of income tax payable by the group by offsetting XYZ Co’s expected losses for the 2020–21 income year against ABC Co’s income from the 2019–20 income year and take advantage of the newly introduced loss carry-back regime (net of ABC Co’s $50,000 profit). This would not be possible if the sale to Q Ltd takes place on the terms contemplated by the memorandum of understanding, as the commonality of ownership requirement would not be satisfied from 1 June 2020. 66. Q Ltd agrees to defer the acquisition of the shares in ABC Co until the start of the 2021–22 income year, but will take responsibility for the day to day management and operation of ABC Co’s tourist attraction from 1 June 2020 under a management agreement that entitles Q Ltd to all proceeds from the operation after direct operating costs have been met. All other aspects of the memorandum of understanding, including the purchase price, are unchanged and the agreement for sale and purchase is entered into on 1 June 2020. 67. Section GB 4 applies to this arrangement. The shares in ABC Co are subject to an arrangement that allows it to continue to meet the requirements of s IZ 8 for the entire 2020–21 income year. A purpose of the arrangement is to preserve the ability to carry back the full amount of XYZ Co’s 2020–21 loss. While a share sale with deferred settlement is not unusual, the specific agreement between the parties here defeats the intent and application of the temporary loss carry-back regime. Therefore, ABC Co is treated as not satisfying the requirements of s IZ 8 from the date of the arrangement (1 June 2020). Example 3 68. F Ltd’s taxable income in the 2019–20 income year was $25 million. By July 2020, it is clear to the company’s directors that, due to the impacts of COVID-19 on F Ltd’s business, F Ltd is likely to have significant tax losses for the 2020–21 income year. The loss is estimated at over $15 million. It is also clear to the directors that F Ltd needs a significant injection of funds to continue trading. 69. F Ltd’s bank (C Bank) is prepared to lend F Ltd additional debt funding on normal arm’s length, commercial terms. C Bank considers that F Ltd will be able to meet its obligations under the loan. However, due to uncertainty concerning the impact of COVID-19 on F Ltd’s business, C Bank requires that the shareholders of F Ltd provide security over their shares in F Ltd. 70. If the security is called on before the end of the 2020-21 income year, and C Bank acquires the shares there would be a loss of shareholder continuity under the current law, which would cause F Ltd to fail to meet the requirements of s IZ 8 and be unable to carry back any loss that occurs after that date. However, if C Bank enforces the security after the end of the 2020-21 income year, the loss carry-back is unaffected. 71. The shares of F Ltd are the subject of an arrangement. However, the purpose of the arrangement is to provide F Ltd with funding on commercial terms. The commercial and economic reality of the arrangement is that C Bank is a secured lender, lending to F Ltd on commercial terms. In the Commissioner’s view, defeating the intent and application of s IZ 8 or the temporary loss carry-back regime is not a purpose of the arrangement. Accordingly, s GB 3B would not apply to the arrangement. F Ltd would be entitled to make an election under s IZ 8 for the portion of its loss that arises after the funding from C Bank is drawn down. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 65 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Example 4 72. In the 2019–20 income year, P Ltd was a successful company with $10 million of taxable income. P Ltd has two shareholders, X Ltd, who owns 40% of the ordinary shares, and Y Ltd, who owns 60%. 73. Due to the impact of COVID-19, P Ltd expects to have a significant loss ($5 million) in the 2020–21 income year. P Ltd is also experiencing acute financial difficulty and requires a significant injection of cash to continue trading. X Ltd is in a position to provide that funding, but Y Ltd is not. The parties come to an agreement for X Ltd to provide P Ltd with additional funds in the form of a loan, with Y Ltd granting X Ltd a call option over 55% of the shares in P Ltd. The loan will be interest bearing and on arm’s-length commercial terms. 74. The call option will only be exercisable if P Ltd defaults under the loan from X Ltd. If the call option is exercised, X Ltd will hold 95% of the shares in P Ltd, and there will be a loss of shareholder continuity under the current law. This would cause P Ltd to fail to meet the requirements of s IZ 8 and be unable to carry back any loss that occurs after that date. 75. At the time the loan is entered into, neither party expects that the call option will be required to be exercised. 76. The shares of P Ltd are the subject of an arrangement. However, the purpose of the arrangement is to provide P Ltd with funding on commercial terms. The commercial and economic effect of the arrangement is that X Ltd is a secured lender, lending to P Ltd on commercial terms. In the Commissioner’s view, defeating the intent and application of s IZ 8 or the temporary loss carry-back regime is not a purpose of the arrangement. Accordingly, s GB 3B would not apply to the arrangement. P Ltd would be entitled to make an election under s IZ 8 for the portion of its loss arising after the loan is entered into. Appendix: Other relevant legislative provisions 77. Section IZ 8 states: IZ 8 Election to use net loss for 2019–20 or 2020–21 year as tax loss in preceding year Terms used in this section (1) This section provides that a person who has taxable income in the 2018–19 or 2019–20 income year and a net loss in the following income year may choose to reduce the taxable income in the first year by an amount, which is treated as being an available tax loss that can be used in the first income year, and subtracting the same amount from the net loss that would otherwise be available in the second income year, subject to restrictions that are expressed in terms of— (a) the offset years, which refers to the period of 2 years that is affected by the election and begins with either the 2018–19 or the 2019–20 income year: (b) the taxable income year, which refers to the first of the offset years: (c) the initial taxable income, which refers to the amount of taxable income given by subsection (2)(a) for the person and the taxable income year: (d) the net loss year, which refers to the second of the offset years: (e) the elected amount, which refers to the amount by which an election under this section reduces both the initial taxable income and the net loss that, in the absence of the election, the person would have in the net loss year: (f) the offset ownership period, which refers to the period in the offset years for which a person that is a company meets requirements relating to continuity of ownership for carrying forward loss balances from 1 tax year to the next: (g) the income ownership period, which refers to the part of the offset ownership period that occurs in the taxable income year: (h) the loss ownership period, which refers to the part of the offset ownership period that occurs in the net loss year: (i) the group loss excess, which is the amount of the excess of net loss given by subsection (3)(b) for the members of a wholly-owned group of companies and the loss ownership period.

Scope of this statement 1. This statement discusses the GST treatment of short-stay accommodation provided on peer-to-peer websites such as Airbnb, Bookabach and Holiday Houses. In this statement, “short-stay accommodation” means accommodation provided for less than four weeks. The focus of this statement is where a host offers accommodation to the guest in either the host’s home (and they might list a room, a sleepout or the entire property) or holiday home. The statement also covers short-stay accommodation provided in a property exclusively used for that purpose. Short-stay accommodation might be for the purposes of a holiday, to visit family or friends, to attend a special event or when travelling away on business. Short-stay accommodation is not intended to cover accommodation provided to residential tenants, boarders, students or care home residents. Summary 2. The statement approaches GST from the perspective of someone considering providing short-stay accommodation for the first time. The statement first confirms the supply of short-stay accommodation by a registered person is not an exempt supply (meaning it is potentially subject to GST). It then discusses: • • the requirements for registration; • • the main consequences of registration; and • • what happens when the property is sold or the short-stay accommodation activity ceases. 3. The supply of accommodation in a dwelling is one of the few exceptions to the broad base coverage of GST. For a property to be a “dwelling”, the guest must use the property as their principal place of residence and they will usually have rights of quiet enjoyment. However, the types of short-stay accommodation addressed in this statement will not be a guest’s principal place of residence nor will they have a right of quiet enjoyment. Consequently, if the host is a registered person, the supply of short-stay accommodation will be subject to GST. 4. To register for GST, it is necessary to first have a taxable activity. Determining whether a taxable activity is being carried on is a question of fact. For most hosts, the crucial question is whether the short-stay accommodation activity is carried on continuously or regularly. Occupancy is a key (but not determining) factor, and regular paying guests will suggest a taxable activity. Providing occasional or intermittent short-stay accommodation, for instance renting a room for a one-off sporting event, will not be sufficient to establish a taxable activity. 5. A person making taxable supplies in the course of a taxable activity becomes liable to register for GST under s 51. The Act provides for compulsory registration for those making taxable supplies exceeding $60,000 in any 12-month period. Hosts making supplies under the $60,000 threshold may voluntarily register for GST. 6. When a person is registered for GST, they must file a GST return for each return period. The GST charged on a registered person’s taxable supplies is referred to as output tax. GST that is charged on goods and services acquired by a registered person is called input tax. If a host registers for GST, they will have to account for GST output tax on the supply of short- stay accommodation. The amount of tax payable is calculated by deducting input tax from the amount of output tax. 7. Generally, a registered person may claim input tax deductions to the extent to which the goods or services are used for, or are available for use in, making taxable supplies. A full input tax deduction is allowed for goods or services that are used (or intended to be used) solely for making taxable supplies (for example, advertising services or goods such as toiletries purchased solely for use by guests). On the other hand, no input tax deduction is allowed for a good or service that is intended to be used solely for making non-taxable supplies (for example, any goods or services purchased for private use by the host). 8. Where the relevant goods or services are to be used for making both taxable and exempt supplies (for example, the power bill for electricity used by both guests and the host), then the input tax able to be deducted must be apportioned based on use (or intended use). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 69 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 9. If a property is a “mixed-use asset” (this is likely to include holiday homes used both privately and to earn income), s 20G contains a formula for apportionment and adjustments. This provision is based on the mixed-use asset rules in subpart DG of the Income Tax Act 2007. Put simply, the formula ignores periods where the property is empty when apportioning between taxable and non-taxable use. 10. Various adjustments may need to be made over the period of the taxable activity. The most likely adjustments for short- stay accommodation are as follows: • • An adjustment under ss 21 to 21I if the extent to which a good or service is used for making taxable supplies changes. Section 21 requires a registered person to ascertain at the end of an “adjustment period” whether an adjustment is required for any difference between the intended use and actual use. • • Section 21B allows a GST input tax deduction where goods acquired before registration are subsequently used in a taxable activity. • • Section 21FB provides for a wash-up calculation where there is a sustained change of use from mixed-use to total taxable or total non-taxable (but the registered person’s taxable activity is ongoing). Rather than continue to make adjustments every year, the taxpayer can effectively get the full input tax deduction from acquisition (if 100% taxable use) or repay the GST input tax from acquisition (if 100% non-taxable use). • • Section 21H and 21HB are transitional provisions that may apply to properties purchased before 1 April 2011. 11. A disposal of a property used to make taxable supplies of short-stay accommodation has GST consequences. A sale of such a property will be in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity and subject to GST under s 8(1). GST output tax will be charged on the sale price. To the extent that a person has not claimed the full input tax deduction they can claim an adjustment under s 21F. GST input tax is claimed on the purchase price and GST output tax is charged on the sale price. Consequently, a net GST liability on property is likely because it usually appreciates in value (sometimes significantly). 12. There will also be a deemed disposal on cancellation of registration. This is most likely to occur where a host ceases their taxable activity of providing short-stay accommodation. The host must notify the Commissioner within 21 days of ceasing their taxable activity of providing short-stay accommodation. The Commissioner can also cancel a person’s registration, if she is satisfied that they are not carrying on a taxable activity. A deemed supply of the property at open market value arises on deregistration. For a host this means paying GST output tax based on the value of their property when they cease their taxable activity. Where the property has been owned since before 1986 (when GST was introduced), the adjustment can be made at the lower of the cost of the property or its market value (s 10(8)). 13. This statement confirms “GST — Supply of Accommodation in Holiday Homes”, Public Information Bulletin 160 (March 1987): 4 (PIB 160) no longer has any current application. The PIB item discussed the GST treatment of holiday homes but the analysis is no longer correct because of amendments to the definitions of the terms “dwelling” and “commercial dwelling” in the Act. Introduction 14. This statement is part of a series of guidance addressing the tax implications of providing short-stay accommodation through peer-to-peer websites. The Commissioner published a Determination and five Questions We’ve Been Asked in Tax Information Bulletin vol 31, no 6 (July 2019): • • “DET 19/02: Standard-cost household service for short-stay accommodation providers” (at 67); • • “QB 19/05: What are my income tax obligations if I rent out my home or a separate dwelling on my property as short- stay accommodation?” (at 3); • • “QB 19/06: What income tax rules apply if I have a dwelling that I sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and sometimes use myself?” (at 12); • • “QB 19/07: How do the mixed-use asset income tax rules apply to a dwelling that I sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and sometimes use privately?” (at 16); • • “QB 19/08: How do the standard income tax rules apply to a dwelling that I sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and sometimes use privately?” (at 22); and • • “QB 19/09: Can I register for GST if I supply short-stay accommodation to guests in my home or holiday home?” (at 27). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 70 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 15. This statement builds on the discussion in QB 19/09, which focuses on whether a host can register and some of the major consequences. This statement follows the lifecycle of a taxable activity of supplying short-stay accommodation. The statement addresses the issues sequentially: • • identifying supplies of short-stay accommodation (from \[17\]); • • determining whether the supply of short-stay accommodation is an exempt supply (from \[23\]); • • registering and calculating the threshold for s 51 (from \[45\]), specifically: –the consequences of making other taxable supplies when calculating the threshold (for example, the self- employed plumber who also has a taxable activity as a short-stay accommodation host); and –supplies to associated persons (for example, where a host makes an “associated supply” to an “associated person” the Act deems this to be a supply at open market value); • • understanding the consequences of registration (from \[92\]), specifically: –the need to file returns for a return period; and –output tax (including output tax on associated supplies); • • determining input tax (from \[96\]): –limitation of input tax deductions where property acquired from an associated person; and –calculation of input tax on goods and services with “mixed” use; • • apportioning input tax on acquisition of goods and services when a property is used privately and for making taxable supplies, which, in most cases, will mean an apportionment based on a “time and space” calculation (from \[114\]); • • applying special rules for mixed-use assets such as holiday homes and baches (s 20G) (from \[133\]); • • making annual change of use adjustments required for property and specific adjustments under (from \[141\]): –s 21B – adjustments for goods acquired before registration; –s 21FB – a wash-up calculation for a change of use to total taxable or total non-taxable; –s 21E – adjustments for the concurrent use of land; and –ss 21H and 21HB – transitional provisions that may apply to the property used to make supplies of short-stay accommodation; • • disposal of property (from \[182\]): –disposal by way of sale, which includes the final adjustment on disposal where a person has not previously had a full input tax deduction (under s 21F) and when the compulsory zero-rating of land rules may apply; and –deemed disposal on cancellation of registration under s 52, which is most likely to occur where a host ceases their taxable activity. 16. Seventeen examples are included throughout this statement to illustrate the issues listed above. Examples 1, 2 and 4 are copied or adapted from QB 09/19, as they illustrate the points discussed in this statement. Example 8 is adapted from QB 19/05. Identifying supplies of short-stay accommodation 17. A wide variety of different types of accommodation are listed on peer-to-peer websites (such as Bookabach and Airbnb). This statement covers accommodation that is: • • provided for a period of less than four weeks; and • • not the guest’s main residence during the period in question. 18. As a result, this statement is not intended to apply to accommodation provided as residential letting, boarding services, student accommodation, respite care and care homes, as they are likely to fail one or both of the requirements. 19. Instead, the focus is on the types of short-stay accommodation used when on holiday, travelling for business, visiting friends or relatives, or spending time in another part of the country. Consistent with this, the statement uses the terms “host” and “guest” (rather than owner, landlord, tenant, renter and so on) as these labels seem most appropriate in the short-stay accommodation context. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 71 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 20. The most common types of premises used to provide short-stay accommodation appear to be: • • the host’s home, which may occur in different ways: –one or more rooms in the host’s home; –a self-contained unit on the host’s property (for example, a sleep-out, cottage or converted garage); –the host’s entire home for periods when the host is not occupying it; • • holiday homes or baches; • • serviced apartments; • • properties providing dedicated short-stay accommodation; • • farmstays; and • • bed and breakfasts. 21. Both the frequency of rental and the cost to the guest vary significantly from case to case. A correlation does not necessarily exist between frequency of rental and income derived (for example, a well-located apartment in a major city listed for a one-off event may make more in a week than an apartment in the suburbs of such a city makes in a whole year). 22. It will often be the owner of the property that is making the supplies of short-stay accommodation but that will not always be the case. By way of example, if a property is owned by trustees then depending on the particular arrangements it may be the trustees or beneficiaries who make the supplies of short-stay accommodation. For instance, if a property is held in trust but made available to the beneficiaries as their family home and the beneficiaries rent a room out on a peer-to-peer website then it may be the beneficiaries who are making the supplies. In this scenario where a room is being rented out in the family home it would be unusual to consider registering for GST. However, if the beneficiaries were carrying on a taxable activity and did register for GST, the property itself would not be part of the beneficiaries’ taxable activity as it is owned by the trustees. Determining whether the supply of short-stay accommodation is an exempt supply 23. When GST was introduced, one of the few exceptions to the broad-base coverage was the supply of residential accommodation. However, it was intended that short-term accommodation would be subject to GST. Broadly, this was achieved in the legislation by making the supply of accommodation by a GST-registered person in a “dwelling” an exempt supply and the supply of accommodation in a “commercial dwelling” a taxable supply. 24. Historically, there has been some uncertainty in applying the distinction, particularly to premises such as homestays and holiday homes. The Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010 addressed this and narrowed the definition of “dwelling” by moving away from the functional nature of the premises to focus on the nature of the occupation by the recipient of the supply. At the same time, the definition of “commercial dwelling” was widened by specifically including homestays, farmstays, and bed and breakfast establishments. Inland Revenue considers that the amendments to the legislation mean that short-stay accommodation will not be an exempt supply of accommodation in a dwelling. Legislation 25. Supplies of accommodation in a “dwelling” are exempt from GST under s 14(1)(c). “Dwelling” is defined in s 2 as follows: dwelling, for a person,— (a) means premises, as defined in section 2 of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986,— (i) that the person occupies, or that it can reasonably be foreseen that the person will occupy, as their principal place of residence; and (ii) in relation to which the person has quiet enjoyment, as that term is used in section 38 of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986; and (b) includes— (i) accommodation provided to a person who is occupying the same premises, or part of the same premises, as the supplier of the accommodation and who meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(i): (ii) any appurtenances belonging to or used with the premises: (iii) despite paragraph (a)(ii), a residential unit in a retirement village or rest home when the consideration paid or payable for the supply of accommodation in the unit is for the right to occupy the unit; and (c) excludes a commercial dwelling Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 72 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 26. In brief, a “dwelling” is premises that a person occupies as their principal place of residence and for which they have quiet enjoyment, but does not include a commercial dwelling. 27. As noted above, the definition of “dwelling” was restricted with effect from 1 April 2011 by amendments in the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010. The definition of “principal place of residence” was also introduced at this time. The intention was to restrict the definition of “dwelling” by referring to the nature of the supply rather the nature of the premises. Dwelling is defined “for a person” as meaning accommodation that the person occupies as their principal place of residence, and the recipient will usually have quiet enjoyment (there is an exception where the person lives with their landlord). 28. For there to be an exempt supply of accommodation in a dwelling to a person, the: • • accommodation or dwelling must be premises (as defined in the Residential Tenancies Act 1986); • • accommodation must be occupied as the person’s principal place of residence; • • person must have quiet enjoyment of the accommodation or dwelling; and • • accommodation or dwelling must not be a commercial dwelling. Whether the accommodation are “premises” as defined in the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 29. The word “premises” is widely defined in s 2 of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986. All the types of accommodation listed at \[20\] are “premises”. Principal place of residence 30. The definition of “dwelling” requires that the person occupies, or that it can reasonably be foreseen that the person will occupy, the premises as their principal place of residence. “Principal place of residence” in turn is defined as a place that a person occupies as their main residence for the period to which the agreement for the supply of accommodation relates. 31. “Principal place of residence” is defined in s 2: principal place of residence, in the definition of dwelling means a place that a person occupies as their main residence for the period to which the agreement for the supply of accommodation relates 32. The term “short-stay accommodation” as used in this statement means accommodation provided for less than four weeks and that is not the person’s principal place of residence. This is consistent with most accommodation listed on websites such as Airbnb or Bookabach. Accordingly, by its very nature, short-stay accommodation will not be the guest’s principal place of residence. On this basis alone, the supply of short-stay accommodation will not be of accommodation in a “dwelling”. Quiet enjoyment 33. If the premises are not the person’s principal place of residence, there will not be an exempt supply of accommodation in a dwelling. Therefore, it is unnecessary to consider whether the guests also have quiet enjoyment. However, it is highly unlikely that a guest would have quiet enjoyment as that term is used in s 38 of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986. Commercial dwellings 34. The supply of short-stay accommodation will not be the supply of accommodation in a dwelling because the premises will not be the guest’s main place of residence, and it seems unlikely that the guest will have quiet enjoyment. Consequently, the supply of short-stay accommodation is subject to GST and is not exempt. Whether it is a supply of accommodation in a “commercial dwelling” does not need to be determined to answer this question. 35. However, the statement briefly addresses this issue because the 2011 amendments to the definitions of “dwelling” and “commercial dwelling” (discussed at \[27\]) have an impact on old Public Information Bulletin items. 36. As discussed above, “dwelling” is defined by reference to the supply rather than the function of the premises. The drafting suggests that the perspective of the recipient of the supply is also relevant when it comes to commercial dwellings: dwelling, for a person,— ... (c) excludes a commercial dwelling Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 73 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 37. This appears to initially put the emphasis on what a “commercial dwelling” is from the perspective of the person receiving the supply. However, the definition of “commercial dwelling” in s 2 focuses on the function of the premises: commercial dwelling— (a) means— (i) a hotel, motel, homestay, farmstay, bed and breakfast establishment, inn, hostel, or boardinghouse: (ii) a serviced apartment managed or operated by a third party for which services in addition to the supply of accommodation are provided and in relation to which a resident does not have quiet enjoyment, as that term is used in section 38 of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986: (iii) a convalescent home, nursing home, rest home, or hospice: (iv) a camping ground: (v) premises of a similar kind to those referred to in subparagraphs (i) to (iv); and (b) excludes— (i) a hospital except to the extent to which the hospital is a residential establishment: (ii) a dwelling referred to in paragraph (b)(iii) of the definition of dwelling 38. None of the types of accommodation in para (a)(i) or para (a)(ii) are defined so all have their ordinary meaning. “Homestay”, “farmstay” and “bed and breakfast establishment” were all added to para (a)(i) by the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010 to broaden the definition of “commercial dwelling”. These types of premises usually involve the use of the host’s home in the provision of short-stay accommodation, so are potentially relevant to the types of accommodation dealt with in this statement. Old Public Information Bulletin items 39. “GST — Supply of Accommodation in Holiday Homes”, Public Information Bulletin 160 (March 1987): 4 (PIB 160) discussed the GST treatment of holiday homes and caravan sites. This item was categorised as being under review following the review of the old PIB items. The analysis of whether holiday homes are “dwellings” or “commercial dwellings” is no longer correct because of the 2011 amendments to the definitions. Consequently, the item has no current application and will not be re-published. 40. The reference in the PIB item to “caravan sites” refers to the underlying site or berth and not the caravan itself (caravans were addressed in Question 116 in Public Information Bulletin Vol 158 (November 1986). PIB 160 stated: The rental or lease of caravan sites is taxable in full, for the first four weeks accommodation and at the rate of 60 percent of the charge thereafter. A site is a “commercial dwelling” and the special valuation provisions of section 10(6) will apply. 41. To the extent that the caravan site is on a camping ground (or a similar establishment), it is included in the definition of commercial dwelling and the special valuation provisions in s 10(6) will apply. Conclusion 42. The supply of accommodation in a dwelling involves an assessment of the supply to the recipient rather than an enquiry into the function of the property. The definition of “dwelling” requires the person to occupy the premises as their principal place of residence and to have quiet enjoyment (as that term is used in the Residential Tenancies Act 1986). Where a person has a residential tenancy, these aspects will usually be present. However, short-stay accommodation will not be a person’s principal place of residence. It is also unlikely that the host will grant rights that correspond to quiet enjoyment. 43. On this basis, the supply of short-stay accommodation will not be the supply of accommodation in a dwelling. This means short-stay accommodation will be subject to GST. Therefore, whether the premises are a “commercial dwelling” is relevant only to scenarios where there are long-term stays (stays in excess of four weeks), as the supplies of accommodation may be subject to a lower rate of GST. 44. Example 1 illustrates the circumstances in which a property can be a “dwelling”. It is based on Example 4 from QB 19/09. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 74 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Example 1 – circumstances in which a property can be a “dwelling” Baz has the opportunity to buy a house in Turangi. The house costs $400,000 but Baz reckons the local housing market is so strong that it will be worth $480,000 in a few years. He wants to either: • • Rent the property to residential tenants; or • • List the property as a holiday home on a website. He will use the property exclusively for providing short-stay accommodation. He believes the property will be popular year-round because of the proximity to the ski fields, the Tongariro Crossing and good fly-fishing spots. Baz wants to know whether he can register for GST. Residential tenants If he rents the property to residential tenants, he cannot register for GST. The supply of accommodation in a dwelling is not a taxable supply. If rented to residential tenants, it is likely to be a supply of accommodation in a dwelling because it is the tenants’ principal place of residence and they have quiet enjoyment under their residential tenancy. Short-stay accommodation The provision of short-stay accommodation (as that term is used in this statement) is a taxable supply. It will not be an exempt supply of accommodation in a dwelling because the house will not be the guest’s principal place of residence and they will not have rights akin to quiet enjoyment. Baz can register for GST provided he has a taxable activity of providing short-stay accommodation. Based on his research, Baz believes he can rent the property year-round. He estimates 120 nights of bookings per year at an average of $200 per night ($24,000 pa). If he proceeds with his plan Baz will have a taxable activity. The value of supplies in any 12-month period will be well below the $60,000 threshold and so registration would be voluntary. Registering and calculating the GST threshold – entry into the GST regime 45. The Act provides for both compulsory and voluntary registration. Section 51(1)(a)–(c) provides: 51 Persons making supplies in course of taxable activity to be registered (1) Subject to this Act, every person who, on or after the 1st day of October 1986, carries on any taxable activity and is not registered, becomes liable to be registered— (a) At the end of any month where the total value of supplies made in New Zealand in that month and the 11 months immediately preceding that month in the course of carrying on all taxable activities has exceeded $60,000 (or such larger amount as the Governor-General may, from time to time, by Order in Council declare): provided that a person does not become liable to be registered by virtue of this paragraph where the Commissioner is satisfied that the value of those supplies in the period of 12 months beginning on the day after the last day of the period referred to in the said paragraph will not exceed that amount: (b) At the commencement of any month where there are reasonable grounds for believing that the total value of the supplies to be made in New Zealand in that month and the 11 months immediately following that month will exceed the amount specified in paragraph (a) of this section: provided that any such person shall not become liable where the Commissioner is satisfied that that value will exceed that amount in that period solely as a consequence of— (c) any ending of, including a premature ending of, or any substantial and permanent reduction in the size or scale of, any taxable activity carried on by that person; ... \[Emphasis added\] 46. Registration is compulsory for persons carrying on a taxable activity whose taxable supplies exceed the $60,000 threshold. Taxpayers who do not exceed the s 51(1) threshold for registration may choose to voluntarily register under s 51(3), if they satisfy the Commissioner that they are carrying on any taxable activity or intend to carry on a taxable activity from a specified date. Whether registration is voluntary or compulsory, there must be a taxable activity. Taxable activity 47. GST is imposed by s 8(1): 8 Imposition of goods and services tax on supply (1) Subject to this Act, a tax, to be known as goods and services tax, shall be charged in accordance with the provisions of this Act at the rate of 15 percent on the supply (but not including an exempt supply) in New Zealand of goods and services, on or after the 1st day of October 1986, by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person, by reference to the value of that supply. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 75 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 48. Taxable supplies are made by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by the registered person. Given that a taxable activity is crucial to whether a person should be registered and entitled to claim input tax deductions, the term “taxable activity” is considered further. 49. Section 6(1)(a) defines “taxable activity”: 6 Meaning of term taxable activity (1) For the purposes of this Act, the term taxable activity means— (a) Any activity which is carried on continuously or regularly by any person, whether or not for a pecuniary profit, and involves or is intended to involve, in whole or in part, the supply of goods and services to any other person for a consideration; and includes any such activity carried on in the form of a business, trade, manufacture, profession, vocation, association, or club: 50. For a taxable activity under s 6(1)(a): • • there must be an activity; • • which is carried on continuously or regularly by a person; and • • that involves, or is intended to involve, supplies made to another person for a consideration. 51. Further the activity must not be an exempt supply, however this will not be a factor where a person is providing short-stay accommodation (see from \[23\]). In most cases, the issue will be whether they are carrying on their activity continuously or regularly. Carried on continuously or regularly 52. To be a “taxable activity”, the activity must be carried on continuously or regularly. In Newman v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,097 (CA), Richardson J in the Court of Appeal considered the meaning of the words “carrying on” at \[20\]: “Carrying on” has been described as “the habitual pursuit of a course of conduct” (Premier Automatic Ticket Issues Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1933) 50 CLR 268 at p 298); and as implying “a repetition of acts, and excluding the case of an association formed for doing one particular act which is never to be repeated” (Smith v Anderson (1880) 15 Ch D 247 at 277, 278). 53. Therefore, a taxpayer must be habitually pursuing a course of conduct or engaging in a repetition of acts to be carrying on that activity. Further guidance in determining the extent to which activities are or are not carried on continuously or regularly can be taken from the following case law. 54. In Wakelin v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,182 (HC), Paterson J stated at \[13\]: The term “carried on continuously or regularly” as used in s 6(1) is to be given its ordinary meaning. An activity is therefore carried on continuously if it is carried on over a period or in a sequence uninterrupted in time or if it is connected. It is carried on regularly if it is carried on in accordance with a definite course or a uniform principle of action or conduct or if there is a proper correspondence between the elements of the activity (see the New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary). 55. In Case N27 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,229 Judge Bathgate commented on the term “continuously” at \[26\]: “Continuously” does not obviously mean that the physical activity must be continuing all the time; again the analogy of a business is useful ... Continuously, in this context means more that the activity has not ceased in a permanent sense, or has not been interrupted in a significant way, so that one could say with some certainty that it was not continuous. \[Emphasis added\] 56. Judge Bathgate also considered the word “regularly”, stating at \[27\]: Whether an activity is carried on “regularly”, involves similar considerations, in which the character and nature of the activity would be of importance in determining whether the activity carried on day by day, week by week, or month by month, may be said to be carried on regularly. Regular, in this context, I think means a steadiness or uniformity of action, or occurrence of action, so that it recurs or is repeated at fairly fixed times, or at generally uniform intervals, to be of a habitual nature and character. 57. The High Court also considered the meaning of “continuously or regularly” in Allen Yachts Charters Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,270. The court found that the yacht-chartering activity in question was a taxable activity. Although it had not been carried on continuously, as there had been only 12 charters over a two-year period, it had been carried on regularly. This was the result given the number of occasions when there was a charter, and also the activities relating to the charter operation. For example, weekly marketing, availability of the boat, signs advertising its availability, and the continuation of these activities until the sale of the boat. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 76 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 58. In an earlier Taxation Review Authority decision, Case P73 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,489, which also dealt with a yacht-chartering business, Judge Barber found that no taxable activity had been carried on. The principal use of the yacht in question was racing and not chartering. Judge Barber found that the yacht company had intended to commence a chartering operation. However, that operation either never commenced, or did not commence to the necessary degree to be carried on “continuously or regularly”. The following parts of the decision are relevant here (at 4,493–4,495): I am in no doubt that, at material times, ... the objector was not carrying on a taxable activity. The objector intended to take all steps necessary to establish business as a charterer, but did not achieve that enterprise. Its activities were preparatory of that. ... In fact, the objector did not get beyond development work for a business. As it dealt with survey aspects and promoted the availability of chartering, it became apparent that there was no market for the objector's enterprise. ... I appreciate that sec 6(2) deems the inclusion of commencement (and termination) activity into the course of that activity. However, here there was never the establishment of any taxable activity. Commencement work can only be added to such an activity. By itself, it cannot amount to a taxable activity. ... There were budgets and feasibility studies. ... The objector incurred expenses in altering the vessel for passenger carrying purposes. ... I also accept that chartering is a seasonal activity and that a boat can be taken out of the water for quite long periods for good reasons. I accept the intentions of the objector to commence chartering from the very outset of GST registration. ... The chartering activity was never much more than a proposal and, certainly, was never continuous or regular as required by sec 6(1)(a). 59. In summary, for an activity to be carried on “regularly”, it must be carried on at reasonably short intervals with a steadiness or uniformity of action. The activity must recur or be repeated at fairly fixed times or generally uniform intervals to be of a habitual nature and character. An activity that is intermittent or occasional does not qualify (Newman, Case N27, Allen Yacht Charters Ltd). For an activity to be carried on “continuously”, the activity must not have ceased in a permanent sense or have been interrupted in a significant way. Involves or is intended to involve supplies 60. A “taxable activity” must also be an activity that “involves or is intended to involve” the supply of goods and services to another person for consideration. This is particularly relevant where a person has yet to make any supplies, for instance they are renovating a sleep-out that they intend to list on Airbnb. If the activity is intended to involve the supply of goods and services to another person for consideration, a taxpayer may have a taxable activity before any supplies have even been made. As Judge Bathgate stated in Case N27 at \[28\]: The actual supply of goods and services is not necessary, so long as there is an intention to be involved in that supply. 61. In Case N27, Judge Bathgate noted that the phrase “involves or is intended to involve” introduces a subjective element into an otherwise objective provision but that generally actions speak louder than words, stating at \[24\]: In the statutory context of sec 6(1)(a) of the Act, with its reference to intention to involve, in whole or in part, the supply of goods and services to another person for a consideration, as part of an activity, to amount to a “taxable activity”, would seem to include, in part at least, a consideration in some instances of the subjective element. Generally, actions will speak louder than words, in determining the nature and character of an activity. Any stated intention can be tested against the objective realities of the case. Nevertheless the subjective element of intention may be a relevant circumstance. I do not think it is wholly an objective test, as to whether or not there is in any particular circumstance a “taxable activity”. It is a matter of fact and degree to be ascertained from all the evidence in any particular case. In Calkin v C of IR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,781 at p 61,785; \[1984\] 1 NZLR 440 at p 445, Cooke J said that, whether there was at relevant times an “undertaking”, “... must ultimately be a question of fact, to be determined by ‘the character and circumstances of that particular venture’ ”. \[Emphasis added\] Taxable activity of supplying short-stay accommodation 62. Determining whether a taxable activity is being carried on, including whether the activity is being carried on continuously or regularly, will always be a question of fact and degree. It will involve an examination of all the circumstances of the particular case. 63. Much of the short-stay accommodation offered on peer-to-peer websites is based in the host’s home or a holiday home. A person’s home is inherently private in nature, and it can be difficult to distinguish what is private and what is related to the taxable activity. An examination of all the circumstances, including the domestic use of the premises, is required. The factor that will usually be the strongest indicator of a taxable activity is occupancy. If, for example, a person lets out their country cottage for 30 weekends over the course of a year, they will have a taxable activity. On the other hand, if the host lets the cottage only once a year for the annual A&P show then this would not be sufficient. The Commissioner cannot prescribe a minimum level of occupancy for there to be a taxable activity because this will depend on the circumstances. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 77 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 64. Factors that may be relevant in the short-stay accommodation context (particularly where the premises are the host’s home) are: • • the level of occupancy; • • the steps the host has taken to commence operating as a provider of short-stay accommodation; for example, undertaking feasibility studies, preparing business plans, advertising (nature, and extent), and approaching local authorities for necessary consent; • • whether the property is listed on various websites and at an appropriate price; • • the type, size, design and layout of the home or premises; • • the location of the home or premises; • • the extent and nature of any modifications to the property to enable the host to provide short-stay accommodation; • • the time dedicated or able to be dedicated by the host to the activity; • • the availability of accommodation over a sustained period; • • the steps the host has taken which demonstrate a continuing commitment to supply short-stay accommodation; for example, advertising and ongoing marketing activities; and • • future bookings. 65. The following Examples demonstrate aspects of what is required to have a taxable activity. Examples 2 and 4 are from QB 19/09. Example 2 – one-off or occasional rentals Luke and Betty own a three-bedroom house in a suburb of Lower Hutt. They were not that interested in renting out their home to strangers and they thought the income would be only modest as demand is limited for short-stay rentals in their suburban neighbourhood. That changed when they heard the area was set to host the Golden Oldies Commonwealth Games and that they could rent out their house for $1,000 a night. They listed their home on a website, and it was booked for 10 nights. They spent the time visiting their grandchildren in Australia. Luke and Betty thought it worked so well that they plan to do something similar in two years’ time during a rugby tournament. Apart from that, they have no intention of listing their property again. One-off or occasional rentals (even though they can be lucrative) will not be a taxable activity as the activity does not satisfy the requirement of being continuous or regular. The rugby tournament is too far away for the activity to be continuous (and Luke and Betty’s plans are too uncertain). Therefore, Luke and Betty do not have a taxable activity as this was essentially a one-off. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 78 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Example 3 – a new homestay Peggy and Paddy are looking at buying a new home and have been told by the estate agent that they can claim some GST back from the purchase if they set up as a homestay. Peggy is intrigued as she has seen various news items about Airbnb homestays. She has heard that it is a growth industry and a way of meeting interesting people. Paddy, who is in full-time employment, agrees. The couple investigate the possibility of selling their existing home and buying a bigger property. Despite the advice of their accountant to the contrary, they register for GST stating their taxable activity to be “homestay operators”. They sell their present home and buy a three-bedroom home on the outskirts of a small town. They claim an input tax deduction on part of the purchase price of the house. As soon as they move in, they advertise the homestay on a peer-to-peer website. Peggy did not undertake any detailed research into the local market and did not take any significant steps to ascertain the viability of the activity. She initially compared prices on the internet and decided on a rental fee higher than for the other few local properties advertised as she considered her new house to be nicer. In the six months after registration they only had two paying guests who each stayed for a weekend. Peggy feels that the guests she has had have been quite a lot of trouble, and so she leaves the rental price at its current level even though it appears too high. This is on the basis that the guests will need to make it worth her while when they stay. Around Christmas time she has a couple of enquiries so decides to block that period out as she does not want guests ruining her summer break. For good measure she also blocks out Easter. In the remainder of the year she only has one more guest who stays overnight. With the benefit of hindsight they should not have registered for GST. While they were initially well intentioned, they undermined their stated intention by not making the property available. Considering the totality of the activity there does not appear to be a taxable activity that was carried on continuously or regularly. The Commissioner has the ability to cancel the registration if there is no taxable activity and can backdate this to the registration date if she is satisfied that they did not have a taxable activity. This effectively means repaying the original input tax claimed plus interest. Example 4 – periods without supplies being made Mai owns a small one-bedroom apartment in central Auckland. To help pay the mortgage she lets her entire apartment on Airbnb and goes and stays with her family in the Waikato. To make it worth her while she lists her apartment for $350 a night for a minimum of two nights. Charging a premium means she generally has guests only for weekends when there are big events on. She researches and targets big events like concerts, sports games and cultural events. Over the Christmas and summer holidays her apartment is rented for 4 weekends. Mai also has guests for 2 weekends for big concerts during February and a further weekend in March when the Black Caps play Australia. Over the next 9 months there are periods when there are no big events and Mai has far fewer bookings. She has guests for only 6 weekends during those remaining 9 months. Mai has a taxable activity. Although there are periods when she does not make supplies she has not stopped the activity in a permanent sense. The activity is also carried on regularly at (mostly) short intervals. There are “seasonal fluctuations” depending on what events are scheduled but the rental activity recurs and is habitual in nature and character. Further Mai dedicates a lot of time researching events coming up in Auckland and ensuring her pricing is profitable but competitive. Registration threshold – calculating the value of the supplies 66. Section 51(1) provides for compulsory registration where supplies exceed $60,000 in a 12-month period. It also deals with the situation where there are reasonable grounds for believing supplies will exceed $60,000. This is the total amount the host receives (or will receive) for supplies before taking expenses into account. The total is for supplies by the host, so where a website charges the guest a fee for arranging the booking this is not included in the host’s total supplies. 67. A person is not liable to register where they only exceed the threshold as a consequence of ending (or downsizing) their taxable activity or the replacement of a capital asset (s 51(1)(c) and (d)). In other words, it’s the supplies of accommodation and not the one-off sale of a property that is used to calculate the threshold. In calculating the value of supplies hosts should be aware that the calculation includes: • • supplies from all taxable activities – not just from the supply of short-stay accommodation; and • • deemed supplies that are valued at open market value – for example, where a trust owns a holiday home and allows the beneficiaries to stay there. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 79 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Supplies from all taxable activities 68. Section 51(1)(a) requires a person to register for GST if the value of supplies in a 12-month period, in the course of carrying on all taxable activities, exceeds $60,000. What this also means is that as long as the taxable activities in question collectively exceed $60,000 in annual supplies, the person must register for GST. It is not necessary that any particular taxable activity exceed $60,000 in annual supplies. 69. Alternatively, if a person is already GST registered for another taxable activity, the supply of short-stay accommodation (assuming it is part of a taxable activity) is subject to GST. Case R38 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,212 involved a GST-registered solicitor who also had a deer farm. A block of land that was leased for grazing was sold, and the solicitor was assessed for GST on the sale of the block on the basis that the supply did not have to be in the course of the taxable activity for which he was registered. 70. Judge Barber agreed with that proposition: Under s.8 of the Act, GST is imposed on a supply made by a registered person in the course or furtherance of "a" taxable activity carried on by that person. As Judge Bathgate said in Case N43 at page 3,366: “An act done for the purpose or object of furthering a taxable activity or achieving its goal can be to help achieve, or advance, and thus a ‘furtherance’ of a taxable activity, although it may not necessarily be always in the course of that taxable activity ... “It should be noted that the indefinite article ‘a’ rather than the definite article ‘the’ precedes taxable activity in the Act, so that it is any taxable activity that may attract GST rather than only a particular kind of activity for which a person may be registered under the Act,” It is also useful to note that a taxable activity can be something less than a business but does not cover a hobby. 71. Judge Barber thought it was clear from s 51 that registration relates to the total value of supplies made in the course of carrying on all taxable activities. Arguments were made about whether a taxable activity was being carried on. Judge Barber considered the solicitor was carrying on the taxable activity of grazing or land investment or both, and he was carrying on a commercial activity and not merely a private recreational pursuit or hobby. That being the case, Judge Barber concluded: the objector was properly registered for GST as a solicitor at all material times and supplied the B block to Mr & Mrs B in the course of ‘a’ taxable activity. The supply did not need to be in the course of the taxable activity for which he was registered. That supply is therefore subject to GST under s.8. 72. An analogy can be made with any GST-registered person who, in addition to their main business, also rents out a room in their house through a peer-to-peer website. If the short-stay rental is sufficient to be a taxable activity, then the supply will be subject to GST. For instance, if the solicitor from Case R38 had a taxable activity of providing short-stay accommodation from his solely owned home, then this (for the reasons discussed in the case) would be subject to GST. 73. However, this is the outcome only if the different taxable activities are being undertaken by the same person. If the solicitor jointly owns the home with his partner and they jointly supply short-stay accommodation, then his personal GST position has no relevance to that taxable activity. The reason for this is that the Act regards unincorporated bodies as separate registrable entities under s 57. Unincorporated bodies, including partnerships, joint ventures and trustees of a trust, are treated as separate entities for GST purposes, and supplies made and received by members of the unincorporated body are treated as made and received by the body. 74. In the absence of any formal arrangements, it may be unclear whether joint owners are acting as a partnership or in some other capacity, but ultimately it does not matter so long as the solicitor is not acting in his individual capacity when supplying short-stay accommodation. However, if the joint owners were to register for GST, they would need to consider whether they were undertaking the taxable activity as a partnership, as a joint venture or in some other capacity. There is an expectation that joint owners who have a turnover exceeding $60,000 or are otherwise registering for GST will have the appropriate formal arrangements in place. 75. In summary, taxpayers need to be aware that the threshold in s 51 applies to all taxable supplies made by that person. This has two impacts if a host makes taxable supplies of short-stay accommodation. 76. First, if an unregistered person has multiple taxable activities, the additional turnover from the short-stay accommodation may take them over the $60,000 threshold. For instance, if an unregistered person runs a small catering business and rents out their bach on a peer-to-peer website, they need to add together the supplies from both activities in calculating whether they exceed the $60,000 threshold. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 80 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 77. Secondly, if a person is already GST registered in respect of their main business, then the supply of short-stay accommodation will be subject to GST. It is anticipated that this will be unusual in the context of short-stay accommodation. An example is where a farmer is GST registered for their farming business and also supplies farmstay accommodation. In this case the supply of farmstay accommodation (assuming it is sufficient to be a taxable activity) would be subject to GST. 78. Example 5 illustrates this further. Example 5 – Supply of jointly owned short-stay accommodation Leslie and Sarah jointly own a large apartment near Cuba Street in Wellington. Leslie works as a graphic designer and illustrator and is GST registered. Sarah is an employee at a local business and is not GST registered. They list a room in their apartment on a short-stay accommodation website. They have a basic partnership agreement and run the short- stay activity as a partnership. Due to the excellent location, they have relatively high occupancy, although there is a limit on the amount they can charge for a room in a shared apartment. The partnership has a taxable activity and a turnover of $12,000 a year. They would prefer not to have to deal with GST but are unsure what impact Leslie’s GST registration has. Leslie’s GST registration in her personal capacity is irrelevant to the taxable activity undertaken by the partnership. When calculating whether they exceed the $60,000 threshold, they count only taxable supplies made by the partnership and not supplies made by the partners in their individual capacity. They decide not to register for GST. Subsequently Sarah decides to go travelling. They dissolve the partnership and the property is transferred to Leslie. Leslie continues to supply short-stay accommodation. Leslie is now the person undertaking the taxable activity, so her GST registration is relevant. As Leslie is already GST registered, all supplies made by her in the course of a taxable activity attract GST. This means the supply of short-stay accommodation is now subject to GST and the apartment is now within the GST regime. Deemed supplies – supplies to associated persons 79. When calculating the value of supplies for the threshold in s 51 it is necessary to include a supply that is an “associated supply” (defined as a supply to an “associated person”) at the deemed open market value. In the short-stay accommodation context, this issue will arise where a holiday home is owned by one entity and used by an “associated person” who does not pay market rent; for example, when the trustees of a family trust own a holiday home and allow beneficiaries to stay free of charge. Associated supplies are valued at open market value and must be included in calculating the $60,000 threshold in s 51. 80. An associated supply is defined as a supply where the supplier and recipient are associated persons. Section 2A provides a definition of “associated persons”. It is a wide definition, and hosts should consider whether there is an associated supply any time there is a supply below market value. 81. Section 10(3) values supplies to associated persons at open market value: (3) Subject to subsections (3A), (3AB), (3B), (3C), (3D) and (8), the consideration for a supply is treated as being the open market value of the supply if— (a) the supply is made by a person for no consideration or for a consideration that is less than the open market value of the supply; and (b) the supply is an associated supply; and (c) the supply is not a fringe benefit that the supplier has, or is deemed to have, provided or granted under the FBT rules of the Income Tax Act 2007 to the recipient, being a person employed under a contract of service by the supplier. 82. Where a supply is to associated persons for no consideration or less than open market value, then the supply is treated as being made for the open market value. This is subject to the exceptions in subss (3A), (3AB), (3B)–(3D) and (8), but these provisions will not commonly apply in the context of short-stay accommodation. Open market value is defined in s 4 with subs (2) most likely to be relevant to short-stay accommodation: (2) For the purposes of this Act, the open market value of any supply of goods and services at any date shall be the consideration in money which the supply of those goods and services would generally fetch if supplied in similar circumstances at that date in New Zealand, being a supply freely offered and made between persons who are not associated persons. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 81 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 83. These provisions have arisen in several cases, most notably CIR v Bayly (1998) 18 NZTC 14,073 (CA). In this case, farming trusts had supplied farming land to associated entities for no rent (although they did pay some expenses, and the trustee landowners received a share of the profits). The trusts were not registered for GST (apart from one which engaged in an unrelated activity). Because the farming entities were making taxable supplies to associated entities, the value of the supplies was held to be the open market value. This meant the farming entities were liable to be registered for GST. On sale, the farming entities were deemed to be registered persons and the sales were subject to GST. 84. For short-stay accommodation, associated supplies will most commonly be an issue where a holiday home is provided for less than market value. Examples of this include where a: • • sole owner allows relatives (within the scope of s 2A(6)) to stay in the holiday home for no or reduced consideration; • • holiday home is owned by the trustees of a family trust and used for free by family members who are beneficiaries; and • • partnership owns a holiday home and the individual partners and their families use the property for free. 85. These uses of the short-stay accommodation property are potentially a supply for GST purposes. Because it is an associated supply, the Act deems it to occur at its open market value. Where deemed supplies result in turnover exceeding the s 51 threshold, the host is required to register for GST and to account for GST output tax on all taxable supplies, including on the supplies made to associated persons. 86. However, it should be rare for “associated supplies” to give rise to any issues in the context of the family bach or holiday home. For those hosts who are not GST registered, the deemed supplies are relevant only if they mean the threshold in s 51 is exceeded. It would be uncommon for such a property’s turnover (even including associated supplies) to exceed $60,000 in a 12-month period. Further, it would be unusual for a host who is making regular associated supplies to then choose to voluntarily register because they would have to account for GST on all supplies including on those supplies. 87. Nonetheless, the Commissioner understands that unregistered owners of family holiday homes in popular tourist destinations are concerned that use by family members will mean they have to register for GST. Individual cases turn on their facts, but this would seem an unlikely outcome. 88. Where family holiday homes are only used by associated persons, there will not be a taxable activity because of the exclusion for private recreational pursuits or hobbies in s 6(3). This includes situations where the host uses the holiday home at the same time as friends or family. For instance, if a couple own the holiday home and their children and a grandparent accompany them on holiday then this use is also covered by the exclusion for private recreational pursuits or hobbies in s 6(3). In other cases, whether an activity is a private recreational pursuit is a question of fact decided on the totality of the evidence. However, an activity that might seem to be a business would not be one that was carried on essentially as a private recreational pursuit or hobby (Case N27 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,229). 89. If there is a taxable activity (for instance the property is also continuously or regularly rented through a peer-to-peer website) then the associated supplies need to be identified. This will involve determining how the property is owned, whether by a company, trust, individual, partnership, joint venture or an unincorporated body of persons. Determining the relevant entity is necessary because the s 2A definition of “associated persons” applies differently for different entities. 90. Another factor to consider is whether the supply to the associated person is the same as the supply being made to third parties via peer-to-peer websites. If the supply is different (eg, the associated person has to bring their own linen and do their own cleaning or it’s a longer term stay) then the open market value of that supply may be different to the open market value of a supply via the peer-to-peer website. 91. There a number of considerations, but associated supplies of a family holiday home appear unlikely to result in compulsory registration unless the property is regularly used in a business-like way and has a significant level of turnover. Examples 6 and 7 illustrate these points. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 82 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Example 6 – supplies to associated persons Kevin and Sally have owned a large holiday home at Foxton Beach for many years. Kevin and Sally use the property regularly, sometimes alone, and sometimes with Sally’s elderly mother or with some of the grandchildren. Several times a year their daughters, Rosie and Sophie, use the property with their families. Sally’s sister Gina also uses the property at least once a year. Kevin and Sally do not charge family to use the property, although Rosie and Sophie generally leave them a bottle of wine and Gina often gives them some money for power. Over the years Kevin and Sally have occasionally rented the property to other people. In most cases their guests are repeat guests, acquaintances or “friends of friends”. On average they rent the house out every year for 3 or 4 weekends and the occasional mid-week stay. They charge $150 a night but this is lower than similar properties that charge on average $200 a night. One of Kevin’s friends told him he should stop renting the property because IRD would make them register for GST. He says this is because IRD treats all the use by family as being at the open market rental value. Kevin and Sally are not registered for another taxable activity and are worried because they know very little about GST and do not want their family holiday home to be subject to GST. Kevin and Sally should not be concerned. Kevin and Sally do not have a taxable activity because their use of the property is a private recreational pursuit. It is not used in a business-like way, they put no time or effort into seeking out paying guests and the financial returns from the few guests they do have are insignificant against the cost of the property. Considered in its totality, their activity is the private recreational use of a family holiday home and a private recreational pursuit under s 6(3) cannot be a continuous or regular taxable activity under s 6(1). For the avoidance of doubt, even if they had a taxable activity the value of supplies would be below the threshold for compulsory registration. Example 7 – supplies to associated persons The Smith and Jones Family Trust owns a large modern holiday home in the South Island. The holiday home is advertised on a website for $600 a night. The holiday home is rented out for most of January and is also popular in ski season. In total, it is rented out for 80 nights a year. The total income from taxable supplies is $48,000. Based on these supplies alone, the trustees would not have to register for GST. However, during the year, some family members use the holiday home. On each occasion, the family members are beneficiaries or relatives of beneficiaries, so are “associated persons”. They stay for a week at Christmas and a week in the school holidays. Family members also stay on occasional weekends when there are no other bookings. In total, family members stay 28 nights a year for which they do not pay rent to the trustees. The open market value of the supplies to associated persons is 28 × $600 = $16,800. The total value of taxable supplies is $64,800 and the trust must register for GST under s 51 and any supplies of accommodation will be subject to GST. Understanding the consequences of registration 92. When a person is registered for GST, they must file a GST return for each return period. Section 20 prescribes the calculation of tax payable by every registered person in a taxable period. Section 20(3) provides that the amount of tax payable is calculated by deducting input tax from the amount of output tax payable. Output tax – overview 93. Section 8(1) imposes GST on the supply of goods and services by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person. GST is charged on the value of that supply. In most cases the value of the supply will be the amount of money paid for the supply (s 10(2)). 94. The two relevant exceptions are supplies to associated persons and the deemed supply of the property on cancellation of registration. In most cases, those supplies will be valued at the open market value (ss 10(3) and 10(7A)). These deeming provisions mean there may be a liability for output tax even though no consideration was received. For instance, where a registered host makes supplies of short-stay accommodation to an associated person free of charge there is still a GST output tax liability calculated on the open market value of the supplies. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 83 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Output tax on disposal of the property 95. In addition to paying GST output tax on supplies of short-stay accommodation, hosts will face a potential GST output tax liability under s 8(1) on sale of the property or a deemed supply of the property following cessation of registration. Case law supports the view that “in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity” includes the one-off sale of capital items that a registered person has used in their taxable activity (Case K55 (1988) 10 NZTC 453, Hibell v CIR (1991) 13 NZTC 8,195 (HC), and CIR v Dormer (1997) 18 NZTC 13,446 (HC)). This is discussed in more detail from \[182\]. Determining input tax 96. Input tax means tax charged on a supply of goods or services acquired by a person (s 3A(1)(a)). Input tax also arises on certain purchases of secondhand goods (s 3A(1)(c), (2) and (3)). 97. The general rule for determining how much input tax is deductible on acquisition of goods or services is set out in s 20(3C)(a): (3C) For the purposes of subsection (3), and if subsections (3D) or (3L) do not apply,— (a) input tax as defined in section 3A(1)(a) or (c) may be deducted to the extent to which the goods or services are used for, or are available for use in, making taxable supplies: 98. The inclusion of “available for use” in s 20(3C)(a) means input tax deductions can be claimed on the acquisition of a good or service when the good or service is able to be used for making taxable supplies or is not otherwise occupied in or held for making non-taxable supplies. This is consistent with the ordinary meaning of “available” (Concise Oxford English Dictionary, 12th ed, (Oxford University Press, New York, 2011): available adj. 1 able to be used or obtained. 2 not otherwise occupied; free. 99. This means supplies purchased solely for use by guests give rise to an input tax deduction even though there may be an initial period of non-use. For instance, if shampoo is purchased in bulk for the guest shower, an input tax deduction is available on the bulk purchase notwithstanding much of the shampoo may remain initially unused. Limitation on input tax deductions where property acquired from an associated person 100. This issue is relevant where the property used to make supplies of short-stay accommodation is acquired as a non-taxable supply from an “associated person”. This might be the case where a home or holiday home is transferred between family members or where it has been transferred into an entity controlled or owned by the transferors. Where this occurs, the Act restricts the amount of GST input tax that can be claimed. 101. Section 3A(3)(a) (or s 3A(3C) for goods and services acquired pre-GST registration) effectively links the GST input tax claimable to the GST output tax on the original supply to the first associated person. Section 3A defines “input tax” where the supplier and recipient are associated persons. The key provision is s 3A(3)(a): (3) The amount of input tax is— (a) if the supplier and the recipient are associated persons, the lesser of— (i) the tax included in the original cost of the goods to the supplier; and (ii) the tax fraction of the purchase price; and (iii) the tax fraction of the open market value of the supply; ... 102. The definition of associated persons under s 2A is very wide and covers many circumstances. Where property is transferred between people or entities that are connected, taxpayers need to consider whether there is an associated supply. Where s 3A(3)(a) applies, the effect is to restrict the GST input tax that can be claimed. 103. In most instances, GST input tax will be limited to that included in the original sale to the supplier. In many cases that will be nil. This is because, generally, the original sale to the associated supplier will be by a non-registered person of a residential property. Therefore, the sale will not be subject to GST. Case law 104. In Case 15/2014 (2014) 26 NZTC 22-025, the taxpayer company owned a substantial residential property that was used to supply short-stay accommodation. The property appears to have been a “high-end” holiday home, and every year from 2009 to 2012 the supplies of short-stay accommodation exceeded $60,000. The majority (99%) shareholder of the company originally purchased the property in his personal capacity in 2005 and spent a considerable amount of time and money renovating the property. He transferred the property to the company in 2007 for $1,100,000. 105. The company used the property to supply short-stay accommodation. These supplies were treated as exempt under a previous definition of “dwelling”. Changes to the definition of “dwelling” from 1 April 2011 meant these supplies of short- stay accommodation were no longer exempt supplies of accommodation in a dwelling and effectively brought the property Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 84 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS into the GST regime. Section 21HB (see from \[175\]) allows taxpayers affected by these changes to retrospectively claim the initial GST input tax that they were not able to claim at the time of acquisition. In 2012, the company registered for GST, with effect from 1 April 2011, and claimed a GST input tax deduction under s 21HB on the purchase of the property. 106. On a supply between associated persons, s 3A(3)(a) defines “input tax” as the lesser of the: • • tax included in the original cost of the goods to the supplier; • • tax fraction of the purchase price; or • • tax fraction of the open market value of the supply. 107. The majority shareholder and the company were “associated persons” under the Act. No GST was charged when the shareholder originally purchased the property. The Taxation Review Authority concluded the consequence of this is that the input tax deduction able to be claimed under s 21HB was limited to zero. 108. Concepts 124 Ltd v CIR \[2014\] NZHC 2,140 and Staithes Drive Development Ltd v CIR \[2015\] NZHC 2,593 are other examples of cases where the GST input tax was reduced as a result of a supply from an associated person. Summary 109. Supplies of properties between associated persons are most likely to occur in the short-stay accommodation context where an unregistered person transfers their property into an entity they control so the entity can undertake the business of supplying short-stay accommodation (for example, similar to the facts in Case 15/2014). The other common scenario is where a family property is transferred between family members (or a family trust). 110. Where a property used to supply short-stay accommodation is transferred by way of non-taxable supply between associated persons, then the GST input tax will effectively be restricted to the GST paid when the seller originally purchased the property. In many cases, this will be zero because the property acquired to supply short-stay accommodation will often be a residential property acquired from an unregistered person. Calculation of input tax 111. A full input tax deduction is allowed for goods or services that are intended to be used solely for making taxable supplies. Where a property is used exclusively to make taxable supplies (that is, it is never used privately), then full input tax deductions will be allowed for most expenditure and, potentially, on the purchase of the property. Goods and services that may be acquired solely for making taxable supplies of short-stay accommodation include: • • advertising costs; • • commissions or fees paid to an advertising platform or transaction facilitator (assuming GST is charged); • • linen, toiletries and other supplies used solely by guests; and • • any additional rates or insurance premiums payable because of the rental activity. 112. On the other hand, no input tax deduction is allowed for goods or services used or intended to be used solely for making non-taxable supplies (for example, any goods or services purchased solely for private use). 113. Where goods and services are wholly used for taxable or non-taxable purposes the treatment is relatively straightforward. However, where goods and services have both a taxable and non-taxable use, then the Act limits the input tax deduction to the extent to which that asset is used (or available for use) for taxable purposes. This is achieved in two steps: • • First, apportion GST input tax on acquisition based on intended use (s 20(3C)-(3JB)). • • Secondly, in subsequent years (subject to certain exemptions), adjust the deduction to the extent that actual use is different to intended use (ss 21, 21A–21C, 21D–21F, 21FB, 21G, 21H, 21HB–21HC, and 21I). Apportioning input tax on acquisition of goods and services 114. Where there is both taxable and non-taxable use (for example, where a host rents out their home or a holiday home they also use privately), then the different elements need to be apportioned. 115. The method of apportionment is different depending on whether or not the property is a mixed-use asset. • • If you are unsure whether you have a mixed-use asset, read “QB 19/06: What income tax rules apply if I have a dwelling that I sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and sometimes use myself?”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31, No 6 (July 2019): 12. • • If you have a mixed-use asset, see from \[133\]. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 85 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Goods and services used for both taxable and non-taxable supplies 116. Where the relevant goods or services are to be used for making both taxable and exempt supplies (for example, a rates bill), then a person must estimate at the time of acquisition how they intend to use the goods or services, choosing a determination method that provides a fair and reasonable result. 117. The method used to calculate the amount that may be deducted as input tax under the general rule in s 20(3C) is set out in s 20(3G): (3G) In determining the extent to which goods or services are used for making taxable supplies, a person must estimate at the time of acquisition how they intend to use the goods or services, choosing a determination method that provides a fair and reasonable result. The determination is expressed as a percentage of the total use. 118. In s 20(3G), the intended use on acquisition is identified by: • • estimating at the time of acquisition how the person intends to use the goods or services; and • • choosing a determination method that provides a fair and reasonable result (with the determination expressed as a percentage of the total use). 119. The Commissioner’s view of the meaning of “intended use” and “fair and reasonable” are discussed in “Interpretation Statement – IS 15/02: Goods and Services Tax – GST and Retirement Villages”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 27, No 11 (December 2015): 6. 120. In the context of short-stay accommodation, intended use when acquiring the property equates to the extent to which the property will be used to provide short-stay accommodation. This will generally be determined using the same time and space approach adopted for income tax (see “QB 19/05: What are my income tax obligations if I rent out my home or a separate dwelling on my property as short-stay accommodation?”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31, No 6 (July 2019): 3). 121. Once a person has identified the intended use, they can calculate the amount of input tax under s 20(3H) and (3I) by multiplying the total inputs by the percentage of intended use. This does not apply in all cases; for example, mixed-use assets use the formula in s 20G. 122. The calculation method for input tax is set out in s 20(3H) and (3I): (3H) The extent to which a deduction for input tax is allowed is calculated using the formula— full input tax deduction × percentage intended use. (3I) In the formula in subsection (3H),— (a) full input tax deduction is the total amount of input tax on the supply: (b) percentage intended use has the meaning set out in section 21G(1)(b). 123. Section 21G(1)(b) provides: 21G Definitions and requirements for apportioned supplies and adjustment periods (1) For the purposes of this section and sections 8(4B)(b), 9(2)(h), 20(3H), 20G, 21 to 21F, and 21H,— ... (b) percentage intended use, for a registered person, means the extent to which the goods or services are intended to be used by the person for making taxable supplies, estimated at the time of acquisition under section 20(3G) and expressed as a percentage of total use: 124. The above discussion can be summarised as follows: • • A purchaser can deduct input tax on the acquisition of goods or services to the extent to which the goods or services are used for, or are available for use in, making taxable supplies: s 20(3C). • • In determining the extent to which goods or services are used for making taxable supplies, a person must estimate, at the time of acquisition, how they intend to use the goods or services, choosing a determination method that provides a fair and reasonable result: s 20(3G). • • The estimated intended taxable use of the goods or services determines the proportion of the input tax that can be deducted: s 20(3H) and (3I). Application to short-stay accommodation – where a host rents out a room (or rooms) in their home 125. Where a host rents out a room (or rooms) in their home, it is necessary to identify the extent to which the property is used (or available for use) in making taxable supplies. This will usually be done by identifying the time the property is used to make taxable supplies and the space used to make taxable supplies. The same method is used to calculate income tax deductions and QB 19/05 includes a discussion and examples of time and space calculations. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 86 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 126. The “space” part of the calculation is generally based on the floor area of the house. It will generally comprise two aspects – the areas that the guest has exclusive use of and the common areas that the guest is permitted to use. Both areas are expressed as a proportion of the total floor area of the house. This part of the calculation is usually straightforward. Where a host rents out the entire property, it is unnecessary to work out the “space”, as the guest will have 100% use of the property while they are there. 127. As with “space”, different considerations apply for determining “time” depending on whether the area is exclusively available for guests or a common area. In the GST context it is necessary to consider the extent to which the property is used, or available for use, in making taxable supplies. Input tax deductions are available only “to the extent” that the property is used or available for use in making taxable supplies. If a bedroom is wholly put to non-taxable use (for example, it is the host’s own bedroom), then, as a matter of practicality, there is no extent to which the bedroom can be used for, or available for use in, making taxable supplies. 128. Section 20(3C)(a) first addresses actual use, which is consistent with the principle of linking input tax deductions to use. “Availability” is usually relevant only where the property (or part of the property) is unused. If the property in question is a privately owned and occupied home, there is an expectation that it is being used privately and expenditure will be private expenditure if the property (or part of it) is not rented out. QB 19/05 discusses when a privately owned and occupied home will be genuinely available for guests and unavailable to the host and their family. The host would need to demonstrate: • • The space is not used at all by the host, including for storage. • • It is essentially not used as part of the host’s home. 129. For common areas in a host’s home there is always an element of private use. This means the area is not 100% available for making taxable supplies. With common areas, it is often impossible or impractical to identify actual use. Where actual use of common areas cannot be identified, Inland Revenue’s approach is to accept an apportionment of 50% between private and income-earning use for periods where there is dual use. A 50% figure will not be appropriate to every person’s circumstances, but in many cases it will be a fair and reasonable starting point for calculating the use of common areas that have both taxable and non-taxable uses. 130. Where there is taxable use and non-taxable use it may be impossible calculate the “time and space” use of a property’s curtilage. However, when a person claims a GST input tax deduction on a property, they will do so on the full value of the property, not just the buildings and improvements. In the absence of any better alternative, a fair and reasonable starting point will be to apply the percentage use of the dwelling to the whole property, including the curtilage. A separate calculation for curtilage should be considered where it has a noticeable impact on the use calculation (for example, if a significant part of the curtilage such as a swimming pool or tennis court is solely for guest use or private use). Summary of principles 131. In summary, the principles for calculating the percentage intended use where a host rents their home or part of their property (for mixed-use assets, see from \[133\]) are as follows: • • Apportionment should be on a time and space basis or another basis that provides a fair and reasonable apportionment. • • “Space” is calculated by reference to the floor area that the guest has exclusive use of as a proportion of the total floor area of the house. • • Where a host rents out the entire property, it is unnecessary to work out the “space” as the guest will have 100% use of the property while they are there. • • “Time” should be calculated based on the extent to which the property is used, or is available to be used, in making taxable supplies. –“Time” should be based on use (for example, when is the room used privately by the host and when is it rented out to a guest and being used to make taxable supplies?). –If the property is a privately owned and occupied home, there is an expectation that it is being used privately if the property (or part of it) is not rented out. –When a property is unused but is available for use as short-stay accommodation, then this should be counted as taxable use when calculating the “time” element. • • For common areas, the starting point is a 50% apportionment for “space”. “Time” should be calculated based on actual use. The objective is to determine an apportionment that is fair and reasonable. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 87 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS • • A separate calculation for curtilage should be considered where it has a noticeable impact on the use calculation; otherwise the percentage use of the dwelling may be applied to the whole property, including the curtilage. 132. Examples 8–10 illustrate apportionment calculations. Example 8 –apportionment calculation Hayley is buying a two-bedroom property in Queenstown for $600,000. She intends to rent out the second bedroom for short-stay accommodation through a peer-to-peer platform. She expects a high level of occupancy and will mostly use the second bedroom as a short-stay rental. This means the room will be listed online and she will not use it privately except for a month when a friend is visiting from overseas. The guests will also be able to use some common areas – the lounge room, dining room, kitchen, laundry and main bathroom. Based on her research, Hayley believes she can rent out the room for 180 nights during the year. The floor areas of the different parts of Hayley’s property are shown in the diagram below. Hayley is considering registering for GST. She wants to know what percentage of GST input tax she can claim on the purchase of the property. In claiming Hayley should apportion her use on the following basis: Area exclusively used by guests – 100% for the days used or available to use Common areas – 50% for days someone is renting the bedroom Private area – 0% The areas exclusively used or available to use by guests are 20m2 out of the total 100m2 floor area of the property, and are 100% deductible for the 335 days out of 365 days in the year that the room will be used, or available for use, by guests: 20 × 335 ×100=18.36% 100365 The common areas, used by Hayley and guests, are 55m2 out of the total 100m2 floor area, and are 50% deductible for the 180 out of 365 days in the year that the room is rented out: 55 × 180 ×50=13.56% 100365 Adding these figures (18.36% and 13.56%) together, Hayley calculates her percentage intended use as 31.92%. The full GST input tax deduction is: 3/23 × $600,000 = $78,260.87 The GST input tax claimable on the purchase is: $78,260.87 × 31.92% = $24,980.87 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 88 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Example 9 – apportionment calculation Len is a short-stay accommodation entrepreneur. He owns a number of properties in the Coromandel and an apartment in Auckland that he rents on peer-to-peer websites. Len is GST registered. Len wants to buy a large five-bedroom home in the Coromandel for $800,000. Len is considering using the property in his short-stay business as it is the sort of property that could make a lot of money during the peak Christmas and January summer period. Len wants to know what GST input tax he could claim if he was to use his new home to make taxable supplies of short-stay accommodation. Len estimates that he will rent his house out for 40 days. During this time, he will stay in one of his other properties or visit family. Len wants to know what percentage of GST input tax he can claim. Len estimates that over a year he will have 40 days of rental and 325 days of private use. This equates to 10.96% of taxable use. The full GST input tax deduction is: 3/23 × $800,000 = $104,347.83 The GST input tax claimable on the purchase is: $104,347.83 × 10.96% = $11,436.52 If Len chooses to use the property in his taxable activity, he must charge GST on the supplies of accommodation and file returns. For the property, he will need to undertake an annual calculation to work out whether he needs to make an adjustment. If the actual use is different to intended use, then Len will have to make an adjustment (assuming it amounts to more than $1,000). If Len stops using the property to provide short-stay accommodation or if he sells the property, then he must account for GST output tax on the property. Example 10 – apportionment calculation Mai (see Example 4) wants to know what percentage of GST she could claim if she registers for GST. She can claim the full GST on any goods or services used exclusively for her taxable activity of supplying short-stay accommodation. For example, toiletries solely for use by guests. The GST input tax deduction for goods and services used both privately and for making taxable supplies (for example, the rates bill) must be apportioned. Mai could also claim a proportion of GST from the cost of her apartment. As Mai is renting out the entire apartment, the calculation is based solely on time. The apartment is rented out for 36 nights per year = 9.9%. Mai can claim 9.9% of GST on goods and services with mixed use. Mai decides not to register as the administrative and compliance burden outweighs the modest amount of GST input tax she could claim back. Applying special rules for mixed-use assets (s 20G) 133. There are special rules for apportioning input tax deductions for mixed-use assets (MUAs). These rules apply on both the initial acquisition and subsequent adjustments (ss 20(3)(hb) and (3JB) and 20G). 134. MUAs have their own regime in the Act for calculating the GST input tax able to be deducted. Section 20G refers to the definition of a MUA in s DG 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007. For a property to be a MUA it must have an income-earning use and a private use (which is not minor) and not be used for at least 62 days a year. 135. Holiday homes and baches listed on peer-to-peer websites will commonly be MUAs. Where there are two properties on a single property title, one of the properties can be an “asset” for the purposes of the MUA rules. For instance, if a host rents out a separate cottage on the same title as their main home (used 100% privately) the cottage can still be a MUA (on disposal, s 5(15) would also deem two separate supplies in this scenario). Where a person’s own home is used to supply short-stay accommodation it is less likely to satisfy the criterion of being not in use for 62 days a year. 136. To identify whether they have a MUA and for an overview of how the MUA rules apply for income tax, hosts should read QB 19/06 and QB 19/07 “How do the mixed-use asset income tax rules apply to a dwelling that I sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and sometimes use privately?”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31, No 6 (July 2019): 16. 137. Where a host has a MUA, s 20G provides the formula for calculating GST input tax deductions for mixed use assets: (1) A registered person who uses an asset described in section DG 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007 for making taxable supplies has a deduction under section 20(3)(hb) of an amount calculated using the formula— input tax for asset × total income-earning days ÷ (total income-earning days + total private days). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 89 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS (2) In the formula,— (a) input tax for asset is the input tax on expenditure that the person incurs in relation to the use of the asset, other than expenditure that is— (i) related solely to the taxable use of the asset ; or (ii) related solely to the non-taxable use of the asset: (b) total income-earning days is the total number of days in the period on which the person supplies the asset for use and derives consideration for the supply, whether at, above, or below market value as that term is defined in section DG 3(5) of that Act, including any days on which— (i) the use made of the asset is described in section DG 4(3) to (5) of that Act: (ii) the asset has become unavailable for use because another person who had earlier reserved the asset for their own use, subsequently did not take advantage of that reservation: (iii) a fringe benefit tax liability arises: (c) total private days is the total number of days in the period on which the asset is in active use as described in section DG 3(7) of that Act and the day is not an income-earning day as described in paragraph (b). (3) A unit of measurement of time other than days, whether relating to hours, or nights, or anything else is to be used in the formula and in subsection (2)(b) and (c), if the use of the unit provides a fair and reasonable result. For this purpose, the same unit must be used in relation to both total income-earning days and total private days. (4) The person must ascertain at the end of an adjustment period whether an adjustment is required to be made for any percentage difference in a supply of the asset for the period in relation to the actual use of the asset for making taxable supplies. (5) If an adjustment is required, the person must, at the end of the adjustment period,— (a) identify the percentage actual use of the asset in accordance with the formula in subsection (1) for making taxable supplies; and (b) compare the percentage actual use with percentage intended use as described in section 20(3JB) or previous actual use, as applicable; and (c) if a percentage difference arises, make an adjustment for any percentage difference for the adjustment period, applying section 21D(3) to the resulting amount. (6) For the purposes of subsection (5), all expenditure incurred in relation to the use of the asset is aggregated and included in the relevant adjustment unless section 21(2)(c) or (d) applies to the aggregated amount. (7) Sections 8 and 21F apply to the disposal of the asset, treating the disposal as in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. (8) For the purposes of this section, a registered person does not include a widely-held company, as that term is defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 138. Put simply, the MUA rules ignore the days when the property is unused. The definition of “total income-earning days” is the total number of days in the period in which the person supplies the asset for use and derives consideration for the supply, whether at, above, or below market value. In addition, the definition of “total private days” does not include any income-earning days. Consequently, the GST treatment is different from the income tax treatment because: • • supplies at “mate’s rates” (below 80%) are treated as part of the total income earning days; and • • for “associated supplies” the host will be deemed to supply the property for a consideration equal to the open market value (s 10(3)), so the use will be part of the “total income earning days” rather than part of the “total private days”. 139. This treatment differs from the income tax treatment discussed in QB 19/07 because rental nights at mates rates and rental to an associate would be treated as private use in that calculation. However, “associated person” in the Income Tax Act context is narrower than “associated person” for GST purposes. When the legislation was introduced, the differences between the Income Tax Act 2007 and GST Act were discussed in “Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2013”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 25, No 9 (October 2013): 3 (at 21): The main differences between the income tax and GST definitions relate to: • the treatment of supplies for less than market value; and • what constitutes “expenditure”. These differences reflect the different nature of the two taxes. In particular: • GST has always recognised the right of registered persons to make supplies for lower than market value to non-associates. • “Expenditure” is not a word generally used in a GST context, so the GST formula replaces “expenditure” with “input tax”. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 90 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Below market value supplies The definition of “income-earning days” in the GST formula includes any day on which the person supplies the asset for use and derives consideration, irrespective of whether this supply is above, at or below market value. This allows asset owners to make supplies at below market value if they chose to do so, with these days still being “income earning”. This is consistent with general GST principles. It is important to note that, if the owner supplies the asset to an associated person, section 10(3) will generally require them to treat the supply as being made at market value. This will require output tax to be paid on the supply, but it will also be treated as “income-earning” for the purposes of calculating entitlement to input deductions. Similarly, if the supply is a fringe-benefit, section 21I will apply to deem consideration to have been received — this will also be an income-earning day. \[Emphasis added\] 140. Example 11 illustrates the application of the special rules for mixed-use assets. Example 11 – application of the special rules for mixed-use assets Jayden and Ruby live in Christchurch. They are buying a holiday home in Queenstown for $900,000. They intend to list it permanently on Airbnb. Based on their research, they expect to achieve 120 nights of occupancy per year. Because of the location they can charge $700 a night, so gross rental over a 12-month period is $84,000 and they must register for GST. Jayden and Ruby will use the holiday home at various times throughout the year, staying an estimated 80 nights a year at the holiday home. The sale settles on 22 March 2019, and Jayden and Ruby register for GST from that date. They have a standard balance date. The house is a mixed-use asset (MUA). In calculating their initial input tax deduction, they use the formula in s 20G: • • Total input tax: $117,391.30. • • Apportionment using s 20G: 120 income-earning days ÷ (200 total income-earning days + total private days) = 60%. • • Calculation of GST input tax apportionment: $117,391.30 × 60% = $70,434.78. Jayden and Ruby should use the same percentage (60%) during their first adjustment period to claim for other input tax deductions related to both their taxable activity and private use. Jayden and Ruby will need to revisit this calculation at the end of each adjustment period. They choose that their first adjustment period will end on 31 March 2020 under s 21G(2)(a)(ii). This means that at the end of this first adjustment period, they will have to use actual figures instead of estimated figures for the expected use of the property to make an adjustment under ss 21, 21A and 21C. Under-estimation For instance, say the property proves more popular than Jayden and Ruby expected and ends up being rented for 150 nights during the year. Despite their best intentions, Jayden and Ruby find that life proves busier than they expect and they only manage to stay at the property for 60 nights. On this basis, the actual figures would be as follows: • • Total input tax: $117,391.30. • • Apportionment using s 20G: 150 income-earning days ÷ (210 total income-earning days + total private days) = 71.43%. • • Under s 20G(5)(c), the percentage difference is actual use less intended use: 71.43% – 60% = 11.43%. As the percentage difference is positive, a further input tax deduction can be claimed under s 21D of $117,391.30 × 11.43%. This means a further $13,417.83 can be claimed. Over-estimation On the other hand, if Jayden and Ruby over-estimated taxable use, then they may have to repay GST as GST output tax. For instance, say the property is less popular than expected, and they achieve only 80 nights rental and 80 nights private use. The actual figures would be: • • Total input tax: $117,391.30. • • Apportionment using s 20G: 80 income-earning days ÷ (160 total income-earning days + total private days) = 50%. • • Under s 20G(5)(c), the percentage difference is actual use less intended use = 50% – 60% = -10%. As the percentage difference is negative, output tax needs to be returned: 10% of $117,391.30 = $11,739.13. This means a GST output tax of $11,739.13 needs to be returned. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 91 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Making annual change of use adjustments 141. Apportionments and adjustments work in tandem under the Act. Adjustments in effect ensure that the initially apportioned input claim (based on intended use) corresponds with the actual use. 142. The change of use adjustment provisions are in ss 21, 21A–21C, 21D–21F, 21FB, 21G, 21H, 21HB–21HC and 21I. Which provisions apply in any given situation depends on the circumstances. Where a property was acquired before 1 April 2011 the old apportionment rules may apply see \[175\]. 143. Under the current rules the starting point is s 21, which requires a person to ascertain at the end of an “adjustment period” whether an adjustment is required for any difference between the intended use and actual use: (1) A registered person must ascertain at the end of an adjustment period whether an adjustment is required to be made for any percentage difference in a supply of goods or services for the period in relation to the actual use of those goods or services for making taxable supplies. (2) Despite subsection (1), the person is not permitted to make an adjustment if— (a) section 20(3D) applies to them: (ab) the person is a non-resident who has incurred input tax as defined in section 3A(1)(b) for goods and who— (i) exports the goods in or before the adjustment period; and (ii) disposes of the goods overseas in the adjustment period or holds the goods overseas at the end of the adjustment period: (b) the value of the goods or services, excluding GST, is $5,000 or less: (c) the difference between the percentage intended use on acquisition and the percentage actual use for the relevant adjustment period is less than 10 percentage points, but this paragraph does not apply if the adjustment amounts to more than $1,000: (d) the difference between the previous actual use calculated for the most recent adjustment period in which an adjustment was made and the percentage actual use for the relevant adjustment period is less than 10 percentage points, but this paragraph does not apply if the adjustment amounts to more than $1,000. 144. The exceptions in s 21(2)(b) to (d) mean adjustments will not be permitted for most day-to-day expenditure that has taxable and non-taxable elements (for example, a rates bill). However, where a GST input tax claim has been made on a property, the exceptions are less likely to apply. 145. The adjustment period (described in s 21G(2)) is a period at the end of which a person is required to estimate whether an adjustment for a subsequent change in use is required. The registered person may choose whether the first adjustment is the first or second balance date following acquisition. The calculation is then repeated annually on the subsequent balance dates. 146. Section 21G limits the number of adjustment periods, except where there is a supply of land (s 21G(5)). The practical effect of this is where a host claims initial GST input tax on a property, they must perform an adjustment every year until they cease using the property in their taxable activity or sell the property. 147. A person is not permitted to make an adjustment if they are below one of the thresholds in s 21(2)(b) to (d). Section 21A sets out when an adjustment is required: 21A When adjustments required A registered person must, at the end of an adjustment period,— (a) identify the percentage actual use of the goods or services in making taxable supplies in the period; and (b) compare the percentage actual use with percentage intended use or previous actual use, as applicable; and (c) if a percentage difference arises and section 21(2)(c) or (d) does not apply, make an adjustment for any percentage difference for the adjustment period. 148. Section 21D calculates the adjustment by reference to the percentage difference (this is defined as the difference between intended use and actual use in s 21G): 21D Calculating amount of adjustment (1) If a percentage difference arises for an adjustment period, a registered person must make a positive or negative adjustment for the period of an amount calculated using the formula— full input tax deduction × percentage difference. (2) In the formula,— (a) full input tax deduction is the total amount of input tax on the supply, including any nominal GST component chargeable under section 20(3J)(a)(i): (b) percentage difference has the meaning set out in section 21G(1)(c). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 92 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS (3) For the purposes of subsection (1) and section 20G,— (a) if the adjustment is positive and the percentage actual use is more than the person’s percentage intended use or previous actual use, as applicable, the person is entitled to an additional deduction under section 20(3)(e) or (hb), as applicable: (b) if the adjustment is negative and the percentage actual taxable use is less than the person’s percentage intended use or previous actual use, as applicable, the person must treat the amount as a positive amount of output tax and attribute it to a taxable period under section 20(4). 149. Subsection 21D(3)(b) provides that where the percentage actual use is less than the percentage intended use the amount must be treated as output tax and returned. 150. Example 12 illustrates a standard change of use adjustment. Example 12 – standard change of use adjustments Hayley (from Example 8) registered for GST but her first year was not quite as successful as she envisaged. She had intended to rent a room for 180 nights of the year. However, she only achieved 90 nights of rental. In addition, her friends from overseas stayed with her for two months, meaning that in total the room was available for only 305 nights during the year. The actual use of areas dedicated to the rental activity is: 20 × 305 ×100=16.71% 100365 And for the common areas: 55 × 90 ×50=6.78% 100365 Hayley’s actual use was 23.49%. Her intended use was 33.56%. Because the difference is more than 10 percentage points (and more than $1,000), Hayley must make an adjustment. The calculation based on actual use is: $78,260.87 × 23.49% = $18,383.48 She had previously claimed $26,264.34 on the purchase price of the property based on the intended use. Therefore, Hayley needs to return an additional $7,880.86 as GST output tax. 151. This example demonstrates a standard change of use adjustment. However, there are a number of specific adjustment provisions in ss 21 – 21I that may apply depending on the circumstances. The next part of this statement discusses the following provisions: • • Section 21B – allows adjustments for goods purchased before the person became GST registered. Where a person, before registration, owns their property that they subsequently use to make taxable supplies of short-stay accommodation, then, subject to meeting the criteria in the section, they can claim a portion of GST input tax corresponding to their use. • • Section 21FB – is a wash-up calculation where a property is used privately and to make supplies of short-stay accommodation and there is a change to 100% taxable or 100% non-taxable use. • • Section 21E – allows taxpayers to make adjustments where there is a concurrent use of the property. This provision will rarely apply in the context of short-stay accommodation. • • Sections 21H and 21HB – are transitional rules that can apply to a property provided it was owned before 1 April 2011 and certain criteria are met. Section 21B – adjustments for goods purchased before registration 152. It is possible to make an adjustment for goods purchased before a person became GST registered. Where a person, before registration, purchases goods and services that they subsequently use to make taxable supplies they can claim some of the original GST input tax when they become registered. Most relevantly, this applies to: • • goods where GST was charged but no input tax was claimed at the time of purchase; for example, a host purchased their home from a builder or developer and GST was included but no input tax deduction was claimed by the host at the time (either because they had not commenced a taxable activity or had not yet registered for GST); and • • “secondhand goods” where goods were supplied but it was not a taxable supply; for example, a sale of a domestic dwelling between two unregistered parties (which is the focus of the following analysis as most supplies of residential properties will not be taxable supplies). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 93 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 153. In the context of short-stay accommodation, the second scenario above is more common because hosts often list their private home or their holiday home on peer-to-peer websites. In many instances, these properties will have been purchased from an unregistered vendor and owned for many years before GST registration. If the host decides to register for GST or is required to register because the level of taxable supplies exceeds the threshold, then, provided they meet the requirements in the Act, some input tax from the original purchase is deductible. Legislation 154. Section 20(3) provides that a person, in calculating the amount of output tax payable, may deduct input tax paid in relation to the supply of secondhand goods to the extent that a payment for that supply has been made during the taxable period. 155. If a person was not GST-registered when they acquired the goods, it is still possible to claim a deduction under s 21B. Section 21B allows an adjustment in the following circumstances: 21B Adjustments when person or partnership becomes registered after acquiring goods and services (1) This section applies when— (a) before becoming a registered person, a person that is not a unit title body corporate acquires— (i) goods or services on which tax has been charged under section 8(1): (ii) goods entered by them for home consumption under the Customs and Excise Act 1996 on which tax has been levied under section 12(1): (iii) secondhand goods— (A) that are supplied to the person by way of sale; and (B) that have always been situated in New Zealand or have had tax levied on them as described in subparagraph (ii); and (C) the supply of which is not a taxable supply; and (b) at the time of registration or at a later time, the person or, if the person is a member of a partnership, the partnership uses the goods or services for making taxable supplies. (2) The person or partnership, as applicable, may make an adjustment under sections 20G, 21, and 21A, as applicable, treating as the first adjustment period, the period that— (a) starts on the date of the acquisition of the goods or services; and (b) ends on the first balance date that falls after the events referred to in subsection (1)(b). (3) For the purposes of this section,— (a) the person or partnership, as applicable, must either— (i) provide a tax invoice in relation to the supply, as required by section 20(2); or (ii) have adequate records that enable the identification of the particulars of an invoice as required by section 24(3) or (7), as applicable: (b) in identifying the percentage actual use of the goods or services in the first adjustment period referred to in subsection (2), the person or partnership, as applicable, may use a method that provides a fair and reasonable result. (4) \[Repealed\] (5) In relation to a supply of secondhand goods, the tax fraction applying to the supply is the tax fraction that applied at the time the goods were purchased by the person 156. Section 21B allows adjustments when a person becomes registered after acquiring goods and services. There are several requirements for a deduction for secondhand goods: • • The goods must be “secondhand goods” supplied to the person by way of sale that is not a taxable supply. • • At the time of registration, the person uses the secondhand goods for making taxable supplies. • • On registration, the person is allowed to make an adjustment for input tax under ss 20G, 21 and 21A. A tax invoice or adequate records are required to obtain an input tax deduction and there are ongoing record keeping requirements. • • The amount of input tax that can be claimed is limited to the extent the goods are used, or available for use, in making taxable supplies. In identifying the percentage actual use of the goods for the first adjustment period, the person may use a method that provides a fair and reasonable result. • • In relation to a supply of secondhand goods, the tax fraction applying to the supply is the tax fraction that applied at the time the goods were purchased by the person (that is, the GST rate applicable at the time). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 94 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 157. To claim a deduction, the registered person must make an adjustment for change in use under ss 21 and 21A. The ordinary rules for apportionment of input tax are modified to treat the first adjustment period as the period that starts on the date of the acquisition of the goods or services and ends on the first balance date that falls after the person becomes registered for GST and uses the goods or services for making taxable supplies. 158. Following the determination of the length of the first adjustment period, the person must identify the percentage actual use of the goods or services in that period, using a method that provides a fair and reasonable result. This percentage actual use would then be compared with the percentage intended use (which will be 0% as the person will not have claimed any deduction on the acquisition). The resulting “percentage difference” will be used to claim an adjusted amount of the deduction under s 21D. Once the asset is in the apportionment regime, it is subject to the same apportionment rules as any other asset purchased by the registered person. 159. The practical implication of s 21B(2) is that the first adjustment period is equivalent to the entire time the host has owned the property, from the date of acquisition to the first balance date after registration. Therefore, if a host has owned a property for several years, most of the use will be non-taxable and the proportion of GST input tax deductible on the first adjustment will be modest: • • If a host purchased a family bach 10 years ago for $225,000 and started using it to make supplies of short-stay accommodation last year (on the basis of 50:50 private and taxable use), then they would have 9 years of non-taxable use and 1 year of 50% taxable use. • • Over the adjustment period that equates to 5% taxable use. • • On this basis, there would be an input tax deduction of $1,250 (5% of $25,000 – note the GST rate that applies is the one that applied at the time of purchase (s 21B(5)), so is 12.5% in this case). 160. This illustrates that where a property has been owned by the host for a long time, voluntary registration will often be commercially unappealing because the host will receive a relatively small GST input tax deduction. 161. In summary, where, before registration, GST has been incurred on goods or secondhand goods have been acquired, the host can retrospectively claim a GST input tax deduction on registering for GST (provided those goods are used, or available to be used, in their taxable activity). The first adjustment period covers the whole period of ownership, from the date of acquisition until the first balance date following registration. This means the adjustment is likely to be relatively modest in the case of a property that has been owned for a significant length of time. Obtaining the full input tax deduction to which the person would have been entitled had they purchased the property at the time of registering for GST could take several years and is technically available only if there is an adjustment under s 21FB. This point is illustrated in Example 13. Example 13 – adjustments for goods purchased before registration David and Jenny purchased their Queenstown property on 1 April 2015 from an unregistered vendor for $1 million. For the first two and half years they used the property solely for their personal use. They started making taxable supplies on 1 October 2017 and register for GST from this date. They expect they will have bookings for 90 days a year and use the property privately for 80 days a year. The property is a mixed-use asset as it has both taxable and non-taxable uses and is not in use for over 62 days a year. Under s 20G, they estimate taxable use of 53% (that is, 90/170). They want to know what change of use calculation for the property can be made in the March 2018 return. Their change of use calculation at 31 March 2018 is: • • Total GST claim – house: $1,000,000 × 3/23 = $130,435. • • Apportionment – Total GST × apportionment percentage 53% = $69,131. • • Non-taxable period: The non-taxable period (that is, before they were registered and using the house for private purposes) is 30 out of 36 months. • • Taxable period: 6/36 months × $69,131 = $11,522. For the March 2018 GST return, they can claim an adjustment for an input tax deduction of $11,522. If David and Jenny remain registered, they can continue to make an adjustment every March GST period until the property is sold or the activity ceases. Assuming they maintained the anticipated level of bookings the change of use calculation for 31 March 2019 is: • • Non-taxable period: = 30 out of 48 months • • Taxable period = 18/48 months × 69,131 = $25,924 • • Less prior year claim = $11,522 • • Total adjustment claimable for March 2019 = $14,402. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 95 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Section 21FB – total change of use and wash-up calculation 162. Section 21FB provides a wash-up calculation where use of an asset changes from both taxable and non-taxable use to total taxable use or total non-taxable use. Section 21FB only applies if the total change of use is maintained for the remainder of the adjustment period and the whole of the subsequent adjustment period (ie, 1 to 2 years). 163. Section 21FB relevantly states: 21FB Treatment when use changes to total taxable or non-taxable use (1) This section applies when— (a) a person makes an adjustment under section 21A or 21B; and (b) the person’s use of the goods or services in making taxable supplies changes in an adjustment period to either total taxable use or total non-taxable use; and (c) the total taxable use or non-taxable use remains unchanged for an unbroken period that is— (i) the remainder of the adjustment period in which the use was changed; and (ii) the adjustment period following the period in which the use was changed. (2) If the use changes to total taxable use, the person’s adjustment for the adjustment period referred to in subsection (1)(c)(ii) is an amount of input tax calculated using the formula— full input tax deduction − actual deduction. (3) In the formula,— (a) full input tax deduction is the total amount of input tax on the supply, after taking into account any nominal GST component chargeable under section 20(3J)(a)(i): (b) actual deduction is the amount of deduction already claimed, taking into account adjustments made up to the end of the adjustment period referred to in subsection (1)(c)(ii). (4) If the use changes to total non-taxable use, the person’s adjustment for the adjustment period referred to in subsection (1)(c)(ii) is an amount of output tax that is equal to the amount of the person’s actual deduction as described in subsection (3)(b). 164. Put simply, the person either: • • claims the balance of the input tax deduction (if use changes to total taxable); or • • repays the input tax deduction already claimed (if use changes to total non-taxable) for a property. 165. Because the full adjustment is made over time (rather than immediately), the person must continue the total taxable or non-taxable use for the rest of the current adjustment period and the whole of the next adjustment period (between 1 year and 2 years). Once the wash-up calculation has been performed, the person will no longer be required to make any ongoing adjustments unless the use of the property changes again. Change to total taxable use 166. Where there is a change to total taxable use, the person receives the full input tax deduction available on the purchase of the property less the input tax they have already claimed. This might happen where a registered person no longer uses a mixed-use bach for family holidays and rents it out for short-stay accommodation full time. This provision means they can make an adjustment under s 21FB and no longer have to perform annual adjustments unless the use changes from 100% taxable. Change to total non-taxable use 167. An important difference exists between removing an asset from a taxable activity and ceasing the taxable activity. In the first situation, the taxable activity continues absent the asset. In the second situation, the taxable activity ceases. This distinction is crucial as different provisions apply in each situation. This is because the key asset in a taxable activity for a person supplying short-stay accommodation will be the property in which the accommodation is provided. Removing that property from the taxable activity by way of a change in use is likely to mean that the taxable activity ceases. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between a change of use where the taxable activity: • • continues, in which case s 21FB applies; and • • ceases, in which case: –the host must notify the Commissioner and their GST registration will be cancelled (s 52(3) and (5)); and –if registration is cancelled, then ss 5(3) and 10(7A) deem the property to be disposed of at open market value and an adjustment will be made under s 21F in the usual way (see from \[222\]). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 96 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 168. Where a registered host has only a taxable activity of providing short-stay accommodation from one property (for example, their home or holiday home), ceasing to supply short-stay accommodation in that property will mean they have ceased their taxable activity. Provided they have no other taxable activity, their GST registration should be cancelled, and there is a deemed supply of the property (s 5(3)) at open market value. 169. However, s 21FB will apply where the use of the property changes to total non-taxable use and the person remains registered in respect of that or another taxable activity. This might apply, for instance, if a GST-registered farmer uses a farm cottage sometimes as accommodation for visiting family and sometimes as farmstay accommodation for paying guests. If an elderly relative then comes to live in the farm cottage full time, the use changes to total non-taxable. If the farmer had claimed any GST input tax deductions on the cottage, the farmer would have to repay the actual deductions claimed as GST output tax and then is saved from the compliance burden of having to make ongoing adjustments (which would otherwise apply forever where the asset is land). Once a wash-up calculation is performed (and assuming there is no further change of use) then the subsequent sale of the cottage would not be subject to GST. Conclusion on s 21FB 170. Section 21FB may be applicable where a registered host’s use of their property changes from mixed-use to total taxable (and that use has been maintained for the remainder of the adjustment period and the whole of the subsequent adjustment period). This may happen where a registered person no longer uses their holiday home for their private holidays and instead uses it full time in their short-stay accommodation business. In this case, s 21FB allows the person to receive the full input tax deduction less the input tax they have already claimed. 171. Section 21FB can also apply where there is a change to total non-taxable use. However, it is important to differentiate between where a host: • • removes a property from their taxable activity and continues to make taxable supplies (s 21FB applies); and • • ceases their taxable activity and GST registration is cancelled (s 5(3) applies). 172. Many hosts will fall into the latter category and will cease their taxable activity when they stop making taxable supplies of accommodation. They should cancel their GST registration and there will be a deemed supply of the property under s 5(3). However, if a host remains registered (for example, because they continue their taxable activity from another property or have another taxable activity) and they can satisfy the period of non-taxable use in s 21FB, then they can use the wash-up calculation. The host is required to make a GST output tax payment equivalent to the input tax claimed. Section 21E - concurrent uses of land 173. Section 21E is a specific provision dealing with concurrent uses of land. This is where an area of land is simultaneously used for making concurrent taxable and non-taxable supplies. An example is where a property developer lets out properties on residential tenancies while trying to sell them. 174. Section 21E is discussed in “IS 15/02: Goods and services tax – GST and retirement villages”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 27, No 11 (December 2015): 6. The Commissioner considers that use of both “simultaneously” and “concurrently” in s 21E suggests the provision requires the relevant land to be used to the full extent for both taxable and non-taxable supplies (at \[205\]). 175. Section 21E will rarely (if ever) apply to a short-stay property because the full extent of the property will not be being used simultaneously and concurrently for making both taxable supplies and non-taxable supplies. Instead, the property will be partly used for taxable supplies and partly used for non-taxable supplies. Because the property is divisible the appropriate approach is to apportion based on use. Adjustments are undertaken using the normal adjustment rules in ss 21A, 21C, 21D and 21F. This outcome is more consistent with the scheme and the purpose of the Act. Sections 21H and 21HB – transitional rules 176. The transitional rules in ss 21H and 21HB will be relevant to only a very small group of taxpayers. Section 21H – relevant to supplies 177. Section 21H is relevant to supplies that wholly or partly consist of land (s 21H(3)). Broadly, the provision allows taxpayers who have been applying the old apportionment rules since before 1 April 2011 to continue to do so. 178. Given the passage of time the Commissioner expects relatively few registered persons will be still applying the old apportionment rules. It is unlikely that hosts supplying short-stay accommodation on peer-to-peer websites will be in this position. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 97 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Section 21HB(1)–(3) – changes to definition of “dwelling” 179. If a person was offering short-stay accommodation in a residential property before 1 April 2011, it would likely have met the definition of a “dwelling” and have been an exempt supply. The change to the definition from 1 April 2011 means the supply is now likely to be considered taxable, so the property will be in the GST regime (without the host having had an initial GST input tax claim on acquisition). These provisions allow a GST input tax deduction as though the person acquired their property on 1 April 2011 at its original cost. With the passage of time it is expected that very few hosts will now be able to apply subss 21HB(1)-(3). Section 21HB(4) and (5) – choice to treat the supply as non-taxable 180. Subsections (4) and (5) of s 21HB recognise that the changes to the definitions could change supplies of accommodation from exempt to taxable. If a person is already registered for GST, they have no choice but to charge and account for GST. Under s 21HB(4), the host has the choice of whether to treat the supply as taxable. 181. Section 21HB(4) will be helpful to persons who are GST registered in respect of their main business or occupation and who also make taxable supplies of short-stay accommodation in a residential property (for example, a self-employed plumber who also lists a room in their home on a peer-to-peer website). The supply of short-stay accommodation (assuming it is sufficient to be a taxable activity) may “inadvertently” be brought into the GST regime. However, provided the property was acquired before 1 April 2011 (and the supplies of accommodation are below the s 51(1)(a) threshold), they may choose to treat the supply of accommodation as non-taxable. Disposal of property 182. For goods and services used in making taxable supplies there are GST implications on acquisition, where there is a change of use and, finally, on disposal. For registered hosts, there will be a “disposal” in two situations: • • First, when they sell the property they use to supply short-stay accommodation. • • Secondly, when their GST registration is cancelled, which is most likely to happen when a registered host ceases their taxable activity of supplying short-stay accommodation. They must notify the Commissioner within 21 days of ceasing the activity and the Commissioner will cancel their GST registration. If no notification is received, the Commissioner has the power to cancel registration if satisfied that the registered person is not carrying on a taxable activity. GST output tax liability on property used to make taxable supplies 183. GST will be imposed on the disposal of a property used to make supplies of short-stay accommodation. Section 2(1) defines “output tax” as: tax charged pursuant to section 8(1) of this Act in respect of the supply of goods and services ... 184. Section 8(1) states: (1) Subject to this Act, a tax, to be known as goods and services tax, shall be charged in accordance with the provisions of this Act at the rate of 12.5 percent on the supply (but not including an exempt supply) in New Zealand of goods and services, on or after the 1st day of October 1986, by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person, by reference to the value of that supply. \[Emphasis added\] 185. From the definition of “output tax” in s 2(1) and the words of s 8(1), output tax is the tax charged on the supply of goods and services by a registered person in the course or furtherance of that person’s taxable activity. In addition to GST output tax on supplies of accommodation, hosts will face a likely GST output tax liability on sale (or a deemed supply following cessation of registration) under s 8(1). 186. It may be questioned whether the disposal of a property will be in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity given the host’s registered activity will be providing short-stay accommodation. Case law supports the view that “in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity” can include the one-off sale of capital items that a registered person uses in their taxable activity (Case K55 (1988) 10 NZTC 453, Hibell v CIR (1991) 13 NZTC 8,195 (HC) and CIR v Dormer (1997) 18 NZTC 13,446 (HC)). 187. Further, the property supplied does not need to be the “usual” good supplied by the taxpayer for it to come within the scope of the taxpayer’s taxable activity (Case K55, Case N43 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,361 and Case V16 (2002) 20 NZTC 10,182). Whether property comes within the scope of a taxable activity is a matter of fact and will depend on the “use” or “involvement” of the property in the taxable activity (Case V16, Case K55). In Case K55, this was characterised as there being a “discernible nexus” between the activity and the supply. If a host is using a property to continuously and regularly make supplies of short-stay accommodation, then the property is being used in the taxable activity and a clear relationship exists between the property and the supply. On this basis, the one-off sale of a property used to make supplies of short- stay taxable accommodation will be in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity and be subject to GST under s 8(1). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 98 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 188. However, these cases were all decided under the pre–1 April 2011 “principal purpose approach”. The consequence of this is that some of the cases consider what the asset was principally used for. The implication is that if an asset is principally used for private rather than business purposes the subsequent sale would not be in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. For instance, in Case K55 Judge Bathgate indicates that in establishing whether a nexus exists between the supply of the assets and the taxable activity, it is necessary to determine for what purposes that asset was principally used. If that asset was used more in the business than for private purposes, its supply is likely to be in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity. Case K55 concerned the sale of a car that the taxpayer had used 56% of the time in his taxable activity (as a sheep farmer) and 44% of the time for private purposes. Judge Bathgate stated (at 457): The sale of the car may not be so obviously an act carried on in the course of the objector's sheep farming, although I think it was such an act, but the sale was I think more obviously in furtherance of that activity. It was more in the furtherance of that activity than not. The car was used more for the objector's sheep farming business than anything else, including family or private purposes. \[Emphasis added\] 189. The approach was similar in Holdgate v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,036 (HC). In deciding whether a land transaction was in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity, the court considered whether the taxpayer owned land as a business asset or a private asset. The court decided it was a business asset, so the land was used in connection with the taxpayer’s business activities and its supply was subject to GST. This reasoning is a consequence of the previous legislation. For the goods to be supplied in the course or furtherance of the taxable activity they would have to be acquired or applied for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. 190. After 1 April 2011, the Act provides for GST input tax deductions based on the extent of intended use, subsequent adjustments, and then a GST output tax liability under s 8(1) when the property is taken out of the GST regime. The “principal purpose test” no longer applies when considering whether a property is being supplied in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. If goods are used privately and in a taxable activity, then an output tax liability arises on disposal, with an adjustment under s 21F (discussed from \[195\]). 191. This is reflected in s 20G(7), which addresses MUAs (that is, most holiday homes and baches with taxable and non-taxable use): (7) Sections 8 and 21F apply to the disposal of the asset, treating the disposal as in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. 192. This provision supports the view that the scheme of the adjustment rules after the 1 April 2011 changes is for output tax to be payable with an appropriate adjustment made under s 21F. A disposal of a MUA with more non-taxable than taxable use will still be in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. 193. In summary, the disposal of a property that is a MUA under s 20G will be subject to GST under s 8(1). Other properties used to make taxable supplies of short-stay accommodation will also be subject to s 8(1) on disposal. Having concluded that a disposal can be subject to GST output tax, it is necessary to consider what happens: • • on the sale of a property, in particular the application of: –s 21F, which effectively credits the host with any GST input tax not claimed; and –the zero-rating of land rules; • • when the host stops supplying accommodation, including: –when GST registration will be cancelled; –when a deemed disposal of the property is triggered; and –the value of the deemed supply. Sale of property 194. As discussed above, GST output tax will be charged on the sale of a property used to make supplies of short-stay accommodation. GST output tax will usually be greater than the initial GST input tax deduction because GST is paid as a proportion of the purchase and sale price. This means the GST output tax liability is likely to be greater than the initial GST input tax deduction because properties generally appreciate in value. 195. GST output tax is not apportioned under s 8, so a registered person must pay output tax on the value of the supply. This is the case even where the registered person did not receive a full input tax deduction on acquisition because GST input tax was apportioned based on taxable to non-taxable use (or intended use). Where there has not been a full input tax claim, s 21F allows for an additional adjustment for the unclaimed portion of the GST input tax. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 99 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Adjustments allowed under s 21F 196. Under s 21F, where a person has acquired goods or services and not had a full input tax deduction (being the total of amounts claimed on acquisition and in subsequent adjustments), the person is required to make a final adjustment when those goods or services are sold. Section 21F provides: 21F Treatment on disposal (1) This section applies when a registered person— (a) acquires goods or services in relation to which they do not have a full deduction, taking into account any adjustments made to input tax in adjustment periods after acquisition; and (b) subsequently disposes, or is treated as disposing, of the goods or services in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. (2) The person must make a final adjustment of an amount calculated using the formula— tax fraction × consideration × (1 − (actual deduction ÷ full input tax deduction)). (3) For the purposes of the formula in subsection (2),— (a) tax fraction has the meaning given in section 2(1), unless subsection (7) applies to the disposal: (b) consideration is the amount of consideration received, or treated as received, for the supply: (c) actual deduction is the amount of deduction already claimed, taking into account adjustments made up to the date of disposal: (d) the amount, when added to any deduction already claimed, must not be more than the amount of the full input tax deduction on acquisition referred to in section 21D(2). (4) Despite subsection (2), if the acquisition referred to in subsection (1)(a) relates to a supply that is charged at the rate of 0% under section 11(1)(mb), on a disposal referred to in subsection (1)(b), the person must make a final adjustment of an amount calculated using the formula— tax fraction × consideration × (1 − previous use). (5) For the purposes of the formula in subsection (4),— (a) tax fraction has the meaning given in section 2(1), unless subsection (7) applies to the disposal: (b) consideration is the amount of consideration received, or treated as received, for the supply: (c) previous use is the percentage intended use or the previous actual use in the period before the period in which the disposal occurs. (6) The amount given by the formula in subsection (4) must not be more than the amount of output tax that is accounted for by the person under section 20(3J)(a)(iii), taking into account any later adjustments made under the apportionment rules in sections 21 to 21H. (7) In the formulas in subsections (2) and (4), on the disposal of the goods or services, if the supply is charged at the rate of 0%, the item tax fraction is treated as 15%. 197. The calculation in s 21F(2) (or s 21F(4) if the compulsory zero-rating provisions in s 11(1)(mb) apply) allows an adjustment based on the apportionment of GST input tax on the original supply. In broad terms, this recognises the person will not have had a full input tax deduction on the original acquisition. 198. Section 21F operates slightly differently depending on whether the asset has increased or decreased in value. Section 21F(3)(d) caps the amount of any GST input tax deduction at the amount of the full input tax deduction on the acquisition of the asset. For assets that appreciate in value, this effectively means the adjustment is equivalent to the unclaimed portion of the original GST input tax. The person pays GST output tax on the appreciated value of the asset and receives an adjustment capped at the original amount of GST input tax. As properties generally appreciate over time this means a registered host’s output tax liability on sale will be more than the input tax claim on acquisition. 199. Example 14 illustrates an adjustment on disposal of an asset. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 100 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Example 14 – adjustment on disposal under s 21F A semi-retired couple live in a wine region and purchased their current home for $600,000 in 2015. It is a popular destination for weekend stays. To make some extra money they occasionally rent the whole property out as a homestay on peer-to-peer websites. They rent out their home for 70 nights a year and during this time they stay with family or organise their own holidays. They decided to register for GST in 2015, so they could claim GST input tax back on the purchase of the house as follows: • • Total GST input tax claim – house: $600,000 × 3/23 = $78,261. • • Apportionment: Total GST × apportionment percentage 19% (that is, 70/365) = $15,009. Use remains as predicted in the subsequent adjustment periods and no further adjustments are required. In 2019, they decide to move to Auckland to be near family. Since 2015, property prices have risen significantly in the region and they sell for $800,000. They must perform an adjustment on disposal using s 21F: • • GST output tax on sale: $800,000 × 3/23 = $104,348. • • Input tax adjustment under s 21F: $104,348 × (1 – ($15,009 ÷ $78,261)) = $84,336. Any deduction, when added to the deduction already claimed, must not be more than the amount of the full input tax deduction on acquisition. Therefore: • • $78,261 − $15,009 = $63,252 total s 21F adjustment. • • Total GST output tax payable: $104,348 − $63,252 = $41,096 GST output tax. Because of the rise in the property’s value, there is a net GST liability of $26,087. This is because GST input tax on purchase was $78,261 and GST output tax on sale is $104,348 Compulsory zero-rating of land rules 200. Where a registered person is selling to another registered person, they should consider whether the compulsory zero-rated provisions apply. 201. The compulsory zero-rating of land (CZR) rules treat certain supplies involving land between registered persons as zero- rated supplies. For more detail on the CZR rules, see “IS 17/08: Goods and services tax – compulsory zero-rating of land rules”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 29, No 10 (November 2017): 17. 202. The core provision of the CZR rules is s 11(1)(mb), which provides: (1) A supply of goods that is chargeable with tax under section 8 must be charged at the rate of 0% in the following situations: ... (mb) the supply wholly or partly consists of land, being a supply— (i) made by a registered person to another registered person who acquires the goods with the intention of using them for making taxable supplies; and (ii) that is not a supply of land intended to be used as a principal place of residence of the recipient of the supply or a person associated with them under section 2A(1)(c); 203. Under ss 8 and 11(1)(mb), a supply must be zero-rated if: • • the supply wholly or partly consists of land; • • the vendor is GST registered (or will be GST registered or will be treated as GST registered) at the time of settlement; • • the supply is being made by the vendor in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity; • • the purchaser is a GST-registered purchaser (or will be GST registered or treated as GST registered) at the time of settlement; • • the purchaser acquires the goods (including the land) with the intention of using them (in whole or part) for making taxable supplies; and • • none of the land included in the supply is intended to be used as the purchaser’s principal place of residence or the principal place of residence of a relative of the purchaser. 204. Section 11(1)(mb) will not commonly apply where the property being sold is an ordinary domestic property. It seems unlikely the buyer and seller of such properties will commonly both be GST registered and that the purchaser will not be using the property as a principal place of residence. The CZR rules are likely to be most relevant to the sales of dedicated short-stay rental properties in popular tourist destinations. In such cases, it is more likely that both parties will be GST registered and that the purchaser is buying an asset that they intend to use to make taxable supplies (and do not intend to use as a principal place of residence). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 101 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 205. Purchasers who acquire a property that has been compulsorily zero-rated may need to make output tax adjustments to account for any non-taxable use: • • when the property is acquired (s 20(3J)(a)); and • • in later adjustment periods under the adjustment provisions in ss 21 to 21H (s 20(3J)(b)). 206. At the time the compulsorily zero-rated property is acquired, the purchaser must identify the “nominal GST component” that would have been chargeable if the supply of the property had been standard-rated. This is done by adding GST at the standard rate to the agreed consideration for the supply. The purchaser then determines the extent to which they intend to use the property for making taxable supplies and calculates the proportion of the nominal GST component for any non-taxable use. The non-taxable use proportion of the nominal GST component is an amount of output tax and must be accounted for by the purchaser in their GST return for the period the supply is attributed to (see s 20(4)). 207. Further adjustments may be required in subsequent adjustment periods under ss 21 to 21H. This is done by comparing the intended use of the property at the time of acquisition against the actual use of the property at the end of an adjustment period. This might occur if a purchaser buys a dedicated short-stay rental property and the transaction is zero-rated, but the purchaser subsequently uses the property for a couple of weeks for their own personal (non-taxable) use. 208. An adjustment may not necessarily be required if the change in use is within the scope of s 21(2). IS 17/08 addresses this issue: 50. Purchasers who acquire goods (including land) that have been compulsorily zero-rated under s 11(1)(mb) may need to make output tax adjustments to account for any non-taxable use of the acquired goods. Adjustments may need to be made: • when the goods (including land) are acquired (s 20(3J)(a)); and • in later adjustment periods under the apportionment rules in ss 21 to 21H (s 20(3J)(b)). 51. At the time the compulsorily zero-rated goods are acquired, under s 20(3J)(a) the purchaser must identify the “nominal GST component” that would have been chargeable if the supply of goods had been standard-rated. This is done by adding GST at the standard rate to the agreed consideration for the supply. The purchaser is then required to determine the extent to which they intend to use the goods acquired for making taxable supplies and calculate the proportion of the nominal GST component for any non-taxable use of the goods. The non-taxable use proportion of the nominal GST component is an amount of output tax and must be accounted for by the purchaser in their GST return for the period the supply is attributed to (see s 20(4)). 52. To determine the intended non-taxable use of the goods acquired (including land) the purchaser needs to estimate at the time of acquisition how they intend to use the goods, choosing a determination method that produces a fair and reasonable result (see s 20(3G)). 53. Further output or input tax adjustments may be needed under the apportionment rules in subsequent adjustment periods (see ss 21 to 21H). This is done by comparing the intended use of the goods (including land) as determined at the time of acquisition against the actual use of the goods at the end of an adjustment period. Adjustments may not be required where the amounts involved are small (see s 21(2)). 209. Under s 21(2), the paragraphs most likely to apply are (c) and (d): (2) Despite subsection (1), the person is not permitted to make an adjustment if— (a) section 20(3D) applies to them: ... (b) the value of the goods or services, excluding GST, is $5,000 or less: (c) the difference between the percentage intended use on acquisition and the percentage actual use for the relevant adjustment period is less than 10 percentage points, but this paragraph does not apply if the adjustment amounts to more than $1,000: (d) the difference between the previous actual use calculated for the most recent adjustment period in which an adjustment was made and the percentage actual use for the relevant adjustment period is less than 10 percentage points, but this paragraph does not apply if the adjustment amounts to more than $1,000. 210. Paragraphs (c) and (d) mean that a person is not permitted to make an adjustment where the difference between the actual and intended uses is relatively minor (less than 10 percentage points) and amounts to less than $1,000. 211. In summary, the CZR rules are likely to be most relevant to dedicated short-stay rental properties in popular tourist destinations. For the rules to apply: • • both the seller and purchaser must be GST registered; • • there must be an intention to make taxable supplies; and • • the property must not be intended to be a person’s principal place of residence. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 102 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 212. If a transaction is subject to the CZR rules, taxpayers should refer to IS 17/08. Even if a transaction is zero-rated, it may still be necessary for a purchaser to subsequently perform ongoing adjustments to reflect any change in use. 213. Example 15 illustrates the application of the CZR rules. Example 15 – application of the CZR rules Len (from Example 9) is a GST-registered short-stay accommodation entrepreneur who owns properties in Coromandel and Auckland. He has heard the short-stay accommodation market in Rotorua is lucrative because of the town’s year- round popularity with tourists. He is looking to expand his portfolio and buy a property in Rotorua. He has identified a suitable property being sold there. Further enquires reveal that the seller is GST registered and has been using the property as a dedicated short-stay rental. Len wants to know whether the transaction will be zero-rated. The CZR rules apply. The buyer and seller are both GST registered and Len will be using the property to make taxable supplies. The answer would be different if Len was going to live in the property as his principal residence and merely rent out rooms for short-stay accommodation on a peer-to-peer website. In that case, he would be using the property as a principal place of residence, so the CZR rules would not apply and GST would apply at the standard rate. Deemed disposal on cancellation of registration 214. Where a registered host’s GST registration is cancelled, they will be liable for GST output tax on the open market value of their property. Cancellation of registration 215. Under s 52 the Commissioner may cancel a person’s GST registration in three situations: • • Sections 52(1) and (2) allow a person to request the Commissioner to cancel their registration where the value of the person’s taxable supplies is below the registration threshold. • • Section 52(3) imposes a requirement on registered persons who have ceased all taxable activities to notify the Commissioner within 21 days. In such circumstances, the Commissioner must cancel the person’s GST registration. However, there is a proviso to s 52(3) if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the person will carry on any taxable activity at any time within the next 12 months. • • Section 52(5) allows the Commissioner to cancel a registered person’s GST registration, if the Commissioner is satisfied that the registered person is not carrying on a taxable activity. 216. For the supply of short-stay accommodation, there are two possible scenarios: • • Scenario 1: The registered person asks the Commissioner to cancel their registration because they are no longer making supplies in excess of the registration threshold. • • Scenario 2: The registered person ceases carrying on their taxable activity of providing short-stay accommodation. Whether a taxable activity is still being carried on in any particular situation will be a question of fact. However, if a registered host files nil returns and does not continuously or regularly make taxable supplies, then it points to them having ceased their taxable activity. 217. The Commissioner’s view is that a s 21FB adjustment is not available where a person’s taxable activity has ceased entirely (see \[162\]). In this case, the most appropriate course will be for the person to cancel their GST registration. Deemed supply 218. When a person ceases to be registered for GST, s 5(3) deems the assets of a taxable activity to be supplied by the person. The time of that supply is immediately before the person ceases to be registered. Section 5(3) provides: (3) For the purposes of this Act, where a person ceases to be a registered person, any goods and services then forming part of the assets of a taxable activity carried on by that person shall be deemed to be supplied by that person in the course of that taxable activity at a time immediately before that person ceases to be a registered person, unless the taxable activity is carried on by another person who, pursuant to section 58, is deemed to be a registered person. 219. In s 5(3), a deemed supply occurs for goods and services forming part of the assets of the taxable activity carried on by the person. If a host has the taxable activity of supplying short-stay accommodation then the property in which the accommodation is supplied will be an asset of the taxable activity. The property will be the most significant asset that forms part of the assets of the taxable activity of supplying short-stay accommodation, although other assets may also be subject to s 5(3). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 103 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Value of supply 220. The value of the deemed supply under s 5(3) is determined under s 10(7A) and (8). Where the property has been owned since before 1986 (when GST was introduced), the adjustment can be made at the lower of the cost of the property or its market value (s 10(8)). But in most cases, the consideration will be treated as being the open market value of the supply (s 10(7A)). Section 5(3) does not contemplate apportionment for non-taxable use but this is offset by s 21F, which effectively allows a credit for unclaimed GST input tax where a person has not had a full GST input tax deduction. 221. Despite s 21F, the consequences of cancellation of registration will often be financially significant. The taxpayer will usually have a net liability for GST because the value of the property will have appreciated. In other words, the taxpayer will pay GST on the uplift in the property’s value. Further, this is only a deemed disposal, meaning the taxpayer will not have sale proceeds from which they can pay their GST liability. Conclusion 222. In summary, a registered person may request that the Commissioner cancel their registration where their supplies fall below the $60,000 threshold and this will trigger a deemed disposal. More commonly, a person’s GST registration will be cancelled because they cease their taxable activity of making supplies of short-stay accommodation. 223. Where a person ceases their taxable activity entirely, then they should inform the Commissioner within 21 days (s 52(3)), and the Commissioner shall cancel their GST registration. Section 52(5) also allows the Commissioner to cancel a person’s GST registration if the Commissioner is satisfied that the registered person is not carrying on a taxable activity. 224. On cancellation, s 5(3) deems a disposal of all assets that form part of the taxable activity. This will include the property used to make the supplies of short-stay accommodation. The deemed disposal will usually be at the open market value (s 10(7A)). This means the person will be liable for GST output tax on the open market value of the property. Where a person did not have a full GST input tax deduction, s 21F allows an adjustment that effectively credits the taxpayer with the unclaimed portion of the original GST input tax. 225. Example 16 illustrates the impact of a registration cancellation. Example 16 – cessation of a taxable activity David and Jenny (from Example 13) have decided to make a lifestyle change. They are selling up in Christchurch and will move permanently to their Queenstown holiday home. They will cease their taxable activity on 31 March 2020 and move into the Queenstown property on 1 April 2020. They want to know how this will impact on their GST obligations. Cessation of a taxable activity will require their GST registration to be cancelled. There is a deemed supply of the assets forming part of the taxable activity (s 5(3)). This means a deemed supply of the property that will be subject to GST. The value of housing in Queenstown has grown considerably in the intervening years and their property is now worth $1.5 million. Therefore, the tax fraction on the deemed supply is: 3/23 × $1,500,000 = $195,652. An input tax deduction of $25,924 has already been claimed (the combined 2018 and 2019 adjustments – see Example 12), so the full deduction available on the original purchase is: $130,435 less the deduction claimed of $25,924 = $104,511. This is the limit of the adjustment. Therefore, on cessation: • • output – GST on deemed supply ($1,500,000 × 3/23) = $195,652 • • input – adjustment = ($104,511) • • GST payable = $91,141. 226. Example 17 illustrates GST issues to consider when purchasing a property to use as short-stay accommodation. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 104 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Example 17 – GST considerations when purchasing a property Neve and George are looking to buy a property in one of New Zealand’s tourist hotspots. They intend to buy a large property which they will use to make supplies of short-stay accommodation. They intend to try and live off the short- stay accommodation income. They are looking at two properties: • • A large section near Lake Wanaka. The section includes a main house and a separate holiday cottage. The house is used solely as the owners’ private residence and the cottage is a dedicated short-stay rental property. The holiday cottage is a top-end property in a prime location that is advertised on various websites. It is used year-round by skiers, trampers and overseas holiday makers. The holiday cottage’s current turnover is $80,000 a year. The property is advertised for sale at $1.8 million. The documentation provided by the seller includes a registered valuer’s report valuing the main house at $1m and the holiday cottage at $800,000. The seller is GST registered and the properties are on one land title. • • A large apartment on the hill in Queenstown for sale for $1.1m. It is a 4-bedroom property split over three floors. It is currently used as a private holiday home. Neve and George would run it as a homestay and plan to rent out the rooms individually on a website at $100 a night. Their research indicates an occupancy rate of around 40% for such rooms which would equate to $44,000 a year. They are GST novices and ask an accountant whether there are any GST implications for either property. Lake Wanaka If Neve and George are intending to continue renting out the holiday cottage (and living in the main home) they will need to register for GST because the turnover is likely to exceed the $60,000 threshold. The Act treats the supply of a principal place of residence and other property as separate supplies. In other words, the sale of the main house and holiday cottage are treated separately for GST purposes As the holiday cottage is used in the current owner’s taxable activity, the sale of the property will be subject to GST. However, the compulsory zero-rating rules will apply where both the seller and buyer are registered persons, the buyers intend to carry on using the holiday cottage to make taxable supplies and it is not intended to be a person’s principal place of residence. Neve and George will have to charge GST output tax on the supplies of short-stay accommodation, but they will be able to claim GST input tax on their expenses for the holiday cottage. Where expenses relate to the whole section rather than just the holiday cottage, the expenses should be apportioned on a fair and reasonable basis. The main house is used solely as the owner’s private residence and will not be subject to GST. There will be GST implications if Neve and George decide to use the main house to make supplies of accommodation in the future. Queenstown The sellers are not GST registered and the sale will not be subject to GST output tax. Because supplies of accommodation in their homestay would be below the $60,000 threshold, Neve and George do not have to register for GST. Neve and George’s accountant suggests that there might be some benefit for them in remaining unregistered. They won’t have to charge GST output tax on the supplies of short-stay accommodation, and they won’t have to file returns and undertake adjustments. They also would not have to return GST output tax on the property when they come to sell it. Registering for GST would likely leave them worse off because property values in Queenstown are expected to rise and consequently the GST output tax on sale will be more than the GST input tax on sale. If they do decide to register for GST, they can claim GST input tax on expenses that relate solely to providing short- stay accommodation (eg, guest toiletries) and a portion of GST on expenses relating to both taxable and non-taxable supplies (eg, utility bills). They can also claim GST input tax on the purchase. To give an indication the accountant calculates that: • • The bottom floor has a bedroom (with ensuite) and inbuilt garage that will be used exclusively by Neve and George - 50m2 with 100% private use. • • The second level is exclusively for guests and contains three dedicated guest bedrooms and a guest bathroom - 50m2 with 100% taxable use. • • The top level contains the common areas - an open plan lounge and kitchen-dining room - 50m2 with 50% taxable use. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 105 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS The second floor area used (or available for use) exclusively by guests is calculated as: 50 × 365 ×100=33.33% 150365 The common areas on the top floor are 50% deductible but only for the days that one of the rooms is rented out. Neve and George estimate that at least one of the rooms will be rented out for 200 days a year: 50 × 200 ×50=9.13% 150365 Adding these figures together (33.33% and 9.13%) they could expect to deduct 42.46% of GST input tax. The full amount of the GST input tax deduction would be 3/23 × $1.1m = $143,478.26. The proportion claimable would be $143,478.26 × 42.46% = $60,920.87. Neve and George would need to weigh up the other pros and cons of registration. If they did register they would need to charge GST on the supplies of accommodation they make and the property would also be subject to GST when they sell it or cease supplying short-stay accommodation.

A Commissioner’s Statement is not a consultative document. COMMISSIONER’S STATEMENT CS 20/02: Trophy hunting and the GST treatment of the “Trophy Fee” All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Background The Commissioner has released an Interpretation Statement (IS 20/02) (the Interpretation Statement) setting out her interpretation of how the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 applies to supplies made by New Zealand hunting outfitters and taxidermists to overseas hunters who hunt trophy animals in New Zealand. Typically, when an outfitter provides a New Zealand hunting package to an overseas hunter, and as part of that package the outfitter provides souvenir animal parts 1 or a hunting souvenir 2 for export, the outfitter makes two separate GST supplies to the hunter: • • a single composite supply of a hunting experience in New Zealand; and • • a supply of souvenir animal parts or a hunting souvenir. The supply of the hunting experience in New Zealand must be standard-rated for GST purposes. This includes the supply of such things as accommodation, transport, guiding, licences etc. And, in the Commissioner’s view, it also includes the outfitter’s supply of the opportunity to hunt and kill a particular breed and quality of animal in New Zealand. The consideration paid by the hunter for this last part of the standard-rated supply is typically included within the “trophy fee” charged by the outfitter. The supply of souvenir animal parts or a hunting souvenir for export to the hunter may be able to be zero-rated for GST purposes. In the Commissioner’s view, the consideration for the supply of souvenir animal parts or a hunting souvenir is the balance of the “trophy fee” that is not attributable to the opportunity to hunt and kill a particular breed and quality of animal in New Zealand. The Interpretation Statement includes discussion on valuing supplies and apportioning consideration where there is a mixture of standard-rated and zero-rated supplies. It observes that the value attached to separate supplies should properly represent the consideration paid for those supplies, and the onus is on the outfitter to show the Commissioner that a supply has been valued appropriately. If the Commissioner is concerned that artificial or contrived pricing is occurring that alters the incidence of tax, then there may be grounds for the transaction to be reviewed. To assist outfitters in determining what portion of a “trophy fee” the Commissioner will accept as consideration for the standard-rated supply of the hunt and what portion is consideration for the exported supply of the souvenir animal parts or hunting souvenir, the Commissioner has established some standard apportionment percentages for trophy hunting animals in New Zealand. The percentages are intended to recognise the increasing value to the hunter of souvenir animal parts and hunting souvenirs as the quality and “uniqueness” of the trophy animal increases. Outfitters may use these percentages to apportion their trophy fees when they export souvenir animal parts or hunting souvenirs, and those valuations will be accepted by the Commissioner. The use of these percentages is optional, however if an outfitter wishes to zero-rate a greater proportion of the trophy fee, they must be able to satisfy the Commissioner that their zero-rated portion is reasonable. Standard percentages 1. To help outfitters correctly apportion the value of the “trophy fee”, the Commissioner provides in this document standard percentages that can be applied by outfitters to determine how much of the trophy fee should be standard-rated and how much can be zero-rated. 2. These percentages are set out in the table below. 1 “souvenir animal parts” refers to the parts of a trophy hunting animal killed by a hunter (for example, heads, shoulders, skins, antlers and bodies) that may later be expedited or mounted. 2 “hunting souvenir” refers to the souvenir animal parts once they have been expedited or mounted by a taxidermist. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 107 COMMISSIONER’S STATEMENT 3. The percentages are based on the species available for trophy hunting in New Zealand and vary according to the quality and “uniqueness” of animal parts from the respective species, based on the trophy fees typically charged. The Commissioner recognises that the portion of the trophy fee that is attributable to the animal parts rather than the hunting experience will increase as the quality and uniqueness of the animal itself increases, therefore a higher percentage of such a trophy fee can be zero-rated. For red deer in particular, the Commissioner recognises that there is a wide range of values for the animal parts. The scoring system used by Safari Club International (SCI) has been used to adjust the applicable percentage - a higher scoring red deer will have a higher zero-rated element – to recognise the greater value the hunter places on the animal parts. 4. The use of these percentages is optional. However, where they are used and the Commissioner is satisfied that fair value is being charged for the supply of the standard-rated hunting experience in New Zealand, the Commissioner will accept the outfitter’s GST treatment of the trophy fee based on the standard percentages. 5. Where an outfitter wishes to attribute a greater proportion of trophy fee to the zero-rated supply than the standard percentages provide for, they will need to satisfy the Commissioner that their valuation is reasonable. The onus is on the outfitter to do so.

It agrees to provide a hunting package for a United States hunter to come to New Zealand to hunt a red deer stag with a Safari Club International (SCI) score of between 500 and 550. The agreement between Kiwi Big Game Hunting and the hunter specifies that any hunting souvenirs made from any souvenir animal parts will be exported by Kiwi Big Game Hunting to the hunter in the course of, or as a condition of, their supply. The package booked by the hunter includes: • • four nights’ accommodation; • • professional guiding and use of firearms for three days; • • assessment of the red deer stag by a Safari Club International qualified measurer; and • • shuttle transfer between the airport and accommodation. Kiwi Big Game Hunting tells the hunter that for a three-day hunt of this type, they will charge $3,000. GST is charged on this amount at the standard rate. The hunter arrives in New Zealand and shoots a red deer stag which has an SCI score of 510. She also shoots a tahr. She wishes for both animals to be mounted as trophies and exported to her home in the United Stated and is happy to pay the applicable trophy fee for both animals, and the necessary taxidermy and shipping costs. Kiwi Big Game Hunting agrees to arrange that. In determining the GST treatment of the red deer and tahr trophy fees, Kiwi Big Hunting uses the Commissioner’s standard percentages. Kiwi Big Game Hunting’s trophy fee for the red deer is $35,000 due to the animal’s high SCI score. Of that value, 10% is charged GST at the standard rate of 15%, while 90% can be zero-rated. For the tahr, Kiwi Big Game Hunting charges a trophy fee of $8,000. Of this, 50% is to be charged GST at the standard rate, while 50% can be zero-rated.

CSUM 20/04: Court of Appeal decides that payments made in support of overseas mission services qualify for tax credits CaseThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints Trust Board and Coward v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2020\] NZCA 143 Decision date6 May 2020 Legislative ReferencesIncome Tax Act 2007, s LD 1 Legal termsAppeal; Missionary; Overseas; Donations; Donor; Gifts; Tax Credits; Charitable; Public Benefit. Summary The Court of Appeal found that the High Court Judge was correct when she concluded that payments made by a missionary’s sibling and other more distant relatives, as well as unrelated members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (“the Church”) were gifts for the purposes of s LD 1(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (“the Act”). The Court of Appeal found that the High Court Judge erred in concluding payments made by a missionary, their parents, guardians or grandparents were not gifts. The Court of Appeal determined these payments were also gifts, making the payors eligible for donation tax credits. Impact The decision will mean donations to support missionaries of the Church will be eligible for donation tax credits and the Church is entitled it issue donation receipts. The decision could have wider implications for other charitable or not-for-profit entities as well. Facts This judgment concerned an appeal of the decision of the High Court addressing two proceedings which were heard together. The first appellant is The Trust Board of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (“the Trust Board”). The Trust Board is the New Zealand based arm or entity of the Church. The second appellant is Mr Coward, a New Zealand tax resident and member of the Church, whose daughter was a missionary of the Church. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) is the respondent in both appeals. The Church itself is based in Salt Lake City, Utah, but has a worldwide presence, including in New Zealand. Under the Church’s missionary programme, young members may take part in an 18 to 24-month mission service overseas. As part of their application, a missionary is expected to commit to raising a “standard amount” to go towards supporting the Church’s missionary work. At the time of Mr Coward’s daughter’s application, the “standard amount” for New Zealand was $475 per month or $5,700 per annum. These payments are made to the Trust Board and intermingled with the Trust Board’s funds and applied, at the sole discretion of the Trust Board, towards activities of the New Zealand Church. The payment is voluntary and non-refundable. The Trust Board makes no payment towards the costs of a New Zealand missionary serving overseas. Their basic travel, accommodation, food and mission-related costs are met by the relevant Church-related entity in the country where their mission takes place. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 110 LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE SUMMARIES Mr Coward’s tax challenge concerned the Commissioner’s decision to not allow him a tax credit for the payments he made to the Trust Board. The Trust Board applied under the Declaratory Judgments Act 1908 for various declarations that payments made by a missionary, his or her family, and members of the Church in New Zealand were gifts for the purposes of s LD 1(1) of the Act. The High Court found in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints Trust Board and Coward v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2019\] NZHC 52 \[High Court judgment\] at \[128\]: • • The “standard amount” payments made to the Trust Board by a missionary, their parents, and/or grandparents are not gifts; and • • Payments by other relatives and Church members unrelated to the missionary are gifts. Issues The Court of Appeal was required to determine whether the payments made by taxpayers to the Trust Board are gifts and therefore eligible for a tax credit under ss LD 1(1) and (2) of the Act. The Court also considered there were two sub-issues that stem from the principal issue: • • whether any of the taxpayers receive a material benefit from the financial assistance received by those performing missionary services overseas; and if so • • whether there is a connection between the payments made by the taxpayer and the financial assistance received by the New Zealand missionary serving overseas so that the payments cannot be treated as gifts. Decision The Court of Appeal held that the payments made to the Trust Board by a missionary, their parents, grandparents, other relatives and/or friends were “gifts” and therefore eligible for a tax credit under s LD 1 of the Act. The Court of Appeal considered that the correct approach was to follow Mills v Dowdall \[1983\] NZLR 154 (CA), by focusing on the legal form of the arrangements over a substance-based approach. Text and purpose of s LD 1(1) of the Act The Court noted that the term “gift” is not defined in the Act and so it must be taken to bear its ordinary and natural meaning. Accordingly, in order to be a “gift” for the purposes of s LD 1(1) of the Act there must be no material benefit bestowed on the taxpayer in addition to the tax credit prescribed in the Act. Sub Issue 1 – was there a material benefit to the taxpayers? The Court held there was no material benefit to the taxpayers and no distinction should be drawn between the various categories of taxpayers covered in the proceedings. It noted: • • The payments are used for the purposes of the New Zealand Church. • • The overseas missionary’s basic costs that are met by either the church in the host country or the Church in Utah were necessary to facilitate missionary work. • • The opportunity to participate in missionary service overseas is not a genuine material benefit because the missionary is performing a charitable service. • • The real benefit to missionaries serving overseas is a sense of spiritual and moral satisfaction. • • Taxpayers other than missionaries do not receive a material benefit. At most they gain the spiritual or moral satisfaction of knowing the missionary is performing a charitable service on behalf of the Church overseas. Sub Issue 2 – was there a connection between the payments made and any benefit received? The Court held there was a disconnection in fact and in law between the payments made by the taxpayers and the receipt of basic costs by a missionary serving overseas, meaning even if there was a material benefit, there was little to no connection between the payment and the benefit. The Court noted there was no legal arrangement connecting the payment by a taxpayer to the Trust Board and the payment by the church in the host country or the Church in Utah to meet the missionary’s basic costs.

Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 July 2020 Inland Revenue Department 111 LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE SUMMARIES CSUM 20/05: Taxpayer ordered by Court of Appeal to pay increased security for costs CaseDowden v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2020\] NZCA 152 Decision date8 May 2020 Legislative ReferencesCourt of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005, rr 5A and 35 Legal termsReview; Registrar decision; Security for costs; Dispensing with Security for Costs; Increased security for costs. Facts In the underlying substantive matter, the appellant, Mr John Alfred Dowden (“Mr Dowden”), appealed the High Court decision that he is liable for unpaid PAYE, GST and income tax for the period from April 2003 to November 2011 in respect of two businesses conducted by him. Mr Dowden applied for an order dispensing with security for costs for the appeal (which the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules set at $7,060). The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) cross-applied for an order increasing security for costs by $2,500 to $9,560. The Deputy Registrar declined Mr Dowden’s application and granted the Commissioner’s application. Mr Dowden then applied for review of the Deputy Registrar’s decision, which the Court of Appeal upheld. Impact The appellant must pay the security for costs by 29 May 2020 to proceed with his appeal. Issues Was the Registrar correct in deciding to: • • Decline to dispense with security for costs; and • • Order increased security for costs. Decision The Court upheld the Deputy Registrar’s decision to decline Mr Dowden’s application to dispense with security for costs. See paragraphs \[8\] – \[12\] of this judgment. Mr Dowden provided information to the Court regarding his financial circumstances. The Deputy Registrar and the Court both agreed that this information especially with regard to Mr Dowden’s liabilities other than the disputed debt to the Commissioner were not sufficient to demonstrate that he was impecunious and could not afford to pay security for costs. The Court also noted: • • Mr Dowden had not applied for legal aid and considered it appeared he would not qualify for it even if his appeal had merit; and • • It did not consider that Mr Dowden had much prospect in succeeding in his appeal. Accordingly, the Court held it would not be right to require the Commissioner to defend the judgment under appeal without the usual protection of security for costs. The Court upheld the Deputy Registrar’s decision to increase security for costs. See paragraphs \[13\] – \[14\] of this judgment. The Commissioner provided evidence of Mr Dowden failing to pay the Commissioner agreed or unchallenged debts including costs of prior proceedings. The Court accepted that these instances of past procedural misconduct meant there was clearly a high risk that Mr Dowden would not meet any costs award made against him if his appeal fails. The Court reiterated that in its view the appeal is without merit. Accordingly, setting an increased amount for security for costs was justified.
