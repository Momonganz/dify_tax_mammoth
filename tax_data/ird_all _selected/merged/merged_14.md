They aim to correct deficiencies in the current legislation and to provide guidance to both Inland Revenue and taxpayers as to the appropriate treatment of a person in debt. The effectiveness of these proposals relies on, and encourages, taxpayers to contact Inland Revenue with their debt problems as early as possible. The rules provide Inland Revenue with considerable flexibility. The outcome of early discussion is more likely to be positive, with reduced stress and cost for taxpayers. Application date The proposed amendments will apply to tax that is outstanding as at 1 July 2002 unless that tax is subject to an instalment arrangement entered into before 1 July 2002, or the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has advised the taxpayer that the outstanding tax has been written off. The proposals will apply to all taxes, and will not apply to child support and student loans. Key features The current debt and hardship provisions in sections 176 and 177 will be rewritten: • to provide that Inland Revenue’s role is to maximise the recovery of outstanding tax but not if: –recovery represents an inefficient use of Inland Revenue’s resources; or –a taxpayer is placed in serious hardship; • to provide that if Inland Revenue can collect more of the debt over time through an instalment arrangement than from bankruptcy or liquidation, Inland Revenue would be required to enter the instalment arrangement and any amount not recovered will be written off as unrecoverable; • to provide that amounts not recovered will be written off permanently, and generally cannot be reinstated; • to include fairer instalment arrangements, including provision that late payment penalties will stop when taxpayers contact Inland Revenue stating they want to negotiate payment of the debt; • to clarify the application of the rules, the definition of “serious hardship” lists both circumstances which meet that test and circumstances which do not. 4 Background The current debt and hardship rules in the Tax Administration Act date back to the 1930s. They were designed for asset-rich but cashflow-poor taxpayers of the Depression era, and were not reviewed as part of the introduction of the current compliance and penalty legislation. As a consequence, no significant consideration of their purpose or consequences was undertaken until the Finance and Expenditure Committee’s 1999 Inquiry into the Powers and Operations of the Inland Revenue Department. The current rules are significantly deficient. They provide little guidance to either taxpayers or Inland Revenue on the appropriate treatment of a person in debt. Details of the proposed reforms The rules outlined in the bill provide a framework for Inland Revenue to consider how best to provide relief for taxpayers in financial difficulties. More prescriptive administrative guidelines will be prepared, providing the necessary balance needed to ensure that taxpayers have their specific circumstances taken into account. Maximising the amount recovered Under the proposed section 176(1) Inland Revenue’s role will be to maximise the recovery of outstanding tax as this maintains both the equity and efficiency of the tax system. Under this provision Inland Revenue will be required to adopt the approach which maximises the amount collected. If Inland Revenue can collect more of the debt over time through, for example, an instalment arrangement, than from bankruptcy or liquidation, Inland Revenue will be required to enter an instalment arrangement. Any amount not covered by this instalment arrangement will be written off as unrecoverable. The specific requirement for Inland Revenue to undertake net present value calculations is being removed. However, in line with Inland Revenue’s role to maximise the amount of outstanding tax recovered when the repayment options are very similar, the net present value calculation is still likely to be used in determining which repayment option is preferable. Recognition of the administrative costs of collection of tax Recovering overdue taxes uses administrative resources. The new section 176(2)(a) will provide Inland Revenue with a clear discretion allowing for effective use of administrative resources. Debt will be written off if the administrative costs of recovering the debt outweigh the amount collected. Inland Revenue will determine when this provision will apply. In other words, taxpayers cannot write to Inland Revenue asking that a debt be written off merely because they consider that the administrative costs of collecting the debt are more than the amount that will be collected. 5 In collecting outstanding tax, Inland Revenue will also consider the effect that requiring payment will have on taxpayers who comply with all of their tax obligations. In some cases requiring payment of an amount that is equivalent to the cost of collection may encourage the taxpayer to pay promptly in future, resulting in Inland Revenue not incurring administrative costs in the future. Financial relief Under the new rules a taxpayer can contact Inland Revenue requesting financial relief. There will be two forms of financial relief: • some or all of the taxpayer’s outstanding tax may be written off; and/or • the taxpayer and Inland Revenue enter an instalment arrangement. Late payment penalties Under the new rules, late payment penalties will stop being imposed when a taxpayer contacts Inland Revenue seeking financial relief. If the taxpayer is granted financial relief, late payment penalties will not be imposed. For example, if all the taxpayer’s outstanding tax is written off, late payment penalties will not be imposed from the date the taxpayer contacted Inland Revenue to the date the tax is written off. If the taxpayer and Inland Revenue enter an instalment arrangement, late payment penalties will not be imposed if the taxpayer complies with the arrangement. If the taxpayer defaults on the arrangement, late payment penalties will start applying from the date of default. The late payment penalties previously not imposed either while the instalment arrangement was being negotiated or while the taxpayer was complying with the arrangement will not be reinstated. For example, a taxpayer contacts Inland Revenue stating that she cannot pay her outstanding tax. Inland Revenue determines that part of the amount outstanding should be written off and the other part of the amount outstanding is payable immediately. The amount payable immediately will be treated like an instalment arrangement, and late payment penalties will not be imposed from the date the taxpayer contacted Inland Revenue. If she then defaults on the amount payable immediately, late payment penalties will apply from the date of the default. The amount written off and the late payment penalties not previously imposed will not be reinstated. If a taxpayer contacts Inland Revenue saying he wishes to enter an instalment arrangement and an arrangement is not then entered into, the late payment penalties that were not imposed while the taxpayer and Inland Revenue negotiated will then be imposed as if the request to enter the arrangement had not been received. Recent amendments to the late payment penalty legislation in section 139B mean that from 1 April 2002 if a taxpayer enters an instalment arrangement before the due date for payment of the tax, the second phase of the initial late payment penalty is not imposed. These principles will also apply under the new rules that provide taxpayer financial relief. This provision provides an incentive for taxpayers to contact Inland Revenue before administrative costs are incurred. 6 Serious hardship Inland Revenue will be prevented from recovering tax if the recovery places the taxpayer in serious hardship. Recovery of a debt will continue until the point where further recovery would place a taxpayer in serious hardship. This ensures that taxpayers are not seen as being rewarded, or unduly punished, for failure to make payment. Any debt that cannot be recovered will be written off. Section 177A will define “serious hardship” to include significant financial difficulties that arise because of: • the taxpayer’s inability to meet minimum living expenses according to normal community standards; or • the cost of medical treatment for an illness or injury of the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s dependant; or • a serious illness suffered by the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s dependant; or • the cost of education for the taxpayer’s dependant. Serious hardship will not include significant financial difficulties that arise because: • the taxpayer is obligated to pay tax; or • the taxpayer may become bankrupt; or • the taxpayer’s social activities and entertainment may be limited; or • the taxpayer is unable to afford goods or services that are expensive or of a high quality or standard according to normal community standards. “Dependant” will be defined to mean within one degree of relationship (for example, husband and wife). For example, under the provision that provides that serious hardship does not include financial difficulties that arise because the taxpayer is unable to afford goods or services that are expensive or of a high quality or standard according to normal community standards, a taxpayer who sends her children to a private school would instead be required to send them to a public school. Normal community standards in this case do not extend to private schooling of dependants. Similarly, a taxpayer may be required to trade down to a car of a lesser value or rent accommodation rather than owning a house. Consideration of serious hardship will be generally limited to people. Legal entities, such as companies, cannot suffer hardship. However, the recovery of the full amount of tax from a company may cause serious hardship for a shareholder who owns, or two shareholders who jointly own, 50 percent or more of that company. The legislation will provide Inland Revenue with the discretion to “look through” the company and examine the effect of its actions on such shareholders. 7 “Write off” For clarity, the legislation will set out a number of circumstances in which tax may be genuinely written off. Inland Revenue will be able to write off tax that cannot be recovered. This provision will cover cases where: • the taxpayer is facing serious hardship; and • the administrative costs of collecting the tax are greater than the amount to be collected. In addition to those cases in which Inland Revenue considers that the outstanding tax cannot be recovered, it must write off tax that cannot be recovered in the following situations: • bankruptcy; • liquidation; or • confirmation of the distribution of a deceased taxpayer’s estate. Evasion or abusive tax position The proposed section 177C(3) will not permit the write-off of tax when the taxpayer is liable for a abusive tax position or evasion shortfall penalty in relation to that tax. This provision is aimed at ensuring that those taxpayers who take such tax positions face the entire consequences of their actions. Tax losses As part of the determination of a taxpayer’s assets, Inland Revenue will take into account the tax losses of a taxpayer. If any tax revenue is written off, Inland Revenue will have the authority to extinguish part or all of the taxpayer’s tax losses at the rate of 33% in proportion to the amount written off. For example, if a taxpayer had losses of $2000 and was facing serious hardship and had $600 of tax written off, the losses would be reduced by $1818. Inland Revenue will send the taxpayer a new notice of determination of loss. Reversal of write-off Unlike the present practice, when tax is written off under the new legislation it will be permanently written off. However, the legislation will provide for two situations where the amount written off can be reversed. The first, as set out in the discussion document, is when the amount that is written off is based on false or misleading information provided by the taxpayer. The second situation is when the taxpayer applies to have tax written off on grounds of serious hardship, and within one year of the amount being written off the taxpayer declares bankruptcy. This second situation was raised in submissions on the discussion document Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review . The submissioner was concerned that the taxpayer’s other creditors could encourage the taxpayer to have an amount owing to Inland Revenue written off so that when the 8 taxpayer subsequently declares bankruptcy the dividend paid to those other creditors was greater. The Government agreed with the concerns expressed in the submission. Instalment arrangements The recovery of most debts involves the consideration of serious hardship, the writing off of tax, or the use of Inland Revenue’s administrative resources. It also involves taxpayers trying to comply with their tax obligations but facing cashflow problems. One option, an alternative to applying whatever recovery action is considered appropriate, is for the taxpayer and Inland Revenue to enter an instalment arrangement. The amendments are aimed at providing financial relief for taxpayers facing financial difficulties, including writing off amounts outstanding when they cannot be collected and providing a clearer and more flexible instalment arrangement process which will ensure that taxpayers who are attempting to comply voluntarily can quickly resolve their problems. Taxpayers who contact Inland Revenue, either in writing or by telephone, will be able to initiate an instalment arrangement by telephone or in writing. On receipt of a request for an instalment arrangement, Inland Revenue will suspend any late payment penalties and recovery action currently under way. Any amount not recovered through an instalment arrangement will be written off as unrecoverable, either because collection would place the taxpayer in serious hardship or because recovery represents an inefficient use of Inland Revenue’s resources. Inland Revenue may overturn an instalment arrangement if the arrangement is based on information provided by the taxpayer which is later found to be misleading or fraudulent. If an arrangement is overturned, late payment penalties will apply as if the instalment arrangement had not been entered. Reasons for declining an arrangement Under the proposed section 177B(2) Inland Revenue will have the discretion to decline to enter an instalment arrangement if: • to do so does not maximise the recovery of outstanding tax from the taxpayer; • Inland Revenue considers that the taxpayer is in a position to pay all of the outstanding tax immediately; • the taxpayer is being frivolous or vexatious; • the purpose of the request for an instalment arrangement is simply to stop recovery action; • the taxpayer has not complied with a previous instalment arrangement; or • the taxpayer has previously made a request to enter into an arrangement and the request has been declined. 9 Inland Revenue must not knowingly place a taxpayer in serious hardship and must use administrative resources efficiently. These requirements will override any instalment arrangement. For example, taxpayers may consider that they can pay back the tax owed, and they may be willing to incur serious hardship to do so. Nevertheless, they should not be required to do so. Another example is where the taxpayer is initially in a position to pay but the taxpayer’s financial affairs worsen during an instalment arrangement, to the extent that serious hardship applies. At this point, part of the taxpayer’s debt would be written off and the rest would be subject to a new instalment arrangement. Response periods The amendments do not specify a time period in which Inland Revenue must respond to a request for an arrangement. If a taxpayer enters an instalment arrangement, late payment penalties will cease applying when the taxpayer contacts Inland Revenue. Ensuring a timely response can best be addressed by establishing appropriate standards as part of Inland Revenue’s annual reporting process. In circumstances where Inland Revenue requests more information or makes a counter-offer, the legislation will provide that the taxpayer should be given ten working days from the date of Inland Revenue’s response to provide any financial or other information required by Inland Revenue or consider the counter-offer. If the circumstances warrant, however, Inland Revenue will have the authority to set a longer period. If the information or response is not provided within the standard ten-day period (or the longer period set by Inland Revenue), late payment penalties will recommence as if no application had been made. If Inland Revenue and the taxpayer cannot agree as to the terms of an instalment arrangement, late payment penalties and recovery action will recommence as if no application had been made. If an agreed instalment arrangement involves Inland Revenue writing off part of a taxpayer’s outstanding tax and the taxpayer making payment of the remainder, default by the taxpayer in payment will not result in reinstatement of the amount already written off. Renegotiation of arrangements The legislation will clearly provide taxpayers with the option to renegotiate an instalment arrangement if their financial situation changes. Under the proposed section 177B(5) a renegotiation will be treated in the same manner as a request for financial relief. If taxpayers’ circumstances improve in the intervening period, resulting in them being able to repay the debt more quickly they can contact Inland Revenue and arrange to do so. Use-of-money interest, which compensates the Crown for not having the use of its money, also provides taxpayers with an incentive to repay the debt as quickly as possible. Any amount previously written off will not be reinstated merely because a taxpayer’s circumstances change. 10 If taxpayers’ circumstances change, resulting in their not being able to meet the repayment obligations under the instalment arrangement, they should contact Inland Revenue as soon as possible stating that they wish to renegotiate the arrangement. One of the clear criteria, provided by the amendments, for Inland Revenue declining an instalment arrangement is when a previous arrangement has not be adhered to, so any delay in contacting Inland Revenue may result in unfavourable consideration of future instalment arrangement applications. Inland Revenue will have an option to renegotiate an arrangement only after two years from the date the arrangement is entered. Transfers of overpaid tax 13 NEW RULES ON TRANSFERS OF OVERPAID TAX (Clauses 48(4), 61(4), (5), (7)(a) and 77) Summary of proposed amendment Comprehensive new rules governing the transfer of overpaid tax are to be inserted into the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxpayers may request a transfer to another period or tax type of the taxpayer, or to another taxpayer. The legislation sets out the effective date of transfer, which differs depending on the relationship between the transferor and the transferee. Currently, there is uncertainty about the rules relating to such transfers, and the proposed new rules should address this. Application date Subclause (2) sets out the various application dates for different types of tax. The new provisions apply to: • excess tax paid in the 2002-2003 and future years; • excess tax paid in an earlier year if the excess arises on an assessment made after enactment of the legislation; • refunds in relation to childcare and charitable donations rebates claimed after enactment of the legislation; • GST on supplies made on or after 1 April 2002; • tax deducted on behalf of another taxpayer that is paid on or after 1 April 2002; and • dividend withholding payments and duties paid on or after 1 April 2002. Key features New Part XB is being inserted into the Tax Administration Act 1994 to allow Inland Revenue, at the request of a taxpayer, to transfer tax that is overpaid by the taxpayer to another period or type of tax or to another taxpayer. Sections 173L and 173M set out the effective date of transfer, which differs depending on the relationship between the transferor and transferee. Section 173L applies to transfers to another period or type of tax of the same taxpayer. When there is a transfer of excess tax that was paid directly to Inland Revenue by the taxpayer (such as provisional tax or tax deducted on behalf of another taxpayer), the date of transfer is any date chosen by the taxpayer that comes after the date of overpayment of the tax. In the case of a transfer of a GST refund or tax deducted at source on behalf of the taxpayer, it is any date after the first day after the end of the taxable period, or income year respectively. 14 Section 173M applies to transfers to other taxpayers. In the case of a transfer to associated taxpayers listed in subsections (2)(a) – (e) and (3), the same date of transfer as described in the previous paragraph will apply. In the case of all other transfers, the date of transfer is a date chosen by the taxpayer but no earlier than the later of the date of the transfer request and the date of filing of the relevant return. Background There is uncertainty about the rules relating to transfers of excess tax because there are no comprehensive rules relating to such transfers in the revenue Acts. Proposals for new rules to legislate for transfers were set out in the discussion document Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review , issued in August 2001. The legislation is essentially in the same terms as the proposals. Detailed analysis Application New section 173K sets out the circumstances in which the new transfer rules will apply, and the effect of the rules. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue is authorised to transfer excess tax at the request of the taxpayer. “Tax” includes all taxes, levies and duties included in the definition of “tax” in section 3. In addition, it specifically includes rebates for childcare and charitable donations (new paragraph (ca) of the definition). The section applies only to tax that is refundable. This means, in the case of income tax, that it will not apply when the company’s imputation credit account has insufficient credits and the amount is retained by the Commissioner under sections MD 2 or MD 3 of the Income Tax Act. The new rules also do not apply if the Commissioner offsets the excess against an outstanding tax liability under section MD 1(3) of the Income Tax Act. That provision overrides the new rules. Tax should not be available for transfer to another taxpayer if the taxpayer has an outstanding tax liability. The amount transferred is treated as a refund to the transferor. So, for example, a corporate transferor should record the amount transferred as a refund in its imputation credit account. The amount transferred is tax paid by the transferee on the date of transfer for all purposes except the imposition of shortfall penalties. Therefore when tax is transferred by taxpayer A to satisfy an unpaid tax liability of taxpayer B as at the due date of the tax, any accrued use-of-money interest and late payment penalties in relation to the underpayment will be cancelled. 15 Transfers within a taxpayer’s own accounts Section 173L applies to requests by a taxpayer for a transfer to another period or to another type of tax of the same taxpayer. Taxpayers may choose the date on which the excess is to be transferred, provided it is after the dates set out in the section. In relation to GST refunds and tax deducted at source on behalf of a taxpayer, the transfer can be made only after the end of the taxable period or income year respectively. In relation to taxes that are paid directly to Inland Revenue (for example, provisional and terminal tax, taxes deducted on behalf of another taxpayer, and duties), the transfer can be made at any time after the date the tax is paid. Allowing taxpayers to choose the date of transfer, subject to these limitations, enables them to choose a date that is most advantageous for them. The effect of a transfer at this date is that taxpayers can transfer overpaid tax to another period or type of tax at the earliest opportunity to reduce use-of-money interest on underpaid tax. This should mean that taxpayers are not charged use-of- money interest (currently at 11.93%) in relation to an underpayment over the same period that they are also receiving use-of-money interest at a lower rate (currently 4.83%) in relation to an overpayment. Example 1 In September 2002, A is assessed in relation to her 2001-2002 income year and discovers she has overpaid tax. She has in the meantime paid her first provisional tax instalment for the 2002-2003 year on 7 July 2002, using the standard uplift method. However, she is now concerned that that amount will not be sufficient and a use-of- money interest liability will arise. She requests Inland Revenue to transfer the excess as at 7 July, which it does. Transfer to certain listed associated taxpayers Section 173M applies to transfers to other taxpayers. If the transfer is between certain listed associated taxpayers, the date of transfer is the same as that applying to transfers within a taxpayer’s own accounts (see the previous commentary on section 173L). This applies to transfers between: • companies in the same group (that is, companies that are at least 66 percent commonly owned); • a shareholder employee and company; • partners in the same partnership; • family members within one degree of relationship (husband/wife, parent/child); and • a family trust and a beneficiary. 16 Because tax can be transferred between these taxpayers generally at the date of overpayment, a transfer may offset unpaid tax liabilities and cancel use-of-money interest and late payment penalties of the transferee. The taxpayers eligible for this treatment fall into one of two categories. They either are, or consider themselves to be, one economic entity, or they share in an income stream and allocate income amongst themselves after the end of the year. It is not appropriate for all transfers to other taxpayers to be made at this date. This would result in high administrative costs on Inland Revenue, as it would need to field and action transfer requests and reissue statements of account to reflect the transfers and resulting cancelled interest and late payment penalties. This increases the complexity of the tax system. To allow all transfers to cancel accrued use-of-money interest and late payment penalties of the transferee also undermines the incentive for individuals to pay the right amount of tax on time. Example 2 A Co estimates its provisional tax and paid provisional tax of $120,000 at each instalment date for the 2002-2003 year (7 July and 7 November 2002 and 7 March 2003). In May 2003 A Co files its return, which shows that its residual income tax is $300,000 for the year. It has therefore overpaid tax of $20,000 at each instalment date. B Co is in the same group as A Co, being 66 percent commonly owned. B Co underestimated its first provisional tax instalment at 7 July 2002 by $20,000 and has incurred use-of-money interest on the underpayment. A Co therefore requests Inland Revenue to transfer the $20,000 excess tax paid on 7 July to B Co as at that date. A Co has no outstanding tax liability, and its imputation credit account has sufficient credits, so Inland Revenue actions the transfer at the date requested. The amount transferred is treated as a refund to A Co. It therefore records a debit of $20,000 in its imputation credit account. The amount transferred is tax paid by B Co, which records a credit in its imputation credit account. Use-of-money interest that has accrued in relation to B Co’s underpayment is cancelled. All other transfers Section 173M(4)(b) sets out the effective date for all other transfers. Again, taxpayers can choose the effective date but it must be no earlier than the later of the date of the request and the day after the relevant return is filed. This is broadly a proxy for the date of processing the transfer request. Example 3 In July 2005, A Co’s 2002-2003 return is reassessed. The reassessment results in excess tax which A Co requests Inland Revenue to transfer to unrelated company B Co. B Co underpaid its provisional tax in the 2002-2003 year, incurring a use-of- money interest liability. A Co cannot transfer its excess to B Co retrospectively. The date of transfer must be no earlier than the later of the date of the request (July 2005) and the date the relevant return was filed (May 2003). A Co therefore decides not to transfer the excess and Inland Revenue refunds it. 17 The date of request is the date on which the taxpayer requests the transfer of that particular excess. So, if in example 3, A Co had calculated in its 2002-2003 return that it had overpaid tax and requested in May 2003 that the excess be transferred, this is not the relevant date of request in relation to the excess arising on reassessment. Transfer of a rebate for childcare or charitable donations Section 173N provides that a rebate for childcare or charitable donations can be transferred only at the later of the date of the request and the date on which the taxpayer applies for the refund. It cannot be transferred at an earlier date because no use-of-money interest is payable in relation to these rebates. Therefore the rebate should not be transferable to another type of tax or another taxpayer so that use-of- money interest, in effect, becomes payable on it. Example 4 A makes a charitable donation in the 2002-2003 year and claims a refund in December 2003. A’s husband underpaid his provisional tax on 7 July 2003. A therefore requests in a letter attached to the claim form that the refund be transferred to her husband as at 7 July 2003 in order to minimise use-of-money interest on the underpayment. Inland Revenue will transfer the excess only as at December 2003. Excess tax retained by Commissioner because ICA has insufficient credits A new section MD 2(5A) is being inserted into the Income Tax Act as an adjunct to the amendments relating to transfers of excess tax at the request of a taxpayer. Section MD 2(5) applies when income tax paid in excess is not refunded to a corporate taxpayer because its imputation credit account has insufficient credits. Instead, it is retained and applied in payment of tax that is payable by the company. It is not clear that the excess can be credited as at a date on which there is no liability to pay provisional tax but from which use-of-money interest applies in relation to underpaid residual income tax. The amendment clarifies that the excess can be credited as at that date. Further tax simplification measures 21 OVERVIEW The bill introduces a number of amendments aimed at further simplifying the tax system and reducing compliance costs for taxpayers. Compliance costs range from the money and time value of complying with tax obligations (such as completing income tax returns) to the stress that comes from not being certain whether all the tax rules have been met correctly, or even what they are. It is expected that the amendments will reduce compliance costs for taxpayers by: • removing the need to file income tax returns on behalf of deceased taxpayers and for small amounts of income from which tax has not been withheld; • simplifying family assistance by better targeting the payment of the family tax credit and aligning the process for determining family assistance entitlements with the general income tax rules; • removing the need for companies to file multiple imputation returns in order to receive refunds of income tax; • reducing the risk of use-of-money interest applying for more provisional taxpayers; • making it easier for banks and other interest payers to communicate resident withholding tax information to their customers; and • not requiring small businesses to value and make adjustments for small amounts of trading stock at the end of the year. These initiatives were presented in a Government discussion document on tax simplification, More time for business , released in May 2001. The document, while primarily aimed at reducing tax-related compliance costs and risks for small businesses, put forward a wide-ranging set of tax simplification proposals. Some of the ideas contained in More time for business that were supported by submissions are being implemented as part of the Government’s continuing tax simplification programme. 22 NON-FILING FOR DECEASED TAXPAYERS (Clauses 63(3), 63(6) and 64) Summary of proposed amendment The bill removes the requirement for a return to be filed or an income statement requested on behalf of a deceased taxpayer in respect of income earned in the income year in which the death occurred. The amendment will apply if the deceased taxpayer would have been able to use the non-filing provisions (that is, would not have been required to file a return or request an income statement) were he or she alive. The amendment will also apply to executors and administrators of deceased taxpayers’ estates. This is a tax simplification measure designed to reduce stress for the families of deceased taxpayers and compliance costs for executors and administrators. Application date The amendment will apply from the start of the 2002-03 income year. Key features Section 33A(2)(l) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is being repealed as it excludes deceased taxpayers from the non-filing provisions in section 33A(1). Section 43(4) is being replaced to ensure that the executors and administrators of a deceased taxpayer’s estate are also able to apply the non-filing provisions. However, had the deceased taxpayer been a person to whom the Commissioner of Inland Revenue would have issued an income statement or who would have otherwise been required to request one, the same responsibility will vest with the executor or administrator. A new section 43(5) is being added to allow executors and administrators of the estates of deceased taxpayers who are to be covered by the non-filing provisions to request income statements on their behalf if so desired. Background Taxpayers who are eligible not to file income tax returns or receive income statements are required to have returns furnished or income statements requested on their behalf in respect of income earned in an income year if they die in that year. Equally, the executors and administrators of a deceased taxpayer’s estate are not eligible to apply the non-filing provisions. 23 The amendment will reduce compliance costs for executors and trustees of deceased persons’ estates which often involves only very small amounts of income, if any, and income that generally has already had tax deducted at source (for example, interest and dividend income). The compliance costs incurred in determining whether a deceased taxpayer had a tax file number, obtaining the relevant source documents, filing a return or requesting an income statement and going through the time- consuming process of waiting for the part-year assessment to be confirmed often outweigh the tax consequences of filing. The amendment will also reduce the stress placed on families of deceased taxpayers from having to comply with tax obligations at a difficult time. 24 $200 THRESHOLD FOR RETURNING INCOME FROM WHICH TAX HAS NOT BEEN WITHHELD (Clauses 63(2) and 63(5)) Summary of proposed amendment Taxpayers with small amounts of income from which tax has not been withheld will no longer be required to return it. The amendment will apply if the value of this income is $200 or less, before any allowable deductions. This tax simplification measure will reduce compliance costs associated with returning small amounts of non-withheld income as well as the risk of penalties applying for not returning the income. Application date The amendment will apply from the start of the 2002-03 income year. Key features Section 33A(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is being amended to include a $200 gross income threshold for income from which tax has not been withheld, under which a taxpayer does not need to return this income. Background There is currently a $200 gross income threshold for withholding income from which tax has not been correctly withheld during the year, under which taxpayers are not required to request an income statement or file a return to reconcile the errors. A similar threshold is required for income from which tax has not been withheld as taxpayers with small amounts of such income often incur compliance costs disproportionate to the amount of the income in order to return it. And if they do not return this income, taxpayers may be subject to penalties and interest. The amendment will remove the risk of penalties and interest applying if a taxpayer earns $200 or less of income during the year, from which tax has not been withheld, and does not return that income. 25 FAMILY TAX CREDIT TO BE PAID TO THE PRINCIPAL CAREGIVER (Clause 42) Summary of proposed amendment The family tax credit is to be paid to the principal caregiver instead of both spouses in a two-parent family. This will allow payment of the family tax credit to be better targeted and will reduce compliance costs associated with applying for and reconciling family assistance. Application date This amendment will apply from the start of the 2003-04 income year to allow time for communicating the changes to recipients. Key features Section KD 3(4) of the Income Tax Act 1994 is being amended to allow the family tax credit to be paid to the principal caregiver, as defined in section OB 1. Background The family tax credit guarantees a minimum family income of $15,080, after tax, for families in which at least one spouse is in paid employment – that is, working for salary and wages. The amendment will allow better targeting of family assistance to the person with the primary responsibility for the day-to-day care of a child or children. It will also reduce compliance costs associated with the family assistance application process, as only one spouse will need to complete an application form and have a bank account to receive family assistance payments. The amendment will also simplify the end-of-year square-up, where family assistance recipients must complete a declaration and reconcile family assistance payments made during the year with income earned. The end-of-year reconciliation will be limited to only one spouse, which will allow the administration of family assistance to be further simplified. 26 ADJUSTMENTS REQUIRED FOR FAMILY ASSISTANCE PURPOSES TO BE REMOVED (Clause 41) Summary of proposed amendment The determination of family assistance entitlements is to be simplified by removing the need to make a number of complex adjustments when calculating them. The adjustments move the assessment of family assistance from a taxable income basis more towards a welfare definition of “income”. The amendment is designed to align the family assistance rules with the general income tax rules, thereby reducing compliance costs associated with making the necessary adjustments for family assistance. It will also reduce the risk of family assistance debt resulting from incorrect application of adjustments. Application date This amendment will apply from the start of the 2003-04 income year to allow time for communicating the changes to recipients. Key features Section KD 1(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994 is being amended as follows: • Certain exempt income for taxable income purposes, such as interest from Post Office Development Bonds, scholarships and bursaries is to remain exempt for family assistance purposes as well. • Deposits to income equalisation and adverse event income equalisation accounts are to be treated as allowable deductions and refunds from these accounts as income for family assistance purposes. • If a taxpayer spreads income to future or preceding income years, this income is to be realised in those years for family assistance purposes (not solely in the year in which payment is received). • Depreciation claimed on buildings is to be treated as an allowable deduction and amounts derived from the sale of buildings as income for family assistance purposes. • Development expenditure relating to agriculture, farming, forestry and aquaculture that is deductible on a taxable income basis is to be treated as an allowable deduction for family assistance purposes as well. 27 Background The tax system uses taxable income for assessing tax, and the benefit system uses a welfare definition of income for assessing benefits. The definition of income for family assistance purposes is a compromise between the tax and welfare definitions. For example, a current-year business loss can be offset against a family’s other income for tax purposes but the offset is disallowed for family assistance purposes. In the calculation of family assistance entitlements, certain types of income that may be exempt for income tax purposes are not for family assistance purposes and vice versa. Similarly, certain allowable deductions under the general income tax rules are not allowed for family assistance. The adjustment process is undertaken when the family applies for or renews family assistance and is also part of the end-of-year square-up process The amendment will bring family assistance more into line with the general income tax rules, thereby reducing compliance costs associated with providing the necessary information to Inland Revenue, making the requisite adjustments and, most importantly, getting the adjustments right. The amendment will also reduce the risk of overpayments (and therefore end-of-year tax debt) resulting from the incorrect application of adjustments. It is expected that a significant number of taxpayers will benefit from reducing the number of instances in which family assistance applicants have to turn their mind to whether they received income or incurred expenditure that forms part of the adjustments for family assistance purposes. This will also reduce the complexity of family assistance applications. For example, the family assistance application form, which currently has to cover all of the adjustments, can be simplified. Detailed analysis The amendment relates to the following adjustments: Exempt income (Clauses 41(1) and 41(8)) Section KD 1(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1994 is being amended to remove the requirement to add back to income for family assistance purposes: • interest from Post Office National Development Bonds or New Zealand Savings Certificates; • interest on any farm vendor finance bond or in respect of any farm vendor mortgage; and • any amount of a scholarship or bursary paid in respect of attendance at an educational institution. This income is exempt under sections CB 1(1)(a) and (c) and CB 9(d) respectively. 28 The requirement to add back to income for family assistance purposes any alimony, spousal maintenance and child support payments received (within the meaning of section CB 9(a)) and the amount of any overseas pension (within the meaning of section CB 5(1)(f)) is to remain. Income equalisation accounts (Clauses 41(2), 41(3) and 41(7) to 41(9)) Section KD 1(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1994 is being amended to include deposits to an income equalisation account and adverse event income equalisation account, under sections EI 3 and EI 13 respectively, as allowable deductions for family assistance purposes. The amendment will apply to deposits made in the 2003-04 and subsequent income years. Consequently, section KD 1(1)(c)(iii) is being repealed on the first day of the 2003-04 income year. Refunds from income equalisation and adverse event income equalisation accounts, under sections EI 4, EI 5, EI 7, EI 9 and EI 14 and EI 15, respectively are to be gross income for family assistance purposes from the 2003-04 income year. However, if the refunds relate to deposits that have not been allowed as a deduction for family assistance purposes they will not be gross income. To that effect, sections KD 1(1)(e)(i) and (vi) are being amended so that refunds from income equalisation and adverse event income equalisation accounts in the 2003-04 and subsequent income years are not gross income if the deposits to which those refunds relate have not been allowed as a deduction for family assistance purposes. This will apply to deposits to income equalisation and adverse event income equalisation accounts before the 2003-04 income year. Spreading income (Clauses 41(3), 41(5), 41(8) to 41(9)) Section KD 1(1)(d) of the Income Tax Act 1994 is being repealed. The provision requires certain income that is allowed to be spread to future or preceding income years, for taxable income purposes, to be wholly realised in the income year in which payment is received for family assistance purposes. With repeal, the following types of income will be allowed to be realised, for family assistance purposes, in each of the spread income years: • remission of specified suspensory loans deemed to be gross income and allowed to be spread over the income year of remission and two succeeding years under section DC 2; • income derived from the sale or other disposition of timber that is allowed to be spread over the income year in which payment is received and a maximum of three preceding years under section EJ 1; • compensation for scrapie deemed to be gross income and allowed to be spread over the years in which stock was exterminated under section EJ 2; • income derived from assignment of or grant of interest in copyright that is allowed to be spread over the income year in which payment is received and a maximum of two preceding years under section EN 3; and 29 • income derived from the acquisition of land by the Crown that is allowed to be spread over the income year in which payment is received and three subsequent years under section EN 4. A consequential amendment is being made to section KD 1(1)(e)(ii) so that income that is allowed to be spread to future income years for taxable income purposes, but is realised wholly in an income year before 2003-04 for family assistance purposes, is not realised in those future years. For example, income from the sale of land to the Crown, if received in the 2001-02 income year would, under the current family assistance rules, be gross income in that year but not in any of the three subsequent years to which that income is allowed to be spread. Once the relevant amendment is enacted however, from the 2003-04 income year the opposite can occur. Given that the potential spread will fall into the 2003-04 and 2004-05 income years, unless otherwise exempted, the income received and fully accounted for in 2001-02 will also need to be incrementally accounted for in the 2003-04 and 2004-05 income years. The consequential amendment deals with this potential double accounting of income for family assistance purposes by exempting spreading income accounted for in an income year before 2003-04. Sections KD 1(1)(e)(iii), (iv) and (viii) are being repealed, as they are redundant. Depreciation on buildings (Clauses 41(2), 41(3), 41(6), 41(8) and 41(9)) Depreciation claimed on a building is being allowed as a deduction for family assistance purposes in the 2003-04 and subsequent income years. Section KD 1(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1994 is being amended to reflect this and, consequently, section KD 1(1)(c)(i) is being repealed from the start of the 2003-04 income year. Conversely, any amount derived from the sale of a building (under section EG 19) is being treated as gross income for family assistance purposes in the 2003-04 and subsequent income years. Section EG 19 requires any depreciation allowed as a deduction to be added back to income upon the disposition of depreciable property. However, when depreciation claimed on a building has not been allowed as a deduction for family assistance purposes these amounts will not have to be added back to income upon the sale of that building. A consequential amendment is therefore being made to section KD 1(1)(e)(v) to ensure that when depreciation on a building has been claimed before the 2003-04 income year (but not allowed as a deduction in those years), the amount of any depreciation before 2003-04 is not added back to income for family assistance purposes if that building is sold in the 2003-04 or a subsequent income year. Development expenditure (Clauses 41(3) and 41(9)) Section KD 1(1)(c)(ii) of the Income Tax Act 1994 is being repealed as it denies a deduction for any development expenditure relating to agriculture, farming, forestry and aquaculture. A deduction for taxable income purposes is allowed for these expenditures under sections DL 2, DO 3 to DO 5 and DZ 2 to DZ 4 respectively. 30 REMOVAL OF INTERIM IMPUTATION RETURN REQUIREMENTS (Clauses 48(1), 48(2), 48(3) and 48(5)) Summary of proposed amendment Companies with credit balances in their imputation credit accounts will be allowed to have these amounts refunded once they have filed an imputation return for that imputation year. This tax simplification measure will remove the requirement for multiple imputation returns to be filed in certain circumstances before income tax refunds can be released. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2002 to refunds of income tax paid on or after this date. Key features A new section MD 2(1A) is being added to the Income Tax Act 1994 so that a company is eligible to be refunded income tax to the value of the credit balance of its imputation credit account on the last day of the imputation year for which an imputation return has been furnished. Background The dividend imputation system allows companies to pass on to their shareholders credits for income tax they have paid in New Zealand. This allows shareholders to get the benefit of the income tax the company has paid. Tax credits available for transfer may alternatively be refunded on receipt of a return for the relevant imputation year. If a company has passed on imputation credits to its shareholders in one year and in the following year is entitled to a refund of income tax paid in the earlier year, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue would, if the company has a nil or debit balance in its imputation credit account, effectively be refunding an amount which has already been passed on by way of credits to shareholders. There is, therefore, a limit on the amount of income tax that may be refunded: the amount must not exceed the credit balance in the imputation credit account as at the end of the previous imputation year. Every company must complete an annual imputation return at the end of every imputation year and furnish it either as part of its income tax return or as a separate return. 31 A company that is allowed an extension of time, up to the end of the following imputation year, to file an imputation return may also have to file an “interim” imputation return before any income tax can be refunded. The “interim” return relates to the company's imputation credit account balance in the extension of time period. These returns are technically redundant and removing this requirement should reduce compliance costs for businesses. Detailed analysis Under section MD 2(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994, an imputation credit account company entitled to a refund of income tax must provide an imputation return for the most recently ending imputation year (year ending 31 March for all taxpayers) before this refund can be released. This creates problems for companies that have extension of time arrangements for filing their returns. For example, a company with a 31 March balance date can file its returns including its annual imputation return up to one year after the income year to which the returns relate. So if the income tax and imputation returns relate to the 2001-02 income / imputation year, the company will have until 31 March 2003 to file its returns for that year. In turn, these returns will not be processed until the beginning of the 2003-04 income year, by which time, under section MD 2(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994 an “interim” imputation return must also be filed for the 2002-03 imputation year before any refund of income tax (relating to the 2001-02 imputation year) can be released. The amendment will be a proviso to section MD 2(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994, allowing income tax to be refunded if there is a credit balance in a company’s imputation credit account at the end of a relevant imputation year, without the need for another imputation return to be provided for the following imputation year, if the original return is filed before the end of that following year. Companies would still have incentives to ensure that their imputation credit accounts do not shift from a credit balance to a debit balance in the interim. A debit balance at the end of an imputation year would arise if income tax refunded exceeds the credit balance in the imputation credit account. This amount is treated as further income tax to pay and an imputation penalty tax of 10% of the amount is also imposed. 32 GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN COMMUNICATING RESIDENT WITHHOLDING TAX INFORMATION (Clauses 62 and 65) Summary of proposed amendment Interest payers are to have greater flexibility in how they communicate resident withholding tax (RWT) information to interest earners, including greater control over the format of RWT deduction certificates and how these certificates are to be provided. This measure is designed to simplify RWT information requirements for banks and other interest payers by allowing communication of RWT information through existing customer interfaces and electronic means. The threshold for providing an RWT deduction certificate is also to be increased from $20 to $50 of gross withholding income. Application date The amendment to simplify RWT information requirements for interest payers will apply from 1 April 2002 to all RWT deduction certificates provided on or after this date that relate to withholding income earned and tax deducted in the 2001-02 and subsequent income years. The amendment to increase the RWT notification threshold from $20 to $50 will apply from the 2002-03 income year, in relation to withholding income earned and tax deducted in that and subsequent income years. Key features Section 25 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is being amended to: • remove the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s prescription as to the form of RWT deduction certificates; • require RWT deduction certificates to provide the interest earner with the amounts of withholding income earned, the amounts of RWT deducted, the year to which the income and tax deductions relate and whether the withholding income is interest or specified dividends; • allow interest payers to furnish RWT deduction certificates electronically, if an interest earner agrees to this; and • increase the RWT notification threshold from $20 to $50 of gross withholding income under which a RWT deduction certificate does not need to be provided to an interest earner. Consequential amendments are being made to section 51 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 33 Background Interest payers (generally banks and other financial institutions) are required to provide RWT deduction certificates to interest earners in respect of the withholding income earned and RWT deducted from that income, in a given income year. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue is required to approve the form of RWT deduction certificates – that is, what information is to be provided and how. This requirement does not take into account technological changes in the financial services industry that have made customer contact more readily achievable by electronic means. Nor does it take account of the fact that most interest payers can provide RWT information using existing customer interfaces instead of as a separate document at the end of each income year. The amendment will allow banks and other interest payers to use these interfaces to communicate RWT information to interest earners. Interest payers have commented in submissions that new media for communicating RWT information could include bank and financial statements, e-mail and interest payers’ web sites. The amendment will reduce the compliance costs imposed on interest payers from not being able to provide RWT information in a manner that is consistent with other communications with their customers. Detailed analysis Section 25(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is being amended to remove the requirement for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to approve the form of RWT deduction certificates. The amendment will reduce compliance costs associated with providing prescriptive and inflexible RWT deduction certificates to interest earners. Although the Commissioner’s approval will no longer be required for RWT deduction certificates, the information provided will still need to comply with the legislation and be reasonably accessible to interest earners. Changes are also being made to the content of RWT deduction certificates. Interest payers have indicated that the cost of communicating RWT information could be minimised by reducing the information that needs to be provided under section 25(6) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The information that is of most importance to interest earners would seem to be the amount of withholding income earned in an income year, the RWT deducted, and the type of withholding income. Section 25(6) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is, therefore, being amended to require that only this information be provided in RWT deduction certificates. The amendment will ensure that the information required by interest earners for use in their tax affairs is still provided but at lower compliance costs to interest payers. Section 25(7) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is being amended to raise from $20 to $50 the withholding income threshold under which a RWT deduction certificate does not need to be provided. 34 Section 25(10) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is being amended to allow RWT information to be provided electronically. At present, RWT deduction certificates must be provided either in person or by post to interest earners, which specifically excludes any electronic medium of provision. The amendment will allow interest payers to provide RWT information to interest earners using an electronic format such as a web site if interest earners agree to receive their RWT information in this way and know that the information is available electronically. Consequential amendments are being made to section 51 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Under section 51 interest payers are required to provide an RWT deduction reconciliation statement to Inland Revenue in respect of withholding income paid out and RWT deducted in a relevant income year. Interest payers are also required to attach copies of all RWT deduction certificates provided to interest earners that relate to that income year. With the amendment to section 25(6) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, interest payers will no longer have to provide ancillary information such as the name of the interest earner or the person’s Inland Revenue number in RWT deduction certificates. While this information is not particularly useful to interest earners, Inland Revenue uses it for cross-matching taxpayer information. Under the proposed amendments this will be even more important for administrative purposes. For example, if a taxpayer is audited, the onus will be on Inland Revenue to confirm that any withholding income assessed or declared relates to that taxpayer. The amendment to section 51 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will ensure that Inland Revenue still receives the relevant taxpayer-specific RWT information from interest payers for each income year. The information will have to be provided in a form that is acceptable to the Commissioner of Inland to comply with Inland Revenue’s existing RWT reconciliation processes. For interest payers, this will simply mean continuing with current RWT information reconciliation practices in terms of the information provided to Inland Revenue and how it is provided. 35 RAISING THE USE-OF-MONEY INTEREST THRESHOLD (Clauses 72, 55(17) and 55(29)) Summary of proposed amendment The threshold under which a provisional taxpayer is not subject to the use-of-money interest rules is to be increased from $30,000 to $35,000 of residual income tax. This will reduce the risk of having to pay use-of-money interest for more provisional taxpayers. Application date The amendment will apply from the start of the 2003-04 income year to allow time for operational implementation. Key features Section 120K(4)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is being amended to increase from $30,000 to $35,000 the residual income tax threshold under which the use-of- money interest rules do not apply. A consequential amendment is being made in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 in the definition of “new provisional taxpayer” to increase the threshold for becoming a provisional taxpayer accordingly. Background Provisional taxpayers who are individuals and who calculate their provisional tax using a previous year’s residual income tax liability plus an uplift of 5 percent are eligible to be removed from the application of the use-of-money interest rules if their residual income tax liability in the current income year is less than $30,000. The amendment will increase this maximum to $35,000. This “safe harbour” from use-of-money interest exists to mitigate the fact that many taxpayers find the provisional tax rules hard to understand and difficult to comply with. Increasing the threshold should reduce the risk of having to pay use-of-money interest and provide greater certainty for a larger number of provisional taxpayers. 36 NO VALUATION REQUIRED FOR TRADING STOCK LESS THAN $5,000 (Clauses 22, 55(23) and 55(32)) Summary of proposed amendment Taxpayers who reasonably estimate that they have less than $5,000 worth of trading stock at the end of an income year are to be allowed not to value it or include any change in the value in their calculation of income. The amendment will apply to taxpayers that have taxable supplies for GST purposes of less than $1.3 million in an income year. This tax simplification measure will reduce compliance costs and the risk of penalties for taxpayers with small amounts of trading stock at the end of the year. Application date The amendment will apply from the start of the 2002-03 income year. Key features A new section EE 2A is being added to the Income Tax Act 1994 to allow taxpayers with taxable supplies for GST purposes of less than $1.3 million to use the value of their opening stock as the value of closing stock if they reasonably estimate their closing stock to be less than $5,000. Background Under the trading stock valuation rules, trading stock must be valued regardless of how little stock is held or how small the change in value is over the year. The amendment will reduce compliance costs associated with valuing and making adjustments for small amounts of trading stock at the end of the year. It will also reduce the risk of penalties and interest applying for not valuing trading stock less than $5,000 accurately. Other policy changes 39 UNIT TRUSTS: EXCESS IMPUTATION CREDITS (Clause 5) Summary of proposed amendment A proposed amendment will ensure that when unit trust managers redeem units with the unit trust in the ordinary course of their business, they will not obtain excess imputation credits when the dividend received merely reflects their purchase cost of the units. This is a revenue protection measure announced by the Government on 6 November. It is designed to prevent unit trust managers using section CF 2(15) to achieve an unintended windfall gain. Application date This amendment will apply retrospectively from 1 April 1996, the date the current unit trust manager rules were put in place. The amendment will not apply, however, to unit trust managers who claimed a credit of tax for the imputation credits in a return of income or by using the disputes procedures in Part IVA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 before 6 November 2001 (the date of announcement of the proposed amendment). This savings provision applies only in respect of transactions before 6 November 2001. Key features A new section CF 7A is being introduced into the Income Tax Act 1994. Its purpose is to ensure that when a unit trust manager redeems units with the unit trust in the ordinary course of his or her business, the dividend derived by the manager (and anyone nominated by the manager) does not include any imputation credits attached to the dividend if it constitutes a recovery of the purchase price. For the purposes of certainty, where this provision applies, section FC 3 of the Income Tax Act will not apply. As the example in the next section illustrates, this ensures that unit trust managers do not gain excess imputation credits following the simple redemption of units. Background Investors in unit trusts often dispose of their units by selling them back to the unit trust manager at market value. The manager then redeems them at the same time with the unit trust. This is usually a straightforward operation in which the manager does not make a cash gain or loss. 40 The unit trust manager is considered to receive taxable dividend income to the extent that the amount received on redemption exceeds the original amount the redeemed units were issued for. The unit trust generally attaches imputation credits to the dividend. Some unit trust managers consider that section CF 2(15) of the Income Tax Act 1994 applies to such transactions. That section reduces the gross income of a taxpayer by the amount of any dividend (excluding imputation credits). If the unit trust manager has made no cash gain or loss, applying section CF 2(15) following redemption with the unit trust gives rise to excess imputation credits for the unit trust manager. Managers are using these excess imputation credits to offset the tax on their other income. Excess imputation credits in this situation are inconsistent with the economic reality of the transaction and would provide an unintended windfall gain to the unit trust manager. Example of use of section CF 2(15) The following example illustrates how excess imputation credits can arise when section CF 2(15) is applied. It also shows that the effect of the proposed amendment is to ensure that the dividend does not include the imputation credits. 1.X purchases 100 units from the trustees of a unit trust at $1 a unit – that is, the original cost or available subscribed capital. 2.X later redeems the 100 units with the unit trust manager for their market value of $1.20 per unit. (Strictly speaking, X sells to the unit trust manager.) 3.The unit trust manager then redeems the units with the trustees of the unit trust at $1.20 per unit. Full imputation credits of $10 are attached to the dividend portion of the redemption. 4.The consideration received by the unit trust manager is $120. Applying section CF 2(15), the gross “sale” proceeds of the unit trust manager is the consideration reduced by the amount of any dividends (exclusive of any imputation credits) – $120 received on redemption minus the $20 dividend = $100 gross “sale” proceeds. 5.Adding back the dividend received (inclusive of imputation credits), the gross income of the unit trust manager is $130. Deducting the $120 cost of the units gives rise to taxation of $3.30 on $10 net income and excess imputation credits of $6.70. These can be converted to a $20 tax loss for the unit trust manager, even though the economic effect of the transaction is that the unit trust manager has neither a cash gain nor a loss. 41 ProblemProposed solution Consideration received for cancellation of units$120.00$120.00 Less dividend portion exclusive of credits20.0020.00 Therefore gross “sale” proceeds100.00100.00 Plus dividend (including imputation credits) 30.0020.00 Gross income of unit trust manager130.00120.00 Less manager’s cost of units 120.00 120.00 Net income 10.00 0.00 Taxation thereon3.300.00 Less imputation credits10.00 0.00 Surplus imputation credits 6.70 0.00 Losses created from surplus imputation credits20.00 0.00 42 PENSIONS PAID BY PARTNERSHIPS (Clauses 13, 14, 16 and 29) Summary of proposed amendment The law is being clarified to ensure that pensions paid by partnerships to former partners are deductible for tax purposes, thus removing uncertainty on the matter. Application date The amendment will apply from the beginning of the 2000-2001 income year. Key features New section DF 8A of the Income Tax Act 1994 provides a deduction for a pension paid by a partnership to a retired partner or a surviving spouse. The deduction will be allowed if the partnership paying the pension operates the same business as the partnership to which the retired partner belonged. For the deduction to be allowed, the pension: • must be payable as of right under a deed; • must be in consideration for past services; and • must be for life or a fixed period. It can be paid to a surviving spouse on the same terms (for life or for a fixed period) or until any remarriage. The partner involved must also have retired from the partnership and the partnership must not be an investment partnership. A consequential amendment to section FF 17 ensures that the deduction is not disturbed if part of the pension is paid to a former spouse under a matrimonial agreement or order. Background Although there is uncertainty about whether pensions paid by partnerships to former partners and surviving spouses are deductible for tax purposes, there is no doubt that such pensions are taxable in the recipient’s hands. From a policy perspective, therefore, the pensions should be deductible, and the amendment clarifies the law. 43 TRANSFERS OF HOLIDAY PAY (Clauses 9, 15 and 18) Summary of proposed amendment The law is being clarified to remove uncertainty as to the treatment of wage-related provisions when a business is sold and employees are transferred. Under the proposed change, when a business is sold and employees are transferred, the vendor will be able to obtain a deduction for any wage-related provisions transferred, such as holiday pay, at the time the business is transferred. If a sale of a business is between associated persons, the vendor will not qualify for a deduction but the purchaser will be able to claim deductions for amounts that would have been deductible had the business not been sold, as they are paid. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features New section DF 10 of the Income Tax Act 1994 will allow a deduction to the vendor of a business for the value of wage-related liabilities transferred to the new owner, whether those liabilities are contingent or actual, as long as certain conditions are met. Provisions that could qualify for the deduction include those for holiday pay, long service leave, retiring allowances and redundancy payments. The deduction will be allowed at the time the business is transferred. Conditions that must be met are: • the vendor and the purchaser must agree the quantum of the wage-related provisions transferred; and • the vendor and purchaser must not be associated persons. When the wage-related provision assumed is understated, the purchaser will be able to claim a deduction for the balance when it is paid. When the provision assumed is overstated, the excess will be treated as gross income in the hands of the purchaser at the time generally accepted accounting practice requires an adjustment to be made in the financial accounts of the business. When the transaction is between associated persons, deductions for wage-related expenditure will be allowed to the purchaser on an “as paid” basis, if a deduction would have been allowable to the vendor. 44 Consequential changes are being made to sections DF 5 (Retiring allowances payable to employees). The first change removes the timing element. Section DF 5 currently provides a deduction for a bonus, gratuity or retiring allowance on the occasion of the retirement of any employee. Under the new rules, the timing of such deductions will be governed by section EF 1. The other change is that no deduction will be allowed to an employer under section DF 5 to the extent that the liability was assumed as part of the purchase of the business and the transfer of employees, and a deduction has been allowed to the vendor. This prevents a double deduction by both the vendor and purchaser of a business. Background Under general principles wage-related provisions are usually on revenue account and should be deductible. The Income Tax Act 1994 defers the deduction until such time as amounts are actually paid out to the employees. Following the Privy Council decision in CIR v NZ Forest Research Institute Ltd \[2000\] 3 NZLR 1 it is clear that when a business and its employees are transferred, the purchaser does not currently obtain a deduction when the wage-related provisions are eventually paid out. In many cases the vendor is also unable to obtain a deduction. The anomaly is being corrected, for arm’s length sales, by allowing the vendor a deduction for the wage-related provisions, as it is the vendor which bears the economic cost of the provisions transferred. 45 TAX DEDUCTIONS FOR BRIBES (Clause 19) Summary of proposed amendments Bribes paid to foreign or domestic public officials in the conduct of business are to be made explicitly non-deductible for tax purposes, thus aligning New Zealand’s tax law on this matter with that of other OECD member countries. Application date The amendment applies from the date of enactment. Key features Section DJ 22 is being inserted into the Income Tax Act 1994 to ensure that bribes paid or promised in the conduct of business are not deductible. A person that corruptly gives, offers or agrees to give a bribe to a domestic or foreign public official, whether directly, or indirectly through another person, will be denied a deduction for the bribe. However, the provision does not apply if the bribe was paid to expedite the performance of a routine government action and the value of the benefit is small. The amendment is closely aligned with the provisions of the Crimes Act 1961, including recent amendments that criminalise active bribery of foreign public officials. Background The New Zealand Government became a signatory to the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions in December 1997. An associated OECD initiative urges member countries that allow tax deductions for bribes paid to foreign public officials to re-examine such treatment. The proposed amendments will fulfil New Zealand’s obligations to the OECD and align New Zealand’s approach with the international standard. 46 PETROLEUM MINING DEDUCTIONS (Clauses 10, 11, 20, 55(5), 55(20) and 57(1)) Summary of proposed amendments The petroleum mining tax rules are being amended to prevent petroleum miners from using the current rules relating to disposals of controlled petroleum mining entities (CPME) to gain unintended tax benefits by obtaining deductions exceeding 100 percent of their investment. This is a revenue protection measure. Application date The revenue protection measure will apply from the date of introduction of the bill. The remedial amendment to the definition of “petroleum licence” will apply from the date of enactment. Key features Section DM 6 of the Income Tax Act 1994 currently allows a deduction for the cost of ownership interests in a CPME. This section is amended to prohibit a deduction for the cost of these ownership interests. Consequential amendments are required in sections CJ 6 and CJ 7 to ensure that consideration from the disposal of interests in a CPME is not taxed when the cost of those interests is not an allowable deduction. Further consequential cross-referencing amendments relating to the amendments to sections CJ 6 and DM 6 are made to sections OB 1 and OD 8. Background The current petroleum mining legislation taxes the net proceeds from the sale of ownership interests in a CPME. These rules were intended to support the overall policy of taxing all disposals of petroleum mining assets through: • including all consideration from disposal of ownership interests in a CPME as gross income (section CJ 6); and • allowing a deduction on disposal of a CPME for the costs of the ownership interests in that entity (section DM 6); and • limiting the taxable gain on disposal of a CPME to the increase in value of the ownership interests from 1 October 1990 for the interests held at that date (sections CJ 7(1)(a) and CJ 7(2)). 47 It is now clear that these rules are not achieving their policy objectives. Contrary to the original policy intent, petroleum miners are using these rules to obtain deductions in excess of 100 percent of their capital invested in petroleum mining development and exploration expenditure. The amendment repeals the current rules and replaces them with provisions that will treat future disposals of ownership interests in a CPME as being on capital account. This will remove the ability for petroleum miners to claim unintended deductions. Consequential cross-referencing amendments It is also necessary to amend sections OB 1 and OD 8 as a result of the amendments to sections CJ 7 and DM 6. The amendment to the definition of “consideration” in section OB 1 omits the cross- reference to DM 6. The amendment to section OD 8(1) omits references to sections CJ 6 and DM 6. A remedial amendment is also necessary to the definition of “petroleum licence” as this incorrectly refers to section DM 6. The cross-reference is being amended to refer to section DM 4. 48 DEBT FORGIVENESS FOR TRUSTS (Clauses 25 and 27) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendment clarifies the operation of the existing debt forgiveness rules for trusts. The main purpose of the amendment is to ensure that resettlements of a forgiven amount to a new trust will be subject to existing debt forgiveness rules for trusts. As such, a trust that resettles will not be subject to tax if the beneficiaries of the new trust were family members for whom the creditor has natural love and affection and charities. Application date The amendments apply from the date of enactment. Key features New sub-sections EH 5(2A) and EH 52(2A) ensure that the clawback rules do not apply to some resettlements. If a trust qualifies for the natural love and affection concession, a resettlement of this trust to another trust will not trigger the clawback rules if the beneficiaries of the new trust are also beneficiaries for whom the creditor has natural love and affection or are charities. The term “distribution” in section EH 5(2) and EH 52(2) is being clarified to include an amount that constitutes beneficiary income. A distribution of such an amount to beneficiaries that do not qualify for the concession could give rise to beneficiary income (under the ordinary trust rules) and further income for the trustees (under the clawback rules). However, gross income arising to the trustee solely because a distribution was made to non-qualifying beneficiaries would not give rise to further tax liabilities for the beneficiaries. This is clarified by inserting new sub-sections EH 5(3A) and EH 52(3A). Further amendments to sections EH 5(3)(b), EH 5(4), EH 52(3)(b) and EH 52(4) clarify that the clawback could apply only to amounts forgiven that had previously qualified for the natural love and affection concession. Background Existing family trusts that qualify for a natural love and affection concession are discouraged from resettling into a new trust because it may create additional, unintended tax liabilities. Allowing the existing natural love and affection concession for family trusts to apply in resettlements recognises that resettlements are often necessary in practice. 49 Two other remedial amendments are necessary to clarify the existing clawback rules. First, it is currently unclear whether, and how, the clawback rules could apply in conjunction with the ordinary application of the trust rules. Second, the current wording of the clawback provision suggests that all amounts forgiven by creditors, including amounts forgiven that had already been taxed as remission income, could be clawed back. This is contrary to policy intention and should be remedied. 50 INCREASE IN BLOODSTOCK DEPRECIATION RATES (Clause 28) Summary of proposed amendment The depreciation rate for broodmares is to be increased by allowing mares to be fully depreciated by age 11. This amendment will ensure that the broodmare depreciation rate is consistent with the economic realities of the bloodstock industry. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment to all broodmares that first become eligible for depreciation or are purchased on or after 1 April 2001. Key features A new section EM 1(4)(d) is being added to the Income Tax Act 1994 to allow broodmares to be fully depreciated by age 11. For bloodstock, depreciation can begin from the first income year in which it is first used for breeding purposes, is purchased with the intention of breeding, or is owned with the intention of being bred from at a later date. Section EM 1(4)(d) will apply to a broodmare if the first income year in which one or more of the tests above are satisfied is an income year beginning on or after 1 April 2001. Background The amendment has arisen out of a government review of bloodstock depreciation rates. The review was undertaken to ensure that bloodstock depreciation rates accurately reflect the average breeding cycle of mares and stallions. Currently, broodmares used for breeding purposes are allowed to be depreciated from age two (or higher) to age 15. The review has shown, however, that on average broodmares finish breeding by age 11. Detailed analysis A new section EM 1(4)(d) is being added to the Income Tax Act 1994 to allow broodmares to be fully depreciated by age 11 if section EM 1(1)(ab) applies in relation to those mares. Section EM 1(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1994 allows depreciation for bloodstock from the first income year in which a bloodstock breeder: 51 • first uses the bloodstock for breeding purposes; or • purchases the bloodstock with the intention of using it for breeding purposes; or • owns the bloodstock if he or she intends to use the bloodstock for breeding purposes at some future date. A new section EM 1(1)(ab) is being added to the Income Tax Act 1994 for broodmares if the first income year in which one or more of these tests are satisfied is a year beginning on or after 1 April 2001. Under the proposed changes, broodmares that first become eligible for depreciation on or after 1 April 2001 will be allowed to be depreciated from the age of the respective mare at the end of the income year in which it becomes eligible for depreciation (being an income year starting on 1 April 2001 or later) to age 11. Example 1 : A broodmare first begins breeding on 1 July 2001, thereby first becoming eligible for depreciation in the 2001-02 income year. At the end of the 2001-02 income year the broodmare will be age four and, once the amendment is enacted, can be depreciated over seven years beginning in that income year. Similarly, broodmares purchased on or after 1 April 2001 can be depreciated from the age of the mare at the end of the income year of purchase (again being an income year starting on 1 April 2001 or later) to age 11. Example 2 : A broodmare is purchased on 1 February 2002 by a bloodstock breeder with a standard balance date. The broodmare is age six at the date of purchase but will be age seven on 1 March 2002. Given the taxpayer’s balance date, the broodmare will be age seven at the end of the 2001-02 income year and, once the amendment is enacted, can be depreciated over four years beginning in that income year. Under section EM 1(4)(d) if a broodmare first becomes eligible for depreciation at age eight or older or is that age at the end of the income year of purchase, she will be depreciated over a period not exceeding three years. Example 3 : A broodmare is purchased on 31 March 2002 by a bloodstock breeder with a 30 June balance date. The broodmare is age 12 at the date of purchase and is the same age at the end of the taxpayer’s 2001-02 income year. Once the amendment is enacted, the mare will be depreciated over three years, beginning in the 2001-02 income year. The table highlights the effect of the amendment on broodmare depreciation rates, generally, and for the purposes of the examples above. 52 E FFECT OF CHANGE ON DEPRECIATION RATES Broodmares first eligible to be depreciated or purchased before 1 April 2001\* Broodmares first eligible to be depreciated or purchased on or after 1 April 2001\*\* AgeYrs of Depreciation (excluding loading) Age\*\*\*Yrs of Depreciation (excluding loading) 153153 143143 133133 123123 114113 105103 9693 8783 7874 6965 5105 6 4114 7 3123 8 2132 9 \* Under section EM 1(4)(c) of the Income Tax Act 1994 \*\* Under new section EM 1(4)(d) of the Income Tax Act 1994 \*\*\* At end of income year in which broodmare is first eligible for depreciation or purchased 53 CHARITABLE DONEE STATUS (Clause 40) Summary of proposed amendment The Akha Rescue Ministry Charitable Trust is to be given charitable donee status. Application date The amendment will apply from the 2002-03 income year. Key features The Akha Rescue Ministry Charitable Trust is being added to section KC 5 of the Income Tax Act 1994, which lists the organisations that qualify for charitable donee status. Background The trust, whose moneys can be used outside New Zealand, is being added to the list of organisations that qualify for charitable donee status. Its main activity at present is the rescue of children from the mountain tribes in Northern Thailand who are in danger of being sold or kidnapped into prostitution. The trust has established a hostel to accommodate the children it has rescued. Donations to qualifying organisations entitle individual taxpayers to a rebate of 33 1/3% of the amount donated, to a maximum for all donations of $500 per annum. Donations by non-closely held companies qualify for a deduction from net income. The amount allowable as a deduction depends on the company’s net income. 54 OVERTAXATION OF QUALIFYING UNIT TRUSTS AND CATEGORY A GROUP INVESTMENT FUNDS (Clauses 49(2), (3), (5) and 51) Proposed new provisions prevent the over-taxation of qualifying unit trusts and Category A group investment funds. This occurs as a result of the loss of the non- taxable status of unit-holders’ paid up capital in certain circumstances. The issue is a major one for the unit trust industry. Application date The new provisions will apply from the 2002-03 imputation year, which begins on 1 April 2002 and ends on 31 March 2003. Key features Overview New subpart MJ is being added to the Income Tax Act 1994 for qualifying unit trusts (which by definition include widely held unit trusts) and Category A group investment funds who use the “slice rule”. These funds may choose to keep a supplementary available subscribed capital account to record available subscribed capital (ASC) that is lost. ASC is the paid-up capital an investor invests in the fund. Operation of supplementary ASC account Over the imputation year funds that choose to operate a supplementary ASC account will record the ASC lost on redemption of units. If an investor receives an amount on redemption which is less than the ASC per share, ASC will be lost. This amount may be recorded in the supplementary ASC account. At the end of an imputation year or immediately before the qualifying unit trust ceases to use an imputation credit account (ICA) the trust may use the balance of the supplementary ASC account to set off a debit in its ICA. The conversion rate will be the relevant company tax rate. The trust may set off credits only to the extent of a debit balance in its ICA. Opening balance of supplementary ASC account Funds can choose to calculate an opening balance for their supplementary ASC account based on the actual ASC lost if there are records to support this, or if not, on a notional wind-up calculation. If a fund chooses not to use either of these options it may still operate a supplementary ASC account using an opening balance of nil. 55 The legislation will provide that the actual calculation or the notional wind-up calculation can be done as at a date anywhere in the period from the date of enactment to 31 March 2003. The result of this calculation will be used to determine the opening balance of the supplementary ASC account, from the date of the calculation. The notional wind-up calculation must be based on an orderly realisation of assets in the ordinary course of business. The calculation requires a determination of a shortfall in imputation credits if the fund is wound up. That is an amount based on the imputation credits the fund will need to fully impute all distributions on wind-up. This shortfall will be adjusted to take account of distributions that should not be accompanied by imputation credits, such as non-taxable gains. The resulting shortfall in imputation credits will be converted to ASC (by using the relevant company tax rate) for the purposes of the opening balance of the supplementary ASC account. Background The unit trust industry has expressed concern about an issue referred to as the “negative dividend issue”, affecting unit trusts and Category A group investment funds. The issue arises from the operation of the company tax rules to unit trust-type vehicles. At the heart of the so-called negative dividend issue is the loss of ASC. Under current company tax rules, ASC can generally be returned to unit-holders without a tax cost. As a consequence of losing the ASC, funds are currently overpaying their tax in order to shelter redemption proceeds paid to unit-holders. Two aspects of the ordinary operation of a unit trust vehicle are likely to give rise to the problem. In both cases units in the fund are redeemed for an amount less than the amount subscribed for those particular units (or for all units subscribed to the same unit-holder) – that is, redemption for less than the ASC. The two cases are when: • the fund has experienced losses in the period between subscription and redemption of those units; or • part of the subscription price of the unit represented accumulated income of the fund that is subsequently paid out to the unit-holder, thus bringing the unit price down below the subscription price (in other words, subscription price is effectively cum dividend). In the first situation, an exiting unit-holder is being paid out the tax benefit associated with the reduction in the value of the fund. Although that benefit will manifest itself in the fund to the extent that it can shelter tax on future increases in fund value, such subsequent increases in fund value are gains that the remaining and future unit- holders will expect to be fully imputed. However, the trust will pay no tax on those gains as they are merely a reversal of previous losses (and are thus naturally “sheltered” from tax). 56 In the second case, ASC is effectively re-characterised and paid out as a taxable dividend to which imputation credits have been attached. The result is that the unit- holder paying the cum-dividend subscription price receives imputation credits on a distribution that is not sourced from taxable income and, therefore, any attached imputation credits do not represent tax paid or payable by the fund. 57 CARRY FORWARD OF LOSSES AND CREDITS AFTER A “SPINOUT” (Clause 56) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments provide a new, concessionary ownership-tracing rule for companies that have been transferred to a new holding company after a “spinout” restructuring process. A “spinout” is a process whereby a holding company transfers its subsidiary businesses to another holding company. The proposed amendments ensure that the ownership tracing rules do not adversely affect companies involved in a spinout if there is no change in underlying economic ownership as a result of the spinout. After a spinout, the new holding company will be treated as holding the ownership interests previously held by the old holding company on behalf of small shareholders, to the extent that there is a common interest in the old and the new holding companies. Key features New subsections OD 5(6A) to OD 5(6F) are being inserted into the Income Tax Act 1994 to provide a new ownership-tracing rule on a spinout. Section OD 5(6A) provides that the new rule will apply when a company (Company A) spins out its subsidiary businesses (Company B and Company C). A spinout can happen in a number of ways and the proposed legislation envisages that Company A could spin out its subsidiary businesses by transferring or distributing to its shareholders the shares it owns in Company B or by issuing to its shareholders new shares in Company B. Section OD 5(6A) also contains a number of conditions that have to be met before a company involved in a spinout could use the proposed tracing rule. Firstly, the proposed rule will be available only if Company A is a limited attribution company at all relevant times (from the date tax losses or credits arose until the date of the spinout). Company B is also required to be a limited attribution company at all relevant times (from the date of the spinout until the date tax losses or credits are used). The term “at all relevant times” is defined in section OD 5(6C). A “limited attribution company” is already defined in section OD 5(10). Secondly, Company B must be 100 percent owned by Company A before the spinout. There is no requirement, however, that Company B must exist for the entire period since the tax losses or credits arose. Company B could potentially be a newly incorporated company that was established for the purpose of the spinout. Company A need not own 100 percent of all the spun out businesses (since other shareholders could own part of Company C). If Company A spins out a partly owned subsidiary business the amendment will apply only in proportion to Company A’s interests in Company C before the spinout. Company C is the company with tax losses or credits. 58 Finally, Company A must be treated as holding voting or market value interests in Company C on behalf of its small shareholders under section OD 5(6)(b) before the spinout. Company B must also be treated as holding voting or market value interests on behalf of its small shareholders under section OD 5(6)(b) after the spinout. When the proposed rule can be applied, section OD 5(6B) provides that Company B will be treated as holding the ownership interests in Company C that were, before the spinout, deemed to be held by Company A on behalf of the small shareholders. However, the rule will apply only to the extent that there is a common interest in both Company A and Company B immediately after the spinout. It will also apply only for the purposes of applying the continuity provisions after the spinout. The new sections OD 5(6D), (6E) and (6F) provide the rules for determining common interests in Company A and Company B. A person’s common interests in Company A and Company B is defined, for the purpose of this provision, as the lowest voting or market value interests that the person holds in both companies. To determine the common interests in Company A and Company B, it is necessary to trace through all legal shareholders (such as nominees or companies) in Company A and Company B to the natural person beneficial owners in accordance with sections OD 3 and OD 4. However, the legal shareholders could be treated as holding the voting or market value interests on behalf of a small beneficial owner if the beneficial owner has less than 10 percent voting or market value interests in Company A or Company B. Application date The proposed amendments will apply to a spinout occurring on and after 1 March 2002. Background The proposed rule is necessary to ensure that the ownership-tracing rules do not adversely affect the companies involved in a spinout to the extent that there is no underlying change in the economic ownership of the spun out businesses. A spinout of subsidiary businesses may result in a change in holding company for the businesses. There may well be no change in the underlying economic ownership of the subsidiary businesses after the spinout. However, when a holding company is treated as holding a substantial proportion of ownership interests in the subsidiaries on behalf of small shareholders, a change of holding company could create a substantial change of ownership interests and may prevent the carry forward of tax losses and tax credits in the subsidiary businesses. Example 1 shows the effect of a spinout without the proposed amendments. In this example, Company A spins out its interests in Company B and Company C. Before the spinout, Company A holds all voting interests in Company C on behalf of its small shareholders (in accordance with section OD 5(6)(b)). After the spinout, Company B holds these same interests in Company C on behalf of the same small shareholders. From an economic perspective, there is no change in the ownership of Company C. However, if Company B wishes to apply section OD 5(6)(b) after the spinout, there will be a 100 percent change of ownership interests in Company C under the current 59 legislation. In such cases, Company B could resort to the core tracing rules in sections OD 3 and OD 4 to satisfy the shareholder continuity tests. Company B will incur additional compliance costs in doing so, however, and it may not be practical for Company B to use the core tracing rules if it is a widely held, listed company. E XAMPLE 1: L OSS OF SHAREHOLDER CONTINUITY IN THE ABSENCE OF LEGISLATIVE AMENDMENT Examples of proposed new rule When the proposed rule is applied after a spinout, Company B will be treated as holding the ownership interests in Company C that were, before the spinout, deemed to be held by Company A on behalf of the small shareholders. However, the rule will apply only to the extent that there is a common interest in both Company A and Company B immediately after the spinout. As such, the proposed rule will reflect any change in underlying economic ownership resulting from the spinout. Example 2 illustrates the effect of the amendment. In this example, Company A holds 100 percent of voting interests in Company C on behalf of its small shareholders before the spinout. However, a group of partly paid shareholders in Company A will not receive any interest in Company B as a result of the spinout. Therefore there is only a 90 percent common interest in Company A and Company B after the spinout. Shareholders < 10%Shareholders < 10% Company A (deemed ultimate shareholder-100% voting interests) Company B (new deemed ultimate shareholder-100% voting interests) Company B Company C Losses or credits to carry forward Company C No l osses or credits to carry f orward 100% loss of shareholder continuity Structure before “spinout” Structure after “spinout” 60 E XAMPLE 2: E FFECT OF PROPOSED LEGISLATIVE AMENDMENT Under the proposed rule, Company B will be treated as holding 90 percent of the ownership interests in Company C previously held by Company A on behalf of its small shareholders. The proposed rule does not affect the other interests of 10 percent. Therefore, under the proposed rule, the ownership interests in Company C are as follows: Before the spinoutAfter the spinout Company B90%Company B100% Company A10% These ownership interests will apply for the purpose of determining shareholder continuity after the spinout. There is a 90 percent continuity over the entire period since Company B holds at least 90 percent of Company C over that period. The proposed rule will override existing ownership tracing rules in sections OD 3(3)(d), OD 4(3)(d) and OD 5(6)(b) for the purpose of applying the continuity provisions after the spinout. However, the rule does not affect losses or tax credits that have been used before the spinout. Fully paid shareholders with < 10% interests (90%) Company B Ultimate owner under the proposed rule (90%) Company B Ultimate owner after spinout (100%) under OD 5(6)(b) Company A 10% loss of continuity Structure before “spinout” Structure after “spinout” Common interests 90% Fully paid shareholders with < 10% interests (100%) Partly paid shareholders (10%) Company CCompany C Losses and credits to carry forward Losses and credits to carry forward 61 In summary: • Before the spinout, in respect of Company C’s losses or tax credits arising and used before the spinout, continuity in Company C would be determined under the existing rules. Company A would be regarded as holding 100 percent if reliance is placed on paragraph OD 5(6)(b). • After the spinout, in respect of losses or credits arising in Company C before the spinout but not yet used, Company B will now be treated as having held 90 percent in Company C from the dates the losses or credits arose until the spinout. Company B would hold 100 percent voting interests in Company C from the date of the spinout if reliance is placed on paragraph OD 5(6)(b). • After the spinout, in respect of losses or credits arising in Company C after the spinout, Company B would hold 100 percent voting interests in Company C if reliance is placed on paragraph OD 5(6)(b). Spinout of partly owned subsidiaries Example 3 shows a spinout of a partly owned subsidiary. In this example, Y owns 20 percent of Company C and Company A spins out its 80 percent stake held through Company B. However, only fully paid shareholders, which constitute 90 percent of Company A’s total shareholders, receive interests in Company B. Under the proposed rule, Company B will be treated as holding interests previously held by Company A (80 percent), but only to the extent that there is a common interest in Company A and Company B after the spinout (90 percent). As such, Company B will be treated as holding 72 percent of voting interests in Company C (90 percent of 80 percent) previously held by Company A. Under the proposed rule, the ownership interests in Company C are as follows: Before the spinoutAfter the spinout Y20%Y20% Company B72%Company B80% Company A8% In summary: • Before the spinout, in respect of Company C’s losses or tax credits arising and used before the spinout, continuity in Company C would be determined under the existing rules. Company A would be regarded as holding 80 percent if reliance is placed on paragraph OD 5(6)(b). Y would be regarded as holding the other 20 percent. • After the spinout, in respect of losses or credits arising in Company C before the spinout but not yet used, Company B will now be treated as having held 72 percent in Company C from the dates the losses or credits arose until the spinout. Company B would hold 80 percent voting interests in Company C from the date of the spinout if reliance is placed on paragraph OD 5(6)(b). 62 • After the spinout, in respect of losses or credits arising in Company C after the spinout, Company B would hold 80 percent voting interests in Company C if reliance is placed on paragraph OD 5(6)(b). E XAMPLE 3: S PINOUT OF PARTLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES Ownership changes after a spinout Example 4 shows the effect of the proposed rule if a change of ownership occurs after the spinout. This example is the same as example 2, except that a natural person, Y, acquires 50 percent of Company B from its small shareholders after the spinout. Under the proposed rule, the ownership interests in Company C are as follows: Before the spinoutAfter the spinoutSubsequent Takeover Company B 90%Company B100%Company B50% Company A 10%Y50% Fully paid shareholders with < 10% interests (90%) Company B Ultimat e owner under the proposed rule (80 %\*90%=72%) Company B Ultimat e owner af ter spinout (80%) under OD 5(6)(b) Company A 8% loss of continuity Structure before “spinout” Structure after “spinout” Common interests 90% Fully paid shareholders with < 10% interests (100%) Partly paid shareholders (10%) Company CCompany C Losses and credits to carry forward Losses and credits to carry forward Other interests (Y) (20%) Other interests (Y) (20%) 80% 63 Since Company B owns at least 50 percent of Company C over the entire period, a subsequent change in ownership of 50 percent would not adversely affect the ability of Company C to carry forward its losses. However, pre-spinout credits could not be carried forward after Y acquires 50 percent of Company B.

The amendment will improve taxpayer certainty by reducing the risk of substantial time delays between a ruling lapsing and its reissue and will allow Inland Revenue to allocate its resources more effectively. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features Sections 91DA, 91DC and 91DE of the Tax Administration Act 1994 are being amended to allow Inland Revenue to issue public binding rulings that apply indefinitely until they are either formally withdrawn or the taxation law on which they are based materially changes. If a public binding ruling issued for an indefinite period is withdrawn, it will continue to apply to an arrangement entered into before the date of withdrawal, for three years from the date on which the ruling is withdrawn. The amendment does not alter the Commissioner’s ability to issue finite period public rulings. Whether a public ruling is issued for a finite period or an indefinite period is at the Commissioner’s discretion. Background Binding rulings are intended to reduce uncertainty for taxpayers about the tax implications of business decisions, and assist taxpayers in complying with the tax law. Public binding rulings are rulings that are publicly available and can be applied by all taxpayers for the particular tax matter(s) and arrangement(s) covered by the ruling. The binding rulings legislation currently requires that these rulings be issued for a finite period. 65 As the number of finite period public rulings grows over time, reissuing them may become an increasingly resource consuming task for Inland Revenue. As a result, taxpayers may experience lags between the date a ruling expires and the date it is reissued, leaving both parties with a period of time in which the application of the law is unclear. This erodes the effectiveness of the rulings system as it reduces taxpayers’ certainty about the tax effect of transactions. The amendments address these issues. 66 GST – NON-PROFIT BODIES AND THE DEFINITION OF “INPUT TAX” (Clause 81) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment clarifies the legislative basis for registered non-profit bodies to claim deductions of input tax by allowing deductions in relation to all activities except the making of exempt supplies. It will provide certainty for charities and other non-profit bodies in relation to their GST obligations and will reduce compliance costs. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features The definition of “input tax” in section 3A of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 is being amended to clarify that GST registered non-profit bodies are entitled to claim input tax credits in relation to all their activities except the making of exempt supplies (such as the supply of donated goods and services, financial services or residential accommodation). The amendment will confirm that non-profit bodies are, for example, able to claim input tax credits in respect of the activity of collecting donations. Background For GST purposes, non-profit bodies are organisations established other than for the profit of their members and are prohibited from making cash or other distributions to their members. They may include, for example, sporting and other recreational clubs as well as charities. The government discussion document Tax and Charities , released in June 2001, noted a possible inconsistency between current practice and the GST legislation in relation to claims for input tax credits by non-profit bodies. Inland Revenue’s practice is to allow input tax credits to non-profit bodies in relation to all their activities, other than the making of exempt supplies. However, in considering the relevant legislation, the discussion document expressed doubt as to whether input tax credits were available in relation to activities that did not involve the supply of goods and services in exchange for payment such as, for example, donation gathering activities. The discussion document therefore proposed to clarify the legislation in line with practice in order to provide certainty to non-profit bodies. Many of those who made submissions on the discussion document welcomed this change. 67 GST – TREATMENT OF WARRANTY PAYMENTS FROM NON- REGISTERED OFFSHORE WARRANTORS (Clauses 82 and 84) Summary of proposed amendment The supply of services to a non-registered offshore warrantor, in relation to goods sold in New Zealand, is being zero-rated for GST purposes. The amendment relieves the impost of GST on non-registered offshore suppliers arising from an inability to recover GST on the cost of warranted repairs which has been included, either directly or indirectly, in the purchase price of the goods. Application date The amendment applies from the date of enactment. Key features The supply of services to a non-registered offshore warrantor, in relation to goods subject to GST on importation that are covered by a warranty agreement, will be zero- rated under new section 11A(1)(ma) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The consideration paid by the warrantor (including any amount attributable to the full or partial replacement of parts) is regarded as relating to the supply of such services. The term “warranty” is defined as an undertaking given as part of the terms of supply to remedy defects that appear during a certain period, or following a specified level of use, after the goods are supplied. The term “supply” is also clarified to ensure that a supply of services to which new section 11A(1)(ma) applies is regarded as the only supply for the consideration provided by the offshore warrantor. Background In Suzuki New Zealand Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue 1 the Court of Appeal held that certain payments in respect of repairs to motor vehicles under warranty were subject to GST. Although the repairs in question were carried out by a dealer under a separate contract with a local New Zealand importer of the vehicles, the nature of the warranty arrangement between the New Zealand importer and the offshore manufacturer of the vehicles also required the importer to supply the repair services to the offshore manufacturer. The payment by the offshore manufacturer was viewed as consideration for services provided to the offshore manufacturer rather than 1 (2001) 20 NZTC 17,096. 68 compensation for breach of warranty. A diagram illustrating the arrangements at issue follows. The effect of the decision in Suzuki is to give rise to a double impost of GST – once on importation of the goods, the value of which includes the cost of the warranty, and again on the supply of services to the non-registered offshore warrantor. An input tax credit is available to the offshore warrantor for the GST cost on the services if they are registered for GST in New Zealand. Registration is, however, not always practicable as the offshore warrantor must establish that it makes taxable supplies in New Zealand in order to claim an input tax credit. The amendment therefore relieves non-registered offshore warrantors from the GST cost arising from their inability to recover GST on the cost of services that was directly or indirectly included in the purchase price of the goods.

If an employee has ceased employment with an employer and the employer has made contributions to a superannuation fund on behalf of the employee, the employee is allowed an exemption from superannuation fund withdrawal tax when withdrawing these contributions. This exemption should be available only if employers do not make superannuation fund contributions in excess of 150 percent of the previous year’s contributions in the income year of cessation of employment and in both of the two preceding income years. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features Section CL 8(2) of the Income Tax Act 1994 is being amended so that the exemption from superannuation fund withdrawal tax applies only if employer contributions in the income year of cessation of employment and in each of the two preceding income years do not exceed 150 percent of the contributions made in the previous year. Background The rules governing the tax treatment of withdrawals from superannuation funds were introduced in the Taxation (FBT, SSCWT and Remedial Matters) Act 2000. One such rule allows an exemption from superannuation fund withdrawal tax (5% of the withdrawn amount) for employees if an employee making that withdrawal is no longer in the service of the employer to whom the superannuation contributions being withdrawn relate. The exemption is designed to apply under the following conditions. First, an employee must have been employed for two or more years by the relevant employer. Second, the employer’s contributions to the superannuation fund, on behalf of the employee, must not exceed 150 percent of the previous year’s contributions. The second condition applies to the annualised contributions made in the income year in which employment is ceased and in the preceding two income years. 72 The legislation, however, is contrary to this policy intention as the 50 percent cap on increases in employer contributions over the previous year applies to only one of the two income years preceding the year in which employment is ceased. In effect, an employer can make contributions in excess of 150 percent of the previous year’s contribution in one of those two income years and the exemption from withdrawal tax would still apply. The amendment will ensure that the relevant exemption from superannuation fund withdrawal tax applies only if employer contributions do not exceed 150 percent of the previous year’s contributions in both of the income years preceding that in which employment is ceased. 73 THIN CAPITALISATION (Clause 30) Summary of proposed amendment A minor remedial amendment is being made to the thin capitalisation rules to allow taxpayers to include the depreciated value of assets under a finance or specified lease in the definition of “assets” for thin capitalisation purposes when they are excluded for accounting purposes. The amendment will make the application of the rules more consistent and fairer to taxpayers who have specified or finance leases. Application date The amendment will apply to measurement dates from the date of introduction of the bill. Key features Section FG 4(3)(ca) is being added to the Income Tax Act 1994 and section FG 4(4) of the Act is being amended. The changes allow the adjusted tax value of a lease asset under a specified or finance lease to be included in the total assets of a New Zealand group if the lease asset is not recognised as an asset under generally accepted accounting practice. Background The thin capitalisation rules are designed to limit interest deductions if the debt/asset ratio of a New Zealand operation, controlled by non-residents, exceeds a certain threshold. Tax practitioners have identified that in some cases there is an unintended overstatement of the New Zealand group’s debt/assets ratio owing to a difference between the tax definition and the accounting definition of “finance” and “specified leases”. The thin capitalisation rules define what an “asset” is and what is “debt” for the purposes of calculating the debt/asset ratio. Under the rules, an asset must be calculated under generally accepted accounting practice. A debt is defined as a financial arrangement, which includes a loan. For tax purposes, a finance or a specified lease is treated as a sale of the leased asset with a loan from the lessor to the lessee. The loan from the lessor to the lessee will always be included in the lessee’s calculation of the debt/asset ratio. The asset itself will not necessarily be included because the debt/asset ratio follows the accounting treatment of the asset. Under generally accepted accounting practice the definition of a finance lease is narrower than the definition of either a finance or a specified lease for tax purposes. Therefore, under the thin capitalisation rules, the asset definition 74 will not capture all the deemed assets, whereas it will capture all the deemed loans. This will in some cases, contrary to the original policy intent, overstate the debt/asset ratio and possibly require taxpayers to limit their tax deductions. The proposed amendment will allow taxpayers to include the asset cost less accumulated depreciation (“adjusted tax value”) of the finance or specified lease asset in the definition of “asset” for thin capitalisation purposes but only if that asset has not already been included in the taxpayer’s financial accounts. 75 UNIT TRUSTS: DEBITS TO IMPUTATION CREDIT ACCOUNT (Clause 50) Summary of proposed amendment A proposed amendment prevents a unit trust’s imputation credit account being double debited. This can occur when there is both a debit resulting from a significant change to the shareholding of the unit trust and a debit of the imputation credits received when a unit trust manager redeems units with the unit trust. This is a remedial amendment designed to resolve a double taxation problem that arises through the interaction of two different provisions. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 1996, the date that section ME 41 of the Income Tax Act 1994 came into effect. Key features Section ME 41(2) of the Income Tax Act is to be amended to ensure that the amount of the imputation credit account debit made under section ME 41 does not include any imputation credits received from the unit trust during the relevant income year that have previously been debited under section ME 5(1)(i) because of a continuity breach. Background Section ME 41 provides that the imputation credits received when unit trust managers redeem units with the unit trust in the ordinary course of their business are offset by a debit to the unit trust manager’s imputation credit account. This debit occurs on the date the income tax return is filed for the income year in which the dividends are derived. When a unit trust manager breaches the shareholding continuity rules, section ME 5(1)(i) requires a unit trust manager to debit the imputation credit account of those credits in the account at the date of the shareholding change. The imputation credit account balance at the date of the shareholding change will include the imputation credits received on redemption that have not yet been offset by a section ME 41 debit. The debit that occurs as a result of the change in continuity does not remove the requirement under section ME 41 to debit the imputation credit account at the time of filing an income tax return, for the full amount of imputation credits received on redemption in that income year. 76 As a result, unit trust managers are effectively required to make a double debit to their imputation credit account for imputation credits received on redemption that have not previously been offset by a section ME 41 debit at the time of a shareholding continuity breach. 77 MULTI-RATE FBT – LOW-INCOME REBATE AND THE MULTI- RATE CALCULATION (Clause 52) Summary of proposed amendment The definition of “tax on cash remuneration” is being amended to ensure that the full low-income rebate applies in the multi-rate calculation, irrespective of the employee’s residence status. The amendment ensures that employers are not required to ascertain an employee’s residence status in calculating the tax on the employee’s cash remuneration. Application date The amendment applies to fringe benefits provided: • on or after 1 April 2000 for employers who pay fringe benefit tax on a quarterly or an annual basis; and • during the 2000-2001 or a subsequent income year for an employer who pays FBT on an income year basis. Key features Section ND 5(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994 is being amended to ensure that in calculating the tax payable on an employee’s cash remuneration, as part of the multi- rate calculation, the low-income rebate is calculated as if the employee were resident in New Zealand for the full income year. In other words, employers do not have to apportion the low-income rebate based on the individual periods of residency in New Zealand of their employees. Background The Taxation (Beneficiary Income of Minors, Services-Related Payments and Remedial Matters) Act 2001, enacted early this year, included an equivalent amendment to section ND 5(2) of the Income Tax Act. However, as a result of a oversight, section ND 5(1) was not amended at the same time. This proposed amendment corrects this oversight. 78 THE MINOR BENEFICIARY RULE (Clauses 33, 34, 55(22) and (31)) Summary of proposed amendments Four minor remedial amendments are proposed to the minor beneficiary rule, which requires certain distributions of beneficiary income to a minor to be taxed at 33%. The purpose of the amendments is to ensure that the legislation more clearly reflects the original policy intent. Application date The proposed amendments will apply to beneficiary income derived in relation to the 2001-02 and subsequent income years (the application date of the minor beneficiary rule), except if the trustee has filed a return for the 2001-2002 income year on the basis of the current legislation, before the introduction date of the amending legislation into Parliament. Key features • Section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 is to be amended to provide certainty that the definition of “settlement”, for the purpose of the minor beneficiary rule, has the corresponding meaning to the definition of “settlor” which was amended by the Taxation (Beneficiary Income of Minors, Services-Related Payments and Remedial Matters) Act 2001. • The second amendment will ensure that section HH 3D, which provides an exclusion from the rule will apply only to “mixed trusts” as intended. A mixed trust is one that has both a settlement that is caught by the rule and a settlement which is excluded from the rule. • The third amendment, also to section HH 3D, is to clarify that the $1,000 threshold for application of the minor beneficiary rule relates to the value of the loan(s) provided to the trust, not to the value of the interest forgone on the loan(s). • Section HH 3F is to be amended to clarify that in determining whether a beneficiary is a “minor”, the age of the minor should be determined on the balance date of the year in which the income is earned by the trust. Background Amendments to the Income Tax Act 1994 enacted in March 2001 introduced the minor beneficiary rule. This rule ensures that distributions of beneficiary income from a trust to a child under the age of 16 years will be taxed at 33% as if it were trustee income. 79 The minor beneficiary rule is intended to limit the ability of some families to pay considerably less tax than other families on similar incomes by meeting expenses of the children through the use of trust. The rule applies to all beneficiary income distributed to a minor from a trust unless a specific exception in the legislation applies. The minor beneficiary rule applies to income derived in relation to the 2001-2002 and subsequent income years. 80 GST – PENALTY INTEREST (Clause 85) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment clarifies that penalty interest charged under a statute or regulation is treated as consideration for an exempt supply for GST purposes. The amendment removes uncertainties with the GST treatment of penalty interest charged by statutory authorities. Application date The amendment applies from 10 October 2001, the date of enactment of the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000, in which the rules relating to the GST treatment of penalty interest were substantively changed. Key features The amendment clarifies that section 14(3) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 applies to treat penalty interest charged under an enactment as consideration for an exempt supply. Background As outlined in the government discussion document GST: A Review and as enacted in the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000, penalty interest should not, in principle, be subject to GST. The change was largely a simplification measure to remove the uncertainty about the treatment of such payments. In most cases penalty interest is equivalent to the payment of interest on the outstanding balance of the purchase price. The charge therefore compensates for the time value of money, which arguably falls outside the scope of a consumption tax such as GST. The change included in the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act applies only to charges under contract but not under statute. This has created uncertainty for some statutory authorities. The amendment does not apply to charges that do not vary with the period of non- payment such as set fees. 81 GST – CHANGE-IN-USE ADJUSTMENTS (Clauses 87 and 88) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment clarifies when an adjustment for GST is required for assets with a value of less than $18,000 if there is a change in use to making taxable supplies. The amendment confirms that the adjustment should be made once and in the taxable period in which the change in use occurs. Section 21F(3) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 is being repealed and a similar provision inserted in section 21G. This is in keeping with the original policy intent of the legislation and administrative practice. Application date The amendment applies from 10 October 2001, the date of enactment of the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000, in which the rules relating to change- in-use adjustments were changed. 82 BUSINESS TAX SIMPLIFICATION (Clauses 17, 76 and 89) Summary of proposed amendment Two minor remedial amendments are proposed to business tax simplification reforms enacted by the Taxation (Beneficiary Income of Minors, Services-Related Payments and Remedial Matters) Act 2001. Section 23A(2) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 is being added to recharacterise the GST adjustment on fringe benefits as a payment of fringe benefit tax, rather than a payment of GST, for administrative purposes. A new section DF 9 is being inserted into the Income Tax Act 1994 to prevent the GST from becoming deductible for income tax purposes. Section 139B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is being amended to make it clear that some of the debt subject to compulsory deductions must be repaid for late payment penalties to be cancelled in relation to that debt. Application date The amendments will apply from the same time that the underlying reforms took effect. 83 OTHER MINOR TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS A number of other minor technical amendments are being made to the tax Acts. None of these amendments results in a policy change. Absolute assignments of a financial arrangement with deferred consideration (Clause 26) Section EH 46(4) is inserted into the Income Tax Act 1994 to clarify the policy intention that an absolute assignment of existing financial arrangements with deferred considerations will not terminate the financial arrangements. Thus, a base price adjustment will not be performed for the financial arrangements under these circumstances and the deferred considerations will not be brought to tax under the base price adjustment. Instead, the deferred considerations will be taxed, as originally intended, on an accrual basis over the term of the arrangements. Non-standard income year provisional taxpayers (Clause 46) An amendment clarifies the law to ensure that taxpayers in a “non-standard income year” can elect to become provisional taxpayers under section MB 2A of the Income Tax Act 1994. The amendment will apply from the 1998-99 income year (the application date of the section being amended) Inaccurate section headings (Clauses 47 and 67) The section heading of section MC 1 is: “Assessment and payment of terminal tax”. The assessment function of this provision (former subsection (1)) was repealed as part of the 1996 core provisions amendments. Accordingly, the section MC 1 heading is to be changed to: “Payment of terminal tax by provisional taxpayer” to more accurately reflect the section’s contents. Section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is entitled: “Disclosure of interest in foreign investment fund”. This heading is inaccurate because section 61 requires disclosure of income interests and control interests in all foreign companies as well as interests in FIFs. Although there is some overlap between these two categories, there are many interests in foreign companies which are not FIF interests – for example, interests in grey list companies. (Exemptions from these disclosure requirements are made by the Commissioner under section 61(2).) Accordingly, the section 61 heading should be replaced by “Disclosure of interest in foreign company or foreign investment fund” to more accurately reflect the section’s contents. 84 Group investment funds’ imputation credits (Clause 49) A minor drafting error in section ME 4(1)(a) is corrected to ensure that taxes paid by group investment funds on category A income would qualify for imputation credits. Category A income of group investment funds are taxed in accordance with company tax rules while category B income are taxed under the trust rules. Thus, only income taxes paid on category A income qualify for imputation credits. However, a drafting error in section ME 4(1)(a) meant that group investment funds are prohibited from claiming imputation credits on income taxes paid on category A income but are allowed to claim imputation credits on category B income since the 1997-1998 income year. The proposed amendment will correct this drafting error with retrospective effect from the 1997-1998 income year. Charitable entity in receipt of foreign dividends (Clause 53) Section NH 1 is being amended to correct an error and clarify the law to ensure that a company or deemed company which is exempt from income tax under section CB 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (non-profit bodies’ and charities’ exempt income) is also exempt from dividend withholding payment obligations. The amendment will apply from the 1997-1998 income year (the application date of the core provision amendments). Non-filing taxpayers (Clause 55) The definition of “non-filing taxpayer” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 is amended by replacing the reference to “natural person” with “person”. This amendment would reinstate the position as it was before 1 April 1999, when the definition was inadvertently changed so that it referred to natural persons only. The current reference to “natural person” means that a non-resident company which derives only section NG 3-type non-resident withholding income (dividends, unrelated party interest and copyright royalties) does not come within the definition. As a consequence, such a taxpayer does not come within section BC 2, which provides that the income tax liability of a non-filing taxpayer is the total of the tax deductions required to be made from that taxpayer’s gross income. As a matter of policy, this type of taxpayer should come within the definition of “non-filing taxpayer”. The amendment will apply from 1 April 1999. 85 Definition of “disposition of property” (Clause 55) The definition of “disposition of property” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 is to be amended so that it also applies for the purpose of the definition of “settlor” (which is also contained in section OB 1). The term “disposition of property” is used in the definition of “settlor”. However, the definition of “disposition of property” does not state that it applies for the purpose of the definition of settlor, even though this is clearly the intention. The two definitions were clearly linked as parts of the trust taxation provisions in the Income Tax Act 1976. The connection was inadvertently broken when the Income Tax Act 1994 was enacted and should be reinstated. Foreign tax credits (Clauses 44 and 58) Section OE 6 of the Income Tax Act 1994 is to be relocated to Part LC (relating to foreign tax credits) as new section LC 14A. Section OE 6 provides that a dividend paid by a non-resident company is deemed to be derived from that company’s country of residence for the purposes of a double tax agreement between New Zealand and that other country. The provision was originally enacted in 1960 as part of the foreign tax credit provisions and its purpose was to facilitate foreign tax credit claims by New Zealand residents. However, when the Income Tax Act 1994 was enacted this provision was incorrectly included in Part OE, as part of the provisions defining the classes of income deemed to be derived from New Zealand. The amendment would place the provision in the correct Part of the Income Tax Act 1994, which is Part LC concerning foreign tax credits. Taxpayers not required to file income tax returns (Clause 63) Section 33A(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 contains one of several conditions that must be satisfied before an individual is entitled not to file an income tax return. The condition is intended to be satisfied only if the person’s annual gross income is derived exclusively from certain types of income from employment, interest or dividends. The word “only” is to be inserted into this provision to ensure that its policy intention is more clearly stated. Also, the term “annual gross income” can be replaced with the more simple term “gross income” without changing the effect of the provision. 86 Trust income tax returns (Clause 66) Section 59(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 relates to income tax returns required to be filed by trustees of trusts. This provision is to be amended to clarify that a trustee is required to furnish a return of all income the trustee derives, whether the income is beneficiary income or trustee income. This has always been the policy intention of this provision. However, the legislation has not been clear on this issue since a core provisions-related amendment in 1996 which replaced a reference to “whole income” with “taxable income”. This amendment will replace the taxable income reference with a reference to all income derived by a trustee of a trust. The amendment will apply from the 1997-98 income year. Amendment to Taxation (Taxpayer Assessment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001 (Clause 95) Section 239(1) of the Taxation (Taxpayer Assessment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001 is to be amended by omitting the reference to section 90 of the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000. Section 239(1) amends the voucher provisions in section 10 of the GST Act for the period between 1 October 1986 and 19 May 1999. Section 239(1) correctly refers to amending section 10 of the GST Act as it was before its amendment by section 79 of the Taxation (Remedial Matters) Act 1999, which amendment had effect from 20 May 1999. However, the reference in the same provision to section 90 of the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000 is incorrect and should be omitted. The amendment will apply from 24 October 2001.
Tax and charities A government discussion document on taxation issues relating to charities and non-profit bodies Hon Dr Michael CullenHon Paul SwainJohn Wright MP Minister of FinanceAssociate Minister of Parliamentary Under-Secretary Minister of RevenueFinance and Revenue to the Minister of Revenue Tax and charities; a government discussion document on taxation issues relating to charities and non- profit bodies. First published in June 2001 by the Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department. ISBN 0-478-10343-3 FOREWORD We would like to acknowledge the enormous contribution the voluntary and charitable sector makes to New Zealand society. New Zealanders are indebted to these groups for the work they do in the community, especially in the welfare, health and education spheres. One of the main forms of government assistance to this sector is to exempt charities from paying income tax. We are issuing this discussion document because we want to ensure that this assistance is as well targeted as it could be. Over our years in politics we have had many approaches from groups within the sector, concerned that in some cases the tax exemption is being inappropriately used, or that some groups do not have access to it. They have often asked that the definition of “charity” for tax purposes be narrowed or modernised. Your views are therefore sought on whether the present definition is appropriate for New Zealand in the 21st century, or whether, and how, it should be modernised. At present, we do not have enough information about how much money the government spends on this tax exemption, or which groups benefit most from it. We are particularly interested in feedback on the information-gathering, or reporting, proposals. With better information about which organisations are benefiting from the charitable tax exemption, and to what extent, we will be in a much better position to judge whether government assistance through the tax system could be better targeted. This discussion document contains a range of proposals for updating the definition of “charitable purpose” and improving the accountability of organisations receiving government assistance. It draws on the excellent work contained in the 1989 report of the Working Party on Charities and Sporting Bodies and the 1999 report on Tax Compliance from the Committee of Experts. It also raises other taxation issues in relation to charities and, in one case, other non- profit bodies. For example, it looks at how the trading operations of charities are taxed, and at other ways charities are assisted through the tax system, such as allowing income tax rebates or deductions for donations to charities. In the final chapter, the discussion document provides solutions to the current uncertainties for charities and other non-profit bodies in relation to GST. These are important issues, and the government looks forward to receiving your submissions.

It then summarises the proposals put forward in the discussion document. 3 Chapter 1 PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW This review 1.1 This discussion document has been issued as part of the consultation stage in a review undertaken by government of the tax treatment of charities. The charitable sector receives assistance through the tax system in the form of the exemption from income tax (section CB 4(1)(c) and (e) of the Income Tax Act 1994); the donations rebate for giving by individuals (section KC 5(1)); the company donation deduction (section DJ 4), and the exemption from gift duty for gifts to a charity (section 73(1) of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968). The government’s intention is to maintain at least the same level of assistance to charities through the tax system as it currently provides. However, it recognises that if that assistance is not appropriately targeted, the available resources may be spread too thinly. 1.2 In determining whether assistance is appropriately targeted, two potential problems are the scope of the current application of the exemption, and the relevance, today, of the possibly archaic definition of “charitable purpose”. 1.3 In addressing these problems, and indeed in determining whether these problems are real or merely perceived, this review focuses on three areas: whether the definition of “charitable purpose”, which derives from English law at least 400 years old, remains appropriate to New Zealand society in the 21st century; whether the level of information provided to the government by charities is appropriate; and some specific tax issues affecting the sector. These areas are covered in this document in Parts II, III and IV, respectively. 1.4 It is important to note that this review deals mainly with charities, and only with issues that relate to taxation. Thus, apart from the GST issues discussed in the last chapter, it does not deal with other tax-exempt organisations. Nor does it deal with governance issues, except to the extent of reporting for tax purposes, as discussed in Part III. The discussion on the definitional issues is intended to apply only for tax purposes, so would not affect other areas of law such as the Charitable Trusts Act 1957 and the Perpetuities Act 1964. Other reviews 1.5 The last major review of the law of charities in New Zealand was undertaken by the Working Party on Charities and Sporting Bodies in 1989. The major recommendation of that review was that a Commission for Charities be established, to increase accountability of charities to the public. This discussion document does not deal with the range of issues covered by that working party as many of them are outside the scope of the present review. However, the working party did make several recommendations in relation to direct tax matters, including that the income tax exemption be retained, and 4 that the limits on deductions and rebates be regularly adjusted. Those issues are discussed in this document. 1.6 The appropriateness of the current broad tax exemption for charities and other non-profit organisations, as well as their ability to earn business income free of tax, were also discussed by the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance. The committee was particularly concerned about the issue of competitive advantage, given the ability of charities to earn business income free of tax. 1.7 Work is being undertaken in other areas that is potentially relevant to this review. It includes the Tax Review 2001, which will look at the use of the tax system to influence behaviour; the government review of gaming; and the Community and Voluntary Sector Working Party, which reported in April 2001. 5 Chapter 2 GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE TO THE CHARITABLE SECTOR THROUGH THE TAX SYSTEM 2.1 This chapter discusses the nature of the charitable sector, and the reasons the government supports the sector through the tax system. The purpose of charities 2.2 Organisations within the charitable sector take many forms, including companies and trusts. They use three main forms of fund raising: direct gifts, such as donations and other philanthropic giving; income from passive investment such as bank deposits; and income from business activity. The forms of charitable provision are direct grants or gifts of money, and the provision of goods and services for nil, or nominal, consideration. 2.3 The New Shorter Oxford English dictionary defines “charity” as, among other things: “a trust, foundation, organisation, etc., for the benefit of others, especially of those in need or distress”. 2.4 Examples of common charities in New Zealand today are churches, universities, play centres, welfare organisations, food banks and night shelters. The functions of these organisations indicate they have a wider purpose than that suggested by the dictionary definition. It could be said they are providing goods and services that are in some way “collective” in their benefit. In other words, they provide goods and services that confer a benefit to society over and above the benefits that the recipient or supplier may get from the arrangement. Organisations that exist primarily to provide a benefit to owners or members are not regarded as charitable, even if some residual funds are used in the provision of collective goods and services. 1 2.5 Although governments are the main suppliers of collective goods and services, some people will want to see more of certain goods and services being provided. Typically, they use the charitable sector as the main vehicle to provide them. 2.6 The charitable sector is perceived to be altruistically focused, reinforced by the fact that charities do not normally have shareholders and often rely upon volunteers. These factors may be an advantage in the minds of donors when they are deciding what type of entity to support. Often donors have little information about the uses to which their donations are put, partly because 1 These concepts are reflected to some extent in the current tax rules applying to charities, which prohibit private pecuniary profit; require a organisation to exist for exclusively charitable purposes; and require the benefit to be available to an appreciably large section of the community. 6 they are not the ultimate beneficiaries of the goods or services provided by the entity to which they have donated. In these circumstances, donors may feel more confident that a non-profit or charitable organisation will not take advantage of the lack of information about what happens to their funds to provide a lower than promised quality of output. However, these factors do not by themselves form a justification for governments subsidising such entities. The question therefore remains – why do governments subsidise the charitable sector, and in particular, why do they do so through the tax system? Government support for greater private provision 2.7 Subsidising charities enables governments to further their social objectives, including by means of increasing support to disadvantaged members of society. One of the reasons governments provide subsidies to the private sector rather than simply increasing state provision is that it can result in a better targeting of resources. The donations people make to a charity provide an effective indicator of the extra goods and services people feel are needed. Subsidising charities also ensures that those members of society who do not donate to charities but who nevertheless benefit indirectly from charities are contributing through their general tax payments. Support through the tax system 2.8 In the case of charities, the subsidy takes the form of an exemption from income tax that allows spending on charitable purposes to be made out of untaxed income. Further, the source of some of those funds that are spent is subsidised by the rebate or deduction for donations made to charities. 2.9 As already noted, a common feature of charities is that they provide a benefit to society over and above any benefit received by the recipient or supplier of the relevant goods or services. For example, the benefit to society of a charity running a soup kitchen is greater than the value of the meals provided there. This is what economists call a “positive externality”. The presence of an externality is one of the few justifications for the use of subsidies through the tax system. A subsidy can be used to give some recognition to the supplier for the extra benefit that those activities provide to society generally. 2.10 Even so, there are several problems with using the tax system to recognise these extra benefits, and some of these problems are noted later. However, in the case of charities, these are mitigated to some extent by the fact that no private pecuniary profit can be made from charitable activities (and therefore from the tax exemption). 7 2.11 In respect of the donations subsidy, empirical studies 2 suggest that subsidies to donors encourage charitable giving, which is generally regarded as socially desirable behaviour. The government could provide its support directly to charities through grants. However, this would not provide a direct incentive for individuals to donate, and might result in less effective targeting of government assistance, particularly if the government grants were not matched to donations. Concerns about using the tax system to support charities 2.12 Despite the advantages of using the tax system to support charities, there are a number of issues that governments need to take into account when using the tax system to provide this kind of support. • In granting tax concessions, governments forgo tax revenues. This means that governments need to raise money from other sources, such as through increasing tax rates on non-exempt companies, goods and individuals, to reach their total tax revenue targets. • Government subsidy by way of a tax exemption can encourage growth in inefficient ways. For example, even though the subsidy may result in more output of a particular good or service, the resources redirected to the subsidised activity to produce the extra output might have been used to greater effect in another activity. Thus there can be a net loss to society from a subsidy, although the size of any loss (or indeed gain) is difficult to quantify in a world of imperfect information. • Unlike other forms of government expenditure, a subsidy through the tax system is not subject to direct control by the government. An exemption on income tax allocates tax expenditure in proportion to an organisation’s income, not according to its needs or worth; a donation deductible from a donor’s income results in both the amount and the recipient of the tax expenditure being chosen by the donor. • Unlike other forms of tax expenditure, there is no direct ministerial scrutiny of the use to which the tax subsidy is put. In New Zealand, there is no formal process for registering charities, and there is ministerial involvement only when Parliamentary approval is required for donee status because the charity intends to operate overseas. Even in those cases, there is no government monitoring of whether a charity is continuing to meet the charitable purposes for which it was established. • Moreover, the assistance granted to charities through the tax system is not transparent and, as such, disguises the total level of expenditure on different parts of the government’s programme. 2 See discussion in chapter 11. 8 2.13 In light of these concerns, governments need to ensure that the support they have decided to give through the tax system is appropriately targeted, is transparent and has the scope for some ministerial or official review. These questions are a particular focus of the review and this discussion document. International comparisons 2.14 Most countries provide support to charities through the tax system in one form or another. The appendix compares the current rules in New Zealand with the rules applying in the United Kingdom, Australia, the United States and Canada. These countries use definitions of “charitable purpose” that are similar to our own and provide similar assistance through the tax system. But all have significantly more developed registration and reporting arrangements, with approved registration being a common feature for those entities seeking tax assistance. In the United Kingdom, charities come under the purview of a Charities Commission. In the other cases, the arrangements are administered as part of the tax system, through their respective tax authorities. 2.15 Specific features of some of these countries are also discussed in subsequent sections of this discussion document as the proposals in relation to reporting and the definition of “charitable purpose” are outlined. Summary of proposals 2.16 This discussion document contains more than one proposal for both the definition of “charitable purpose” and for increased reporting by charities. That is because the government’s decision on the definition of “charitable purpose” will be influenced by feedback on reporting issues. Broadly, if the definition of “charitable purpose” can be modernised or narrowed, less stringent reporting would be required. However, if the definition cannot be modernised without affecting entities which the government considers should be supported, increased monitoring might be required, so that both the government and the public can see that their money is being spent to best effect. 9 PROPOSALS Defining “charitable purpose” – two options 1.Use the same definition but with safeguards The first option is to leave the current definition unchanged, subject only to any liberalisation of the public benefit test, and the safeguards discussed below. 2.Replace the existing definition with a new, general definition assisted by detailed guidelines on how it should be applied, with specific approval required. This approach is a modernisation of the current law. It would encompass all of the traditional charitable purposes (relief of poverty, etc.) outlined in chapter 3, but expressed in terminology more fitting to 21st century society. Specific approval would be required before charitable status would be granted. Given that this is a broad definition, it would need to be accompanied by a set of guidelines that could be used in applying the definition. Safeguards Both of these options would be subject to some reporting requirements. They would also be subject to the public benefit test, and could be subject to a discretion or override by the government (on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance) in order to allow it to better target its support. The provisions of section CB 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994 would be amended to require an entity not only to be established for charitable purposes, but to continue to carry out those charitable purposes in order to remain eligible for the tax exemption. All charities would have to register with the government before the tax exemption was available, in accordance with a specified procedure to be developed. Reporting requirements Registration The charitable tax exemption would be available only to those charities that have registered as such. This could also involve a specific approval process. Supply of information Charities would file annual accounts (audited when appropriate) and, possibly, tax returns. The annual accounts should be publicly available. 10 Regular monitoring The government envisages that the activities of charities would be regularly monitored (by either the Inland Revenue Department, another government department or an independent body) to ensure that the charitable objects for which their tax exemption was granted were, in fact, being pursued. Specific tax issues Trading operations Trading operations of charities would be subject to income tax but with an unlimited deduction for distributions made to the charity that owns the trading operation. Charitable purposes outside New Zealand The criteria for donee status (section KC 5(1)) for overseas charitable purposes (see paragraph 10.3) would be standardised by applying those same criteria to the income tax exemption (section CB 4(1)(c) and (e)). Rebates and deductions for donations to charities Rebates for donations by individuals would be increased in line with inflation since 1990, and the company deduction rules in the Income Tax Act 1994 would be simplified by removing the limit for each donation made, and allowing deductions for close companies that are listed on a recognised exchange. Fringe benefit tax The exemption from fringe benefit tax for fringe benefits provided to employees of charities would be removed. Superannuation schemes for the benefit of employees of charities The issue of whether superannuation schemes for the benefit of employees of charities should have charitable status is raised for discussion. GST To remove existing uncertainties, GST input tax credits would be allowed to GST registered charities and other non-profit bodies in relation to all their activities, other than the making of exempt supplies. 11 Outcome of consultation process 2.17 Any legislation resulting from this review is proposed to be included in a taxation bill later this year. We envisage the changes taking effect from the beginning of the income year following enactment. Communicating your views 2.18 The government invites you to provide your views on the proposals in this discussion document. Although the document identifies specific issues for consultation, the government is interested in your views on any of the issues raised. Submissions should be made by 31 July 2001 and can be provided either in written form or electronically. 2.19 Written submissions should be addressed to: The General Manager Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON The electronic address is policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz. 2.20 Please note submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. If you feel there is any part of your submission which you consider could be properly withheld under that Act (for example, for reasons of privacy), please indicate this clearly in your submission. Part II The relevance of the definition of “charitable purpose” This part of the discussion document deals with the issue of whether the definition of “charitable purpose” is relevant in the 21st century. It outlines the current law on what constitutes a charity before discussing problems with the current law and possible solutions. 15 Chapter 3 CURRENT LAW 3.1 Whether an entity, be it a trust, incorporated society or a limited liability company qualifies as a charity entitled to tax concessions depends on whether it meets the following tests: • It must have been established exclusively for charitable purposes. 3 • It must have been established for the benefit of the community as a whole or an appreciably significant section of it (“the public benefit test”). The courts have exempted charities for the relief of poverty from the public benefit test. • The charitable purposes cannot be carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual. 3.2 Furthermore, in the case of a business, the exemption from income tax is not available to the extent the charitable purposes are outside New Zealand. Nor is it available if a person associated with the charity is able to receive some financial benefit from it. Charitable purposes 3.3 “Charitable purpose” is defined in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, as including: “every charitable purpose, whether it relates to the relief of poverty, the advancement of education or religion, or any other matter beneficial to the community”. 3.4 The categories of relief of poverty, education, religion or other community benefits are known as the four “heads” of charity, and are based on the Charitable Uses Act 1601 (sometimes also known as the Statute of Elizabeth). 4 But they are not defined in any legislation. Instead their meaning is to be found in court decisions both in New Zealand and the United Kingdom. 3 This discussion document deals only with the definition of “charitable purpose” for income tax purposes, but it is relevant to note that similar concepts apply in other contexts. These include the Charitable Trusts Act 1957 and the Perpetuities Act 1964. 4 In fact, the preamble to the Statute of Elizabeth itself is strikingly similar to the fourteenth century poem, “The Vision of Piers Plowman”, and some commentators have suggested that the drafter of the statute probably drew upon that poem. 16 Historical influences 3.5 The Charitable Uses Act 1601 was a regulatory tool which provided for commissioners to investigate the misuse of funds that had been endowed for the benefit of charitable causes. The preamble to the Charitable Uses Act listed the following as examples of charitable purposes: “The relief of aged, impotent and poor people; the maintenance of sick and maimed soldiers and mariners, schools of learning, free schools and scholars in universities, the repair of bridges, ports, havens, causeways, churches, sea-banks and highways; the education and preferment of orphans; the relief, stock or maintenance for houses of correction; the marriage of poor maids, the supportation, aid and help of young tradesmen, handicraftsmen and persons decayed; the relief or redemption of prisoners or captives; and the aid or ease of any poor inhabitants concerning payment of fifteens, setting out of soldiers and other taxes.” 3.6 One of the historical influences on the definition was the Mortmain Act 1736, which operated to invalidate any legacies of money or land to charitable purposes if strict procedures were not followed. That Act appeared to have a distorting influence on the definition of “charitable purposes” throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, as testators’ families challenged legacies made to entities or purposes outside the family circle. The courts, in order to protect the families’ interests, found more and more purposes to be charitable so that the Mortmain Act could apply to them, and potentially invalidate legacies that had not complied with the required procedures. 5 3.7 The Mortmain Act lost its influence on the development of the law of charities when it was liberalised in the late nineteenth century. However, the courts have continued to develop the law on what constitutes “charitable purposes”. 3.8 In looking at the definition of “charitable purpose”, it needs to be borne in mind that the definition has two purposes. At common law a trust for a purpose (as opposed to a trust for a person) is valid only if it is charitable. The courts have therefore found a purpose trust to be charitable wherever possible, in order to avoid the consequences of invalidity. In this way, the definition of “charitable purpose” has broadened over the years. In the tax context, however, the definition of “charitable purpose” provides a threshold for tax relief. At present, “charitable purpose” has the same meaning in both contexts, but an option is to explore whether that need be so. 5 See Chesterman Charities, Trusts and Social Welfare (Weidenfield & Nicolson, 1979) at 55-56. 17 3.9 The first major decision to consider the meaning of charitable purpose in the income tax context was Commissioners for Special Purposes of the Income Tax v Pemsel 6 (“ Pemsel’s case”). The judgment of Lord Macaghten embedded into law the four categories of charitable purposes (or heads) of charity. Pemsel’s case held that for the purposes of exemption from income tax the definition of “charitable purpose” should be the legal and technical definition deriving from the Charitable Uses Act 1601. 7 Subsequent cases have refined what comes within each category. It is beyond the scope of this discussion document to do any more than canvas these cases briefly. This is done by reference to New Zealand cases, and English cases where relevant to New Zealand law. Case law in relation to the four categories of charitable purpose Relief of poverty 3.10 It has been held by the courts that “poverty” does not mean utter destitution. It simply means a need of some sort, either for a home, or for the means to provide for some necessity. 8 3.11 This category of charitable purpose also encompasses relief of the aged and impotent described in the preamble to the Charitable Uses Act. In Re Bingham, 9 it was held that a gift for the care of aged women was charitable under this category. It seems necessary, in this context, that some element of “need” associated with aging (for example, illness, infirmity or poverty) be present. 3.12 More recently, the New Zealand High Court held in D V Bryant Trust Board v Hamilton City Council 10 that a retirement village in Hamilton which charged rentals for units at well below market rates so that it was available to the elderly of moderate means was a charity. It was accepted that the trust that ran it was a substantial benefactor to the people of the Waikato and did not confer private benefits to any person. Advancement of education 3.13 The courts have interpreted the category of advancement of education liberally. It has been said that education is not restricted to the narrow sense of schools and universities, and includes increasing and promoting the appreciation of arts and culture. Thus, the promotion of choral singing has been held to be charitable in the United Kingdom. In New Zealand it has been held by the Court of Appeal in CIR v New Zealand Council of Law 6 \[1891\] AC 531 7 The dissenting minority in Pemsel were of the view that, for a taxing act, the words “charitable purposes” should be restricted to their “ordinary and natural” meaning, which was purposes for the relief of poverty. 8 IR Commrs. v Baddeley \[1955\] AC 572 at 585. 9 \[1951\] NZLR 491 10 \[1997\] 3 NZLR 342 18 Reporting 11 that the publication of law reports by the Council of Law Reporting (a non-profit body) is a charitable activity under this head. More recently, the High Court held in Educational Fees Protection Society Inc v CIR 12 that an incorporated society that had as its objectives the payment of the fees of school pupils on the death of a parent was charitable under this head. 3.14 Sporting purposes are not charitable in themselves. 13 However, sporting purposes have historically been charitable when undertaken through an educational facility. In IR Commrs v McMullen 14 the House of Lords held as charitable under the education head a trust to improve the sporting facilities available to students. The definition in New Zealand is broadened by section 61A of the Charitable Trusts Act 1957, under which it is charitable to provide, in the interests of social welfare, facilities for recreation or leisure time occupation. Advancement of religion 3.15 With respect to the advancement of religion, there is no distinction in case law between one religion and another or one sect and another, so the advancement of any religious doctrine could be considered charitable. The advancement of religion simply means the promotion of spiritual teaching in a wide sense. In Centrepoint Community Growth Trust v CIR 15 Tompkins J found that the trust, which had as one of its purposes the advancement of the spiritual education and humanitarian teaching of Herbert Thomas Potter, was charitable as being a trust established for the advancement of religion. For the purposes of the law, the criteria of religion are the belief in a supernatural being, thing or principle and the acceptance of certain canons of conduct in order to give effect to that belief. 3.16 This category includes a wide variety of activities associated with religion, such as the repair of churches, and the installation and building of stained glass windows and spires. It has also been held by the court that this charitable purpose includes a superannuation fund established to provide an annuity to ministers of religion in their retirement. 16 The fund’s objectives were the protection of its ministers of religion, by ensuring that they were provided with sufficient income throughout their life in accordance with their lifelong commitment to the church. The retired ministers who received a financial benefit were an integral part of the structure and workings of the church and without them the church would cease to exist. 11 \[1981\] 1 NZLR 682 12 (1991) 13 NZTC 8,203 13 Re Nottage \[1895\] 2 Ch 649, where a gift for the encouragement of yacht racing was held not charitable. Re Nottage was applied in Laing v Commissioner of Stamp Duties \[1948\] NZLR 154. In that case it was held that although sporting activities may result in greater physical fitness, and the indirect benefits to the public may be more highly valued, the purposes were still not within the analogy of the Charitable Uses Act 1601 (43 Eliz 1, c 4). 14 \[1980\] 1 All ER 884 15 \[1985\] 1 NZLR 673 16 Presbyterian Church of New Zealand Beneficiary Fund v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1994\] 3 NZLR 363. 19 Any other matter beneficial to the community 3.17 As would be expected, the fourth category of the Pemsel classification has the greatest variety of activities and purposes that have been considered charitable. It was held by the majority of the New Zealand Court of Appeal in CIR v Medical Council of NZ 17 that the Medical Council, which is a statutory body established, among other things, to maintain a formal system of registration of medical practitioners, was a charitable body. The court held that the purpose of the Medical Council was the protection of the public by ensuring that only those persons properly qualified could practise medicine. Perhaps more importantly, the court confirmed that the correct approach today is that objects that are beneficial to the community or are of public utility are prima facie charitable under the fourth category unless there are good reasons why they should not be. 3.18 Within this category, all manner of activities, including protection of animals, rehabilitation of prisoners, increasing the efficiency of the armed forces and promoting cremation as a means of disposing of the dead, have been held to be charitable. Political activities have been held not to be charitable. 17 \[1997\] 2 NZLR 297 20 Chapter 4 WHY REVIEW THE DEFINITION OF “CHARITABLE PURPOSE”? 4.1 Two main factors are behind the government’s interest in reviewing the definition of “charitable purpose”: that the charitable tax exemption may be too widely available, and it may be out of date. It may be that these problems are problems of perception only. The government has little information about the scope and cost of the tax exemption, so it is difficult to tell whether these problems are at the margin or are more general. For this reason, the reporting proposals discussed in chapter 8 are key. 4.2 Some sectors of the community have expressed concern that the charitable tax exemption is too widely available, and may be being used by some businesses to gain an advantage over their competitors. In that respect, it could be argued that the legal concept of a charity is now somewhat remote from the popular perception that a charity connotes “worthy” causes. These causes might involve the giving of assistance to less fortunate members of society, or providing for other activities that have clear and discernible benefits to the community as a whole. It is unlikely that in the public’s mind, the New Zealand Council for Law Reporting and the Medical Council, for example, would be considered charitable in the same way as, say, the Salvation Army or the Red Cross. 4.3 Furthermore, a definition used to make decisions about what is, in effect, government expenditure, and that is based on law up to 400 years old, should be reviewed in the light of the needs of New Zealand in the 21st century. The government is concerned to ensure that tax assistance is directed to those charitable purposes and activities that have broad-based community acknowledgement and support, and that those in greatest need of those resources have access to them. The fiscal privileges accorded to charities make it imperative that the definition of “charitable purpose” accords with society’s current objectives. 4.4 Other factors are that: • Concerns have been expressed that in some cases the benefit to society provided by an organisation is incidental to some other purpose it has undertaken. • As a technical matter, the definition of “charitable purpose” refers only to organisations established exclusively for charitable purposes. There is an argument that because of this, there is no legislative authority to challenge the tax exemption of an organisation that was established for, but no longer pursues, the relevant charitable purposes. 21 Chapter 5 OPTIONS FOR CHANGING THE DEFINITION 5.1 The definition of “charitable purpose” could be reformed in several ways, ranging from minimal to radical change. This chapter discusses two possible options: maintain the current broad definition but incorporate safeguards or use a new, broader definition with built-in safeguards. The government has also considered the possibility of using a radically limited definition, an approach described in detail below. However, because a large number of existing charities would no longer qualify as a charity for tax purposes if this definition were adopted, the government has decided not to proceed with this approach. 5.2 As discussed in chapter 1, both the options require some reporting requirements to be introduced. Reporting issues are discussed in Part III. Option 1: Maintain the current definition but with safeguards 5.3 This option recognises the difficulty of rewriting the current definition of “charitable purpose” completely, despite its acknowledged problems as identified in chapter 4. A reason for no change would be to avoid the uncertainty and the transitional problems that a new definition would create. Proposal 5.4 The four categories of “charitable purpose”, as are currently applied in New Zealand, would remain central to the definition. However, the tax exemption would be available only to registered charities (see chapter 8), and the wording of section CB 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994 would be amended so that an entity need not only be established for charitable purposes, but also must continue to carry out these charitable purposes for as long as it claims the tax exemption. 5.5 A variation could involve the government (on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance) having the ability to override any registration and to deregister a charity. This would be in keeping with recognising the tax exemption as an expenditure decision by the government and would allow the government to target those entities undertaking activities that it wishes or does not wish to support. To ensure that any such changes could be made within a reasonable timeframe and were transparent, they could be promulgated by Order in Council, and gazetted, and apply from the beginning of the following tax year. 22 Advantages 5.6 The advantages of maintaining the status quo in respect of the four categories of charitable purpose are simply that a large body of law already exists on what is a charitable purpose, and the rules have been relatively stable, although developing, for a long time. It would also avoid the transitional problems that would arise with a new definition. Some charities may have the power in their trust deeds to amend their trust purposes. There is otherwise no power to vary the purposes of a charitable trust unless it has become impossible, impractical, or inexpedient to carry them out (Charitable Trusts Act 1957, section 32). 5.7 The advantage of allowing the government the power to deem a particular entity not to be charitable is that it would allow decisions about government resources to be made in a manner consistent with evolving views on what constitutes a charitable purpose. Disadvantages 5.8 The definition would still be wide, although the problems identified in chapter 4 could be managed to some extent by the registration process, and/or the government’s discretion or override. Option 2: Replace the existing definition with a new, general definition assisted by detailed guidelines on how the definition should be applied, with specific approval required. 5.9 The specific references to poverty, education and religion would be removed but the entities covered by those categories could still qualify under the new definition on a case-by-case basis, subject to specific approval. This option would involve the same breadth of definition in general terms but would be quite different in its manner of operation, in particular because a specific approval would be required. 5.10 An example of generalised wording would be: “A charitable purpose means a humanitarian purpose that, when viewed objectively, makes a direct positive contribution to the well- being of society as a whole.” 5.11 The reason for adopting this approach would be to move away from existing case law, which may have expanded the boundaries of what is charitable to such an extent that it is now too easy to become a charity. One issue would be to ensure that the definition would be sufficiently different that the courts could not continue to apply the current case law. This definition would implicitly or explicitly be subject to the public benefit test. 23 5.12 A set of detailed guidelines would be required to give the general definition meaning and focus. The guidelines could be set by Order in Council and in that respect, could be more readily varied over time as the public perception of what is a charitable purpose changes. 5.13 Because specific approval would be needed before charitable status was conferred, responsibility for this would have to be undertaken by either a government department or some other body. The decision-maker would have to have regard to all relevant guidelines. In all but the most clear-cut cases, it would be a matter of fact and degree as to whether, after taking into account the relevant guidelines, a particular purpose was charitable. It would, of course, be up to each applicant to show the relevant benefit to society. The specific approval process is also discussed in chapter 8. 5.14 Possible guidelines could cover: • whether and to what extent the stated purpose complements or supplements the government’s measures on providing housing, food, education and other basic necessities of life; • whether and to what extent the stated purpose promotes education; • whether and to what extent the stated purpose promotes culture or the arts; • whether and to what extent the stated purpose propagates any religion or any set of beliefs, and if so, the nature of the principles, tenets or teachings sought to be promoted; • whether and to what extent the stated purpose provides support for people requiring health care or suffering some kind of disability, distress or suffering; and • whether and to what extent the stated purpose is directed to the protection and rescue of animals. 5.15 The government override discussed in option 1 could also be applied to this option. Advantages • This option would not immediately exclude a great number of current charities from the tax exemption. • It retains the flexibility of the fourth Pemsel category, although it requires that the charitable purpose makes a genuine contribution to the enhancement of society’s welfare. • It does away with the current Pemsel categories, thereby ensuring that no one purpose could claim to be prima facie charitable just because it falls within any one of the those categories. 24 • It provides transparency of decision making by the promulgation of guidelines which the decision-maker is required to have regard to. • A specific approval process would increase certainty for an organisation that it qualifies as a charity for tax purposes. • A specific approval process, by covering both applications for income tax exemption and donee status, 18 would reduce compliance costs. Disadvantages • Given that there is criticism that the current definition is too wide and uncertain, this option could be criticised as being no better. • Some of the guidelines could be criticised as being vague and difficult to apply. • Given that there would be a specific approval process, the information required from applicants to determine if they meet the definition could be considered onerous. • If the decision-maker were to be an independent body there could be high costs involved in setting up and maintaining such a body to grant specific approvals. • The transitional costs could be high as existing charities become subject to the new rules. Alternative approach: Limit the definition to the relief of poverty, illness, distress or other suffering 5.16 The government has also considered the approach of defining a charitable purpose to be the relief of poverty, illness, distress or other suffering. This is a similar concept to that outlined in the dictionary definition referred to in chapter 1. In essence, this limits the definition to only one of the categories of charitable purpose under current law. As is the case under current law, this definition would not be subject to the public benefit test. 5.17 The range of entities that would qualify for charitable status would narrow dramatically, and it is likely that a large number of entities now accepted as charitable under current law would not qualify under these criteria. Significantly, entities such as independent schools and affiliated organisations, universities and religious organisations (unless they form separate entities that have the purposes of the relief of poverty and other hardship) would not qualify. 18 A donee organisation within section KC 5(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 25 5.18 This approach could be modified by defining charitable purpose by reference to the concept of “needs”, rather than the possibly more restrictive concept of “poverty”. A possible alternative definition could incorporate some phrases from section 61A of the Charitable Trusts Act 1957 and could provide that: “charitable purpose means any purpose – (a) that improves the conditions of life of persons, who, by reason of their youth, age, infirmity, disablement or social or economic circumstances, are in need of any such assistance; or (b) that relieves any illness, suffering or other hardship.” 5.19 The definition might also incorporate the following phrases, based on section 38 of that Act: “Without in any way limiting the generality of \[the definition of charitable purpose\] purposes that improve the conditions of life of those persons requiring the assistance include – (a) the supply of the material needs of those persons; (b) the education, counselling and teaching of life-skills of those persons; (c) the provision of housing, shelter and food for those persons. (d) the provision of health and medical services for these persons.” Advantages • From the point of view of targeting government support of charities, narrowing the definition would mean that more resources were available to support those organisations that fall within it. • There is already a body of law in relation to “poverty” with which people are familiar, and the relief of illness, distress and other suffering have traditionally been “charitable” under the current definition. • This approach reflects the popular perception that charities are organisations having as their goal the alleviating of hardship and the provision of aid and assistance to the suffering and the needy. Disadvantages • A significant number of entities that are currently charities and the public has long acknowledged to be charitable (such as schools and churches) would fall out of the definition, except to the extent they were providing for the relief of poverty, and would have to adjust their expenditure to compensate for having to pay tax. This in turn means that there would be less money for those particular purposes, which by and large the community continues to support. 26 • There could be confusion over the fact that many entities would remain charities for other purposes, say, for the purpose of the Charitable Trusts Act 1957, but would not be “charitable” for tax purposes. 5.20 Given these significant disadvantages, the government has decided not to proceed with this approach. Blood ties, contractual arrangements and the public benefit test 5.21 The public benefit test must be satisfied before an entity qualifies as a charity, except in the case of a charity for the relief of poverty. Although the question of whether the public benefit test is satisfied is considered on the facts of each case, the courts have developed a number of general tests for determining whether the group benefiting constitutes the public or an appreciably significant section of the public. Through cases such as Re Compton 19 and Oppenheim v Tobacco Securities 20 it has been established that the number of beneficiaries must not be negligible. In addition, even if the number of beneficiaries is large, if those beneficiaries are determined on the basis of a personal relationship such as blood or contractual ties, the entity will not be for the public benefit. Rather it will be for the benefit of private individuals and, therefore, not charitable. 21 5.22 The House of Lords (Lord Cross) in Dingle v Turner 22 has questioned the Re Compton and Oppenheim tests, suggesting that the existence of a personal connection such as blood ties or a contract should not be determinative of whether an entity provides a public rather than a private benefit. Rather, consideration should also be given to the nature of the entity and the charitable purpose for which it was established, the number of beneficiaries and the degree of connection between the beneficiaries. Although the Re Compton and Oppenheim tests have continued to be applied in the English courts, Lord Cross’s comments have been noted with approval in two recent New Zealand cases. 23 Consequently, there is now a degree of uncertainty in New Zealand as to whether trusts for the benefit of persons who are determined by either a blood or contractual relationship will satisfy the public benefit test. 19 \[1945\] 1 All ER 198 20 \[1951\] 1 All ER 31 21 In Oppenheim’s case a gift for the education of the children of the employees and former employees of the company and its subsidiaries failed to qualify as a charity because the employees of a firm were not a public class. This was in spite of the fact that at the testator’s death the number of employees exceeded 110,000. 22 \[1972\] AC 601 23 New Zealand Society of Accountants v CIR \[1986\] 1 NZLR 147, Educational Fees Protection Society Incorporated v CIR (1991) 13 NZTC 8,203. 27 5.23 The inability of an entity to qualify for charitable status when its beneficiaries are determined on the basis of bloodlines has been raised by the Maori community as a major concern, although it is by no means an issue limited to Maori. Although Maori authorities often provide benefits of a charitable nature to iwi and hapu, they might not qualify for an exemption because their benefit extends to a specified group of people connected by blood ties. This issue is being considered as part of the government review of the taxation of Maori authorities. Proposal 5.24 One proposal likely to emerge from the government’s review of the taxation of Maori authorities is that an entity will not cease to be eligible for charitable status by reason only of the fact that its purpose is to benefit a group of people connected by blood ties. Other factors such as the nature of the entity, the number of potential beneficiaries, and the degree of relationship between beneficiaries would then have to be considered in determining whether an entity benefited a sufficient section of the public. 5.25 Although this proposal is especially relevant to iwi and hapu-based entities, it would apply to both Maori and non-Maori entities. Entities would no longer be prevented from having access to the charitable tax exemption solely because the potential beneficiaries might be related in some way. Submissions received in relation to this proposed change to the public benefit test will be considered in relation to both the review of the taxation of charities and the review of the taxation of Maori authorities. Specific issues for consultation Submissions are sought on these options, and the following issues, in particular: • Do you consider that the current definition of “charitable purpose” is too wide? • Do you consider the definition remains appropriate to New Zealand society in the 21st century? • If the current, or a new, definition were modified by guidelines, are those expressed above at option 2 appropriate? • Do you agree that the public benefit test should be liberalised to cover blood ties and contracts? Part III Reporting requirements for charities The government considers that some level of reporting requirements must be introduced so it can measure the effectiveness of its tax assistance to charities. Because of the lack of reporting requirements, there is no means by which the government can measure the cost of the income tax exemption, nor monitor the nature or activities of those entities benefiting from it. Accordingly, this part of the discussion document focuses on reporting requirements. It outlines what reporting arrangements currently exist for charities, the reasons for requiring more reporting and the proposed new reporting arrangements. 31 Chapter 6 CURRENT LAW AND PRACTICE 6.1 This chapter summarises the reporting requirements and other arrangements that can currently apply, in law or in practice, to certain charities. Accounting 6.2 No specific accounting standard applies to the preparation of accounts of charities or non-profit organisations in New Zealand. Nevertheless, any member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand preparing or auditing accounts for a charity is required to comply with generally accepted accounting principles. The Institute has issued a research bulletin on Financial Reporting by Voluntary Sector Entities (R-120, January 1999), setting out reporting guidelines for voluntary sector entities. Tax 6.3 As a matter of practice, most entities seeking charitable status will submit their founding documents to Inland Revenue for its view as to whether or not the entity is charitable at law. It should be noted, however, that this is neither required, nor is the Inland Revenue view binding, except when a binding ruling is obtained. Whether an entity is a charity for tax purposes is ultimately a matter for the courts. Thus it is possible for a charitable entity to exist and derive untaxed income without the government being aware of this. 6.4 If an organisation has donee status, those who make donations to it may claim rebates or tax deductions for them. Again, in practice, many organisations seek confirmation of this from Inland Revenue. The definition of “donee organisation” (in section KC 5 of the Income Tax Act 1994) is wider than that of a charity and includes any organisation, “the funds of which are applied wholly or principally for any charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes in New Zealand.” 6.5 Because donee status is limited to purposes within New Zealand, organisations with purposes outside New Zealand must seek and obtain specific legislative approval (see section KC 5(1)(ae) to (bv)). 32 6.6 Several provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994 potentially apply to charities: • Section 32 requires all gift-exempt bodies 24 to keep sufficiently accurate records, in English, to enable the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to determine both the sources of donations made to them and the application of those funds. • The Commissioner has the power under section 58 to require gift- exempt bodies to furnish a return showing the source and application of their funds (whether derived or actually received). • There is a general power in section 80 for the Commissioner to require any person, whether a taxpayer or not, to furnish any return the Commissioner considers necessary for the purposes of the Tax Administration Act or the Income Tax Act. • Under section 89, if the Commissioner has reason to believe that the funds of a gift-exempt body are being applied for a purpose that is not charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural, the Commissioner will inform the Minister. Charitable Trusts Act 6.7 The trustees of a charitable trust can, if they wish, incorporate as a board under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957. The big advantage of doing so is perpetual succession in that property is held in the name of the board and does not have to be transferred to new trustees when the membership of the board changes. Complaints about charities can be made to the Attorney- General, who has the power under section 58 of that Act to inquire into the management and administration of any charity, whether or not the trustees are a corporate body. Under section 60 of the Act, any member of the public can sue to enforce the charitable purposes of the trust. 24 A gift exempt body is an organisation within section KC 5(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994, and any other person issued with a certificate of exemption from resident withholding tax under subsections (1)(i) or (1)(j) of section NF 9 of the Act. Those subsections apply to persons deriving exempt income under: • section CB 3(a) and (b) – (public and local authorities); • section CB 4(1) – various exempt persons including charities; • section CB 5(1)(i) and section CB 9(e) – various categories of exempt income; and to non-profit bodies earning less than the $1000 limit provided in section DJ 17. 33 Chapter 7 WHY INCREASED REPORTING IS NECESSARY 7.1 Because current arrangements contain no obligatory reporting requirements for charities, it is possible for an entity to claim charitable status, and have access to the taxpayer subsidy without the government having knowledge of this, without any monitoring of the entity’s activities or the use of the funds it raises. This situation raises the following two concerns for the government. Cost of the subsidy 7.2 There is no means by which the government can know how much it is spending on the charitable tax exemption, although information is available about the amount of rebates claimed. 7.3 A government decision to not collect tax from a certain sector of society can be regarded as similar to a government expenditure decision. Ideally, then, the government should be in a position to know how much of taxpayers’ money is being “spent” as a result of such a decision. Although many charities register under the Charitable Trusts Act, or submit their documentation to Inland Revenue, there is no complete list of organisations benefiting from the tax exemption, or information about the extent to which they are benefiting. Further, the government does not know how much of the subsidy is being spent on charitable purposes outside New Zealand (see chapter 10). If this information were available to the government, it is possible that more accurate targeting of government assistance could take place. Accountability 7.4 Apart from random Inland Revenue audits and the provisions of the Charitable Trusts Act, there is no process for monitoring whether entities are pursuing the charitable purposes for which they were set up. 7.5 Inland Revenue has a role in monitoring charities to ensure that section CB 4 of the Income Tax Act is being complied with. However, regular monitoring would involve extremely pro-active audit activity on the part of Inland Revenue, as no information is available to the department on which it can make a decision to conduct an audit. 7.6 When the government contracts with voluntary organisations or others to provide services in the community, some form of reporting is always required. The level of reporting varies from sector to sector. It sometimes involves detailed, itemised budgets, and in some cases focuses more on outputs produced. The level of reporting can also depend on the amount of funding involved. Generally, the government expects audited accounts to be 34 provided to ensure that public money is being used for the purposes for which it was intended. No such accountability is required for the charitable tax exemption to be accessed. 7.7 As part of this accountability question, it is not always clear whether profits of commercial operations carried on by, or owned by charities are distributed to the charitable purposes for which the entity was established. 7.8 If a charity is raising funds by means of conducting a profitable business activity, this in theory is no different from raising funds by any other means. However, if profits are not being distributed to charitable purposes but being re-invested into the business, it may be that the charitable purposes are not being met (see chapter 9). 35 Chapter 8 OPTIONS FOR CHANGE 8.1 This chapter details several proposals for improving reporting requirements for charities. They include registration, filing annual audited accounts (possibly to be made public), filing tax returns and other regular monitoring. 8.2 Administration of any of the reporting requirements discussed here could be undertaken by Inland Revenue, another government department, or an independent body. It may be that a party other than Inland Revenue would be in a better position to undertake this administration, given that the secrecy provisions of the Tax Administration Act 1994 would inhibit transparency. In some cases, if Inland Revenue were the appropriate body, the Tax Administration Act might have to be amended to avoid this problem. Registration 8.3 At present, there is no requirement that a charitable entity be registered as such. Proposal 8.4 It is proposed that in order to qualify for the various tax subsidies, an entity would have to officially notify the government, by means of a set procedure, that it considers itself to be a charity for tax purposes. Under this proposal, there would be no formal approval process, although the entity might be required at a later stage to demonstrate that it meets charitable purposes. This process would not, however, preclude application to Inland Revenue for informal confirmation that the founding documents prima facie demonstrate charitable purposes. 8.5 Registration could be with Inland Revenue, another government department or an independent body. However, the list of registered charities should be publicly available, so if the register were maintained with Inland Revenue, it should not be subject to the usual Inland Revenue secrecy provisions. 8.6 This registration requirement would apply to existing as well as new charities. For existing charities, there could be a period within which registration must take place, say, one year, before the tax exemption would be withdrawn. 8.7 The registering body would have power to de-register a charity if it were found not to be pursuing its stated charitable purposes, or if it had failed to meet other obligations imposed upon it (for example, if charities were required to file tax returns, or annual accounts, and had failed to do this). 36 Advantages 8.8 The government and the public would have access to better information about the number and type of entities benefiting from the tax exemption. Disadvantages 8.9 The only real disadvantage of registration requirements would be increased compliance costs, although they should be one-off and not particularly onerous. Many charities already seek Inland Revenue’s view as to their charitable status or donee status. Approved registration 8.10 As an alternative, the government has considered a procedure which is common overseas, whereby registration would be approved before the tax subsidies were available. This approach was referred to, together with its advantages and disadvantages, in chapter 5 when discussing the option of replacing the current definition of “charitable purpose” with a new, general definition. But it could be applied to any of the definition options. 8.11 The approval requirement would apply to existing as well as new charities, which would raise transitional issues that would have to be dealt with. 8.12 Essentially, approved registration would involve an assessment of whether the purposes for which the entity was established were charitable, and would likely be binding on both the charity and Inland Revenue. Because of the binding nature of the decision, it would have to be administered by an independent body. Issues would then arise as to the funding, composition and role of such a body. The role of the courts would be confined to that of judicial review of the decision-making process. It would also likely involve on-going monitoring by that body of the activities of the charity. Annual accounts 8.13 As noted earlier, most organisations receiving government funding are required to provide audited annual accounts, for accountability of the public money they receive. Given that the tax subsidies are a form of public funding, in principle those taking advantage of them should also be required to provide accounts. Even with a registration process in place, some form of continuous monitoring is important, to ensure continued adherence to the relevant charitable purposes. 37 Proposal 8.14 Each registered charity should be required to prepare audited annual accounts. These should be filed with an appropriate body, and made publicly available. The accounts would be in accordance with New Zealand accounting standards, and should, at a minimum, show all amounts actually distributed to charitable purposes, both in New Zealand and overseas. Advantages 8.15 If these accounts were required to be made public, not only would the government have information about how the tax forgone had been spent, but the public would have access to information about how its donations had been spent. Disadvantages 8.16 As with registration, the only disadvantage of this proposal is increased compliance costs for charities. However, many charitable organisations prepare accounts already and, in fact, some make these public. Possible threshold 8.17 For some smaller charities, preparation and auditing of annual accounts may give rise to disproportionate compliance costs. It may be that an income threshold should be introduced for those smaller charities that should not be required to comply to the same extent. For these smaller charities, it may be that a simple income and assets statement would be sufficient. Tax returns Proposal 8.18 Charities would file an annual income tax return with Inland Revenue. The Commissioner already has power, under section 58 of the Tax Administration Act, to require “gift-exempt” organisations to file returns, although this provision is rarely used. The return could require details of: • income – amounts and sources; • expenditure – including details of amounts distributed to charitable purposes (including amounts distributed overseas); • assets and liabilities; and perhaps • remuneration bands for senior staff. 38 Advantages 8.19 The advantage of filing annual income tax returns, over and above any requirement to provide accounts, would be that more accurate information about the amount of tax forgone would be available to the government. The administration costs involved in Inland Revenue reviewing the accounts of all charities to extract this information are likely to be higher than the compliance costs involved for charities in filing a tax return, given that they would be preparing annual accounts. Disadvantages 8.20 Again, compliance costs are the only disadvantage. The government has considered whether smaller charities (say, those who would not have to file audited accounts) should be exempt from this requirement. However, if those smaller charities were to prepare an income and asset statement, it might not be unduly onerous to convert that information into a tax return. Other forms of regular monitoring 8.21 The purpose of the charitable tax exemption is to subsidise spending on charitable purposes. If profits are not being distributed to the relevant charitable purpose, the objective of the tax exemption is not being met. 8.22 The government envisages that the activities of charities would be regularly monitored to ensure that an organisation was charitable at law and was applying its funds for charitable purposes. A charity that was accumulating significant funds, for example, could be asked to explain the reasons for such accumulation. 8.23 A list of registered charities, combined with information from annual accounts and returns would enable the design of a better-targeted audit programme by Inland Revenue. One option is to tie the provision of tax returns to an Inland Revenue audit programme so that only those that are audited would be required to file returns. This approach has recently been adopted in the United Kingdom . This approach would not require legislative change in New Zealand, given section 58 of the Tax Administration Act. 8.24 Although this discussion assumes that regular monitoring would be conducted by Inland Revenue, it would be possible for this activity to be undertaken instead by another government department or an independent body. If registration were to involve specific approval, the body that undertook that approval process could also undertake other functions such as auditing. 39 Specific issues for consultation • Should registration be subject to a formal approval process? • If so, what would be an appropriate time frame in which to require existing charities to obtain approval? • Should audited annual accounts of charities be made publicly available? • Should there be an income threshold for smaller charities? At what level of income should any such threshold be set? • Should tax returns be required only on a regular sample basis? • Should regular monitoring be undertaken by Inland Revenue as part of an audit programme, or by some other body? Part IV Specific income tax issues This part covers a range of specific issues that have been raised from time to time. All relate to aspects of the Income Tax Act 1994 and in some cases are interconnected with the definition and reporting issues discussed earlier. The specific issues are: • the tax treatment of trading operations run by charities; • what limits should apply to charities with purposes outside New Zealand; • the level of assistance to individual and corporate donors; • whether imputation credits should be refunded; • recognition of fringe benefits provided to employees of charities; and • the status of superannuation schemes for employees of charities. 43 Chapter 9 CHARITIES’ TRADING OPERATIONS 9.1 Many charities raise funds through trading activities. The scale of these activities can vary considerably, from a fete stall to a large-scale business, and in some cases the activities are carried out by an entity separate from the charity. The income earned from these activities is tax-exempt; in other words, it is treated the same as any other income earned by a charity, on the basis that the profits from the activities will be ultimately used for charitable purposes. 9.2 A criticism often levelled at this exemption is that it provides the trading activity with a competitive advantage over its tax-paying competitors. One element of a firm’s normal cost structure, income tax, is not present in the case of the charity-run trading operation. It is argued that this “lower” cost could be used by a large-scale entity to undercut its competitors, in order to improve its market share or to deter new entrants. 9.3 Any one type of cost, however, cannot be looked at in isolation. Because the tax-exempt entity can generally earn tax-free returns from all forms of investment, 25 the “after tax” return it expects from a trading activity is correspondingly higher than that of its taxed competitors. Therefore an income tax-exempt entity cannot rationally afford to lower its profit margins on a trading activity, as alternative forms of investment would then become relatively more attractive. 9.4 On this basis, the tax-exempt entity will charge the same price as its competitors. The tax exemption merely translates to higher profits and, hence, higher potential distributions to the relevant charitable purpose. Consequently, funding the charitable activity from trading activities is no more distortionary than sourcing it from “passive” investments, such as interest on bank deposits, or from direct fund raising. 9.5 In the short term, a large-scale tax-exempt entity could try to use its “deeper pockets” to eliminate competitors by temporarily lowering its prices, although there is no real evidence to suggest that this is occurring. 9.6 A charity could have a competitive advantage, however, if it were to accumulate its tax-free profits back into the capital structure of its trading activities, enabling it, through a faster accumulation of funds, to expand more rapidly than its competitors. We consider that this is the real competitive advantage that trading activities owned by charities have over their competitors. This competitive advantage potentially applies to other forms of income earned by charities, although there is more scope for that 25 An exception is investment in domestic equity, as imputation credits are non-refundable (see chapter 13). 44 advantage to create distortions within the market in which a charity is trading than in other markets. 9.7 Further, it is possible that some benefit of the tax-free gains could be captured by individuals involved in the trading operation. This is contrary to the principles supporting the income tax exemption for charities. At present, however, a charity loses its tax exemption if a person who is in a position to influence remuneration or other financial benefits paid by a charity receives such remuneration or benefits. 26 Proposal 9.8 Trading operations owned by charities would be subject to tax in the same way as other businesses, but with an unlimited deduction for distributions made to the relevant charitable purposes. Donations made to other charities would be subject to the same deduction limits as other companies (see chapter 11). Because the competitive advantage arises only from the ability to grow a business faster by accumulating pre-tax funds, this proposal might not be necessary if accumulations were monitored. As noted earlier in the discussion on reporting requirements, although there need not be specific limits on accumulations, the accumulation of funds could lead to questions from the monitoring authority as to why this was happening. Advantages 9.9 If a trading operation of a charity were being used as a means of raising funds for distribution to the relevant charitable purposes, the income would effectively be exempt, as the deduction for funds distributed appropriately would cover the relevant income. Although this rule could be circumvented by distributing and then immediately reinvesting funds, this would show up in the accounts of the charity. This could raise questions as to whether the charity was as a matter of fact pursuing its charitable objectives (see chapter 3). Disadvantages 9.10 Removal of the exemption and its replacement with a deduction for distributions made to a parent charity would impose compliance and administrative costs, although charities should have information on their income and distributions readily available. This could be a problem particularly for charities with small-scale trading activities, in which case a turnover threshold could be introduced, below which the activity would not be taxed. 26 In its 1989 report, the Working Party on Charities and Sporting Bodies made a number of recommendations aimed at tightening section CB 4(1)(e) (section 61(27) of the Income Tax Act 1976) (see pages 37-41 of the report). 45 Specific issues for consultation • Would the alternative of limits on accumulations of profits of businesses run by charities be preferable? • Given that accumulation problems might also arise with passive investment activities, would you prefer to see the proposed rules apply to investment as well as trading activity? • What level of threshold might be appropriate for small-scale trading activities? 46 Chapter 10 CHARITIES WITH PURPOSES OUTSIDE NEW ZEALAND 10.1 At present, the general rules that provide donors with rebates and deductions for their donations cover only charitable purposes within New Zealand. Specific parliamentary approval is required on a case-by-case basis for charities whose charitable purposes extend outside New Zealand. The over forty organisations that have such approval are listed separately in section KC 5(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 10.2 Reasons for this restriction are a combination of concern about to what purposes donations might be put, as well as acknowledging that the tax assistance is a specific government expenditure decision and should be consistent with New Zealand’s overseas aid programme. 10.3 Accordingly, over the years a set of criteria has been established for approving organisations seeking donor status with charitable purposes outside New Zealand. The funds have to be applied towards either: • the relief of poverty, hunger, sickness or ravages of war or natural disaster; or • the economy of developing countries (recognised as such by the United Nations); or • raising the educational standards of a developing country. 10.4 Specifically excluded have been charities formed for the principal purpose of fostering or administering any religion, cult or political creed. 10.5 The rules differ in respect of the income tax exemptions. Under section CB 4(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act, funds from business activities of a charity in New Zealand must be applied to charitable purposes within New Zealand. 27 However, there is no such restriction on the tax exemption under section CB 4(1)(c), the general income tax exemption for charities. There seems to be no good reason for treating one form of funding differently from another. Proposal 10.6 The approaches to all forms of tax assistance to charities with overseas purposes would be standardised. The criteria currently used in respect of donee status, described earlier, would be applied in determining eligibility for both the income tax exemptions and for donee status. 27 If the funds are used for purposes both within and outside New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue can apply apportionment so that only part of the income is tax-exempt. 47 10.7 This means that in respect of the general income tax exemption (CB 4(1)(c)), the eligibility criteria would be tightened, because income applied for some overseas purposes would no longer be eligible for the exemption. However, the eligibility criteria would be liberalised in respect of a charity’s business activities (CB 4(1)(e)) because income applied for some overseas purposes would then be eligible for the exemption. 10.8 For a charity to comply with this requirement, the overseas charitable purposes of the organisation would have to be approved, as currently happens with donee organisations. 10.9 All charities would be required to report how much they were distributing overseas. If a charity did not meet the criteria in relation to its overseas purposes, but was also undertaking charitable purposes within New Zealand, the amount of income that would be exempt would be determined by apportionment. 10.10 There is no intention to tax the donation income of an entity when it becomes taxable in respect of income it applies overseas. Advantages 10.11 A common set of criteria would apply to both the tax exemption and the rebate and deduction rules for donations. Also, charities operating as a business would receive increased support as they would be eligible for the exemption in respect of income applied for some overseas purposes. Disadvantages 10.12 Charities currently operating overseas might receive less government support (as they could be taxed on some part of their income) if they did not meet the criteria. As well, obtaining approval would create compliance costs for those charities currently operating overseas. Specific issues for consultation • What would be the best method for approving organisations with overseas charitable purposes? 48 Chapter 11 THE TAX TREATMENT OF DONATIONS MADE BY INDIVIDUALS AND COMPANIES 11.1 Governments provide assistance to charities in respect of the donations they receive in several ways: • a deduction of the donation from the donor’s income; • a tax rebate, credit or refund at a fixed rate; and • a grant to charities, either directly or, for example, by matching donations received. 11.2 In New Zealand, donations of money made by individuals and companies are subsidised through the tax system. Individuals receive rebates, while companies are able to claim deductions. Both forms of assistance are capped. The issues that have been raised in relation to this assistance are whether the incentives are appropriate and sufficiently flexible. 11.3 A rebate or deduction effectively provides the donor with more after-tax income and reduces the cost of donating relative to the price of other goods and services consumed by the donor. This is an advantage of providing a tax subsidy to encourage charitable giving, since it may lead to an increase in the level of donations made. 28 11.4 A problem with using the tax system in this way, however, is that government revenue that is forgone is determined by the donor’s tax rate and the amount donated. As a result, support may be biased towards the charitable purposes chosen by higher income earners, and the government is left with no control over the aggregate amount of support it provides. 11.5 In the case of the individual rebate, this is mitigated by the rebate being allowed at a fixed 33 cents in the dollar only, and the limit on the amount of donation eligible for the rebate. Likewise, in the case of the company deduction, the company rate is fixed at 33 cents in the dollar, and the amount of the donation eligible for the deduction is capped. 28 See, for example, the following empirical studies: • Feldstein M (1975) “Income tax and charitable contributions: Aggregate and distributional effects”, National Tax Journal 28(1) 81-100; • Brown E (1987) “Tax incentives and charitable giving – evidence from new survey data”, Public Finance Quarterly 15(4) 386-396; and • Clotfelter CT (1985) “Federal tax policy and charitable giving”, National Bureau of Economic Research, University of Chicago Press . 49 11.6 Figure 1 shows the wide variety of income groups in New Zealand that claim the rebate. Even though the proportion of income earners who claim a rebate increases as income increases (from around 20 percent at $10,000 to nearly 50 percent at $100,000), those with annual taxable incomes under $40,000 claimed 70 percent of the total rebates. F IGURE 1: 1999 D ONATIONS R EBATE B Y T AXABLE I NCOME Rebate limit for donations – individuals 11.7 At present, individuals can claim a tax rebate at a set 33 cents in the dollar up to a maximum of $1,500 of donations made to “donee organisations”. Donee organisations are those entities that meet the requirements in section KC 5(1) of the Income Tax Act, which include all charities. Donations must be in cash in order to qualify. Proposal 11.8 Since it was set over ten years ago the $1,500 limit would be raised in line with inflation since 1990. This would increase the limit to $1,800 per individual per year, making for a maximum rebate of $600. There should be legislative authority for this limit to be amended by regulation, which would facilitate future adjustments for inflation. 1999 Donations Rebate by taxable income 0.0 5.0 10.0 15.0 20.0 25.0 Nil/negative $1 - $10,000 $10,001-$20,000$20,001-$30,000$30,001-$40,000$40,001-$50,000$50,001-$60,000$60,001-$70,000$70,001-$80,000$80,001-$90,000 $90,001-$100,000 Over $100,000 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 45% 50% Rebate claimed ($M, left axis) Pro portion of tax returns with a rebate claim (right axis) $M Proportion of tax returns with a rebate claim (right axis) Rebate claimed ($M, left axis) 50 Other matters considered 11.9 The government also considered whether donations other than in cash should also be eligible for the rebate. However, to allow this would lead to increased compliance costs for taxpayers, and administrative costs for Inland Revenue, as it would give rise to questions as to the valuation of the donated goods and services. When rebates are available for non-cash donations, complex valuation rules are required, and anecdotal evidence from other jurisdictions suggests this can give rise to tax planning opportunities. Even when values are readily identifiable, the outcome of donating goods or services needs to be the same as when the goods or services are sold and the proceeds donated. For example, tax on the sale of a revenue account asset should not be avoided by donating that asset. Because of these complexities, the rebate would not be extended to non-cash donations. 11.10 Nor does the government favour introducing “payroll giving”. Payroll giving is a scheme in the United Kingdom that involves donors electing in advance for regular donations to be deducted from their salary and wages on a before- tax basis. The same result can be achieved in New Zealand by donating from after-tax salary and wages and claiming a rebate from Inland Revenue. Payroll giving, although it would eliminate the need to claim a rebate in some cases, would have compliance costs for the employer. It would involve administrative costs for Inland Revenue, since levels of rebates claimed would have to be matched against payroll giving to ensure that the rebate limits were adhered to. Deduction limit for donations – companies 11.11 At present, companies other than close companies 29 can claim a deduction for donations to donee organisations up to the prescribed annual limits in section DJ 4 of the Income Tax Act. Those limits are: • a maximum to any one donee of 1 percent of net income of the company or $4,000, whichever is greater; and • an aggregate maximum of 5 percent of net income of the company or $1,000, whichever is greater. 11.12 It can be argued that no deduction for charitable donations should be available to companies, as individual shareholders should be able to decide directly to which charities they want to donate out of the income they earn from their holding. This would not preclude companies undertaking tax deductible sponsorship or advertising, because there is either a direct or indirect benefit to the shareholder. However, because the government is committed to assisting the charitable sector the current deduction will be retained. 29 A company controlled by five or fewer people, as defined in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. 51 11.13 As with the rebate for donations by individuals, the government also considered whether donations by companies could be made in a form other than cash. For the same reasons, the government does not favour extending the deduction to cover non-cash donations. Proposal 11.14 The current limits would be simplified by removing both the limit on donations to any one donee and the aggregate limit of $1,000. This would leave companies free to donate up to 5 percent of net income (calculated before taking account of the donation) to donee organisations in any one year. There have been recent calls for further taxpayer subsidy of donations made to educational institutions by companies. Liberalising the donation deduction rules in this way should facilitate such giving. 11.15 The removal of the $1000 limit could limit the deduction available to companies with net income of less than $20,000. However, companies with net income below this level are unlikely to be making significant donations. Further, in practice many of those companies will be closely held companies that are not entitled to the deduction. 11.16 The government also proposes that this deduction be extended to close companies provided they are listed on a recognised stock exchange. 30 The close company restriction is designed to protect minority shareholders, as well as to provide some level of protection to the tax base. The current restriction is unnecessary in the case of companies listed on the stock exchange, given directors’ fiduciary duties to shareholders, and the public scrutiny and disclosure requirements to which listed companies are subject. 11.17 In line with proposals likely to emerge from the review of the taxation of Maori authorities, Maori authorities would be able to deduct donations to donee organisations in the same way. At present, they are allowed a deduction only for donations to Maori associations. 30 “Recognised exchange” is a defined term in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. 52 Chapter 12 OTHER INCOME TAX ISSUES Imputation 12.1 Charitable organisations that receive dividends with imputation credits attached cannot use those credits. The reason is that charities are exempt from tax, so do not have tax liabilities against which they might apply the tax credits. Because imputation credits are not refundable, the benefit of imputation credits is effectively lost to charities. This means, in effect, that their income from domestic equity is taxed. 12.2 The same problem does not arise in respect of active domestic investment, overseas equities or debt. When a charity owns a business outright, that business’s profits are exempt from tax. In the case of debt, charities are eligible to obtain a certificate exempting them from resident withholding tax on interest. In respect of offshore equity investments, the issue of imputation credits does not arise. 12.3 This means that charities are discouraged from investing in domestic equity. One way of resolving this would be to allow charities, and possibly other exempt or loss-making entities that cannot use imputation credits, a refund of the tax paid on their behalf by the company (represented by the imputation credit). 12.4 As discussed at Part I, this review is intended to be broadly fiscally neutral. Because the cost of such a measure is potentially high, significant savings would have to be made in other areas of the tax treatment of charities before such a measure could be considered. Moreover, the issue would have to be considered in the wider context of any initiatives in relation to the treatment of other exempt entities and non-residents. 12.5 For these reasons, the government does not intend to address this issue at present. Once the government has more information on charities’ activities, it will be in a better position to assess the relevant fiscal cost. Fringe benefit tax 12.6 Section CI 1(m) of the Income Tax Act 1994 provides that benefits provided to employees of charitable organisations are not subject to fringe benefit tax, although this exemption does not apply to employees of businesses run by charities. It is proposed that the existing exemption from fringe benefit tax be removed. 53 12.7 Employees of tax-exempt organisations are taxed on their employment income. Fringe benefit tax is a substitute for the income tax that would be paid by an employee on remuneration received in monetary form. There is no reason that employees of charities should be exempt from tax on remuneration paid in kind. It follows, therefore, that there is no reason that the charities employing those people should be exempt from fringe benefit tax if they choose to remunerate their staff by payment in kind. 12.8 This view is consistent with a recommendation of the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance. Superannuation schemes for employees of charities 12.9 A similar issue, also raised by the Committee of Experts, is the tax treatment of superannuation schemes for the benefit of employees of charities. In the case of Presbyterian Church of New Zealand Beneficiary Fund, 31 the court held that the income earned by a fund to provide an annuity to retired ministers was exempt from tax. This was on the basis that by providing financial security for retired ministers who were an integral part of the church, the fund fostered the charitable purpose of the employer. 12.10 The Committee of Experts recommended that the Income Tax Act be amended to clarify that superannuation schemes for the benefit of employees of charities should not have charitable status. The basis for this recommendation is that income earned by such schemes accrues to the benefit of the individual employees and is equivalent, from a policy perspective, to salary and wages, which are taxed. 12.11 This issue is intertwined with the definition of “charitable purpose” and, as such, may be implicitly addressed under the options outlined earlier for that definition. Alternatively, the issue may need to be addressed more explicitly, as recommended by the Committee of Experts. Specific issues for consultation • Should superannuation schemes for employees of charities have charitable status? 31 \[1994\] 3 NZLR 363. See also discussion in chapter 3 on “Advancement of religion”. Part V GST This final part of the discussion document looks at GST as it affects all non-profit bodies, including charities. 57 Chapter 13 GST ISSUES 13.1 Charities and other non-profit bodies carry on a wide range of activities. If they are registered for GST purposes they must generally account for GST in relation to those activities much like any other business. They may claim credits (input tax credits 32 ) for GST incurred on goods and services they acquire, and must charge GST (output tax) on goods and services they supply, in relation to those activities. The current legislation is, however, unclear with regard to the activities of charities and other non-profit bodies involving non-taxable supplies, such as collecting donations. 13.2 This chapter contains proposals to provide certainty for charities and other non-profit bodies in claiming credits for expenses incurred in making non- taxable supplies and determining the supplies for which they must charge GST. Current treatment 13.3 The Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 does not specifically define “charities” for the purpose of GST. Instead the Act includes a definition of “non-profit bodies” which includes all charities as well as other non-profit bodies. Table 1 sets out the activities of charities and other non-profit bodies and their current GST treatment. T ABLE 1: GST AND N ON -P ROFIT B ODIES ActivityExampleGST treatment Taxable supplies Making supplies for payment Premises for hire to the public for social functions Credits allowed GST charged Exempt supplies Selling donated goods and services Second-hand goods stall operated by a charity No credits allowed No GST charged 33 Other non-taxable supplies Collecting donationsDonations collected as a result of a TV advertising campaign Credits are being allowed No GST charged 32 An input tax credit is defined in section 3A of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 as tax charged under section 8(1). Section 8 imposes goods and services tax on supplies. Registered persons are entitled to claim input tax credits for the GST incurred on goods and services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. 33 The supply of donated goods and services by a charity is specifically treated as an exempt supply under the GST Act. 58 13.4 Table 1 shows that in relation to non-taxable supplies, other than exempt supplies, credits are being allowed in relation to activities for which no GST is charged. However, it is not clear from the legislation whether or not this practice is correct. Taxable supplies 13.5 A person who carries on an activity involving the supply of goods and services in exchange for payment may register for GST purposes. Therefore charities and other non-profit bodies making taxable supplies are entitled to register for GST purposes and be subject to the normal GST rules, meaning they are able to claim credits on goods and services acquired but are required to pay GST on goods and services supplied. If a person or entity has a turnover of greater than $40,000 in any 12-month period it is required to register for GST. A charity or other non-profit body that carries on a taxable activity but makes supplies for less than $40,000 may register for GST purposes if it wishes. In practice, many non-profit bodies carrying on taxable activities have registered voluntarily. Exempt supplies 13.6 Registered persons charge GST on goods and services they supply but are able to claim credits for the GST incurred in relation to goods and services acquired in making supplies. Non-registered persons or persons supplying only exempt goods and services do not charge GST on these supplies and are not entitled to credits for the related GST they incur. Non-taxable supplies 13.7 Under the current GST legislation there is some doubt as to whether credits are available in relation to activities that do not involve the supply of goods and services in exchange for payment (non-taxable supplies). For example, although fund-raising activities are a necessary aspect of sustaining the income of a charity or other non-profit body, genuine donations are a gift rather than a payment for the supply of goods and services and, for this reason, are not subject to GST. Current practice 13.8 Inland Revenue’s policy is to deny credits for expenditure relating to exempt supplies but to allow credits for expenditure relating to taxable and non- taxable supplies. Most charities and other non-profit bodies incur expenditure in excess of the value of their taxable supplies, which results in their receiving refunds of GST rather than paying GST. The government considers that the uncertainty as to whether or not current practice is correct is undesirable. It is therefore proposed that the legislation be amended to make it clear. 59 13.9 Clarification is also needed as to which supplies of charities and other non- profit bodies attract GST. Proposals Claiming credits 13.10 The GST Act would be amended to clarify that GST-registered charities and other non-profit bodies are entitled to claim credits in relation to all their activities. These activities would include the collection of donations, but exclude supplies of donated goods and services or any other supplies which are specifically treated as exempt supplies. The definition of “input tax” would be amended to specifically allow charities and other non-profit bodies to do this. This will provide much needed certainty for charities and other non-profit bodies in relation to their GST obligations. Charging GST 13.11 In the GST Act, an “unconditional gift”, 34 such as a donation, is excluded from the definition of “consideration” (payment), and so does not provide the necessary linkage to a supply. Hence GST is not payable in respect of genuine donations. 13.12 The Court of Appeal in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v New Zealand Refining Co Ltd established that “a linkage between supply and consideration is requisite to the imposition of the tax.” 35 This indicates that the exclusion for unconditional gifts is unnecessary as genuine donations would not have a sufficient linkage with a supply to meet the definition of consideration. The definition of “consideration” should be amended accordingly by removing the unnecessary reference to “unconditional gift”. In making the distinction between what is and what is not an unconditional gift, reliance will, therefore, be on the ordinary principles set out in the GST legislation (that is, whether there is a link between the supply and the consideration) rather than on the legislative definition of “consideration”, which has proved at times to be difficult to interpret. 34 “Unconditional gift” means a payment voluntarily made to any non-profit body for carrying on or carrying out the purposes of that non-profit body and in respect of which no identifiable direct valuable benefit arises or may arise in the form of a supply of goods and services to the person making that payment, or any other person where that person and that other person are associated persons; it does not include any payment made by the Crown or a public authority. 35 (1997) 18 NZTC 13,187 at 13,193 60 13.13 Genuine donations to charities do not involve a taxable supply of goods or services, and no GST should be charged. This also includes donations given in exchange for an item such as a sticker or flower, where there is no fixed minimum charge required for the item to be given. However, any payment which is in return for a supply of goods or services would be viewed as consideration for a supply and not a genuine donation. When a basic minimum charge is stipulated in return for goods and services, such as a voucher booklet offering a variety of discounts, the supply should be subject to GST by reference to that minimum charge. To the extent that an amount in excess of the stipulated amount is provided to the charity or non-profit body, that excess would be a genuine donation and not subject to GST. 13.14 Clarifying in the legislation the requirement for a link between consideration and supply would necessitate a review by Inland Revenue of its policy in this area. This could include more detail as to the type of donations that are regarded as consideration for a supply. This would make it easier for charities and other non-profit bodies to identify which supplies should have a GST component, and which supplies should not have a GST component. Specific issues for consultation • Do you agree that GST registered charities and other non-profit bodies should be able to claim input tax credits for expenses incurred in making non-taxable supplies? • Do you agree with the proposed removal of the definition of “unconditional gift”, placing reliance on the ordinary principles set out in the GST legislation?

A Challenge in an Electronic Commerce Environment A Government discussion document Hon Dr Michael Cullen Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue Hon Paul Swain Associate Minister of Finance and Revenue John Wright MP Parliamentary Under- Secretary to the Minister of Revenue First published in June 2001 by the Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department, P O Box 2198, Wellington. GST and imported services – a challenge in an electronic commerce environment; A Government discussion document. ISBN 0-478-10344-1 PREFACE Things have changed in the nearly fifteen years since GST was first introduced. Some of the assumptions and realities which underpinned the design of GST no longer hold true. Removal of regulations from the telecommunications and financial services industries have opened them up to competition. Legal and technological constraints which had acted to stifle international trade in goods and services have faded away. New Zealanders have become part of the global economy. As a result we are importing more services than when GST was designed. The development of electronic commerce will further increase the extent to which New Zealanders are able to purchase both goods and services from offshore. Today, if you were to buy services from a New Zealand company, GST is charged. If instead you purchase services from a foreign company supplying services from offshore, GST is not charged. This document examines this tax treatment in the light of changes in the economy and in technology. This document contains proposals that aim to ensure that the GST system adjusts to the electronic commerce environment and does not unfairly disadvantage New Zealand service industries. It is part of a continuing review of GST and a part of the Government’s electronic commerce strategy, as set out in the Government strategy paper E-Commerce : Building the Strategy for New Zealand . We look forward to receiving your submissions on this document.

This was raised as an issue for further development in the Government discussion document GST: A Review in March 1999 and in the Government strategy paper E-Commerce : Building the Strategy for New Zealand in November 2000. It proposes that GST be imposed on imports of services by registered persons making non-taxable supplies, adopting the “reverse charge” mechanism. It also sets out the proposed scope and general features of the mechanism, and signals further areas for development of GST in the future. Objectives General objectives 1.2 The proposals contained in this discussion document are intended to improve the efficiency and equity of GST, reduce future erosion of the tax base resulting from the growth in electronic commerce and bring New Zealand into line with the internationally accepted GST framework. The proposals are also intended to clarify the international boundary in relation to GST. 1.3 This discussion document examines the current GST treatment of imported services in the light of: • the increase in the volume of imported services since the introduction of GST in 1986; • the potential for future increases in the volume of imported services, including digitised products, arising from the rapid growth in electronic commerce; • the associated potential for future revenue loss from the GST base as a larger volume of services consumed in New Zealand is potentially supplied from offshore; • the competitive distortions created by treating identical supplies of services differently depending on the source of the supply; and • the ramifications of treating imported services in a manner inconsistent with New Zealand’s major trading partners and most OECD countries. 1.4 The review has been carried out, and the proposals resulting from it have been formulated, in the context of the Ottawa Taxation Framework and the Government’s electronic commerce strategy. 2 The Ottawa framework 1.5 In October 1998, representatives of several governments (including the New Zealand Government) and businesses met at the OECD ministerial conference “A Borderless World: Realising the Potential of Electronic Commerce” in Ottawa, Canada. The conference discussed how to adapt to the challenges posed by electronic commerce. In relation to taxation, it was agreed at this conference that the same principles that governments apply to the taxation of “conventional” commerce should apply to electronic commerce. The five fundamental principles are: 1 • Neutrality: Tax should seek to be neutral and equitable between forms of electronic commerce and between conventional and electronic commerce, thus avoiding double taxation or unintentional non-taxation. • Efficiency: Compliance costs for business and administration costs for governments should be minimised as far as possible. • Certainty and simplicity: Tax rules should be clear and simple to understand, so that taxpayers know where they stand. • Effectiveness and fairness: Taxation should produce the right amount of tax at the right times and the potential for evasion and avoidance should be minimised. • Flexibility: Taxation systems should be flexible and dynamic to ensure they keep pace with technological and commercial developments. 1.6 These core principles have been developed in the field of consumption taxes to give the following framework for cross-border trade: 2 • Taxation rules should result in the taxation of cross-border trade in the jurisdiction where consumption takes place. • The supply of digitised products should not be treated as the supply of goods. • Countries should consider the introduction of the reverse charge, self- assessment, or other equivalent mechanisms to tax imports of services. • Appropriate systems to collect tax on imports of physical goods should be developed. 1.7 The New Zealand Government endorses these principles, and any proposal in relation to imported services will be consistent with them as far as is possible. 1 Electronic Commerce: Taxation Framework Conditions , www.oecd.org/daf/fa. 2 ibid. 3 The Government’s electronic commerce strategy 1.8 The strategy paper E-Commerce : Building the Strategy for New Zealand set out the Government’s commitment to ensuring New Zealand becomes “world class in embracing electronic commerce for competitive advantage”. 3 A key principle is that there must be a predictable, simple and consistent legal environment for electronic commerce, with any Government intervention carried out in a transparent manner. 4 With respect to taxation, this requires that the tax system take into account the growth in electronic commerce, when possible, provide clear, simple and equivalent tax rules across jurisdictions and ensure an equivalent treatment of electronic and non- electronic transactions. 1.9 With these principles in mind, the review of the GST treatment of imported services, especially those provided electronically, was acknowledged in the strategy paper as a key part of ensuring that New Zealand’s regulatory environment enables electronic commerce. 5 Key issues 1.10 Key issues in considering the GST treatment of imported services are: • determining the appropriate jurisdiction in which a supply occurs and, when necessary, such as in the telecommunications sector, clarifying the rules that determine the place of supply; • distinguishing between supplies of goods and services, particularly with respect to digitised products; • the appropriate mechanism for taxing imported services; and • the extent to which efficiency is achieved without significant compliance and administrative costs. 1.11 This discussion document addresses these four areas. Application date 1.12 Legislation resulting from these policy proposals is expected to apply from mid to late 2002. 3 E-Commerce : Building the Strategy for New Zealand , November 2000, page 9. 4 ibid, page 2. 5 ibid, page 15. 4 Submissions 1.13 The Government invites submissions on the proposals contained in this discussion document.

Submissions received by the due date will be acknowledged. 1.17 An electronic copy of this discussion document is available on-line at: http://www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/index.php?catid=2 SUMMARY OF PROPOSALS • A reverse charge mechanism will be introduced to tax certain imports of services in business-to-business transactions. This will require GST registered recipients of supplies of imported services to self-assess GST on the value of the services if : (1) the services are acquired for purposes other than of making taxable supplies; and (2) the supply of those services, if made in New Zealand by a registered person, would be a taxable supply. 5 This means that if a registered person acquires services that would be subject to GST if supplied in New Zealand and for which the recipient would not have received a full, or any, input tax credit, the recipient will be required to add GST to the price of the services and return the GST to Inland Revenue. • The recipient of a supply of imported services will be treated as if it had made that supply for the purpose of imposing and enforcing the reverse charge and for determining whether the GST registration threshold is exceeded. For all other purposes in the GST Act the recipient of a supply of imported services will be treated as the recipient, rather than the supplier, of the services. • For the purposes of the reverse charge the normal time of supply and value of supply rules, in section 9 and 10(2) and (3) respectively, will be applied. • Supplies of imported digitised products, such as software provided over the Internet, will be treated as supplies of services. • A New Zealand branch or company will be treated as separate from its offshore head office or parent company in relation to supplies of services that would be subject to GST if supplied in New Zealand. This requires in these circumstances: -treating a New Zealand branch of a non-resident company as a separate entity; and -not disregarding supplies within a wholly-owned group of companies. • The amount of a management fee or cost allocation charged to a New Zealand branch or subsidiary that is to be subject to the reverse charge will be calculated by taking the fee or allocation and excluding component supplies that are readily identifiable as not being for the acquisition of services that would be subject to GST if acquired in New Zealand. • A supply of services in New Zealand will occur when a New Zealand customer initiates the supply of telecommunications services from a non-resident telecommunications supplier. Non-resident suppliers of telecommunications services will be required to register for GST if they make supplies of more than $40,000 in a twelve-month period. • Telecommunications services will be excluded from the reverse charge. • The Commissioner of Inland Revenue will have a discretion not to require GST to be returned by telecommunications suppliers operating wholly offshore if it would not be cost effective to do so. 6 Chapter 2 THE ELECTRONIC COMMERCE CHALLENGE Introduction 2.1 It is crucial that the New Zealand taxation framework is able to contend with, and respond to, changes in the commercial environment if it is to gather revenue in a stable, efficient and minimally distortionary manner. 2.2 The development of electronic commerce is one of the most significant changes in the business environment in the last decade. It greatly increases the ability of consumers to obtain goods and services worldwide and improves the ability of businesses to provide them. 2.3 This chapter looks at the ways in which electronic commerce is affecting, and will continue to affect, New Zealand’s taxation system and outlines areas where change may be needed. The impact of electronic commerce on taxation 2.4 Electronic commerce gives rise to issues in the three main areas of taxation: • income tax; • tax administration; and • goods and services tax (GST). 2.5 It provides opportunities to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the tax system, and at the same time creates challenges which must be overcome if increased efficiencies and stable levels of revenue are to be achieved. Income tax issues 2.6 Rapid advances in technology have made it easier for non-residents to conduct substantial business with, and derive substantial income from, New Zealand customers without having a fixed place of business in New Zealand. This has implications for many of the concepts of our international tax rules, which were developed at a time when operating a business commonly required a physical presence. 2.7 For example, under double taxation agreements, a resident of one state is normally required to have a “permanent establishment” in another state before that state is able to impose tax on the non-resident’s business profits. A permanent establishment in a state commonly requires a physical presence. Technological advances mean that a physical presence is no longer needed to conduct business. 7 2.8 Even if a physical presence is established in New Zealand, however, modern technology has made it relatively straightforward to ensure that the bulk of the value-adding activities are retained outside New Zealand. In that case, New Zealand would not be able to attribute any significant share of the overall profits of a non-resident to that physical presence in New Zealand. 2.9 This poses two important questions in relation to the taxation of income: • Is there a need to redefine existing concepts to accommodate the changes to business practices caused by electronic commerce? • Is a continuing reliance on source-based taxation appropriate? 2.10 New Zealand imposes tax on the worldwide income of its tax residents (the residence principle of taxation). However, New Zealand also imposes tax on all income sourced in New Zealand, whether it is derived by resident or non- resident taxpayers (the source principle). The double tax agreements to which New Zealand is a party can modify the application of these principles. 2.11 Both the residence and source principles have definitional difficulties that may be exacerbated by electronic commerce. 2.12 The main challenge from electronic commerce to income tax is to the source rules (the statutory provisions defining the income which is sourced in New Zealand), especially for the business income of non-residents. Residents of countries with which New Zealand has double tax agreements must have a permanent establishment to become liable for income tax in New Zealand on their business profits. 2.13 For example, a programmer living in Australia is contracted to design a database for a New Zealand bank, and conducts all of her development from a terminal in Australia. She makes one short visit to New Zealand to discuss her development work with the New Zealand bank. Under New Zealand’s double tax agreement with Australia, the Australian programmer would need an actual place of business in New Zealand (a permanent establishment) before New Zealand could tax her business income. New Zealand could not, therefore, tax the business income of the programmer. Similar protection would apply to most non-residents engaging in electronic commerce with New Zealand customers from a country with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement. 2.14 If non-residents from countries with whom New Zealand does not have a double tax agreement engage in business with New Zealand customers, their business profits would not be protected by the definition of “permanent establishment”. Thus if the programmer in the example used here were from a country with which New Zealand does not have a double tax agreement, she would be deriving New Zealand-sourced business income, by virtue of her business being partly carried on in New Zealand. Even then, however, little of the income is likely to be attributable to New Zealand, as the courts have tended to look to where services are performed in attributing income from services between jurisdictions. 8 2.15 The Government recognises that there are international issues to which the policy response needs to be developed in co-operation with other countries. For that reason it continuously monitors the work the OECD is undertaking to update the concept of a permanent establishment, for the purposes of the OECD’s model double tax agreement (which is used as the basis for most negotiations between OECD member countries). New Zealand shares the OECD view that the current framework of international income tax rules is adequate to deal with these issues. In particular, the benefits of the growth of electronic commerce should not be inhibited by attempts to impose new taxes or impose tax on income not sourced in New Zealand and derived by non- residents. Tax administration issues 2.16 The growth in electronic commerce has raised difficult issues for tax administrations in maintaining the revenue base. On the other hand, it has provided the opportunity to make tax administrations more efficient, improving the timeliness and quality of service to taxpayers – for example, by allowing the electronic filing of tax returns and the electronic payment of tax and tax refunds. 2.17 Although many of the revenue base concerns raised by electronic commerce are not new, the rate of technological development has increased their significance and potential impact on the tax base and tax administration. 2.18 Some of these issues are: • Audit trails may be more difficult to identify: The lack of any central control of the Internet and the ease with which cross-jurisdiction transactions take place may make tracing complex arrangements more difficult. • Verification of identity and residence: Taxpayers can establish, and operate from, an Internet address in any jurisdiction even though they effectively reside elsewhere. • Obtaining documentation: The growth in Internet commerce may make obtaining the information necessary for enforcement difficult, particularly when transactions involve countries with which New Zealand does not have a double tax agreement or the issues involved are not covered by the information exchange powers contained in New Zealand’s double tax agreements. • The removal of convenient "taxing points": With fewer or, in some cases, no intermediaries in the distribution of goods and services as a result of producers selling directly to consumers, the number of available collection mechanisms is reduced. 9 2.19 The Electronic Transactions Bill, currently before Parliament, aims to facilitate the use of electronic technology, in part by allowing paper-based legal requirements to be met using “functionally equivalent” 6 electronic technology. The Government is considering how the bill interacts with the requirements for businesses to keep records for tax purposes (largely contained in the Tax Administration Act 1994). 2.20 Inland Revenue’s policy on record storage emphasises the ability to restore documents to paper as a test for whether electronic recording provides a functional equivalent to paper, and this is consistent with the stated purposes of the bill. The Government is considering in more detail whether the bill should, among other things, specifically support the continuation of this approach to ensure that the integrity of information is maintained. 2.21 The Government is always interested in the views of taxpayers, tax agents and other interested parties on how tax administration can be made more efficient, and welcomes any views on how electronic commerce can be harnessed for greater efficiency gains. 7 GST issues 2.22 New Zealand’s GST was designed and introduced before the prevalence of electronic commerce. Although the general framework of GST remains robust enough to deal with most electronic commerce transactions, at a detailed level electronic commerce raises some difficult issues. Invoices and record-keeping 2.23 Invoices are Inland Revenue’s primary information source for verifying a registered person’s GST calculations. Suppliers of goods and services are now able to operate from anywhere in the world, in many cases without a physical address, which could diminish the ability of businesses to obtain suitable invoices, and that of Inland Revenue to verify the necessary details of transactions. Similarly, the fact that many suppliers may now more easily be situated outside New Zealand provides challenges for ensuring compliance with record-keeping requirements and gaining access to documents. 6 Clause 3(b) Electronic Transactions Bill; and Electronic Transactions Bill, Explanatory Note, General Policy Statement, page 1; conditions for functional equivalence are set out in Part 3 of the Electronic Transactions Bill. 7 The Government discussion document More Time For Business , released 3 May 2001, contains a discussion of areas where technology could be used to lower compliance costs on business. 10 Border enforcement 2.24 Electronic commerce has made it easier to import goods and services. Some products which would once have been in a tangible form and described as goods can now be supplied in a digitised form, making them more easily transferable and more akin to services in their mode of delivery. This creates border control issues, with it being increasingly difficult for customs and revenue authorities to monitor the importation of both goods and services. This, therefore, affects the ability of these authorities to gather revenue from such importations, eroding the revenue base. Imported services and GST 2.25 The major issue in relation to GST is the treatment of imported services. Unlike imported goods, most services imported into New Zealand are not subject to GST, except for freight and insurance services associated with imported goods. This treatment came about because of the low volume of imported services in the mid-1980s, when GST was introduced, compared with the compliance and administrative costs involved in taxing imported services. 2.26 Changes in the New Zealand economy, the global economy, and the way that business is done now mean that it is time to reconsider this treatment. The distortions which arise from treating services in a different manner depending on the place from which they are supplied, and the fact that most other OECD countries impose GST or VAT on imported services, suggest that the current exclusion of imported services from the New Zealand GST base should be reconsidered. 2.27 New Zealand service providers are at a disadvantage, therefore, compared with non-resident service providers, since New Zealand service providers must charge GST, whereas non-resident service providers are not generally required to do so. 2.28 From an international perspective, it is important to limit the non-taxation of supplies between New Zealand and our trading partners. By not taxing imports of services, the New Zealand GST system allows those services to avoid any impost of consumption tax, since such supplies would not have been taxed when exported from the jurisdiction in which they originated. As well as creating consumption distortion effects in New Zealand, it may also distort decisions in the country from which services are exported. 11 2.29 Any move to impose GST on imported services is not primarily designed to be a revenue raising exercise but it would stem future revenue losses from this source. The increasing mobility of the supply of services means that purchasing services supplied offshore is becoming more common. Although there is no evidence to suggest the tax base is currently significantly threatened by not applying GST to imported services, this does not mean a significant future revenue loss is not possible. 8 2.30 This discussion document considers the GST treatment of imported services and proposes that GST be imposed on certain imported services. 8 For example, globally, electronic commerce is predicted to reach approximately US$ 600 billion in trade by 2004-05, or roughly eight percent of all global trade (OECD Presentation: Electronic Commerce - Answering the Taxation Challenges, Tokyo OECD / Pacific Island Forum Conference, February 2001). 12 Chapter 3 GST AND IMPORTED SERVICES This chapter outlines the current treatment of imported services, explains the reasons for this treatment, and discusses the reasons for proposing change in this area. Current treatment of imported services 3.1 Unlike imported goods, most imported services are not subject to GST, except for freight and insurance services associated with imported goods. 9 This treatment largely reflects the limited volume of imported services that existed when GST was introduced, and the practical difficulties associated at that time with levying and collecting GST on them. 3.2 When GST was introduced, in 1986, all but international transportation services were consumed in the jurisdictions in which they were produced because of the legal and technological constraints that either prevented international trade in services altogether or made it uneconomic. The volume of services imported into New Zealand at the time was relatively low, and their exclusion from the GST base was, therefore, perceived to be relatively non-distortionary. 3.3 The practical difficulties involved in identifying and monitoring the supply of services also militated against their inclusion in the GST base at that time. The decision not to impose GST on imported services resulted from concerns that the revenue derived from GST on imported services would not justify the costs incurred by business and the Government in collecting that tax. Problems with the current treatment The efficiency of the GST system 3.4 Ideally, the tax system raises and redistributes revenue in a manner that is consistent with the government’s economic and social policies. It achieves this objective while minimising the costs to the economy as a whole. This is referred to as the “efficiency” of a tax system. An “efficient” tax system is one that does not affect individuals’ investment decisions one way or the other. 9 Section 12(2) – valuation of imported goods. 13 3.5 The limited number of exemptions and the uniform rate at which it is applied generally make GST an efficient tax relative to a multi-rate tax with many exemptions. The non-taxation of imported services, however, reduces the efficiency of GST. Both imported and domestically produced services can be consumed as part of the production process or as final consumption, but only domestically supplied services are currently subject to GST. The absence of GST on imported services, therefore, causes distortions in: • The relative prices faced by consumers of tradable services. The absence of GST on imported services encourages domestic consumers to substitute imported services that are not subject to GST for domestically produced services that are subject to GST. In other words, it encourages inefficient patterns of consumption by discouraging the consumption of domestically produced services in favour of imported services. • The relative prices faced by producers of tradable services for their outputs and their factors of production to the extent that tradable services are used in the production process. The absence of GST on imported services also tends to encourage inefficient patterns of production and resource use in New Zealand. In particular, it discourages the domestic production of services, since domestic producers may not be able to pass on the GST cost to consumers, who are able to switch to imported services that are not subject to GST. It also discourages the use of domestically produced services by some New Zealand businesses. Domestic producers who are either unable to claim input tax credits, or unwilling to incur the compliance costs associated with claiming input tax credits, will tend to substitute imported services for domestically produced services. 3.6 By distorting these relative prices, GST causes resources to be allocated in a less efficient manner than they would be if both domestic and imported services were subject to taxation. It is clear that imposing GST only on domestic supplies of services creates a distortion by re-allocating resources away from domestic to foreign production. The production inefficiency arises because New Zealand consumers acquire a reduced level of the domestically supplied services and more services supplied from offshore. 3.7 Since the introduction of GST, several developments have promoted a considerable growth in the volume of services being imported into New Zealand. Deregulation of the telecommunications and financial services markets in New Zealand, coupled with rapid advances in communication and computer technology, mean that it is now possible to consume a wide range of services in New Zealand that have been produced offshore. This growth in the volume of imported services exacerbates the distortions caused by the non-taxation of imported services. 14 3.8 The efficiency of the GST system, therefore, will be improved by taxing imported services at the same rate as other goods and services. Impact of electronic commerce on the economic costs of taxation 3.9 The size of the costs caused by taxation depends upon the responsiveness of patterns of consumption and production to changes in relative prices (the elasticities of demand and supply). As responsiveness increases so do the economic costs. 3.10 In general, the responsiveness of demand to price increases with: • the degree to which the services demanded can be substituted for other services; • the amount of time that has elapsed since the relative price change; and • the proportion of income spent on the service. 3.11 The responsiveness of supply increases with the length of time available to suppliers to change the quantities of production and introduce the technology that enables them to alter those quantities. 3.12 Electronic commerce increases the responsiveness of both demand and supply of services, particularly in industries such as telecommunications, where the services produced are highly substitutable. Specifically, electronic commerce reduces the cost at which services can be traded across borders and the speed at which markets react to changes in relative prices. As the use of electronic commerce develops as a means of transacting, relative price movements caused by taxation could result in larger economic costs, exacerbating the existing problems caused by the non-taxation of imported services. 3.13 Advances in technology mean that it is now possible for New Zealand businesses to import services that in the past would have had to have been supplied by domestic producers. For example, a New Zealand financial institution wanting to update its software systems faces a choice between obtaining the necessary services from domestic providers or importing them. 3.14 If the financial institution decides to obtain those services from a New Zealand programmer who is a registered person, GST will be charged on the software development. However, if the services are being used to update the financial institution’s treasury operations, it cannot claim an input tax credit for those services because treasury operations are exempt from GST. By contrast, if the financial institution contracts with a non-resident programmer, the services may not be subject to GST since the supply may be deemed to occur outside New Zealand. 15 3.15 The absence of GST on these imported programming services, therefore, has the potential to distort the resource use decisions of financial institutions that need to purchase programming services. In particular, it lowers the price of imported programming services in relation to domestically produced services for those financial institutions that are either unable to claim input tax credits, or are unwilling to incur the additional compliance costs associated with claiming them. 3.16 The absence of GST on imported programming services also distorts patterns of production and resource use in New Zealand. In particular, it means that domestic programmers may not be able to pass on the full burden of the GST to businesses that purchase their services. This places domestic programmers at a competitive disadvantage in the markets for both their outputs and their inputs. Equity 3.17 GST is intended to impose the burden of the tax on the consumer, and, with the exception of firms making exempt supplies, not on producers. The fact that the burden of GST falls on New Zealand programmers in the situation described earlier, as a result of the design of the GST Act, means the policy intention is not being achieved. Nor is “horizontal equity” being achieved, since people in the same position are being subjected to different effective rates of tax. Tax base implications 3.18 Not taxing imported services poses a potential risk to the tax base. When GST was introduced, the level of imported services was low. The increasing mobility of the supply of services, however, means that purchasing services supplied from offshore is more common. Although there is limited evidence to suggest the tax base is currently threatened by not applying GST to imported services, this does not mean a significant future revenue loss is not possible. 3.19 In considering tax base implications, the imposition of GST on imported services would not, therefore, be expected to raise substantial revenue in the short term. It would, however, limit the potential for future significant revenue losses. 16 International consistency 3.20 Not imposing GST on imported services is contrary to the generally accepted international framework for consumption taxes. Most other jurisdictions, particularly members of the OECD, include imported services in their consumption tax base. Indeed, the OECD has stated that members should consider the introduction of mechanisms for taxing imports of services by businesses, as this is necessary to limit the non-taxation of cross- jurisdictional supplies. The vast majority of nations operate consumption tax systems which tax the supply of goods and services consumed within their country. This is brought about by taxing imports of goods and services and not taxing exports of goods and services. This is known as the destination principle. 3.21 New Zealand operates under the destination principle. Nevertheless, by not taxing imports of services, the New Zealand GST system allows services which have not been taxed in the jurisdiction from which they have “originated”, and are consumed in New Zealand, to avoid the impost of any consumption tax. 3.22 It is important, therefore, for New Zealand to address the non-taxation of imported services. 17 Chapter 4 OPTIONS FOR TAXING IMPORTED SERVICES This chapter outlines methods by which the importation of services into New Zealand could be made subject to GST. It concludes that the “reverse charge” mechanism is the most appropriate method, and recommends its introduction. Introduction 4.1 The distortions caused by the non-taxation of imported services can be addressed in three ways. Two of these options result in GST being charged on imports of services, and both fit within the current GST framework. The third option involves a fundamental change to the GST framework. All three must be considered in the context of determining the appropriate “place of supply” rules for internationally traded services. 4.2 This chapter analyses these issues and concludes that the reverse charge mechanism is the most appropriate. OECD consumption tax framework 4.3 The OECD has developed the “Ottawa framework” to provide the following guidelines for consumption tax: • Rules for the taxation of cross-border trade should result in taxation in the jurisdiction where consumption takes place, and an international consensus should be sought on the circumstances under which supplies are to be regarded as consumed in a jurisdiction. • The supply of digitised products should not be treated as a supply of goods. • In relation to imports of services and intangible property, countries should examine the use of reverse charge, self-assessment or other equivalent mechanisms if this would provide protection for the competitiveness of domestic suppliers and for the revenue base. • Countries should ensure that appropriate systems are developed in co- operation with the World Customs Organisation and in consultation with carriers and other interested parties to collect tax on the importation of physical goods, and that such systems do not unduly impede revenue collection and the efficient delivery of products to consumers. 18 4.4 The place of consumption has been defined for business-to-business transactions as the jurisdiction in which the recipient has located its business presence. For business-to-consumer transactions, it is the recipient’s usual jurisdiction of residence. 10 4.5 The Government intends to base any proposal in relation to services imported by businesses in New Zealand on these principles. Especially important is the principle that consumption tax rules should result in taxation in the jurisdiction in which consumption takes place. This ensures that the unintentional double or non-taxation of goods and services does not occur when they are traded across borders. It also ensures that New Zealand continues to tax in accordance with the more internationally accepted “destination principle”, rather than the “origin principle”. These concepts are discussed in the following paragraphs. A change in the GST framework: the origin principle 4.6 Most goods and services are consumed in the same jurisdiction in which they are produced. In these circumstances, GST can be imposed on the basis of the place of supply (the location of the supplier) or the place of consumption (the location of the recipient) and the incidence of the tax will be the same. For reasons of administrative and compliance costs, it is easier to tax at the place the supply is made. Adjustments must be made, however, when goods and services are traded across borders, because the place of supply and place of consumption are not the same. To make these adjustments, GST can either be based on the “destination principle” or the “origin principle”. The destination principle 4.7 Under the destination principle supplies of goods and services are taxed in the jurisdiction in which the goods and services are consumed. This means that exports are zero-rated, while imports are taxed. New Zealand’s GST system, and the vast majority of other countries’ systems, are based on the destination principle. 11 10 A report by the Committee’s Working Party No. 9 on Consumption Taxes: Consumption Tax Aspects of Electronic Commerce , (www.oecd.org/daf/fa/e\_com/ec\_6\_WP9\_REPORT\_Eng.pdf). 11 The Russian Federation taxes imports into the Federation, but zero-rates only exports out of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), so exports from within the Federation to other members of the CIS are taxed. It is often perceived that the European Union (EU) operates under the origin principle. For supplies to non-registered consumers within the EU this is generally true. Supplies between businesses, however, are not taxed under this principle. Instead tax is applied by using a reverse charge mechanism that applies to both services and goods supplied within the EU. This is not an “origin” system in the strict sense of the word, but is more representative of an attempt to move toward a single internal market. Between the EU and the rest of the world the destination principle applies. 19 The origin principle 4.8 Under the origin principle supplies are taxed according to their origin and at the GST rate of the originating jurisdiction. This means that exports are taxed but imports are not taxed. Moving to the origin principle would therefore remove the need to tax imported services. It would also remove the need to tax imported goods. Comparing the origin and destination principles 4.9 This document raises proposals for taxing imported services under the current GST framework, which is based on what is known as the destination principle. Under this method of applying GST, exports are zero-rated (and thus face no GST impost), while imports are subject to GST as they cross the border. As a result, consumption in New Zealand is taxed but consumption of New Zealand goods and services outside New Zealand is not subject to GST. This is in accordance with the “Ottawa framework” for consumption taxes. 4.10 Economic theory holds that the same effect as taxing imports and zero-rating exports can be achieved by moving from the destination principle to the origin principle. Under the origin principle, goods and services are taxed according to the place from which they originate. This means that exports would be subject to GST (by removing zero-rating) but imports would be zero-rated and thus free of GST. 4.11 This would seem to place exporters and import-substitutable businesses at a disadvantage, as they would compete against imported goods and services and overseas purchased goods that would not be subject to New Zealand GST. However, when combined with an appropriate exchange rate adjustment a move to the origin principle could be expected to leave all producer and consumer prices, and thus trade flows, unaffected. 4.12 A GST based on the origin principle seems to have advantages when looked at in the context of the issues dealt with in this document. It means, for example, that there is no need to tax imported services (or any other imports), removing the need to tax supplies (such as digitised products) that are not easily taxed as they cross the border. 4.13 Nevertheless, a GST system based on the origin principle has serious administrative problems. Imports would need to remain zero-rated through to final consumption. To achieve this, a deemed input tax credit would need to be provided to registered persons first acquiring imported supplies. This would create an unacceptably high risk to the tax base. In addition, since the essential equivalence of goods and services taxation based on the origin and destination principles is often misunderstood, the origin approach, which on its face appears to disadvantage New Zealand businesses, is unlikely to be widely accepted as trade neutral. 20 4.14 Moving to the origin principle does not seem, therefore, to be a viable option, and this document concentrates on options based on the destination principle. However, we welcome comments on this issue. Register offshore non-resident suppliers 4.15 One mechanism for taxing imported services would be to change the current rules that determine the place of supply so that an obligation to register for GST is imposed on offshore non-residents if they supply services to New Zealand to a value exceeding the registration threshold. 4.16 In New Zealand the place of supply is determined by reference to the residence of the supplier. In the case of non-resident suppliers, the test is whether the services are physically performed in New Zealand and, for transactions between registered persons, whether the parties agree to treat New Zealand as the place of supply. In other jurisdictions, such as the members of the European Union (EU), the place of supply is determined by reference to the “establishment” of the supplier. These rules are based on the principle that the majority of consumption will occur in the GST or VAT jurisdiction in which the supplier resides. 4.17 These rules do not, however, generally require offshore non-residents to charge GST or VAT when they supply services within the taxing jurisdiction. This could be addressed by introducing a place of supply rule that is based on the effective use of goods or services supplied within the taxing jurisdiction. 4.18 A major difficulty with an effective use test is in determining where the service is in fact used. This is generally feasible if the service that is supplied is not readily transferable from one jurisdiction to another. For example, services in relation to land are less easily transferred to another jurisdiction than are services in the nature of, say, insurance, which can be effectively used in a number of jurisdictions. 4.19 Some jurisdictions apply a targeted effective use test to certain types of imported services, such as telecommunications. Whether this would be appropriate in relation to the New Zealand telecommunications sector is discussed in chapter 8. 4.20 A general impost of GST in this manner could also raise significant enforcement concerns, since the legislation would need to be enforced offshore. It would also create compliance cost concerns for non-residents required to register in New Zealand and charge GST. 21 4.21 Last year the European Commission (EC) circulated a proposal 12 which would impose VAT on supplies of electronically delivered services based on the location of the consumer of those services (as opposed to the supplier’s location, as at present). Suppliers selling electronic services 13 from outside the EU to customers inside the EU would be required to account for VAT in the same way as an EU resident supplier: they would register for, and charge, VAT. 14 The non-EU supplier would only be required to register only if it made sales of more than Euro 100,000 to private consumers in the EU, and would be required to register in only one jurisdiction within the EU. 4.22 The proposal was adopted by the EC on 7 June 2000. 15 It will operate alongside the reverse charge already in operation for business-to-business transactions. 4.23 Once in place, the proposal will rely partially upon international co-operation for enforcement. It will also rely upon the willingness of multinational firms to protect their goodwill and image in the EU and maintain a favourable environment in the EU for non-EU suppliers to do business. A favourable environment might provide, for example, protection of intellectual property and free access to markets. 4.24 While it is feasible for an economic bloc to implement such a system of taxation, it is questionable whether a country the size of New Zealand could unilaterally impose and enforce such a system. Reverse charge 4.25 The most commonly used mechanism for taxing imported services is the reverse charge. The members of the EU introduced a reverse charge in the late 1970s in response to the growing level of services traded within the common market. Canada’s GST system incorporates the reverse charge and, more recently, Australia introduced a reverse charge as part of its GST system. There is a general acceptance among OECD member countries of the appropriateness of the “reverse charge” mechanism to tax imported services provided in business-to-business transactions. 4.26 The reverse charge mechanism results in the taxation of services in the jurisdiction in which the services are consumed, that is, in the jurisdiction to which they are imported. The adoption of a reverse charge mechanism is, therefore, consistent with the accepted OECD framework for consumption taxes and the OECD’s more recent guidelines on the appropriate place of taxation for internationally traded services. These OECD guidelines, which are endorsed by the Business and Industry Advisory Committee (BIAC), a 12 A Strategy to Improve the Operation of the VAT System within the context of the Internal Market COM(2000) 349. 13 For example, pay-per-view television. 14 Conversely, EU suppliers that provide such services to non-EU customers do not have to charge VAT. 15 It is unclear, however, whether it will be implemented, as it has been reported that the UK has recently expressed opposition to the proposal. 22 committee of the OECD, also recommend the adoption of the reverse charge mechanism as the most viable tax collection method for cross-border business-to-business transactions. 4.27 The specific design of the reverse charge can vary between jurisdictions but the principle is the same. Registered persons self-assess GST and claim an input tax credit to the extent that services were acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. 4.28 A similar obligation is imposed on registered suppliers of exempt goods and services and in some countries, such as Canada and Switzerland, on private individuals. In these circumstances an input tax credit for the self-assessed GST would not generally be available. For enforcement reasons, however, it is clear that the reverse charge is difficult to apply effectively to supplies of imported services to private individuals. 4.29 A reverse charge mechanism would, however, have one advantage. In relation to business-to-business transactions, it would be a suitable mechanism for correcting the production distortions created by the preference that registered suppliers acquiring services for purposes other than of making taxable supplies might have for internationally provided services over domestically provided services. Preferred option 4.30 Ideally, to remove all of the distortions created by the non-taxation of imported services, GST would be levied on all imports of services, both to consumers and businesses. The option of registering offshore non-resident suppliers would achieve this. However, a general requirement for offshore non-resident suppliers to register for GST would pose several problems, particularly with enforcement. 4.31 Requiring self-assessment of GST under the reverse charge would also remove all of the distortions. However, a general requirement for final consumers to self-assess GST under the reverse charge mechanism would also have enforcement problems. This, therefore, leaves the taxation of services imported by businesses. 4.32 The Government’s preferred option is to implement a reverse charge on business-to-business transactions. The reverse charge has been adopted by the majority of countries with a general consumption tax and is proven to work well in relation to business-to-business transactions. It also results in the taxation of services in the jurisdiction in which they are consumed, consistent with the OECD framework for consumption tax. 4.33 In this case, if the New Zealand importer is making taxable supplies, the business would receive an input tax credit for any GST paid. In the light of this, the benefits of imposing GST on registered persons making solely taxable supplies are unlikely to be large enough to justify the compliance costs of doing so. 23 4.34 A net benefit from taxing imported services is, therefore, likely to occur only when the importer is acquiring the services for purposes other than of making taxable supplies. Therefore the reverse charge proposed in this discussion document is targeted at imposing GST on businesses importing services for purposes other than of making taxable supplies, as discussed further in the following chapter. 24 Chapter 5 THE REVERSE CHARGE MECHANISM Proposed policy • A reverse charge mechanism will be introduced. It will require the self- assessment of GST on the value of services imported by registered persons for purposes other than of making taxable supplies if the supply of those services in New Zealand by a registered person would be a taxable supply. • For the purpose of imposing and enforcing the reverse charge, and for determining whether the registration threshold is exceeded, the recipient of a supply of imported services will be treated as if it had made that supply. The recipient of a supply of imported services will be treated as the recipient, rather than the supplier, of the services for all other purposes in the GST Act. • For the purposes of the reverse charge, the normal time of supply and value of supply rules, in section 9 and section 10(2) and (3) respectively, will be applied. Introduction 5.1 This chapter outlines the main features of the proposed reverse charge mechanism. The two following chapters deal with issues concerning the scope and operation of the reverse charge in more detail. General application 5.2 The reverse charge mechanism will generally require registered recipients of supplies of imported services to self-assess GST on the GST-inclusive value of those supplies. For the purposes of the reverse charge, the recipient of a supply will add GST to the value of the services and be required to return the GST as if it had made a supply of the services. 5.3 This means that when New Zealand residents receive a supply of services which is not supplied in New Zealand under section 8(2) (and therefore not subject to GST under section 8(1)) they will self-assess GST on that supply of services as if the supply were made in New Zealand. 5.4 This will ensure, in keeping with the Ottawa taxation framework, that supplies of services are taxed in New Zealand if they are consumed in New Zealand. 25 5.5 It is proposed that the reverse charge apply to supplies of services performed for New Zealand recipients that would be taxable supplies if made in New Zealand by New Zealand-resident suppliers. For example, a supply of imported financial services, say, re-insurance of a life insurance contract, which would be an exempt financial service, will not be subject to the reverse charge. 5.6 As explained in more detail in the next two chapters, the reverse charge will generally apply to supplies of imported services that would be taxable if made in New Zealand and that are acquired by a person other than in the course of making taxable supplies. 5.7 The value of imported services supplied to a person will be included in the total value of supplies made by that person for the purposes of determining liability to register for GST under section 51. Although businesses making exempt supplies in New Zealand will usually be registered for GST in any event, the reverse charge may require others to register – in particular, any person importing services exceeding $40,000 in value in a twelve-month period as a private consumer. 5.8 Introducing a reverse charge will not preclude a non-resident company carrying on a taxable activity and making supplies in New Zealand from registering for GST in New Zealand if it wishes to do so. In this situation the company would charge GST on any supplies made in New Zealand, and the reverse charge would not apply to the recipient of the supplies. Limited to acquisitions for purposes other than of making taxable supplies 5.9 The application of the reverse charge will be limited to services to the extent that they are acquired by registered persons (or persons liable to be registered) for purposes other than of making taxable supplies. Therefore, to the extent that a registered person acquires a service for purposes other than of making taxable supplies, the supply will be taxed under the reverse charge mechanism. 5.10 In contrast, any services imported and for which the taxpayer is entitled to an input tax credit if the services are supplied onshore will not be subject to the reverse charge. This approach will remove the necessity for taxpayers to pay GST for which they are then fully reimbursed through input tax credits. It will also remove the corresponding administrative costs. 5.11 This proposed treatment will differ in its scope from that of imported goods. Most imported goods are charged with GST at the border by the New Zealand Customs Service, regardless of whether or not the recipient of the goods is entitled to an input tax credit. 16 This is done because the Customs Service will not know at the time of importation if the recipient of the goods is entitled to an input tax credit – the recipient may not be registered or, if registered, may not be acquiring the goods for a taxable purpose. It is, 16 Section 12, Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. 26 therefore, more efficient to charge GST on the importation of all goods than it is to require recipients to prove on importation that they have acquired the goods for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies and are, therefore, entitled to an input tax credit. 5.12 For this reason the reverse charge will mainly apply to providers of financial services, such as banks, but will also apply to other registered persons who import services for purposes other than of making taxable supplies. Time of supply 5.13 Under section 9(1) of the GST Act, a supply takes place at the earlier of the time an invoice is issued or a payment is received for the supply. 5.14 Section 9(2)(a)(iii) further provides that in supplies between associated persons the time of supply for services is the time they are performed, unless an invoice is issued, or a payment is received on or before the last day for furnishing a GST return for the taxable period in which the services were performed. In that case the rule in section 9(1) applies. 5.15 These rules ought to work equally for the purposes of the reverse charge. It is proposed, therefore, that the time of supply for the reverse charge be the earlier of: • when an invoice is issued in respect of the supply; or • when payment is made in respect of the supply; or • when the services are performed if the supply is between associated persons and an invoice has not been issued, or payment received, on or before the last day for furnishing a GST return. 5.16 Any rule based on the performance of a service has inherent difficulties, particularly if the service is performed uniformly over a period. The Government is, therefore, interested in receiving submissions on any special considerations and problems that should be taken into account in the application of these rules to supplies of imported services. Valuation The issue 5.17 The general rule under section 10(2) of the GST Act for determining the value of a supply is that a supply is valued by reference to the amount in money that has been paid for the supply, or if the supply is paid for using non-monetary consideration, at the open market value of that consideration. Under section 10(3), the value of a supply between associated persons is the open market value of the supply, unless, in terms of section 10(3A), the recipient is entitled to an input tax credit for the supply. The Australian, Canadian and United Kingdom GST or VAT legislation use their general 27 valuation rules for their reverse charge mechanisms, which are equivalent to the rule in section 10(2) of the GST Act. Furthermore, under Canadian GST legislation, the value of a supply between branches is the “fair market value” at the time the supply is made. 17 5.18 A requirement to adopt market valuation for transactions between associated persons ensures that objective considerations are applied and that supplies of goods and services are not under-taxed by GST. This would seem to apply equally for cross-border transactions as for domestic transactions. The Government is, however, interested in receiving submissions on any special considerations that should be taken into account in the application of the valuation rules to supplies of imported services. 5.19 Transfer pricing may be an issue to consider in the context of the proposed reverse charge. However, most countries, particularly New Zealand’s main trading and commercial partners, already have GST or VAT systems with reverse charges. The relatively low rate of GST in New Zealand as compared to other OECD countries with a GST or VAT system may, therefore, reduce the incentives to transfer price for GST purposes. 18 Proposed policy 5.20 Supplies subject to the reverse charge will be valued in the same way as normal supplies under the GST Act, which means section 10(2) and (3) 19 will treat the value of the supply as: • the total of the amount of money paid for the supply and the open market value of any non-monetary consideration; or • the open market value of the supply if it is between associated persons (branches, members of a group) and the monetary and non-monetary consideration is less than the open market value of the supply. 5.21 This proposed treatment is consistent with the treatment of intra-group supplies and the arm’s length principle expressed in New Zealand’s Transfer Pricing Guidelines . Mixed use acquisitions and apportionment 5.22 The recipient of a supply of imported services will be treated as if it had made that supply of services itself for the purpose of imposing and enforcing the reverse charge and for the purpose of determining whether the registration threshold is exceeded. For all other purposes in the GST Act, the recipient will continue to be treated as the recipient, rather than the supplier, of the services. 17 Section 220(c), Excise Tax Act. 18 Standard rate: New Zealand: 12.5%, Australia: 10%, Canada: 7%, United Kingdom: 17.5%, France: 20.6%, Germany: 16%, Ireland: 21%, Italy: 20%, EU(15) average: 19.4%. 19 Section 10(3A) will not be applicable, as the supplies the reverse charge applies to will be outside the scope of that provision. 28 5.23 For example, a non-resident supplier provides software to a New Zealand life insurance company for $1 million. Using a turnover approach, the software is used 70 percent for making exempt supplies of life insurance, and 30 percent for making taxable supplies of general insurance. Under the reverse charge, the life insurance company would, therefore, add GST to the $1 million, giving a figure of $1.125 million, and include the GST of $125,000 imposed under the reverse charge in its GST return. 5.24 Because the company uses the software 30 percent for taxable purposes, it is entitled to an input tax credit adjustment, and will be able to make a deduction of $37,500 from its output tax liability. 5.25 The company would not, however, include the $1.125 million as a supply it has made for the purposes of making the adjustment based on turnover. This is because the amount assessed under the reverse charge will be treated as a supply received by the life insurance company, not a supply made by the life insurance company. 5.26 Conversely, if the life insurance company acquires the software for 70 percent use in making taxable supplies and 30 percent in making exempt supplies, the reverse charge will still apply, as the software is not solely acquired for making taxable supplies. The company will, however, be entitled to a full input tax credit on the importation of the services, as they are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. It would then be required to make an adjustment for exempt supplies made using the software. Documentation requirements 5.27 The GST on supplies of imported services subject to the reverse charge will be included in a registered person’s GST return in the same way as other supplies. As invoices will not always be provided for such supplies, alternative supporting documentation, such as a supply contract or record of payments made, will be required to substantiate the valuations adopted for the purposes of the reverse charge. 29 Chapter 6 “SERVICES” This chapter addresses the application of the proposed reverse charge in relation to: • what constitutes a “service” for the purposes of the reverse charge; • the treatment of “digitised products”; and • the treatment of physically imported software. Introduction 6.1 The services to which the reverse charge is to apply must be clearly defined. So-called “digitised products”, and software more generally, raise a number of issues in this regard that require clarification. 6.2 This chapter deals with what constitutes a “service” for the purposes of the reverse charge. Broad definition of “services” 6.3 The GST Act defines a service as anything other than goods or money. 20 Thus if the reverse charge applies to a registered person, it should apply to all supplies of services that, if acquired offshore, would give rise to a lower GST impost than if the services were acquired in New Zealand. This treatment corrects the production distortions created by the preference that registered suppliers acquiring services for the purpose other than of making taxable supplies may have for internationally provided services over domestically provided services. 6.4 As stated earlier (chapter 5), the reverse charge will not apply to supplies of services which would be exempt if supplied by domestic suppliers. For example, the reverse charge will not apply to supplies of imported financial services, as defined in section 3(1). 20 Section 2(1); choses in action are services, as they are specifically excluded from the definition of “goods”. 30 Generic description versus list 6.5 Some jurisdictions apply the reverse charge to a specific list of services, and in other jurisdictions it is applied to all services, with specified exclusions. Both approaches raise questions over which services, if any, should be excluded and, indeed, what constitutes a “service” for the purposes of the reverse charge. 6.6 The Australian reverse charge applies to all imported services, apart from the supply by an overseas entity to an Australian branch of the services of an expatriate employee. 21 The EU, on the other hand, lists the specific services to which the reverse charge applies. 6.7 A clear disadvantage of listing the services to which the reverse charge applies is that problems are created with respect to defining each type of service in the list. This has been the case, to a degree, with the definition of “financial services”, for example, in section 3 of the GST Act. The list also runs the risk of rapidly becoming outdated, especially with the advent of new technologies, services, and methods of service delivery. The use of a specific list creates a boundary around which avoidance and tax planning activity can occur, with a resulting increase in compliance and administrative costs. 6.8 Indeed, the European Commission has suggested that the EU rule could be reshaped to become a general rule for services, stating that “\[t\]here are sound reasons ... for saying that the ‘list’ approach is fundamentally flawed and should be replaced by some more general measure.” 22 6.9 Using a more generic definition instead of a list approach would remove the need to define each type of service subject to the reverse charge. It would also avoid the need to update the list as new types of services emerge and technology enables more of the existing services to be traded across borders. Proposed policy 6.10 It is proposed, therefore, that the reverse charge apply generally to all supplies of services, unless specific services are excluded from its scope. Chapter 7 discusses specific services that will be included in or excluded from the reverse charge. 21 Section 84 – 15(2), A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999. 22 Harmonisation of Turnover Taxes European Commission, Working Party 1, Brussels, June 1999, page 14. 31 The nature of digitised products The issue 6.11 Digitised products are goods and services that are delivered by electronic means in digital form. These products can be delivered to a computer through the Internet, by way of telephone or cable network, or by satellite. Music in the form of compressed music files, film and software are examples of digitised products. 6.12 These products are usually received by customers directly from the supplier and are not subject to border control by Customs or handling by intermediaries. They are not tangible property when sent to the customer, but are easily converted to a tangible form by, for example, saving music files on to a compact disc. 6.13 The categorisation of digitised products as either goods or services is an issue for consumption tax purposes when digitised products are traded across borders. If they are treated as goods 23 the New Zealand Customs Service would be required to charge GST on the importation of a digitised product. If they are treated as services, they would, under the proposals in this discussion document, be subject to GST under the reverse charge only when imported by a registered person other than in making taxable supplies. 6.14 In October 1998 the OECD, as a part of the ministerial conference “A Borderless World: Realising the Potential of Electronic Commerce”, released a policy paper outlining taxation framework elements that required consideration as a result of electronic commerce. 24 The paper concluded that digitised products should not be treated as “goods” for cross-border consumption tax purposes. New Zealand has agreed to this treatment in principle. 6.15 Further, the EC, on behalf of the EU, has stated that sales of digitised products downloaded over the Internet should be taxed as services. 6.16 Administratively it is easier to levy GST on digitised products using a reverse charge (thereby treating them as services) rather than treating them as goods and the customs service levying the tax at the border under section 12 of the GST Act. This is because digitised products can enter a country in a number of ways – by cable, telephone wire, cellular network, or satellite, all of which pose enforcement and tracing difficulties. 23 Defined as “all kinds of movable personal property, including animals” in section 2 of the Customs and Excise Act 1996. 24 Electronic Commerce: Development of a Taxation Framework . 32 6.17 A reverse charge avoids this problem by placing the onus of levying tax on the recipient of the import. The OECD framework is based, therefore, on the pragmatic problems associated with the taxation of digital goods rather than a purely principle-based approach to defining the nature of digitised products. It is also based on the assumption that there is a reverse charge mechanism on imported services, which is the case in most OECD countries. 25 Proposed policy 6.18 In line with the OECD taxation framework, digitised products will be treated as services for the purposes of the reverse charge. Physical imports of software The issue 6.19 Software physically imported into New Zealand (contained on a disc or CD- ROM) is considered to be “goods” and liable to duty (in this case GST) collected by the New Zealand Customs Service under section 12 of the GST Act. GST is levied on the price paid or payable for the imported software package. 6.20 For valuation purposes, however, if the value of the contents (the message or data) is declared or invoiced in a manner which distinguishes it from the value of the carrier medium, the legislation allows the customs service to deduct the value of the contents from the price paid or payable. Customs will then levy GST only on the value of the carrier medium, plus the cost of freight and insurance incurred in bringing the goods to New Zealand. 26 6.21 This method of valuation results from New Zealand’s commitment to the World Trade Organisation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The agreement allows jurisdictions to impose customs duties on only the carrier media (CD-ROMs) physically imported into a country, excluding the software (data or instructions) content. 27 Although this valuation method is not mandatory, it is a convention which member countries will ideally follow. The distinction between content and media does not apply to imported sound, cinematic or video recordings, or embedded software. 28 25 This is why this approach differs from that proposed for income tax purposes in the Exposure Draft of Interpretation Guideline IG0007 : Non-resident Software Suppliers’ Payments Derived from New Zealand – Income Tax Treatment , whereby the means of delivery is not considered determinative of the income tax treatment. 26 Second schedule cl 3(1)(c) of the Customs and Excise Act 1996. 27 WTO Valuation Committee Decision VAL/8/Add, reaffirmed in WTO Valuation Committee Decision 4.1/1. 28 Second schedule cl 3(3) of the Customs and Excise Act 1996. 33 6.22 The distinction is also restricted to pure customs duties – taxes such as GST which apply to both imported and domestically produced goods are excluded, even if the tax is collected or enforced by a customs authority at the border. 29 The GATT distinction between content and media is, therefore, not determinative of the appropriate GST treatment of physical importations of software. 6.23 For GST purposes it may be argued that a supply of software can be regarded as comprising both a supply of a goods component (the carrier medium) and the supply of a services component (the message or data). The GST Act provides little guidance on the treatment of composite supplies and it is, therefore, unclear whether, under a reverse charge system, a cross-border supply of software could give rise to GST both at the border on the “goods component” and under the reverse charge on the “services component”. The issue needs to be considered. Options for removing the distortion 6.24 The current treatment of physically imported software may give rise to the potential for the software component of imported software to avoid a GST impost. More generally, the current treatment could distort a registered person’s choice of the method of importation of software. 6.25 There are two approaches which would remove this distortion and avoidance opportunity. However, they both potentially involve introducing new distortions and increasing compliance or administrative costs. 6.26 The valuation rule could be removed for GST purposes, meaning that Customs would charge GST on the full value of physically imported software at the border. This would remove the distortion and avoidance opportunity, since registered persons would be subject to the reverse charge on electronically imported software. It would also, however, mean that non- registered persons (final consumers) and registered persons not otherwise subject to GST under the reverse charge will be charged GST on physical importations of software but not on electronic importations of software. 6.27 Although registered persons not subject to the reverse charge will generally be entitled to an input tax credit for the physical importation, taxing the full value of the import would give rise to a distortionary treatment between physically and electronically imported software for non-registered persons. This distortion occurs because services imported by final consumers (business-to-consumer transactions) are not subject to GST and, because of the impracticalities of doing so, are not likely to be subject to GST in the near future (see chapter 9). The extent of this distortion will increase with improvements in telecommunications and Internet technology and the associated ease with which software can be downloaded or electronically delivered. 29 GATT Article 3, Ad Article 3. 34 6.28 Alternatively, the valuation rule could be retained, with Customs charging GST on the value of the media, and registered persons importing for non- taxable purposes applying the reverse charge to the remaining value of the product. This treatment would remove the distortion and avoidance opportunity for registered persons subject to the reverse charge, while not affecting final consumers and registered persons not subject to it. This approach could, however, significantly increase compliance costs on registered persons subject to the reverse charge and administrative costs for Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Customs Service. 6.29 Despite their disadvantages, both approaches would clarify the GST treatment of physically imported software. The Government seeks submissions on which approach is preferred. 6.30 Neither of these options will affect New Zealand’s commitment to the World Trade Organisation’s moratorium on imposing specific tariffs or specific taxes on electronic transmissions and the Internet. 30 30 Declaration on Global Electronic Commerce, May 1998, WTO Ministerial Conference. 35 Chapter 7 BRANCH AND INTRA-GROUP TRANSACTIONS AND COST ALLOCATIONS Proposed policy • A New Zealand branch or company will be treated as separate from its offshore head office or parent company in relation to supplies of services that would be subject to GST if supplied in New Zealand. This requires in these circumstances: -Treating a New Zealand branch of a non-resident company as a separate entity; and -Not disregarding supplies within a wholly-owned group of companies. • The amount of a management fee or cost allocation charged to a New Zealand branch or subsidiary that is to be subject to the reverse charge will be calculated by taking the fee or allocation and excluding component supplies that are readily identifiable as not being for the acquisition of services that would be subject to GST if acquired in New Zealand. Introduction 7.1 This chapter discusses the treatment of inter-branch and intra-group transactions, and the treatment of management fees and cost allocations, in the context of the proposed reverse charge. What is a “supply” in the context of cross-border, related party transactions 7.2 Section 5(1) of the GST Act defines a supply as including “all forms of supply”, and the courts have interpreted the term according to its ordinary meaning: “to furnish with or provide”. 31 7.3 It may be necessary in some instances to specify for the purposes of the reverse charge whether a supply of services has been made, particularly when intra-group or inter-branch transactions are involved. An overriding consideration is whether a member of a group or a branch is treated as an independent party receiving supplies from its parent or head office or as, in effect, part of a single entity. The following example is illustrative of where such clarification may be needed. 31 Per Davidson CJ, Databank Systems Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1987) 9 NZTC 6,213 at 6,223. 36 7.4 A financial services group with a United Kingdom-based parent and a wholly-owned subsidiary in New Zealand decides to embark upon an international advertising campaign. To facilitate the campaign, the UK parent contracts with a United States based advertising firm for a series of generic advertisements for screening in all of the countries in which the group operates. 7.5 In this situation there would, in effect, be a supply of advertising services to the New Zealand subsidiary. However, because the contract is with the UK parent only, it is unclear whether the New Zealand subsidiary itself receives a supply of services. 7.6 In principle, the reverse charge should apply to all services that, if acquired offshore, would give rise to a lower GST impost than if acquired in New Zealand. However, in many instances the charge for the services will be incorporated into a larger sum. In the example used here the advertising cost to the New Zealand subsidiary may be incorporated into a general head office charge from the UK parent. Requiring the value of the service and every other component of the charge to be separately identified for the purposes of the reverse charge could create substantial administrative and compliance costs. 7.7 An important consideration in introducing a reverse charge, therefore, is to balance the objective of imposing the tax on services that, if not taxed, would give rise to distortions and the objective of minimising compliance and administration costs. US ADVERTISING COMPANY UK Co. (Parent) UK(NZ) Co. (Wholly- owned Sub.) Generic advertising £ 37 Cost allocations and related party transactions Identifying entities to which the reverse charge will apply 7.8 In some circumstances individual services supplied to a business will not be charged for or identified separately. This may be the case within a group of companies or single multi-national company, where the parent company or head office may, for example, allocate a proportion of its costs to the various parts of the enterprise. The existence of a supply of services may not be easily ascertainable in this situation. The charging of a global sum, or allocation of global costs does not, however, change the fact that a supply may have been made to which at least part of the costs relate. Thus, in principle, the nature of the charge, be it a global sum or specific charges for specific services, should not affect the GST treatment of any supplies made. 7.9 The more difficult issue is whether the New Zealand entity should be treated as distinct from its offshore parent or head office. The general approach proposed in this discussion document is to treat the New Zealand entity or presence as a separate person, but only in relation to supplies (including components of cost allocations) to which the reverse charge should apply because of the economic distortions that non-taxation would create. That is, the reverse charge will generally apply only to supplies of services that would be taxable supplies if made in New Zealand by a registered person. 7.10 Treating the New Zealand entity or presence as a separate person for the purposes of the reverse charge will require changes to the treatment of cross- border transactions between head offices and branches and cross-border transactions within groups of companies under the GST Act. Currently the GST Act, in the majority of situations, does not recognise transactions between head offices and branches and transactions within groups of companies as supplies. It is necessary, therefore, to treat parents and branches, and members of groups, as separate persons before identifying the supplies to which the reverse charge should apply. Inter-branch transactions 7.11 GST applies only to supplies made between separate legal entities. A registered person may apply under section 56 of the GST Act for separate registration of any branch, and the branch will be deemed to be a separate registered person carrying on a separate taxable activity for the purposes of the GST Act. However, an offshore parent company not carrying on a taxable activity in New Zealand might not be a registered person, so section 56 would be inapplicable to the branch in New Zealand. (Although under the current legislation an offshore parent company not carrying on a taxable activity in New Zealand is arguably able to register for GST purposes, this position needs to be reviewed, as discussed later in this chapter.) 38 7.12 Therefore, based on the current law, the reverse charge would not apply to supplies from an offshore parent to a New Zealand branch (unless section 56 has been applied). If a New Zealand supplier makes exempt supplies in New Zealand and it is a branch of a non-resident company, any supplies of services from the non-resident company to its New Zealand branch will not be subject to GST, because a single legal entity cannot make supplies to itself. 7.13 Many of the entities to which the reverse charge will apply, such as financial institutions, are branches of foreign entities. If supplies between offshore parent companies and New Zealand branches were not within the scope of the reverse charge the distortions which the reverse charge was intended to remove would be perpetuated. 7.14 Therefore for the purposes of taxing imported services, a New Zealand branch of a non-resident company should be treated as a separate entity from the offshore part of the company (unless section 56 has been applied). Intra-group transactions 7.15 Under section 55 of the GST Act, companies that are in a group of companies for income tax purposes 32 may apply for group GST registration if all of the members are registered for GST. Any person may voluntarily register for GST under section 51(3) if they can show that they are carrying on a taxable activity. A taxable activity, as defined in section 6(1), is any activity carried on continuously or regularly which involves or is intended to involve the supply of goods or services for consideration. The taxable activity definition is not restricted to activities carried on in New Zealand. Therefore it is arguable that a non-resident business which is not carrying on any business in New Zealand may register for GST if it so wishes, although it will only pay output tax on taxable supplies made in New Zealand and claim input tax credits directly related to those supplies. 7.16 This position needs to be reviewed as there seems to be little justification for a non-resident company not carrying on a taxable activity in New Zealand to be able to register for GST. At a minimum, there needs to be a restriction for the purposes of the reverse charge on the ability of such a company to register. 7.17 Based on the current legislation, therefore, a non-resident company which is a member of a group could apply, together with New Zealand members of the group, for group GST registration. Once registered as a GST group, all taxable supplies between members of the group would be disregarded. 33 32 Section IG 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. 33 Section 55(7)(c) – although adjustments must be made under sections 55(7)(db) and (dc) in conjunction with sections 21(1) and 21E to reflect any changes in use of goods and services by the group. 39 7.18 A supply of services by a foreign subsidiary or parent of a New Zealand GST group to the New Zealand arm of the group would be disregarded, and the reverse charge would not, therefore, apply. 7.19 As with inter-branch transactions, if supplies between members of groups of companies were not within the scope of the reverse charge the distortions which the reverse charge was intended to remove would be perpetuated. 7.20 Therefore intra-group transactions should not be disregarded if, but for the existence of the GST registered group, that transaction would have been charged with GST under the reverse charge mechanism. Calculating the amount subject to the reverse charge 7.21 The next issue, once the New Zealand entity or presence is separated from its offshore entity or presence, is how best to calculate the amount to which the reverse charge should apply. This requires a balance between removing the distortions which necessitate the reverse charge and minimising compliance and administrative costs. 7.22 The calculation could be made in two ways. The first would be to take the global sum or cost allocation and identify component supplies that should be excluded from the ambit of the reverse charge. This would target supplies that, in the main, have originated from a third party external to the parent company or head office, such as the advertising services of the US company in the example used earlier. An alternative would be to include in the calculation only those components of the global sum or cost allocation that would be subject to GST if supplied in New Zealand: again, supplies that have originated from an external third party. 7.23 Both approaches will give rise to the need for access to information from the offshore parent company or head office on which to base any apportionment or identification of a sum on which to apply the reverse charge. Inland Revenue would have difficulty obtaining access to such information, particularly given its limited ability under the current law to enforce requests for information made offshore in relation to GST. Taxpayers in these circumstances, who are associated with the suppliers, are in a better position to obtain this information. The Government therefore prefers the first option, which is to take the global sum and subtract the amounts that relate to specified supplies that should be excluded from the reverse charge. 7.24 Under either approach New Zealand businesses incurring cost allocations will need to be able to break down the allocations so as to identify the “taxable supply” components to enable the appropriate targeting of the reverse charge. 40 7.25 Charges that may be excluded would include exempt supplies such as interest on loans. Salaries might also be excluded. Although GST will apply in some circumstances, such as when fees are charged for seconded staff, in most cases it will not apply. The reason is that GST is not charged on the supply by an employee of services under a contract of service, and supplies within groups and between branches are disregarded for GST purposes. Excluded charges would be listed in the legislation. 7.26 The need to limit the scope for avoidance by placing higher values on the non-taxable components would also need to be considered. 7.27 If the New Zealand entity is a branch, there is no separate entity in law, and breaking down cost allocations in the manner proposed, subject to the need to minimise compliance and administration costs, would be appropriate. The issue is more difficult in the case of New Zealand subsidiaries, although, when wholly-owned, 34 there is no reason why, in principle, the same approach should not apply. 7.28 This approach can be contrasted with that in Canada. Under the Canadian Excise Tax Act 35 the true nature of any “management fee” is considered in determining whether there are multiple supplies of services to be separately characterised for the purposes of the reverse charge or one supply of management services. If the head office has a “hands on” management role (that is, control and decision making) any cost allocation or charge is generally characterised as a global “management fee” and, therefore, fully reverse charged. If not, the individual supplies are analysed and subject to the reverse charge if they come within the Canadian law. 7.29 This approach, while having some merit, also involves difficult judgments as to what constitutes “hands on management”. Summary of proposed approach 7.30 The treatment of related party transactions, management fees and cost allocations proposed in this chapter can be summarised as involving: (a)Starting from the principle that the reverse charge should apply to services which would be subject to GST if supplied in New Zealand. (b)Treating a New Zealand entity or presence as separate from its offshore presence in relation to the services described in (a). This requires: (i)Treating a New Zealand branch of a non-resident company as a separate entity; and (ii)Not disregarding supplies within a wholly-owned group of companies. 34 For GST purposes defined in section IG 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 35 Refer Policy Statement P 126. 41 (c)Calculating the amount of a management fee or cost allocation that is to be subject to the reverse charge by taking the global sum or cost allocation and identifying component supplies that should be excluded from the ambit of the reverse charge. Such charges would include exempt supplies and potentially salaries. 7.31 Ultimately, the need to achieve a balance between the appropriate targeting of the reverse charge and the minimisation of compliance and administrative costs will be dependent on practical considerations, particularly the extent to which New Zealand entities are, in fact, able to identify the separate components of cost allocations. It will also depend on the ability of the reverse charge mechanism to counteract the development of a practice of placing higher values on the non-taxable components of a cost allocation. The Government therefore welcomes submissions on these issues. 42 Chapter 8 TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES Proposed policy • A supply of services will occur in New Zealand when a New Zealand customer initiates the supply of telecommunications services from a non-resident telecommunications supplier. Non-resident suppliers of telecommunications services will be required to register for GST if they make supplies of more than $40,000 in a twelve-month period. • Telecommunications services will be excluded from the reverse charge. • The Commissioner of Inland Revenue will have a discretion not to require GST to be returned by telecommunications suppliers operating wholly offshore if it would not be cost effective to do so. Introduction 8.1 The provision of telecommunications services involves the sending or receiving of material or information by electronic or similar communications systems. As well as telephone calls, this includes Internet access and satellite transmission services. 8.2 These services are highly mobile and homogeneous, which makes it difficult to establish where they are supplied or consumed and hence where they should be appropriately taxed. Many jurisdictions have, therefore, included specific provisions in their GST legislation to deal with the taxation of telecommunications services. 8.3 This chapter examines whether similar provisions are justified in the GST Act. Telecommunications services – the issues 8.4 Technological advances and the deregulation of the telecommunications market in New Zealand have made it possible for consumers in New Zealand to purchase telecommunications supplies from international service providers as easily as they can from New Zealand service providers. 43 8.5 For example, a New Zealand resident can choose to subscribe to either a New Zealand or an American Internet service provider (ISP) for Internet connection services. The New Zealand ISP would charge GST on the connection services it provides to the New Zealand resident, whereas the American ISP would not charge GST, even though the New Zealand resident is consuming the services in New Zealand. 8.6 Therefore the absence of GST on imported telecommunications services encourages consumers to substitute domestically produced services with imported telecommunications services. The extent of this distortion in patterns of consumption depends upon how substitutable New Zealanders consider imported services to be for domestically produced services. 8.7 The absence of GST on imported services may also distort patterns of production and resource use in New Zealand. In order to stay competitive with suppliers of imported telecommunications services, New Zealand telecommunications companies would be forced to lower their prices, thereby eroding their ability to pass on the full burden of the GST levied on the telecommunications services they supply to New Zealanders. 8.8 This means that the GST system would impose a relatively higher rate of tax on the value added by domestic telecommunications companies. This would reduce their ability to compete not only in the market for their products, but also their ability to purchase resources. 8.9 Therefore the absence of a GST impost on these services encourages inefficient patterns of consumption by discouraging the consumption of domestically produced services in favour of imported services. It also discourages the domestic production of services, since domestic producers may not be able to pass on the GST cost to consumers. 8.10 The introduction of a reverse charge on imported services would remove these distortions with respect to GST-registered suppliers acquiring services for a purpose other than of making taxable supplies. Entities making taxable supplies would not be affected, as they would be entitled to input tax credits for purchases of imported services if GST was imposed. The economic distortion problem would still exist in relation to final consumers of telecommunications services – “business-to-consumer” transactions. For these transactions there is, as yet, no solution to the general problem of imposing GST on supplies of services across international borders. (See the next chapter for a discussion of this issue.) 8.11 Although these distortions and problems exist for all business-to-consumer supplies, supplies of telecommunications services are being specifically addressed as there is a smaller and more identifiable group of suppliers involved and a more immediate threat to the GST base. 44 8.12 Equally significantly, the general application of the reverse charge would not provide the much needed certainty as to the place of supply of telecommunications services. The way in which other jurisdictions have provided this certainty, and hence clarified which supplies of telecommunications services are subject to GST or VAT in the jurisdiction, is discussed in the following paragraphs. Overseas approaches European Union treatment 8.13 In 1997 telecommunications services were added to those in article 9 of the EU 6 th Directive 36 that are subject to taxation where the recipient of the service is established. Their inclusion was initially an interim measure but has now become permanent. 8.14 The rules are aimed at ensuring that telecommunications services used by customers resident in the EU are subject to EU VAT. There are two sets of rules for telecommunications services. The normal reverse charge mechanism applies to business-to-business transactions, whereas place of supply rules for business-to-consumer transactions treat certain supplies as made in the EU. Therefore, they may require a non-resident supplier to register for VAT purposes. Business-to-business supplies 8.15 Under article 9(2)(e) of the 6 th Directive, the place of supply of telecommunications services provided to customers outside the EU or provided to taxable persons (equivalent to registered persons) in the EU but not in the same country as the supplier is: (i) where the customer has its business establishment; or (ii) where the customer’s fixed establishment to which the supplies are made is located. 8.16 In this case the taxable person would return VAT under a reverse charge if the supply was from a non-resident telecommunications supplier. Business-to-consumer supplies 8.17 Under articles 9(3)(b) and 9(4) of the 6 th Directive, telecommunications services supplied by an operator established outside the EU to a private individual established inside the EU are supplied where the effective use and enjoyment of the services takes place. This also ensures that supplies made to customers who are not resident in the EU are not subject to EU VAT. In this case the supplier is required to register for and return VAT. For example, under the UK Value Added Tax Act 1994, when a UK resident 36 Which sets the framework and general rules for the VAT systems in all EU jurisdictions. 45 receives telecommunications services supplied by a non-resident and consumes them in the UK the supplier will be subject to UK VAT on those services. 8.18 If neither requirements (i) and (ii) of Article 9(2)(e) nor Article 9(4) apply, Article 9(1) treats the supply as made where the supplier is established. 8.19 Telecommunications services are defined as services relating to the transmission, emission or reception of signals, writing, images and sounds or information of any nature by wire, radio, optical or other electromagnetic systems, the provision of access to global information networks (the Internet), and the related transfer or assignment of the right to use capacity for such transmission, emission or reception. Canadian treatment 8.20 Under the Excise Tax Act non-resident suppliers of telecommunication services are liable to register for GST in Canada when they provide the services in the course of carrying on business in Canada 37 and: • a telecommunication facility is located in Canada; or • the signal is emitted and received in Canada; or • the signal is either emitted or received in Canada and the billing location for the service is in Canada. 38 8.21 The billing location is in Canada if either: • the person responsible for payment of the bill has an account with a telecommunication supplier and the account relates to a telecommunication facility that is usually located in Canada; or • the telecommunication facility used to initiate the telecommunication service is located in Canada. 8.22 If the specific rules do not apply the general reverse charge provisions can still apply when the supply is made outside of Canada. 8.23 A telecommunication service is defined as the emitting, transmitting, or receiving signs, signals, writing, images or sounds or intelligence of any nature by wire, cable, radio, optical or other electromagnetic system, or by any similar technical system, or making available telecommunications facilities to provide such emissions, transmissions or reception. 37 Section 143(1) of the Excise Tax Act. 38 Section 142(1) and Schedule IX Part VIII of the Excise Tax Act. 46 Australian treatment 8.24 Division 85 of the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 deals with telecommunication services. When final consumers receive telecommunication services from offshore the provision requires overseas suppliers to register for and return GST in Australia. 8.25 Division 85 provides that telecommunication supplies are connected with Australia, and hence subject to GST, if they are effectively used and enjoyed in Australia, regardless of where the supplier has a physical presence. 8.26 Section 85-5 provides that: “(1) A telecommunication supply is connected with Australia if the recipient of the supply will effectively use or enjoy the supply in Australia. (2)\[The section\] does not apply to a telecommunication supply, or a telecommunication supply included in a class of telecommunication supplies, if: (a)the supplier makes the supply through an enterprise that is not carried on in Australia; and (b)the Commissioner determines that collection of GST on that supply or class of supplies would not be administratively feasible.” 8.27 Thus if the supplies are made from an enterprise offshore that has no permanent establishment in Australia and the collection of tax is deemed by the Commissioner not to be feasible, there is a discretion to treat the telecommunication supply as not being a taxable supply. 8.28 Section 85-10 defines a telecommunication supply to be a supply relating to the transmission, emission or reception of signals, writing, images, sounds or information of any kind by wire, radio, optical or other electromagnetic systems. It includes: • the related transfer or assignment of the right to use capacity for such transmission, emission or reception; and • the provision of access to global information networks (the Internet). 8.29 If Division 85 applies to tax a supply the reverse charge in Division 84 does not apply. 47 Proposed application in New Zealand 8.30 The approach adopted by the EU, and latterly Australia, has shown that it may be possible to address the problems posed by imported supplies of telecommunications services, and provide the necessary definition of the tax base, by enacting specific provisions determining the place of supply for these services. The approach in these jurisdictions is to treat telecommunications supplies as being made where the customer (the person “using” the call services) resides and, therefore, to require suppliers of those services to register for GST or VAT. 8.31 It is proposed to introduce similar, but not identical, rules for taxing telecommunications supplies to operate alongside and complement the proposed reverse charge mechanism. 8.32 Telecommunications services should be defined as clearly as possible, and in a way that ensures the definition will not be made obsolete by changes in communication technology. The Telecommunications Act 1987 defines telecommunication as the conveyance from one device to another of any sign, signal, impulse, writing, image, sound, instruction, information, or intelligence of any nature, whether for the information of any person using the device or not. 39 8.33 This definition, and the definitions used in the EU and in Australia, are based on the definition of telecommunication adopted by the International Telecommunications Union (of which the New Zealand Government is a member) in the Final Acts of the World Administrative Telegraph and Telephone Conference 40 – known as the Melbourne Accord. The Melbourne Accord regulates international supplies of telecommunications. Telecommunication is defined as “any transmission, emission or reception of signs, signals, writing, images and sounds or intelligence of any nature by wire, radio, optical or other electromagnetic systems”. 8.34 A supply of telecommunications services could, therefore, be defined as the transmission, emission or reception of signals, writing, images, sounds or information of any kind by wire, radio, optical or other electromagnetic system, or by any similar technical system. It would include: • the related transfer or assignment of the right to use capacity for such transmission, emission or reception; and • the provision of access to global information networks (the Internet). 39 Note that the recently introduced Telecommunications Bill is likely to change this definition. 40 Final Acts of the World Administrative Telegraph and Telephone Conference (WATTC – 88), Melbourne, 1988. 48 8.35 The services supplied would, therefore, be the action of sending or receiving material or information provided by the telecommunications supplier to the New Zealand customer. 8.36 Under the proposed rule, a supply of services in New Zealand would occur when a New Zealand customer initiates the provision of telecommunications services from a non-resident telecommunications supplier – for example, when a New Zealand customer connects to the Internet using an overseas ISP. Conversely, if a non-resident customer initiates the provision of telecommunications services from a New Zealand-resident telecommunications supplier the supply would not be subject to GST in New Zealand. 8.37 There are two possible approaches to determining whether there is a New Zealand customer (and conversely, if there is a non-resident customer) and, therefore, whether the consumption and the supply of telecommunications services has occurred in New Zealand and is subject to GST. 8.38 The first is to treat a supply of telecommunications services as occurring in New Zealand when a person who is usually resident in New Zealand initiates a supply of telecommunications services. This approach avoids potential problems associated with identifying the jurisdiction in which the customer is actually physically located when they initiate the supply. 8.39 This approach does not, however, provide the most accurate identification of the jurisdiction in which the customer is actually present and consuming the services – it sacrifices this accuracy to provide a simple and certain result. 8.40 The second approach would be to treat a supply of telecommunications services as occurring in New Zealand when the customer who initiates the supply is actually physically present in New Zealand. This approach would require the telecommunications supplier to identify the place from which the customer is initiating the supply of telecommunications services. If the telecommunications supplier were not able to identify the jurisdiction from which the customer was initiating the supply of telecommunications services, the services could be treated as supplied either in the jurisdiction in which the customer is usually resident or the jurisdiction of the telecommunications supplier. 8.41 Although it is potentially capable of more accurately identifying the jurisdiction in which consumption actually occurs, a test which looks at where the customer is actually physically present may be more difficult to apply. Difficulties in identifying where the customer is physically located will increase with advances in technology, such as the increased use of wireless communications and Internet telephone services. 8.42 The Government welcomes submissions on the advantages and disadvantages of these approaches. 49 8.43 Under the proposed rule, a non-resident telecommunications supplier making over $40,000 of such supplies in a twelve month period will become liable to be registered for GST, and incur all the associated GST obligations. 8.44 In this situation the reverse charge will not be applied to telecommunications services. Although the reverse charge would tax such supplies to exempt suppliers, it may not be possible for telecommunications suppliers to distinguish between customers who would be liable to the reverse charge and those who should be charged GST on supplies. 8.45 It is also proposed to include a discretion for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue not to enforce the rule in relation to telecommunications suppliers operating wholly offshore if it would not be cost-effective to do so. Under such circumstances the reverse charge would also be deemed not to apply to such a supply. The section 11A(2) amendments and telecommunications 8.46 In 1999 section 11(2A), now section 11A(2), was inserted into the GST Act to ensure that section 11(2)(e), now section 11A(1)(k), did not apply to zero- rate services that were consumed in New Zealand but contracted for by a non-resident who was outside New Zealand. 8.47 Section 11A(2) provides that section 11A(1)(k) does not zero-rate services supplied to a non-resident if another person (including an employee or company director of the non-resident) receives the performance of those services in New Zealand. The provision does not apply if it is reasonably foreseeable that the supply of the services is related to the making of taxable or exempt supplies by registered persons. 8.48 At the time the amendment was made concerns were raised that it might, contrary to the policy intent, incorrectly exclude "inbound" telecommunications services from the GST zero rating provisions. 8.49 An example of an "inbound" telecommunications service is an overseas caller making a telephone call to a person in New Zealand. This service is provided to the overseas caller by an overseas telecommunication supplier who contracts with a New Zealand telecommunication supplier to connect the call in New Zealand. In this situation the New Zealand telecommunication supplier serves as a link between the overseas telecommunication supplier and the New Zealand resident receiving the phone call. Such services are intended to be zero-rated under the GST Act. 8.50 The Government does not consider that section 11A(2) applies to “inbound” telecommunications supplies, as the connection service supplied by the New Zealand telecommunications company is received by the overseas telecommunications company, not by the person in New Zealand receiving the call. This was made clear in the report of the Finance and Expenditure Committee on the Taxation (Annual Rates and Remedial Matters) Bill and in 50 the Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin article on the legislation after it was enacted. 8.51 Enacting specific rules for telecommunications services will further clarify the place of supply of telecommunications services, and hence clarify what supplies are subject to GST in New Zealand. This will ensure that connection services in relation to “inbound” telecommunications services provided by a New Zealand telecommunications supplier are not subject to GST in New Zealand. 51 Chapter 9 BUSINESS-TO-CONSUMER TRANSACTIONS Introduction 9.1 At present, most imports of services occur through business-to-business transactions. The volume of business-to-consumer transactions is still relatively small, but is expected to increase. This discussion document only proposes a solution to the problems caused by the non-taxation of business- to-business imports of services, as there is not, as yet, a viable tax collection mechanism for business-to-consumer imports of services. 9.2 This chapter outlines the problems and possible future tax collection mechanisms with regard to business-to-consumer transactions. Business-to-consumer transactions: the problem 9.3 The collection of GST from transactions involving supplies between non- resident businesses and New Zealand private consumers poses a difficult problem to which, internationally, there is yet to be a workable resolution. 9.4 The problem arises because the non-resident business will not in the usual course of events be registered for GST and, therefore, will not return GST to Inland Revenue on any sales to New Zealand consumers. 9.5 Electronic commerce has increased the extent to which services can be traded across borders. As electronic commerce further develops as a means of transacting, the extent to which it is possible and affordable to purchase services from offshore providers will increase. 9.6 Difficulties also arise when determining the residence of the consumers, principally when digitised products are being supplied, since these may be sent to an Internet address which may not have any obvious connection to the actual residence of the consumer. (For example, the address may not be identifiable as a New Zealand domain name.) 9.7 As discussed in the previous chapter, business-to-consumer transactions are a particular issue for telecommunications suppliers, as it is difficult to determine if these services are physically performed or occur at a particular location, and the services are highly mobile. Possible solutions 9.8 Four possible methods have been identified to collect GST from business-to- consumer transactions. 52 Self-assessment 9.9 Under a system of self-assessment, consumers who receive services from offshore suppliers self-assess and return GST on the value of those supplies. This means that a mechanism such as the reverse charge would apply to private consumers. This method appears at this stage to be the least effective way to subject supplies of imported services to private consumers to GST. There are significant compliance and enforcement issues, with there being no or very few incentives for consumers to comply with a requirement to self- assess. There are also difficulties in identifying those who have imported services, and difficulties relying upon consumers knowing that they must comply with the self-assessment requirement. 9.10 Placing the burden of complying with tax rules on the consumers of imported services would tend to discourage the consumption of such services, and distort consumption patterns towards domestically produced services. 9.11 Such a system is also contrary to recent simplification initiatives which aim to shift the burden of compliance from individual taxpayers, and contrary to the GST framework which avoids placing any administrative requirements on private consumers. Registration of non-resident businesses 9.12 This option would require non-resident businesses making supplies of services to a country to register for GST in that country and charge and return GST on the supplies they make, according to the GST rules of that country. Non-resident suppliers would, therefore, be treated in the same manner as New Zealand suppliers for GST purposes. 9.13 This approach is used with some success in the EU with respect to supplies of telecommunications services, apparently owing to: • the relatively limited and identifiable number of companies involved in the supply of telecommunications services, and the ability to trace those companies, since to provide their services they must interconnect with resident telecommunications suppliers; • compliance costs being limited by the need to register in only one EU nation for the purposes of all EU VAT; • the size and economic power of the EU; and • the incentives that telecommunications service providers have to comply with EU law. 53 9.14 The EC also has a broader proposal which would impose VAT on supplies of electronically delivered services based on the location of the consumer of those services (as opposed to the supplier’s location, as is currently the case). 41 Suppliers selling electronic services 42 from outside the EU to consumers inside the EU would be required to account for VAT in the same way as an EU-resident supplier. The non-resident supplier would register for, and charge, VAT in the EU. 43 The non-EU supplier would be required to register only if it made sales of more than Euro 100,000 to private consumers in the EU, and would be required to register only in one jurisdiction within the EU. 9.15 The proposal will operate alongside the reverse charge already in operation for business-to-business transactions. The proposal was adopted by the EC on 7 June 2000, but is not yet legislated for in member countries. 44 9.16 The proposal will rely partially upon international co-operation for enforcement. It will also rely upon the willingness of multinational firms to protect their goodwill and image in the EU and retain a favourable climate in the EU for non-EU suppliers to do business. 9.17 The OECD has recently published for public consultation a draft report from its working party on consumption taxes. 45 The report states that, in the short term (pending adoption of technology-facilitated options), the most viable collection mechanism to support the practical application of the Ottawa Taxation Framework Guidelines 46 to business-to-consumer transactions lies with a mechanism based on the registration of non-resident suppliers. The working party acknowledges that the registration of non-resident suppliers has its shortcomings and that simplified approaches to the registration of non-resident suppliers should be developed. 9.18 Although this approach appears to have been successfully applied to telecommunications services in the EU, there are a number of difficulties with its general application to imported services: • It would impose significant compliance burdens on the non-resident supplier, which would need to have technical knowledge of the GST or VAT systems of the jurisdictions to which it makes supplies. • It will be more difficult to enforce the registration requirement generally, as other service industries may not be as identifiable or as traceable as the telecommunications industry. 41 A Strategy to Improve the Operation of the VAT System within the context of the Internal Market COM(2000) 349. 42 For example pay-per-view television. 43 Conversely, if an EU supplier provides such services to a non-EU customer they do not have to charge VAT. 44 It is unclear, however, whether it will be implemented, as it has been reported that the UK has recently expressed opposition to the proposal. 45 A report by the Committee’s Working Party No. 9 on Consumption Taxes: Consumption Tax Aspects of Electronic Commerce , (www.oecd.org/daf/fa/e\_com/ec\_6\_WP9\_REPORT\_Eng.pdf). 46 See discussion in Chapter 1. 54 Technology-based solutions 9.19 As the identification of suppliers and recipients becomes increasingly difficult in the electronic commerce environment, owing to the growing employment of electronic cash payment systems and software protecting customer privacy, technology-based withholding systems using financial intermediaries could be used to collect GST. 9.20 Financial intermediaries would withhold the GST or VAT portion of any payment for a supply of goods or services acquired electronically, and remit the money to the relevant revenue authority. 9.21 Assuming withholding by financial intermediaries were technically feasible, the following problems might arise: • The financial intermediary would need to know the jurisdiction in which the supply was taking place. Identification of the residence of the consumer may be possible if a credit or debit card were used, but not necessarily if electronic cash were used. • The financial intermediary would need to know the GST or VAT rules of that jurisdiction. • The financial intermediary would need to know the nature of the supply, to determine the correct GST or VAT treatment. 9.22 This approach might require compensating financial institutions for the high compliance burdens placed upon them, and measures to ensure that financial institutions in jurisdictions which did not comply with the withholding framework were not used to avoid the withholding regime. Taxation at source and transfer 9.23 A further option is to enter into consumption tax agreements with countries under which a business making an export would charge and collect GST or VAT on that supply, and return that amount to their revenue authority. The revenue authority would then pass the tax on to the revenue authority of the country in which the services are acquired. 9.24 This approach would require a network of agreements between nations, and a system of incentives to encourage the revenue authority in the exporter’s jurisdiction to ensure compliance by the exporter. It would impose a compliance burden upon exporters, who would be required to have an understanding of the GST or VAT rules of the countries to which it was exporting. 55 The future 9.25 A general impost of GST on supplies of imported services from businesses to private consumers is not proposed at this stage. The New Zealand Government is continuing to participate at the OECD and discuss these issues with member countries, and will monitor the EU proposal to register non-resident suppliers of electronically delivered services.
Tax simplification 2 Taxation of Māori organisations A Government discussion document Hon Dr Michael Cullen Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue Hon Parekura Horomia Minister of Māori Affairs Hon Paul Swain Associate Minister of Finance and Revenue John Wright MP Parliamentary Under- Secretary to the Minister of Revenue The taxation of Māori organisations; a Government discussion document. No. 2 of the Tax Simplification series. First published in August 2001 by the Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department. ISBN 0-478-10345-X PREFACE This document is the second in a series of Government discussion documents that puts forward proposals for simplifying and improving the equity of the tax system. The focus of these proposals is aimed at simplifying the income tax requirements for Māori authorities and those individuals who derive benefits from these organisations. There are also proposals for clarifying how “charitable” tax exemptions apply to Māori organisations, including marae. These proposals should be considered in the light of the Government’s proposed changes that are likely to emerge from the wider review of tax and charities. The document is a genuine attempt to respond to the growing number of concerns in the Māori community that the existing income tax laws applying to Māori organisations and businesses are no longer appropriate and should be updated. Before the Government goes any further with these proposals, we seek your views on whether these proposals are workable and, if so, how they can be further improved.

Te Tiriti o Waitangi i roto i te arotake nei He kawenga tō te Kāwanatanga i raro i te Tiriti o Waitangi ki te tiaki i ngā pānga a te Māori, ki te whitiwhiti kōrero hoki me te Māori, mō ngā kaupapa nui, me ngā wāhanga o roto i aua kaupapa e hāngai ana ki te Māori. I roto i te horopaki whakarerekē ture, ka noho te Kāwanatanga ki te whiriwhiri he aha ngā pānga Māori e hāngai ana, he aha ngā whakaaro o te Māori mō ngā tūtohunga, kia aha, kia whai wāhi atu ai nga kōrero a te Māori ki te hātepe whakatau kaupapa a te Kāwanatanga. I roto i te arotake tāke nei, i oti te whitiwhiti kōrero a te Kāwanatanga ki ētahi rōpū Māori mō ngā whakahōunga kei te whakaarohia. He wāhi te tuhituhinga nei o te hātepe whitiwhiti kōrero mō te arotake. Mā te arotake nei ka whānui atu te titiro a te Kāwanatanga i a ia ka wānanga me pēhea te tāke i ngā manatū Māori, me te pānga mai o ngā ture oha ki ngā rōpū Māori. Hātepe whitiwhiti kōrero I te marama o Hui-tanguru o te tērā tau, i tūria e te Kāwanatanga ētahi huihui ki ētahi rōpū Māori, mātanga hoki, ki te aha, ki te whai i ngā urupare ki ngā ariā kaupapa here i whakaarahia, i whakahiatotia e te rōpū arotake. I āta tirohia i konei te tika o te uta tāke kamupene, tāke tarahiti hoki ki runga i ngā manatū Māori; i tirohia anō hoki ki te pupuri i ngā ture tāke o nāianei, ki te whakangāwari rānei i aua ture. I wānangatia anō te whakarerekē o te ture kaupapa oha e pā ana ki ngā rōpū Māori. Ko ngā kitenga nui i ēnei o ngā whitiwhitinga kōrero, kia whakangāwarihia ake ngā ture tāke, kia wātea ake te huarahi ki te whanaketanga o ngā rōpū, kaipakihi Māori i roto i te wā. Ko te whakaaro me ū anō hoki ngā whakarerekētanga o te ture ki te whakaaro kia iti noa ngā wā e whakapā ana te tangata ki te pūnaha tāke. Ko ngā tāngata i hoatu whakaaro, mārama ana tā rātou e kī, me hanga mai he rārangi ture mō ngā manatū Māori, engari kia āhua māmā ake te takoto. 5 Hei whakautu ki ēnei kōrero, kua whakahiatotia mai e te Kāwanatanga ētahi kaupapa here ki runga i te take nei, ā, ko tāna ināianei, ko te rapu i ngā whakaaro o te iwi mō te whakamahia o ngā ture nei, me te whakapai ake i ngā wāhi e whakaarohia ana e koutou e tika ana kia whakapaihia ake. Ko te tūmanako i roto i ngā whakaaro, ka puta i ēnei o ngā whitiwhitinga kōrero, ko ngā titiro a ngā manatū Māori, ō rātou mema, ngā mātanga tāke, tae noa ki ētahi atu, he aha ngā tikanga tāke tika rawa atu mō ngā manatū Māori, ngā rōpū Māori e tono ana kia taka rātou ki raro i te tikanga tāke tuku oha. Ina oti ana te whiriwhiri a te Kāwanatanga i ngā tono mō ngā kaupapa nei, ka titiro ia ki te hanga kaupapa here, ki te whakatakoto ture hoki. Kāore e kore ka puare ake ētahi take i te wā ka whakarerekēhia ngā ture; ka tono te Kāwanatanga mō ētahi whakaaro me pēhea te whakatutukitanga o ēnei. Te Hanga o te tuhituhinga whitiwhiti kōrero me te Rārangi Whakamārama Kua wehea te tuhinga nei ki ōna wāhanga, arā: • Ka tīpokaina e te Whakarāpopotonga te tuhituhinga i roto i te reo Māori. • Ko te Wāhanga I, e whakamārama ana he aha ngā kōrero, ngā tūtohunga o te tuhinga. • Ko te Wāhanga II, ka kōrero i ngā tūtohunga mō: -te whakapai i te hātepe tāke i ngā manatū Māori rātou ko te Kaitiaki Māori; -te whakawhānui i ngā tangohanga tāke mā ngā manatū Māori ka tuku oha ki ētahi rōpūtanga Māori. • Kei te Wāhanga III, ka takoto ngā tūtohunga kaupapa here e whakamārama ana i te pānga o ngā ture oha ki ngā rōpū katoa, engari e hāngai pū ana ki ngā rōpū Māori (tae noa ki ngā marae) ka tono whakawāteatanga tāke, i runga i tō rātou tūranga oha. • Kei te tāpiritanga, ko te tāhū kōrero mō ngā ture tāke i nga manatū Māori. He papakupu kei muri o te tuhinga nei hei whakamārama i ētahi kōrero tāke, Māori hoki kei te whakamahia. Kua tuhia ēnei ki te tuhinga itāria i tō rātou takotoranga tuatahi, kia ngāwari ai te tohutoro. 6 Tahi atu arotake tāke a te Kāwanatanga He mahi atu anō kei te mahia tērā ka hāngai mai ki te tāke o ngā manatū Māori. Tērā ka hua he painga ki ētahi rōpū Māori mea te whakangāwaritanga o roto o te tuhituhinga e kīia nei ko More time for business – Tax simplification for small business , i whakaterea i te rā 3 o te marama o Haratua o te tau 2001. Ko te tūmanako, ma ēnei tūtohinga e māmā ake ai te wāhi ki ngā tāngata kaipakihi iti, i roto i ā rātou kaupapa tāke. Ko te titiro whānui kei roto o ngā tūtohinga nei, kia torutoru noa iho ngā wā ka whitiwhiti kōrero ngā kaipakihi ki te Tari Tāke. Me whai wahi ngā rōpū Māori katoa e tono ana kia noho ki raro i te ‘kaupapa oha’ ki te pānui i ngā kōrero o te tuhituhinga Tax and charities , he mea whāki i te marama o Pipiri o te tau 2001. Ko ngā tūtohinga kei te tuhituhinga nei e rapu ana kia mārama te kupu ‘oha’, kia pai ake te taha tuku pūrongo a ngā rōpū ka taka ki raro i te whakamāramatanga tangohanga tāke ‘oha’. Te tāke i ngā manatū Māori Ngā whakamārama o ngā momo whakarerekētanga Ko te kōrero ‘manatū Māori’, i kitea tuatahi i te ture tāke moni whiwhi o te tau 1939. I whakamahia taua momo kōrero mō ngā rōpū ‘mahi’ i whakatūria ki te whakahaere poraka whenua mō ngā tāngata Māori takitahi. Ināianei, he maha ngā rōpū, kaipakihi Māori ka taka ki raro i taua taitara – Poari Māori, Marae, Poari Whenua Māori, arā noa atu. He nui ngā whakarerekētanga o ngā manatū Māori mai te tīmatanga. Kua maha ake ngā mahi, ngā rawa kei te whakahaerehia e rātou, atu i te mahi ahu whenua. Kei te ū tonu ngā manatū Māori ki ngā whāinga mai rā anō, arā, kia hua ake ko ngā taha tikanga, hapori, ōhanga hoki. Ko te mea rerekē o ēneki rā, kua rahi ake ngā mahi whakahaere me te ū ki ngā ture; i runga i tērā, me pai ake ngā pūnaha whakahaere i ngā rawa Māori. Hāūnga anō ēnei nekeneke, kei te mau tonu ngā tikanga tāke manatū Māori; ko te putanga, kāore pea i te tika ngā tikanga tāke manatū Māori. Ngā tūpuhitanga o ngā tikanga tāke manatū Māori Kua whīwhiwhi, kua kore take ngā tikanga tāke i ngā manatū Māori. Ko te hua o tēnei, kua raruraru ngā manatū Māori, tae rawa ki ā rātou mema, i te taha ū ki ngā tikanga nei, kua uaua hoki ki te Tari Tāke ki te whakahaere. Ko te tikanga, ka whai te tāke o tētahi mea i tōna tūranga i raro i te ture. Mehemea i tūria tētahi mea hei kamupene ka tākehia ia i raro i ngā tāke kamupene; he pērā anō mō te tarahiti, ka hāngai ko ngā tāke tarahiti. Ko te mea kē, kāore e hāngai tēnei mātāpono ki ngā rōpū, kaipakihi Māori. Ki te taka rātou i raro i ngā whakamārama o te manatū Māori, me whai rātou i ngā tikanga manatū Māori, ahakoa tō rātou hanga ā- ture, tō rātou ake huarahi tāke e hiahia ana rātou te whai. 7 Ka tākehia ngā moni whiwhi a tētahi manatū Māori i runga i te tokomaha o āna mema. Mēnā kei raro iho i te 20 te tokomaha o ngā mema o tētahi manatū Māori, ka tāke pēneitia rātou. Ka huia katoatia te moni whiwhi more a te manatū i roto i te tau, kātahi ka whakaritea ki tēnā, ki tēnā mema i runga i te rahi, te iti rānei o ana pānga i te manatū. Me pupuri e te manatū ngā moni tāke a tēnā, a tēnā mema, kātahi ka utua e te manatū ki te Tari Tāke. Ka tirohia, ka kīia tēnei he moni whiwhi hunga whai pānga a te mema, nā reira me whakakī e te mema tētahi puka tāke, ka huihui atu i ngā moni nei ki ētahi atu moni whiwhi, pēneki i ngā utu mahi, aha noa atu. Ka tukuna he whakawāteatanga tāke ki te manatū Māori mō ngā tāke kua utua. Ko ēnei moni hua ka tohaina, e tirohia ana, he moni whiwhi hunga whai pānga, ā, ka tākehia anō nei i whiwhia e te mema. Me uru tēnei moni whiwhi ki roto i tana puka tāke mō te mutunga tau, ki te taha o ētahi atu moni whiwhi a te mema (pēneki i te utu mahi). Ka taea anō e te mema te tono whakawāteatanga tāke mō ngā tāke i tangohia, i utua e te manatū mōna. Waihoki, ki te iti rawa te tāke i tangohia, mā te mema e utu i tērā kei te tāwēwē. I tīkina te tau 20-mema i te tauira mō ngā mema whakahoa mai te whakahoa ā-ture i te tau 1952. Nō te koroua rawa, kua pīrahia tēnei tikanga. Ehara tēnei i te tikanga hōu, pai hoki mō te whakarite i te tāke a ngā rōpū Māori. Ki te kō atu i te 20 ngā mema o tētahi manatū Māori, ka tākehia a rātou moni whiwhi ka toe i te paunga o te tau, i te reiti 25 ōrau. Ki te tohaina e te manatū ētahi moni whiwhi ki tētahi o ana mema, ka noho te moni rā hei mea tango mā te manatū, engari ina tae aua moni whiwhi ki roto i ngā ringaringa o tētahi mema, ka tākehia te mema ki te 33% i raro i te tikanga tāke pupuri. Ko ngā tohatoha ki ia mema, (tae noa ki te wāhanga tāke pupuri) e tirohia ana, he moni whiwhi peke, ā, ka whakaurua ki te puka tāke, ki te pūrongo moni whiwhi rānei a ia mema. I tua atu, ka ratoa he whakawāteatanga tāke ki te mema, e taurite ana ki te tāke pupuri e 33% kua tangohia e te manatū. Mēnā kei raro iho i te 33% te reiti tāke tuarua ki te mema, ka āhei ia ki te tono ki te Tari Tāke kia whakahokia te rahi e tāwēwē ana ki a ia. Ki te nui ake i te 33% te reiti tāke tuarua a te mema, me utu e te mema tērā e nama ana. Mehemea he rahi atu ngā moni i tohaina ki ngā mema, ki te moni whiwhi more i kuhu mai i roto i te tau moni whiwhi, ka tareka e te mema te tono kia uru atu taua moni ki ngā puka tāke o tētahi o ngā tau tata e whā kua pahure. Ki te pā mai tēnei āhuatanga, ka whiwhia te manatū ki ngā tāke o aua moni whiwhi o aua tau tawhito. I runga i te tikanga whā tau e kōrerohia i runga ake nei, hei ētahi wā kua tōpūngia ngā tāke. Kua utua e te manatū te tāke (i te 25%), nō reira, ko ngā tohatoha o aua moni ka whai, ka tākehia ina tau ana ki ngā ringa o te mema. 8 Te whakatau he aha ngā tikanga tāke e tika ana mō ngā manatū Māori Ko ngā tikanga tāke e mea ana, kia tākehia ngā rōpū i runga i te ara e tika ana, ā, kia aro atu hoki ki te āhua, te hanga, tae noa hoki ki ngā mahi ki ngā here o runga i aua rōpū. Ko te tikanga, ka tākehia he mea i runga i tōna hanga i raro i te ture, nō te mea, ko te hanga ā-ture o tētahi rōpū, manatū aha noa, ka tohu ki tōna āhua. I runga i tērā, ka tākehia te kamupene i raro i ngā ture tāke kamupene, ka tākehia te tarahiti i raro i ngā ture tāke tarahiti. I te whakataunga ko tēhea te tikanga tāke pai rawa mō ngā manatū Māori, e tika ana kia titiro te Kāwanatanga mēnā ka tākehia ngā manatū i runga i tō rātou hanga i raro i te ture. Ehara i te mea he ōrite ngā rōpū, ngā kaipakihi ka taka ki raro i taitara ‘manatū Māori‘. He rerekē ō rātou hanga, ō rātou āhua i raro i te ture, ā rātou kaupapa mahi, ngā hua ka puta i a rātou, ā rātou mema, ō rātou whāinga hoki. I runga i te huhua o ngā rerekētanga o ngā manatū Māori, he uaua te uta i ngā tikanga tāke kamupene, tarahiti hoki ki runga i te katoa o ngā manatū Māori. Hei tauira atu, ko ngā manatū Māori e tiaki ana i ngā rawa a te iwi, hapū rānei, i te nuinga o te wā, kāore ō rātou rārangi o ā rātou mema. Me te aha, ka tino uaua te uta i ngā tikanga pupuri hea (he tikanga tērā ka mahia i raro i te tikanga tāke kamupene), te whakarite rānei i ngā moni whiwhi ki tēnā, ki tēnā mema (tērā kia whakamahia i raro i ngā tikanga tarahiti). Nā runga i te āhua hiranga o ngā manatū Māori, me te whānui o ā rātou kaupapa, ko te whakaaro o te Kāwanatanga, kāore pea i te tika tēnei pūnaha tāke mō rātou, tae rawa ki a rātou mema, nā te uaua o te whakakī. Ko tētahi anō āhuatanga me titiro, ko te rerekē o ngā tāngata whai pānga ki ngā manatū Māori ki ētahi atu tāngata utu tāke he rite nei ō rātou rawa. Hei tauira atu, he nui ngā here e uaua ai te hoko a te mema o tētahi manatū Māori i ana hea, kāore i pēnei i te tangata he hea āna i roto i tētahi kamupene, ka taea noa iho e ia te hoko i ana hea. Ko tā te Kāwanatanga tirohanga, tērā pea e tika ana kia takoto he rārangi tikanga ake mō ngā rōpū, kaipakihi Māori e ahu mai nei ō rātou moni whiwhi i ngā rawa nō te katoa. Nō reira, e tautoko ana te Kāwanatanga kia pupuritia tētahi rārangi tikanga ake mō ēnei mea. Ngā tūtohunga kia pai ake ngā mahi tāke manatū Māori (wāhanga 4) Kei te wānangatia e te Kāwanatanga ngā tūtohunga e toru e titiro ana ki ngā tikanga tāke manatū Māori he mea māmā, mārama hoki ki te whai. Ka hāngai ēnei tūtohunga e toru ki ngā raru pēneki i te tōpū o ngā tāke o ngā moni whiwhi a te manatū Māori, me ngā here i runga i te āheinga o te manatū Māori ki te whakamahi i ētahi atu tikanga tāke māia ake. 9 Taketake ake ngā tūtohunga e toru nei i ngā tauira tāke kei te whakamahia ināianei i raro i ngā ture tāke moni whiwhi (pēneki i te tauira kamupene, tarahiti rānei), engari kua hurihia kia hāngai ake ki ngā āhuatanga ake o ngā manatū Māori. (1)Te tikanga tāke o nāianei i ngā manatū nui (tirohanga tuatahi) Ka hāngai ake ki ngā manatū Māori katoa te tikanga tāke i ngā manatū Māori e 20 neke atu rānei ā rātou mema, ka mutu, ka whakatikatikahia ngā pōraruraru (pēneki i te tōpūtanga o ngā tāke). Ka whakakorehia te wā tatari whā tau, ka whakakuhuna ko tētahi tikanga e tareka ai te huri i aua tohatoha rawa tāwere hei tātai tāke, ka tango mai i ngā moni whiwhi ā ngā tau kei te tū (pēneki i te hingatanga i roto i ngā tauhokohoko). Ka pā tonu mai te tāke pupuri ki ngā moni whiwhi ka tohaina ki ngā mema, engari ka arotakengia e te Kāwanatanga te reiti o nāianei, kia hāngai atu ki te toharite o te reiti tāke moni whiwhi o taua mema. Me mātua uru atu ngā tohatoha nei ki te puka tāke, pūrongo moni whiwhi rānei a te tangata. (2)Te tāke whakamutunga i te taumata manatū (tirohanga tuarua) Ka tākehia whakamutuhia ngā moni whiwhi a ngā manatū Māori katoa. Koinei te tāke mutunga i te taumata o te manatū. Kāore e tākehia i tua atu te moni nei ina tau atu ki ngā ringaringa o ngā mema. (3)Tāke pupuri i runga i te moni whiwhi me te whakawāteatanga tāke (tirohanga tuatoru) Ko ngā moni whiwhi a ngā manatū Māori katoa, ka tākehia i te taumata manatū ki te tāke pupuri. Ka tukuna ngā moni tāke nei ki tētahi pūtea tāke, ka tāpirihia ngā whakawāteatanga tāke ki ngā tohatoha ki ia mema. He aronga ēnei whakawāteatanga tāke mō ngā tāke kua utua kē e te manatū mō aua moni whiwhi. Ka taea e ngā mema te whakamahi i ngā whakawāteatanga tāke nei mō ō rātou ake kawenga tāke moni whiwhi. Ko ngā tohatoha hua pēnei i te whakawāteatanga tāke, ka kīia e te Tari Tāke, he moni whiwhi peke, ā, i runga i tērā, me whakakuhuna ki te puka tāke, pūrongo whiwhi moni rānei; i tua atu, ka taea te tono wāteatanga tāke mō ngā take i utua e te manatū Māori. Ko ngā tāke ka utua e te manatū i raro i tēnei tikanga, ka kīia he tāke pupuri, ko tōna rite, ko ngā tikanga wātea tāke kei runga i ngā kamupene. Ngā rerekētanga hei whakapai ake (wāhanga 5) Kei te hiahia anō te Kāwanatanga ki te whakatikatika i ngā take e whai ake nei. 10 He whakamāramatanga hōu o te “ Manatū Māori ” Ki tā te Kāwanatanga titiro, me whāiti mai ngā tikanga hōu kei te whakaarohia, ki ērā rōpū, kaipakihi Māori, e tiaki whenua, rawa ana mō te Māori. Ki te pēneki te takoto o ngā tikanga hōu, kua kore e āhei te kuhu mai o ngā rōpū tūmataiti he tokomaha ō rātou mema Māori, ki roto i te kaupapa. Ko tētahi huarahi e tareka ai tēnei, ko te rārangi ko wai ngā momo rōpū ka āhei ki te noho i raro i ngā tikanga hou. Mā te whakamahi i te rārangi nei, ka aukatia te kuhu a ngā rōpū tūpono he tokomaha ā rātou mema Māori, ki raro i ngā tikanga hou. Tērā ka kuhuna atu ki te rārangi e whakaarohia ana ko: • ngā rōpū i whakatūria i tā Te Ture Whenua Māori 1993 i takoto (engari kaua ko ngā tarahiti kaitiaki); • ngā rōpū i whakatūria i tā te Ture Poari Kaitiaki Māori i takoto; • ngā rōpū i whakatūria hei painga mō ngā Māori katoa; • ngā rōpū i whakatūria hei painga mō te iwi, te hapū rānei (mēnā he wāhi nui o te katoa o ngā tāngata); • te Kaitiaki Māori; • ngā marae. Tikanga Pōti ki waho Ka taea e ngā manatū Māori te puta ki waho o ngā tikanga manatū Māori kei te whakaarohia, ka hoki ki ngā tikanga kei runga i te tūmatanui – mēnā e hāngai ana rātou ki ngā paearu o ēnei tikanga. Ki te tutuki e te manatū Māori ngā paearu o te kamupene, o te tarahiti o tētahi atu mea rānei, me te whakaaro, he pai atu tāna kuhu ki ērā tikanga, me tuku noa iho. He whakamāramatanga o te “Māori” Ka whakarerekēhia te whakamārama o te “Māori” i a ia ka hāngai ki te “manatū Māori”, kia whai wāhi atu ai ko te tangata takitahi, ko ētahi atu manatū. Mā tēnei whakarerekētanga, e mārama ai te kī ko te ‘manatū Māori’, ka taea tōna whakatū hei painga mā te Māori takitahi, mā te manatū Māori, mā rāua tahi rānei. Ki te nōhia mai ko te tikanga whānui o nāianei e pā ana ki te manatū Māori, ka pupuritia tēnei o ngā whakarerekētanga. Ki te whakakuhuna ko te whakamārama hou o te “manatū Māori”, kāore he take o te pupuri ki te whakarerekētanga nei, nō te mea kāore he whanaungatanga i waenganui i te whakamāramatanga hou o te “manatū Māori” me te whakamāramatanga o te “Māori”. He pānga tō ngā whakarerekētanga ki te whakamārama o te kupu “Māori”, ki ngā whakawāteatanga tāke e pā ana ki ngā tohatoha kei te tirohanga tuatahi. Otirā, ka whakaaetia ngā tangohanga ki te manatū Māori mō ana tohatoha ki ngā tāngata takitahi, ki ētahi atu manatū Māori rānei. 11 Te whakamahia o te mana whakahaere o te Kōmihana o Te Tari Tāke E toru ngā wāhi whakamahia ai e te Kōmihana tōna mana e pā ana ki ngā tikanga o ngā manatū Māori. I tēnei wā, he kawenga tō te Kōmihana ki te whiriwhiri mēnā kei te ahu mai ngā moni whiwhi a ngā manatū Māori i ngā haupū rawa, i ngā moni puta rānei. Ina tau ana tērā, kua āhei tana whakarite i te tikanga tāke tika mō ngā manatū Māori, i a rātou ka pakari mai i tētahi manatū pakupaku, ki tētahi manatū rahi. Me whakatau anō e te Kōmihana mehemea ka taka ngā tohatoha ka tohaina ki tētahi Māori, ki raro i te haumi, i te toha moni whiwhi rānei. I raro i ngā whakarerekētanga kei te whakaarohia, tērā ka tangohia ngā momo mana nei, nō te mea kua kore kē he take, kāore hoki i te hāngai ki te hiahia a te Tari Tāke, mā te kaiutu tāke anō a ia e aromātai. Ka noho mā ngā manatū Māori anō e whiriwhiri mēnā ko tā rātou e toha, he toha moni whiwhi, he toha haupū rawa rānei, ā, mēnā ko te toha he haumi taketake, he toha moni whiwhi rānei (ka rite ki ētahi atu mea). Nō te mea ka whakatūria mai he anga tāke kotahi mā ngā manatū Māori katoa, kua kore e korikori ngā tikanga tāke ina tipu ake he manatū ‘rahi’ i te manatū ‘iti’. Te whakawhānui ake i ngā tangohanga mō ngā oha ki ngā rōpū kua mana kē tā rātou tūranga hei rōpū oha (wāhanga 6) I te wā nei, ka taea e ngā manatū Māori ngā tangohanga mō ngā oha ki ētahi rōpū Māori (ko te taumata o ēnei oha kia kaua e kake ki runga ake o te 5% o ngā moni whiwhi more a te manatū). Mai te tau 1952, kua wātea tēnei tangohanga ki ngā manatū Māori. I whakatūria ēneki, kia pai ai te tuku oha a ngā manatū ki ngā Komiti a Te Kaunihera Māori o Aotearoa, i runga i te whakaaro, he nui ngā painga i ngā mahi a aua komiti. I hurihia ngā ingoa o ngā Komiti ki te rōpū Māori i raro i te Ture Whanake Hapori Māori 1964. Ko tā te arotake, he rapu mēnā kei te hāngai tonu aua tangohanga ki ēnei rā. Ko ngā tirohanga tuatahi kei te whakaatu mai, kei te tāmi te tikanga nei i ngā manatū Māori nā te mea, arā atu kē te maha o ngā rōpū kei te tautokona e ngā manatū. Kei te whakaaro te Kāwanatanga ki te whakawhānui atu i ngā tangohanga mō ngā moni oha ki ngā rōpū oha whai mana, waihoki, ka uru atu ko te nuinga o ngā rōpū Māori, tae noa ki ērā rōpū e mahi ana i ngā kaupapa mā te hapori. Ka rite te tūtohunga nei ki ngā tangohanga oha mā ngā kamupene kei te kōrerohia i roto i te tuhituhinga mō te tāke me ngā rōpū oha. Te unu i te tikanga tāke “kanohi” e pā ana ki te Kaitiaki Māori (wāhanga 7) Ko ngā moni whiwhi mai ngā whenua e whakahaeretia ana e te Kaitiaki Māori, ka tākehia i raro i ngā tikanga manatū Māori, hāunga ngā wā ka noho te Kaitiaki Māori hei kanohi kohikohi, kanohi tohatoha i ngā reti, i ngā utu hea, i ngā moni hua mā te hunga nō rātou ngā whenua. I ēnei wā, kua ūtaina ētahi tikanga tāke ake. Ko tā te arotake, he rapu mehemea kei te whai kiko tonu tēnei tikanga, inarā ngā āhuatanga e rerekē ai te noho a te Kaitiaki Māori. 12 I whakaurua ngā tikanga tāke “kanohi” i te tau 1974, nā te whakapae kei te tōpūhia te tāke o ētahi o te hunga he panga ō rātou e tiakina ana e te Kaitiaki Māori, nō te mea he kaumātua rātou, he hunga moni whiwhi iti rātou. I koneki, ka ūtaina te reiti tāke 7.5 ōrau ki ngā moni whiwhi a te Kaitiaki Māori i mua o te tohatoha ki te hunga whai pānga, hāunga anō te mea tērā pea kāore he kawenga tāke o tēnā, o tēnā tangata takitahi. I koneki ka tōpū te utu i ngā tāke. Ko tā te Kāwanatanga kia unuhia ngā tikanga nei, nā te mea kua kore e hāngai, me te mea anō, he nui hoki te utu ki te Kaitiaki Māori. Ka hāngai ngā tikanga manatū Māori ki te Kaitiaki Māori i ngā wā katoa. Te tāke i ngā rōpū Māori e tono ana i te wātea tāke “oha” (wāhanga 8) Ki te hiahia tētahi rōpū ki te tono kia mahia e ia ngā tikanga wātea tāke oha i te Ture Tāke Moni Whiwhi 1994, me eke ia i te tikanga o te kupu nei o te oha. E rua ngā wāhanga o te whakamātautau oha. Tuatahi, ki te tūria he mea oha, me noho ko tōna tino, ko ngā kaupapa oha; tuarua, me hua ōna painga ki tētahi wāhanga āhua nui o ngā tāngata katoa. Ko tētahi mea tuarua e mōhiotia nei, ko te whakamātautau painga tūmatanui. Te whakarerekē i te whakamātautau “painga tūmatanui” Ko te āwangawanga nui a ngā manatū Māori pēneki i ngā marae e hiahia ana i ngā tangohanga tāke oha, rite tonu tā rātou hinga i te wāhanga ‘painga tūmatanui’ o te whakamātautau. Ahakoa te mea ka tae ngā painga taha oha a ngā manatū Māori ki ngā iwi, hapū, kāore pea e whakaaehia tā rātou tono nā te mea, ko aua momo painga, ka ahu kē ki tētahi hunga tūranga whānau, kāore ki ngā tāngata katoa. I whakatūria te arotake nei ki te wānanga mēnā ka kīia tētahi mea he rōpū oha, ki te hua ngā painga ki ngā uri anake. I hāngai ngā kōrero tuatahi katoa me te Māori ki te take o te hono ā-toto. I roto i te arotake nei, kua whāiti mai te titiro ki ngā hononga ā- toto anake. Ko te kōrero kua puta i ngā whitiwhitinga kōrero katoa, kāore pea i te tika te whakamātautau “painga tūmatanui” mō Aotearoa, he kore nōna e aro atu ki te āhua ake o te noho ahurei o ngā momo tikanga i Aotearoa. Ko tā te Kāwanatanga, mēnā e kīia ana e te ture, he rōpū oha tētahi rōpū, me kaua e aukati i tana āheinga ki te tangohanga tāke “oha”, i runga noa iho i tana hingatanga i te paearu ‘ painga tūmatanui’. Nō reira, ko te tūtohunga a te Kāwanatanga kia whakarerekēhia te whakamāramatanga o te ‘kaupapa oha’ i te Ture Tāke Moni Whiwhi, kia kore e taea te whakakore i te tono tangohanga tāke i runga noa iho i te mea ka hua ngā painga ki ētahi tāngata whanaunga anake. 13 Engari me ū tonu te mea ki ētahi atu o ngā paearu o te rōpū oha whaimana, arā, i te ‘kaupapa oha’, me te mea anō kei te hua ngā painga ki tētahi wāhi nui tonu o ngā tāngata katoa. Ko ngā take hei whakaaroaro i te wā ka whiriwhiria mēnā ka hua he painga o tētahi mea ki “tētahi wāhi nui tonu o ngā tāngata katoa”, ko: te āhua o te mea; tokohia ōna mema; te pānga a tēnā mema ki tēnā. Ko te mea uaua ki ngā mea Māori e tono ana kia noho hei rōpū oha whaimana, ka taea te wehe i ngā rawa mai i te Māori. Ina katia tētahi rōpū oha whaimana, ko te tikanga, me tuku kē ōna rawa ki tētahi anō rōpū oha whaimana, e kore e taea te whakahoki ki te hunga nā rātou i tuku atu i te tuatahi. He take tēnei ka pā ki ngā rōpū oha whaimana, waihoki, he take nui tēnei te tuku whenua Māori ki roto rōpū oha whaimana. Te tū o ngā Marae hei mea oha I kīia ake i mua rā, kāore e kore ka hinga ngā marae i te wāhanga “painga tūmatanui” o te whakamātautau he aha te rōpū oha, nō te mea ko ngā painga ka hua ake i ngā marae, ka riro e te hapū e te iwi rānei e pā ana ki taua marae. I tua atu, kāore i te tino mārama mehemea ka taka ngā take e tū ai ngā marae ki raro i te whakamārama ture- noa o te “ kaupapa oha”.

As a result, these rules have not been updated to reflect the evolutionary changes that Māori entities have undertaken or, more importantly, the role that these entities play in facilitating Māori economic and social development. Nor have they incorporated the major tax policy reforms that have occurred in the last 50 years. 1.2 This situation has led to repeated calls from various Māori groups for the tax laws applying to Māori organisations to be reviewed. There is growing concern that these laws have become outdated and complex, and may actually inhibit Māori economic and social development. In particular, it is believed that existing tax rules impose unnecessary compliance costs on Māori organisations and their members and that, in some cases, there can be double taxation on the income of these organisations. 1.3 In response, the Government has embarked on a review of the income tax laws applying to Māori organisations with a view to developing workable solutions to the problems with those laws. 1.4 The review examines the specific rules applying to organisations that are known as “Māori authorities”. It also includes a review of how aspects of the law of charities, such as the “public benefit” test, apply to Māori organisations seeking exemption from tax on the grounds of charitable status. The review focuses on the income tax treatment of Māori organisations. It does not extend to how these entities must account for GST; nor is it concerned with how certain income sources (such as Treaty settlement payments) are to be treated. 1.5 This discussion document is the product of the Government’s review so far. It contains policy proposals to amend the specific tax rules for Māori authorities, including the Māori Trustee, and to clarify how the law of charities applies to all organisations, especially iwi-based and hapū-based organisations and marae. Objectives of the review 1.6 The main objective of this review is to determine whether the income tax laws applying to Māori organisations and businesses are a barrier to Māori economic and social development – and, if so, how those barriers can be removed while allowing Māori organisations and businesses to meet their tax obligations. 20 1.7 This review also forms part of the Government’s programme for simplifying the tax requirements for businesses and individuals and its continued commitment to improving the equity of the tax system. 1.8 The package of proposals is intended to improve the way Māori authorities are taxed. Specifically, the proposals would remove the potential for double taxation under the Māori authority rules and address a number of technical problems with those rules. They would also minimise the extent to which individual members of Māori authorities must interact with the tax system. 1.9 The proposals dealing with “charitable” tax exemptions for Māori organisations (including marae) should provide greater certainty for those organisations about how the exemption applies in their specific cases. The proposal to relax aspects of the “public benefit” test is not limited to Māori organisations, although it is especially relevant to them. The Treaty of Waitangi in this review 1.10 Under the Treaty of Waitangi, the Government is required to actively protect Māori interests and to consult with Māori on significant matters where there are particular Māori issues at stake. In a law-reform context, this involves the Government in identifying relevant Māori interests, and gathering Māori views on the proposals, so that the views of Māori can be taken into account in informing the Government’s decision-making process. 1.11 The Government has already consulted with various Māori groups on the development of the proposed reforms, as part of this tax review. This discussion document represents a further step in the review’s consultative process. It is intended to inform the Government’s decision making on the future tax treatment of Māori authorities and the ways in which the law of charities applies to Māori organisations. Consultative process 1.12 In February last year, a series of focus-group discussions were held with Māori organisations and tax practitioners to seek feedback on initial policy ideas that the review team had developed. These initial ideas considered the appropriateness of applying company and trust taxation to Māori authorities, and the options for retaining and simplifying current Māori authority tax rules. Options for amending the law of charities as it relates to Māori organisations were also canvassed. 1.13 The key view arising from this consultation round was that the tax rules for Māori authorities should be simple and flexible in order to accommodate the future development needs of Māori organisations and businesses. It was also believed that the tax rules should be consistent with the Government’s desire to minimise, as far as practicable, the extent to which individuals must interact with the tax system. There was a clear preference for retaining a 21 separate set of rules for Māori authorities – but in a more efficient and simplified form. 1.14 In response to these views, the Government has developed a number of policy proposals to address these issues. It now seeks your views on how these proposals will work in practice and your suggestions on how they can be improved. 1.15 It is hoped that this round of consultation will indicate the views held by Māori authorities, their members, tax practitioners, and other interested parties on the most appropriate income tax treatment for Māori authorities and Māori organisations seeking a “charitable” tax exemption. 1.16 Once the Government has considered the submissions received on these proposals, it will finalise its policy proposals and look to introduce legislation. As transitional issues may arise from the introduction of these changes, we welcome submissions on how these transitional issues could be addressed. The structure of this document This discussion document is in several parts: • The whakarāpopotonga summarises the discussion document in Māori. • Part I provides an overview of the contents of this document and its proposals. • Part II discusses the proposals for: - improving the way Māori authorities and the Māori Trustee are taxed; and - extending the scope of the specific deduction provision that is currently available to Māori authorities who make donations to Māori associations. • Part III discusses the policy proposals for clarifying how aspects of the law of charities applies to all organisations, especially Māori organisations (including marae) that seek exemption from tax on the basis of their charitable status. • The appendix surveys the history of the Māori authority tax rules. There is also a glossary at the back of this document, to explain tax and some Māori terms that are used. These terms are italicised when they first appear from this point on, for your easy reference. Other Government tax reviews 1.17 Work is being undertaken in other areas that may also be relevant to the taxation of Māori organisations. 22 1.18 Some Māori organisations may also benefit from the simplification changes that are proposed in the discussion document More time for business – Tax simplification for small business , which was released on 3 May 2001. These proposals are aimed at reducing the stress, uncertainty and risk that the requirements of the tax system place on small businesses. The proposals are also aimed at reducing the need for all businesses, irrespective of their size, to communicate with Inland Revenue. 1.19 Māori organisations that have a “charitable” tax exemption or that seek to apply for such an exemption should also read about the proposals contained in the discussion document Tax and charities , released on 14 June 2001. The proposals contained in this document seek to modernise the definition of a “charity”, and to improve the accountability and reporting requirements for organisations that have a “charitable” tax exemption. 23 Chapter 2 SUMMARY OF PROPOSALS Improving the way Māori authorities are taxed (chapter 4) 2.1 Three options are being considered to replace the current mix of rules applying to Māori authorities. These options are based on the existing tax models used in income tax law, but they have been modified to take into account the specific characteristics of Māori authorities. In all three options, there would be a single set of rules for all Māori organisations that meet a new definition of a “Māori authority”. (See 2.2 for this definition.) (1)The current tax treatment for “large” authorities (option one) The income of all Māori authorities would be taxed according to the tax rules that currently apply to Māori authorities with more than 20 members, and the technical problems with those rules (such as the potential for double taxation) would be addressed. The four-year rule, which limits the ability of an authority to deduct excess distributions, would be replaced with a mechanism to allow these distributions to be treated as tax losses that the authority can carry forward for offsetting against its income in future years. Member distributions would still be subject to resident withholding tax, but the Government would review the existing rate to ensure it is set at a level that reflects, on average, members’ marginal tax rates. (2)Final tax on income at the authority level (option two) The income of all Māori authorities would be subject to a final tax at the authority level. Distributions of that “tax-paid income” would be exempt from further tax in a member’s hands. (3)Withholding tax and tax credits (option three) The income of all Māori authorities would be subject to a withholding tax at the authority level. The withholding tax paid by the Māori authority would be credited to a tax credit account, and the resulting tax credits would be attached to the distributions on a pro rata basis. These tax credits would recognise the tax that the authority has already withheld and paid on that income. Members would use these tax credits to offset their own income tax liability. 24 Remedial changes (chapter 5) A new definition of “Māori authority” 2.2 The Government is considering limiting the scope of the proposed rules to those Māori organisations that administer land and other assets held in common ownership for iwi or hapū. To do this, it would redefine “Māori authority” so that private entities that just happen to have Māori members would not be eligible to apply the Māori authority rules. 2.3 The new definition would list the types of organisations eligible to apply the Māori authority rules. The proposed list is likely to include: • those organisations established in accordance with Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 (but excluding kaitiaki trusts ), the Māori Trustee Act 1953, and the Māori Trust Boards Act 1955; • organisations established for all Māori or for the benefit of iwi or hapū (if these groups are large enough to constitute an appreciably significant section of the public); and • marae. “Electing out” mechanism 2.4 Māori organisations and businesses would have the option of electing out of the proposed Māori authority rules and applying general tax rules instead – but they would have to meet the criteria for those general rules. A possible redefinition of “Māori” 2.5 The definition of “Māori” in “Māori authority” could be clarified, to include individuals and other authorities that are legally or beneficially entitled to any gross income of a Māori authority. This change would make it clear that a Māori authority can be established for the benefit of individual Māori, other Māori authorities, or both. The change would only be required if the current broad definition of “Māori authority” is retained. 2.6 The redefinition would also affect the deductibility of distributions under option one – that is, applying the tax treatment for “large” authorities (those with more than 20 members) to all authorities. Māori authorities could then claim deductions for distributions made both to individual Māori and to other Māori authorities. 25 Removing unnecessary discretionary powers of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue 2.7 At present, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is required: • to determine whether Māori authority income is from capital or revenue sources; • to adjust the tax liability of Māori authorities as they move between “small” authority (those with 20 or fewer members) and “large” authority taxation; and • to make a determination on whether a distribution from a Māori authority to a “Māori” is a bona fide investment or a distribution of income. 2.8 These discretionary powers are unnecessary, and are inconsistent with the current emphasis on taxpayer self-assessment. They would be removed. Māori authorities would be able to assess whether a “distribution” is a distribution of income or capital, and also whether a distribution is a bona fide investment or a distribution of income (as other entities are able to do). Because a single tax structure would apply to all Māori authorities, there would be no need for any adjustments when authorities move between “small” and “large” categories. Extending the scope of the deduction for donations to organisations with approved donee status (chapter 6) 2.9 Currently, Māori authorities can obtain deductions for donations they make to Māori associations, up to a maximum of 5 percent of the authority’s net income. The Government is considering extending the scope of this deduction to apply to donations of money to organisations with approved donee status , which would include most Māori associations and also those Māori organisations operating for community purposes. 2.10 This would be consistent with the donation deductions for companies proposed in the Tax and charities discussion document. Removing the “agent” tax rules applying to the Māori Trustee (chapter 7) 2.11 The income from properties administered by the Māori Trustee is taxed under Māori authority rules except when the Māori Trustee acts as agent in the collection and distribution of rents, royalties and interest for the property owners. In these circumstances, the income is subject to specific tax rules. The Government proposes to remove these rules, as they are no longer necessary and are a source of compliance costs for the Māori Trustee. The proposed Māori authority rules would apply to the Māori Trustee in all situations. 26 Taxation of Māori organisations seeking a “charitable” tax exemption (chapter 8) 2.12 An entity wishing to take advantage of the “charitable” tax exemptions in the Income Tax Act 1994 must first satisfy the common law meaning of a charity. This imposes a two-step test. Firstly, an entity must be established for a charitable purpose and, secondly, it must be for the benefit of the public or an appreciably significant section of the public. The second step is known as the “ public benefit” test . Changing the “public benefit” test 2.13 The main concern for Māori authorities (including marae) that wish to use the “charitable” tax exemption is that they will usually fail to meet the “public benefit” test. While Māori authorities often provide benefits of a charitable nature to iwi and hapū and may in fact have charitable purposes, they may not qualify for an exemption because their benefit extends to a group of people connected by blood ties, rather than to the general public. 2.14 The Government considers that if an organisation meets the legal requirements for “charitable purpose”, then it should not automatically be excluded from the “charitable” tax exemption simply because it fails to meet the “public benefit” test. 2.15 The Government therefore proposes to amend the Income Tax Act so that an organisation will not cease to be eligible for charitable status simply because its purpose is to benefit a group of people connected by blood ties. However, the organisation must still meet the other requirements of a charity – that is, having a charitable purpose and benefiting an appreciably significant section of the public. Factors to be considered in determining whether the organisation benefited an “appreciably significant section” of the public would include: the nature of the entity; the number of potential members; and the degree of relationship between members. Charitable status for marae 2.16 As mentioned earlier, marae would generally fail to meet the “public benefit” test for a charity because they are usually established for the benefit of a hapū or iwi that is affiliated to the marae. Furthermore, it is not clear if the purposes for which marae are established meet the common law meaning of “charitable purpose”. 2.17 The Government considers that marae should be able to claim charitable exemptions, provided that certain requirements are met (see 2.18). This would recognise the important role that marae play in New Zealand society by supporting a way of life for New Zealanders within a structure of Māori culture and values. 27 2.18 Marae would qualify for a “charitable” tax exemption if they meet the following requirements: • The marae must apply its funds to specific purposes. These purposes will include maintaining the physical structures of the marae and supporting activities traditionally carried out on the marae. • The marae activities must not be carried on for the private financial gain of any person. 2.19 Marae that do not meet these requirements would be treated as Māori authorities. However, if they prefer, they could choose instead to be treated under general tax rules – for example, as a non-profit body – as long as they meet the requirements for this. 2.20 The discussion document Tax and charities contains proposals for updating the definition of “charitable purposes” and improving the reporting requirements for charities. These proposals are likely to have implications for Māori organisations and marae who seek “charitable” tax exemptions under the proposed changes. Key questions and specific issues for consultation 2.21 Before it makes final decisions on whether to proceed with the various proposals discussed in this document, the Government is seeking the views of interested parties. Parts three and four of this document contain “key questions” and “specific issues for consultation” that are intended to promote feedback on the proposals. Submissions 2.22 You can provide your feedback by: • Attending one of our consultation hui to be held in August and September 2001.

Part II The taxation of Māori authorities This part of the discussion document discusses policy proposals for improving the way Māori authorities and the Māori Trustee are taxed. It also discusses the proposal for extending the scope of the deduction provision currently available for donations to Māori associations. 31 Chapter 3 MĀORI AUTHORITY TAX RULES AND THEIR LIMITATIONS History of the Māori authority tax rules 3.1 The first specific set of rules applying to Māori authorities appeared in 1939 and formed part of the Land and Income Tax Act 1923. These rules were intended to apply to the various “working” organisations that administered large blocks of farmland owned in common by individual Māori (and not in private ownership). These organisations were the first to become known as Māori authorities. They included the Board of Māori Affairs, the Māori Trustee, the Māori land boards, special statutory trusts (such as the East Coast Commissioner), and various land trusts under Māori land legislation. 3.2 Although the rules were largely concerned with the taxation of income from Māori land, they also applied to any income earned by an organisation that administered property, income or reserves in trust for the benefit of Māori. Thus the essential character of all the organisations covered by the term “Māori authority” was that of trustee for the individual members. 3.3 In 1952, a new framework for the taxation of Māori authorities was introduced as a result of the recommendations made by a Commission of Inquiry. The Commission had been established to ascertain whether certain Māori farming operations were fully complying with their tax obligations and whether the law on this could be made clearer. 3.4 The original framework of the 1952 rules continues to apply today, although it has been modified from time to time to incorporate changes in tax rates and the tax structure (including the introduction of resident withholding tax on distributions made by Māori authorities). The appendix provides an overview of the history of the Māori authority rules. Current context and Māori authorities 3.5 Māori organisations and businesses that manage Māori assets have proliferated since the 1950s, and the Māori authority rules now apply to a much wider range of organisations than they did originally. They include Māori trust boards, rūnanga , Māori land trusts, and certain Crown/Māori organisations that have been established for the purpose of managing and facilitating the return of assets to Māori in accordance with the Treaty settlements process. 32 3.6 The organisations and businesses covered by the term “Māori authority” are not a homogenous group. The glossary contains descriptions of some of the main organisations that fall within this group. The unique and defining characteristics of Māori authorities that the Government has identified are summarised in the box below. What is a Māori authority? Māori authorities provide a range of financial and non-financial benefits. For example, a Māori incorporation may pay dividends to its members in the same way as a company provides dividends to its shareholders, while other authorities provide their members with certain rights to participate in the decision-making process, or to access non-financial benefits. These non-financial benefits are usually collective in nature and not private. They can include the retention of tribal lands, protection of waahi tapu , grants to marae, kōhanga reo and kura kaupapa , and education scholarships. Māori authorities differ in the definition of their “membership group”. Some Māori land trusts have clearly defined members (this is usually linked to a person’s vested interest in the land), whereas the membership of a Māori trust board is usually defined with reference to an individual’s connection with a particular iwi or hapū. Some Crown/Māori organisations have a pan-tribal membership base. Most Māori authorities administer Māori freehold land . Māori land ownership is generally characterised by multiple owners in a single block of land. Owners of Māori land and associated assets frequently have little or no control over the structure for owning and administering these assets, and the management of these assets is regulated by Māori land legislation. An individual Māori usually inherits an interest in Māori land and must accept the decision of the Māori Land Court on how the property is to be administered. That person also has limited ability to sell his or her interest and little or no control over who the co-owners are. Māori authorities often have multiple objectives that embrace political, cultural, social, and commercial dimensions. The relative mix of these objectives may vary from authority to authority. Māori authorities differ in size. Some authorities are small land-owning trusts, while other authorities resemble large corporate structures. Māori authorities are involved in a broad range of activities. These activities include education and training programmes (which are the most common), property investment, farming, fisheries, tourism, business loan portfolios, and employment schemes. Some authorities such as trust boards have invested in other areas such as the hospitality industry, housing construction, meat processing, broadcasting, orcharding, community welfare, and property administration. 33 How the current rules work Key definitions 3.7 All section references are to the Income Tax Act 1994, unless otherwise stated. “Māori authority” 3.8 The term “Māori authority” is defined in section OB 1 as: • the Māori Land Board or the East Coast Commissioner; or • the Māori Trustee, except when acting as agent in the collection and distribution of rent, royalties or interest; or • a Māori incorporation created by Court order under the Māori Land Act 1993. 3.9 The definition also includes any person or body of persons (other than an executor of a deceased person’s estate or the trustee of a private trust) who administer or control property or income in trust for the benefit of Māori. “Māori” 3.10 The term “Māori” is defined in section OB 1 to mean a person belonging to the aboriginal race of New Zealand and a person descended from a Māori. 1 The definition also includes (except for the purposes of the definition of “Māori authority”) any person legally or beneficially entitled to any gross income of a Māori authority. 3.11 This definition is also relevant in determining whether a “distribution” qualifies as a deduction. This is because Māori authorities can only obtain deductions for distributions made to a “Māori”. 3.12 The terms “beneficial owner”, “owners” or “beneficiary” are commonly used in place of the term “Māori”. This discussion document, however, uses the term “member” because of its inclusiveness and because of the express reference to “a person legally or beneficially entitled ...” in the legislation. “Person” 3.13 Section OB 1 defines a “person” for income tax purposes. A “person” includes both an individual and an incorporated or unincorporated entity such as a company, marae or Māori authority. 1 There is a section reference error in the definition of “Maori” in the Income Tax Act 1994. The reference to sections HH 1 to HH 5 should be a reference to sections HI 1 to HI 5. 34 “Distributions” 3.14 Section HI 1 sets out specific rules for distributions made by a “large” Māori authority. (There are no specific rules for distributions made by a “small” authority.) 3.15 The term “distribution” includes any amount that is paid, credited or advanced by a Māori authority for the individual personal benefit of a Māori. The definition of distribution also includes any property that is transferred or otherwise disposed of by a Māori authority to a Māori. 3.16 The tax treatment of distributions depends on whether the Commissioner of Inland Revenue regards a distribution as being out of income or not. If a distribution is out of income, it is treated as a deduction to the authority and as a dividend subject to resident withholding tax in a member’s hands. If a distribution is not out of income (for example, if the distribution represents a distribution of a capital nature), the authority cannot claim a deduction for it and it is not subject to resident withholding tax in the member’s hands. 3.17 A further rule applies if the authority is in the course of termination . Distributions made in the course of termination of a Māori authority are regarded as out of income, unless they are from amounts derived in previous years and have not been taken into account in calculating the income tax liability of the authority. Two classes of authorities 3.18 The substantive provisions of the Māori authority rules are contained in sections HI 1 to HI 5. The income of a Māori authority is taxed differently depending on the number of members for whom income is derived. There are two classes of Māori authorities for income tax purposes, “small” authorities (those with 20 or fewer members) and “large” authorities (those with more than 20 members). 3.19 If the number of members having a beneficial interest in a Māori authority changes above or below the threshold of 20 in an income year, then section HI 5 gives the Commissioner of Inland Revenue power to make adjustments that are “just and reasonable”. Tax rules for “small” authorities 3.20 Section HI 4 provides for the assessment of income tax for “small” authorities. 3.21 The net income for the year of a “small” authority is allocated to each member on the basis of his or her interest in the assets of the authority. The authority must withhold tax on the income allocated to each of its members and must pay this to Inland Revenue. 35 3.22 The income that is allocated to each member is treated as beneficiary income and is taxed as if the member had actually received it. The income allocation must be included in the member’s end-of-year tax return, along with any other income received by the member (such as salary and wages). The member can also claim a tax credit for the tax that was deducted and paid by the authority on the member’s behalf. 3.23 If the authority has deducted too much tax, the member is entitled to a refund. Similarly, if the authority has under-deducted tax, the member is required to pay the shortfall. Tax rules for “large” authorities 3.24 Section HI 3 provides for the assessment of income tax for “large” authorities. A “large” authority pays tax on the income it retains at the end of the year (that is, net income minus distributions) at the rate of 25 percent. 3.25 The distribution rules set out earlier apply specifically to the amounts distributed by “large” authorities. If a distribution is out of income it is treated as a deduction (for the authority) and as a dividend subject to resident withholding tax of 33 percent (for the member). 3.26 If the amount distributed is greater than the net income earned in that year, the amount of the excess distribution may be claimed as a deduction from the income retained in any of the four immediately preceding years. When this happens, the Māori authority receives a refund of the tax that was paid on that income in the previous year(s). 3.27 Distributions to a member (including the resident withholding tax portion of those distributions) are treated as gross income and are included in the member’s end-of-year tax return or income statement. Members also receive a tax credit equal to the 33 percent resident withholding tax that has been deducted from these distributions by the authority. If a member’s marginal tax rate is less than 33 percent, the member can apply to Inland Revenue for a refund of the difference. If a member’s marginal tax rate is higher than 33 percent, the member must pay the additional tax due. 3.28 Table 1 summarises the tax consequences for distributions made by a “large” authority. 36 T ABLE 1: T AXATION O F D ISTRIBUTION DistributionsAuthority levelMember level From current year’s income Deductible to the authorityTaxed at member’s marginal tax rate From income “retained for between one and four years” Deductible to the authority, but only in respect of the four immediately preceding years (The authority must apply for a reassessment of the relevant year in which there is sufficient income against which to take the deduction.) Taxed at member’s marginal tax rate From income “retained for more than four years” No deduction permitted (The authority is prevented from claiming back the tax that was previously paid on the value of those distributions.) Taxed at member’s marginal tax rate Double taxation can occur Other provisions 3.29 Section 31 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires an authority to provide the following information to each member who has received a distribution: • the amount of the distribution; • the individual’s obligation to include this amount in their return if they are required to file; and • the amount that is liable for tax in their hands. 3.30 Section 57 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires the authority to provide the Commissioner of Inland Revenue with a complete statement of: • taxable income; • the amount distributed to each member; • the names and addresses of those members; and • the number, if any, of those members on the Māori electoral roll. 2 Limitations of the current rules The distinction between “small” and “large” authorities 3.31 The 20-member threshold was based on the 1952 figure for the legal maximum number of partners in a partnership. That maximum number has since been repealed. The 20-member threshold is therefore outdated, and is now an arbitrary way of determining how the income of a Māori authority should be taxed. 2 It is unclear why there is a requirement for Maori authorities to provide the number of members they have on the Maori electoral roll. In practice, this information is not provided. 37 3.32 Furthermore, it is possible that the tax rules for “small” authorities could create cashflow problems for its members. “Small” authority members are taxed on the income earned by the authority each year, regardless of whether that income is actually distributed to its members. So the member might have a tax liability, without having received any cash distribution that would help meet that tax liability. Double taxation of Māori authority income 3.33 The most significant problem for “large” authorities concerns the potential for double taxation of authority income. 3.34 The tax on income that has been retained by a large Māori authority for more than four years cannot be claimed back by the authority when that income is distributed. When it is distributed, it will almost always be treated as a member’s gross income and so will be taxable again in the member’s hands. Since members cannot get a credit for the tax that was previously paid by the authority, double taxation occurs. 3.35 While this problem can be avoided if the authority distributes its income within four years, the process of managing these distributions within the four-year window is complex and involves high compliance costs. 3.36 Māori authorities must go through a process of reassessment of one or more of the last four income years in which there is undistributed income. The distribution is then allowed as a deduction, and is offset against the undistributed income in that year. The authority receives a refund of the tax already paid, which can in turn be distributed. Māori authorities must usually repeat this process more than once before coming close to distributing the original amount retained, and they often never receive a full refund of the tax that they have paid within the last four years. 3.37 This problem has implications for the economic development of Māori authorities. There is an incentive to distribute income within four years to avoid double taxation, and a further incentive to distribute the current year’s income to avoid the high compliance costs of the reassessment process. Therefore Māori authorities may be discouraged from retaining income for long-term development purposes. The definition of a Māori authority 3.38 A Māori authority is not a legal entity in itself. It is a term used in tax legislation to describe a wide range of Māori organisations. An organisation could be set up as a company or trust and yet meet the criteria for the definition. If an organisation meets the criteria, it has no choice but to apply the Māori authority tax rules, even though other tax rules may be more appropriate for its purposes. 38 3.39 Under the current definition, private entities that just happen to have Māori individuals as their members could also be eligible to apply the Māori authority rules. If they did so, this would undermine the principle that only those entities that hold property in communal ownership for individual Māori should apply the Māori authority rules. 3.40 There are also references in the current definition to the East Coast Commissioner and the Māori land boards, both of which no longer exist. These entities were established by the Native Lands Act 1909, but their functions were devolved to the Māori Land Court and the Māori Trustee as a result of the Māori Affairs Act 1953. The definition of “Māori” 3.41 The reference to “any person legally or beneficially entitled to the gross income of a Māori authority” in the definition of “Māori” suggests that it can include a corporate body or a marae. It is not clear whether a person other than an individual was intended to be included in the definition of Māori, since the context of the definition and all other references in it refer to individuals of Māori ancestry. 3.42 A clear definition is especially relevant to the deductibility of distributions for a Māori authority. To qualify as a deduction for a Māori authority, a distribution must be to a “Māori”. If a “Māori” is restricted to individuals only, then the authority would be unable to deduct distributions made to associated Māori authorities, such as grants. 3.43 A further problem concerns the interrelationship between the definitions of “Māori” and “Māori authority”. A Māori authority must be for the benefit of a class of members that includes individuals of Māori ancestry. It seems that an authority cannot be established for the benefit of non-individuals alone. This creates problems for authorities that are established for the benefit of affiliated Māori authorities (even though these affiliated authorities are, in turn, established for the benefit of individuals of Māori ancestry). Discretionary powers of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue 3.44 Many income tax provisions give discretionary powers to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. These discretionary powers permit flexibility in addressing unforeseen situations, and they are generally used when it is undesirable to legislate for matters of detail or for multiple variations. In practice, taxpayers usually apply to Inland Revenue for these powers to be exercised. 39 3.45 There are three instances in which the Commissioner is able to exercise his discretion under the Māori authority rules. These are: • in determining whether distributions from a Māori authority to a Māori are from capital or revenue sources (because capital distributions are passed on to a member tax-free, whereas revenue distributions are not); • in making necessary adjustments to the income tax liability of an authority in the year in which a “small” authority becomes a “large” authority (so that income taxed under the tax treatment for “small” authorities is not taxed again under the tax treatment for “large” authorities); and • in determining whether a distribution to a Māori is a bona fide investment or a distribution of income. 3.46 In practice, the Commissioner rarely exercises his powers. Māori authorities usually make these decisions themselves as part of the return-filing process. However, as long as legislation allows the Commissioner to exercise his discretionary powers, it treats Māori authorities differently from other taxpayers and undermines the general principle of self-assessment. 3.47 The existence of discretionary powers also leads to unnecessary administrative costs for Inland Revenue. Furthermore, it creates compliance costs for taxpayers, because of the uncertainty about whether they must specifically apply for particular discretions to be exercised. 3.48 The recently introduced Taxation (Annual Rates, Taxpayer Assessment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill removes the discretionary powers of the Commissioner that relate to taxpayers making their annual assessments. However, the bill does not deal with the discretionary powers of the Commissioner in the Māori authority rules. Over-taxation of distributions made by a “large” authority 3.49 In most cases, resident withholding tax is imposed on all distributions made to members of “large” authorities at the rate of 33 percent. It is believed, however, that many members have marginal tax rates lower than 33 percent, and that many members are not required to file tax returns. In this situation, the resident withholding tax becomes a final tax and over-taxation occurs. 40 Chapter 4 IMPROVING THE WAY MĀORI AUTHORITIES ARE TAXED Proposed policy Three options are being considered for replacing the current mix of rules for Māori authorities with a single set of rules that would apply to all Māori authorities. (Māori authorities could also choose to apply general tax rules in appropriate circumstances – see chapter 5.) (1)T HE CURRENT TAX TREATMENT FOR “ LARGE ” AUTHORITIES ( OPTION ONE ) Under option one, the current tax rules that apply to Māori authorities with more than 20 members would be extended to all Māori authorities, and the technical problems with those rules would be addressed. The current four-year limit on the ability of an authority to deduct excess distributions would be replaced with a mechanism that allows these distributions to be treated as tax losses that the authority can carry forward for offsetting against its income in future years. Member distributions would be subject to resident withholding tax at an appropriate rate. (2)F INAL TAX ON INCOME AT THE AUTHORITY LEVEL ( OPTION TWO ) In option two, a Māori authority’s income for each year would be subject to a final tax at the authority level. Distributions of that income would be exempt from further tax in the member’s hands. (3)W ITHHOLDING TAX AND TAX CREDITS ( OPTION THREE ) Option three would apply a withholding tax to a Māori authority’s income for each year. The amount of tax paid by the authority would be credited to a tax account, and the resulting tax credits would be attached to distributions on a pro rata basis. These tax credits would recognise the tax that the authority has paid, and members could use these credits to offset their own tax liability. Determining appropriate tax rules for Māori authorities 4.1 Tax rules are intended to tax entities in the most appropriate way, taking into account an entity’s specific characteristics, structures, conditions, and activities. This usually means applying tax rules that are consistent with an entity’s legal form, because legal form closely determines an entity’s specific characteristics. 41 4.2 In determining the most appropriate tax treatment for Māori authorities, the Government needs to look at whether Māori authorities should be taxed according to their legal structure. 4.3 The organisations and businesses covered by the term “Māori authority” are not a homogenous group. Māori authorities differ in terms of their legal structure and size, the types of activities that they have entered into, the range of benefits they provide, their membership group, and their mix of objectives. 4.4 These wide-ranging characteristics make it impracticable, in most cases, to apply to all Māori authorities the tax rules for companies or trusts. For example, Māori authorities that administer assets in trust for the benefit of iwi or hapū generally do not have defined membership lists. As a result, it would be difficult if not impossible to apply the technical requirements of shareholder continuity (as may be necessary under the company tax rules) or, in some cases, attribute income to individual members (as may be necessary under the trust rules). 4.5 Because of the specific characteristics of Māori authorities and their wide- ranging nature, the Government considers that this basis of taxation may be impracticable for Māori authorities and their members and may lead to unnecessary complexity and cost. 4.6 An additional consideration centres on the important differences between the underlying owners of the assets administered by Māori authorities (especially Māori land) and other taxpayers with similar investments. For example, members of a Māori authority have limited ability to sell their interests in the assets of the authority, whereas a shareholder with an investment in the shares of a company can generally dispose of his or her interest without restriction. The Government has reached the view that there may need to be a separate set of rules for Māori organisations and businesses that derive income from assets held in common ownership. Options for improving the way Māori authorities are taxed 4.7 As stated at the beginning of this chapter, the Government is considering three options for making the current Māori authority rules simpler and clearer. These three options address problems such as the potential for double taxation of Māori authority income and the restrictions that limit the ability of Māori authorities to apply other, more efficient tax rules. 42 4.8 The three options are based on tax models used in existing income tax law (such as the company or trust tax models) but have been modified to take account of the specific characteristics of Māori authorities. 4.9 In developing its proposals, the Government is attempting to balance a number of competing objectives including: • ensuring that members who receive distributions are taxed on that income at their respective marginal rates; • minimising the costs for Māori authorities in complying with their tax requirements; • minimising the extent to which members who receive financial benefits from Māori authorities have to file returns or complete income statements to correct any underpayment or overpayment of tax; and • recognising the specific characteristics, structures and conditions of Māori authorities, and also the activities they undertake. The Māori authority tax rate 4.10 A key feature in each of these options is the applicable tax rate for Māori authorities. For illustrative purposes, the tax rate for authorities in the examples below has been kept at the current rate of 25 percent. 4.11 Under option one, the resident withholding tax rate on member distributions is also an important consideration. For illustrative purposes, the rate applied is the current resident withholding tax rate of 33 percent. 4.12 The Government has not yet made a final decision on the appropriate tax rates for Māori authorities and resident withholding tax. It welcomes submissions on this issue. (1) T HE C URRENT T AX T REATMENT F OR “L ARGE ” A UTHORITIES (O PTION O NE ) Key features 4.13 This option would have the following features: • The undistributed income of a Māori authority would be taxed at an appropriate tax rate in the year the income is earned. • Distributions to members that are made out of income would be deductible to the Māori authority. • Distributions to members that are made out of income would be treated as “dividends” subject to resident withholding tax. 43 • Members would receive a cash distribution and a resident withholding tax credit. Since the gross value of distributions would be taxed in members’ hands, members would be able to use this tax credit to offset the tax they must pay on the distributions. • If the authority makes a distribution in excess of its current income (that is, a distribution of retained earnings), this excess distribution would be able to be carried forward as a tax loss for offsetting against the authority’s future income. Link with existing tax model 4.14 Under option one, Māori authorities would be taxed in a similar manner to a co-operative company – that is, using a tax deduction for distributions (rebates) paid to its members. How the proposal would work 4.15 Table 2 shows the tax effect on the Māori authority and on the member. For illustrative purposes, it is assumed that the authority derives income of $1,000 each year. It also assumes that the tax rate on the Māori authority’s undistributed income is 25 percent, that the resident withholding tax rate is 33 percent, and that the member’s marginal tax rate is 21 percent.

As the authority is taxed on its undistributed income at the rate of 25 percent, the authority must pay tax of $250. Thus cash reserves available to the authority at the end of year one are $750. 4.17 In year two, the authority distributes the retained income from year one and the $1,000 earned in year two. Total distribution is $1,750, which is fully deductible by the Māori authority. The amount distributed in excess of the income earned in year two is $750. This amount can be carried forward as a loss to the next year and can be offset against any income in that year. 4.18 If the loss is offset against year three’s income, the following would occur: Net income1000 Less income distributednil Less losses brought forward(750) Taxable income (loss)250 Less tax paid at 25%(62.5) Cash reserves available937.5 4.19 In year three, the loss would be deducted from that year’s net income after taking into account any current-year distributions. The net result (that is, the “taxable income”) represents the undistributed income for year three, which is subject to tax at the rate of 25 percent. 4.20 Māori authorities would not be subject to the shareholder continuity rules that measure shareholding changes (and they are not subject to these rules currently). So the authority could carry forward its losses until these are fully used. This recognises the practical difficulties that Māori authorities have in keeping up-to-date membership records; and it also recognises the unique nature of Māori land ownership and its process of succession. 4.21 The proposed change to the definition of “Māori” would, by itself, have implications for Māori authority distributions under option one. That is, it would allow deductions for distributions made to other Māori authorities as well as to individuals. Implications for members 4.22 Member distributions would be subject to resident withholding tax at 33 percent. In year two, members would receive a distribution of $1,750. That distribution would comprise a cash amount of $1,172.50 and resident withholding tax credits of $577.50. Because the marginal tax rate of each member is assumed to be 21 percent, which is lower than the withholding rate of 33 percent, each member could claim a refund of the difference. The tax refund is $210. 45 Resident withholding tax rate on member distributions 4.23 As mentioned earlier, the current resident withholding tax rate of 33 percent can lead to over-taxation of distributions. To address this problem, the Government is considering adjusting the resident withholding tax rate so that, on average, the correct amount of tax is withheld. Key question for option one How should an appropriate resident withholding tax rate be set for distributions from a Māori authority? “Deemed distribution” rules 4.24 As detailed later in this discussion document, the Government proposes to clarify the definition of “Māori” so that it includes both individuals and other Māori authorities (see chapter 5). It also proposes to extend the donations deduction so that this applies to all donations to organisations with approved donee status (see chapter 6). These proposed changes have particular implications for Māori authority distributions under option one. 4.25 If a Māori authority member has approved donee status, the authority would be faced with a choice in claiming a deduction for distributions. It could claim the deduction either as distributions of income to members, or as donations to Māori organisations with approved donee status. (The latter deduction would be capped at 5 percent of the net income of the authority.) 4.26 The Government proposes to remove the element of uncertainty from this. Māori authorities would be required to treat their distributions as distributions of income to members, rather than as donations. Advantages and disadvantages 4.27 The main advantage of option one is that it involves the least change to existing rules. Māori authorities that have administrative methods in place to manage the current rules should not have to change these substantially. Also, they should not incur any costs associated with setting up new compliance systems. “Small” authorities could opt out of the Māori authority rules under the proposed “electing out” mechanism (discussed in chapter 5) if they wished. 46 4.28 Māori authorities would not have to distribute income within four years in order to avoid double taxation, since they would be able to carry forward any excess distributions as a tax loss and would benefit from a lower tax liability in a subsequent year. Māori authorities would also be relieved of the requirement to apply for reassessments of past income years to claim refunds for tax paid when retained earnings are distributed. 4.29 However, option one is still complex and may be difficult to operate in practice. This is because Māori authorities would still have to: • claim deductions for distributions they make; • deduct resident withholding tax from these distributions; and • issue resident withholding tax certificates to those members who receive distributions. 4.30 Option one could still result in some double taxation if the Māori authority is unable to use its losses in future years. Alternative approach considered for the four-year limit 4.31 The Government also considered removing the four-year limit and allowing deductions for distributions beyond the four immediately preceding years. Although this would have provided an up-front cash refund of tax paid in previous years, it would have been more complex (and possibly impractical) to administer. 4.32 Removing the four-year limit would have required Māori authorities to keep more extensive records; and there would never be certainty of closing the books off, as there would always be the possibility of reassessment. Administrative costs for Inland Revenue would also have been higher. As a result, the removal of the four-year limit was not pursued further. Transitional issues 4.33 Transitional rules would probably not be necessary under option one. This is because the Māori authority would be able to claim a deduction for all distributions made out of income, with any excess distribution being carried forward as a loss and offset against net income in the following year(s). 47 (2) F INAL T AX O N I NCOME A T T HE A UTHORITY L EVEL (O PTION T WO ) Key features 4.34 This option would have the following features: • The income of a Māori authority would be taxed (in the year the authority earns it) at an appropriate final tax rate. • This final tax rate would serve as a substitute for members’ marginal tax rates. • Distributions to members would not be deductible by the authority. • The final tax would apply to authority income regardless of whether it is distributed. • All member distributions would be tax-free in members’ hands. Link with existing tax model 4.35 Under option two, the Māori authority would pay tax on behalf of its members. The tax paid would be a final tax. This is similar to what is done by a superannuation fund (in respect of income earned from its members’ investments) or by a trust (in respect of income retained by the trustee). How the proposal would work 4.36 Table 3 shows the tax effect on the Māori authority and on the member when the authority has retained income in one year for distribution in a subsequent year. For illustrative purposes, it is assumed that the authority derives income of $1,000 each year, that the final tax rate is 25 percent, and that the member’s marginal tax rate is 21 percent. T ABLE 3: T AX EFFECTS OF OPTION TWO Authority levelYear 1Year 2 Taxable income10001000 Less tax at 25%(250)(250) Income after tax750750 Accumulated cash reserves available for distribution 7501500 Less distributions to members0(1500) Member levelYear 1Year 2 Cash distribution received01500 After-tax amount01500 48 Implications for the authority 4.37 In this example, a final tax rate of 25 percent is applied to the income of the authority as it is earned in each income year. The authority pays tax of $250 in year one and $250 in year two, and makes a distribution of $1,500 in year two. Implications for members 4.38 The member receives a tax-exempt cash amount of $1,500. In this example, there is over-taxation because the tax rate of the Māori authority is higher than the marginal tax rate of the member. If the member’s tax rate was higher than 25 percent, there would have been under-taxation. Advantages and disadvantages 4.39 Under option two, there are likely to be compliance cost savings for the Māori authority and for its members. Māori authorities would not have to undertake the current reassessment-and-refund process associated with the four-year rule. Nor would they have to deduct resident withholding tax from distributions. The potential for double taxation of income would be avoided because the tax at the authority level is final, and members who receive distributions from the authority would receive them free of any further tax requirements. 4.40 This option could, however, lead to over-taxation of income distributed to members with lower marginal rates and under-taxation of income distributed to members with higher marginal rates. The extent of this problem would vary over time, and would depend on both the numbers of individuals who are under-taxed and over-taxed and the degree to which they are affected. If distributions are for small amounts, the benefit of taxing this income at the correct rate would be outweighed by the costs of compliance. But if distributions are large, the potential for under-taxation or over-taxation would become more of an issue. 4.41 A key feature of this proposal is therefore the establishment of a tax rate that will allow the members of a Māori authority to minimise underpayment and over-taxation. Distribution threshold 4.42 Because of concerns about the potential for under-taxation and over-taxation, the Government is also considering whether a “distribution threshold” should be adopted to help address this problem. 49 4.43 For example, a threshold of $200 a year per person would mean that the final tax would apply to distributions up to $200, but distributions over $200 would have tax credits attached to them. Members could either receive a refund (if the distribution is over-taxed) or pay tax (if the distribution is under-taxed). Key question for option two If a distribution threshold is supported, what would be an appropriate threshold level and what compliance issues would arise? (3) W ITHHOLDING T AX A ND T AX C REDITS (O PTION T HREE ) Key features 4.44 This option would have the following features: • The income of a Māori authority would be taxed in the year the authority earns it, at an appropriate withholding tax rate. • The tax paid by the Māori authority would be credited to a tax credit account and this tax could be attached to distributions that are made out of income. • Distributions to members that are made out of income would have tax credits attached, to reflect the tax paid at the authority level. • The tax credit account would not be subject to the shareholder continuity rules. • The cash amount of the distribution and the value of the tax credit would be included in a member’s gross income. • Tax credits would be fully refundable. • Distributions would not be deductible by the authority. Link with existing tax model 4.45 Option three employs a model similar to that of the company imputation tax credit but with a slight modification. The tax credit mechanism would act in a manner similar to imputation tax credits that are attached to company dividends. But option three’s tax credits would be fully refundable (whereas imputation tax credits that cannot be used must be converted into a tax loss). 50 4.46 The reason for making option three’s tax credits fully refundable is that members would often not have enough other income against which to offset tax losses. Given this, and also the fact that the distribution amounts involved are usually small, it seems unnecessarily burdensome to require that small tax losses be carried forward from year to year. How the proposal would work 4.47 Table 4 shows the tax effect on the Māori authority and on the member when the authority has retained income in one year for distribution in a subsequent year. For illustrative purposes, it is assumed that the authority derives income of $1,000 each year, that the withholding tax rate is 25 percent, and that the member’s marginal tax rate is 21 percent.

These rules restrict the tax benefit of imputation tax credits to those people who have paid the original tax. Applying these rules to Māori authorities would give rise to practical difficulties. For example, membership lists are often incomplete for a variety of reasons – people may not have succeeded to their interest or be aware of the need to do so, or they may simply have lost touch with the authority. 4.50 To ensure that a Māori authority has paid sufficient tax to attach to member distributions, the tax credit account would be required to operate in a way similar to an imputation tax credit account – that is, it must not be in a debit balance at the end of year. Otherwise, the authority would be able to attach more tax credits than what it has actually paid. Implications for members 4.51 Members can use tax credits to offset their personal tax liability. Therefore the member could receive a refund (if the member’s tax rate is lower than the authority’s tax rate) or pay additional tax (if the member’s tax rate is higher than the authority’s tax rate). Advantages and disadvantages 4.52 Māori authorities would not have to undertake the current reassessment-and- refund process associated with the four-year rule. Nor would they have to deduct resident withholding tax from distributions. Option three also avoids the inequitable outcomes that could arise under option two, because the tax credit mechanism eliminates over-taxation and under-taxation of individual members’ income. The tax credit mechanism ensures that Māori authority income is not subject to double taxation. 4.53 However, the costs for Māori authorities and their members may be higher under option three than they are under option two. Māori authorities would incur the costs of tracking the tax paid and attaching tax credits to distributions. Members would also be required to file tax returns or complete income statements in order to claim the tax benefit of the tax credits (as they must do currently in relation to resident withholding tax). Key question for option three What difficulties could arise for organisations using a tax credit account? 52 Specific issues for consultation (chapter 4) The Government seeks your views on the following matters: • What option is most preferred? • What compliance issues would arise under each of the options and how could these be addressed? • Under option one, how should an appropriate resident withholding tax rate be set for distributions from a Māori authority? • Under option two, what would be an appropriate threshold level? • Under option three how difficult would it be for Māori authorities to use a tax credit account? 53 Chapter 5 REMEDIAL CHANGES Proposed policy The following remedial changes to the tax rules for Māori authorities would apply under each of the options outlined in the previous chapter: • The definition of “Māori authority” would be clarified to ensure that only those Māori organisations and businesses that administer Māori property in common ownership could apply the Māori authority rules. • Māori authorities would also have the option of electing out of the Māori authority rules and applying general tax rules (provided they meet the criteria for those general rules). • The definition of “Māori” would be clarified so that for tax purposes a “Māori” could be an individual or another authority. • The Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s discretionary powers over the Māori authority rules would be removed. Definition of “Māori authority” 5.1 As mentioned earlier, the main policy reason for retaining a separate tax treatment for Māori authorities is to recognise the unique characteristics of Māori organisations and businesses and, in particular, their role in administering Māori land and assets held in common ownership for Māori. The Government therefore considers that the scope of the proposed rules should be limited to those organisations that administer land and other assets held in common ownership for Māori. 5.2 One of the ways of achieving this would be to list those organisations that would be eligible to apply the new rules. The list would be used to ensure that private organisations that just happen to have members of Māori ancestry would not be eligible to apply the new rules. 5.3 The proposed list could include: • organisations established in accordance with Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 (but excluding kaitiaki trusts); • organisations established in accordance with the Māori Trust Boards Act; 54 • organisations established for the benefit of all Māori; • organisations established for the benefit of iwi or hapū (if these groups are large enough to constitute an appreciably significant section of the public); • the Māori Trustee; and • marae. 5.4 The Government proposes to exclude kaitiaki trusts from the list of Māori authorities because these trusts administer assets on behalf of individuals. They do not administer assets held in common ownership for Māori. (All other organisations established under Te Ture Whenua Māori are likely to meet the criteria of “administering assets held in common ownership for Māori”.) Key questions If a list is an appropriate way to define Māori authorities for tax purposes, what other organisations should be added to this list? What organisations should not be on the list? If you consider a list is not appropriate, what other ways are there for defining a “Māori authority”? Removing redundant references 5.5 The definition of “Māori authority” would also be updated to remove redundant references to the East Coast Commissioner and the Māori land boards. These entities no longer exist. “Electing out” mechanism 5.6 Māori authorities would also have the option of electing out of the proposed rules and applying general tax rules instead – but only if they meet the criteria for these rules. If a Māori authority does meet the criteria for a company or trust or some other entity type and considers it more efficient to apply those rules, then it should be able to do so. 5.7 The concept of “electing out” received considerable support during the policy-testing consultation round. Those consulted were of the view that “election” provides flexibility and, in turn, a recognition that the nature and purpose of Māori organisations is likely to evolve over time. 55 5.8 However, the Government is concerned that entities might move in and out of the Māori authority rules in order to avoid tax. For this reason, it is proposed that if Māori authorities elect out of the Māori authority rules they would not be able to elect back in. This should reduce compliance costs for entities moving in and out of tax rules; it should also reduce administrative costs for Inland Revenue. 5.9 Depending on which of the three options is adopted, transitional rules may be required when a Māori authority elects to be taxed under general tax rules. For example, if option three is adopted, transitional rules may be required to deal with debit and credit balances in the tax credit account. Definition of “Māori” 5.10 The focus of the Māori authority rules is on an appropriate tax treatment for organisations that administer Māori land and other assets held in common ownership for Māori. The Government considers that the members of these organisations should be: • individual Māori; • entities (such as other Māori authorities) that have Māori members as their ultimate beneficiaries or shareholders; or • both. 5.11 The definition of “Māori” as it relates to the definition of “Māori authority” would be clarified, to include individuals and other authorities. This change would make it clear that a Māori authority can be established for the benefit of individuals of Māori ancestry, other Māori authorities, or both. 5.12 This change would only be required if the current broad definition of “Māori authority” is retained. It would not be required if the proposed new definition of “Māori authority” is adopted, because the new definition of “Māori authority” is independent of the definition of “Māori”. 5.13 The proposed change to the definition of “Māori” would have implications for the deductibility of distributions under option one. That is, it would allow deductions to a Māori authority for distributions made to individuals and to other Māori authorities. Application of the discretionary powers of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue 5.14 The Commissioner’s discretionary powers under Māori authority tax rules would be removed. These powers relate to: • determinations on whether a distribution is of a capital nature; 56 • adjustments to the income tax liability of a “small” authority when it becomes a “large” authority; and • determinations on whether a distribution is a bona fide investment or a distribution of income. 5.15 As discussed in chapter 3, these powers are no longer necessary. Furthermore, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue does not have the same discretionary powers in relation to other taxpayers – and to continue them would be inconsistent. Specific issues for consultation (chapter 5) What difficulties are likely to arise from the proposed remedial changes, and how could these difficulties be addressed? 57 Chapter 6 EXTENDING THE SCOPE OF THE TAX DEDUCTION FOR DONATIONS TO MĀORI ASSOCIATIONS Proposed policy The deduction available to Māori authorities for donations to Māori associations would be extended to include donations to organisations with “approved donee status”. This deduction would be the same as the deduction that is proposed for companies in the Tax and charities discussion document. Section DI 2 deduction provision 6.1 Under section DI 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994, Māori authorities may claim a deduction for donations that they give to Māori associations. The extent of the deduction is limited – up to 5 percent of the authority’s net income (calculated before taking into account the donation). 6.2 A “Māori association” is defined in the Māori Community Development Act 1962. It means a Māori Committee, a Māori Executive Committee, and a District Māori Council. All of these bodies are committees of the New Zealand Māori Council. 6.3 This deduction was introduced as part of the 1952 rules. In recommending it, the 1952 Commission of Inquiry commented that such a deduction recognised the social and community service provided by Māori associations and that Māori authorities should be encouraged to make donations to them. The Commission also commented that the deduction was consistent with the principle “that to the extent that the income of an authority is applied for this purpose it may be considered to have been derived for charitable purposes”. Problems with section DI 2 6.4 Those consulted were of the view that this deduction no longer reflects current practice. There are other entities aside from Māori associations that provide community benefits and that are supported by Māori authorities – for example, affiliated marae, kōhanga reo, kura kaupapa, and local charities. The general view was that the deduction provision should be updated to reflect the greater range of community benefits that are assisted by Māori authority funding. 58 6.5 The Government considers there is merit in changing the deduction so that it applies to a wider range of donations that Māori authorities currently make. Proposed change 6.6 The current deduction would be extended to apply to donations of money to all organisations with approved donee status (including Māori associations). The maximum level of deduction would remain at 5 percent of the authority’s net income (calculated before taking into account the deduction). 6.7 To qualify for approved donee status, an organisation must be established for charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand or must be specifically listed in section KC 5 of the Income Tax Act 1994. As only organisations can qualify for donee status, Māori authorities would not be able to claim this deduction for distributions to individuals. 6.8 This proposal is the same as the deduction that is proposed for companies in the Tax and charities discussion document. Advantages and disadvantages 6.9 This proposal recognises a greater range of community benefits that are assisted by Māori authority funding. Many Māori groups could be eligible for donee status, as the criteria for donee status are very broad. Māori entities that currently possess approved donee status include the Māori Women’s Welfare League, the New Zealand Māori Council, the Waitangi National Trust, and many kōhanga reo. Most entities that have a “charitable” tax exemption will also have donee status. 6.10 Those organisations that currently do not have approved donee status would incur a small initial cost in determining whether they satisfy the criteria. 6.11 There could be a disadvantage in this proposal for Māori groups that do not have constituting documents (such as constitutions, trust deeds, or written governing rules). Inland Revenue’s administrative practice is to review an entity’s constituting documents to determine if donee status should be granted. This might be a problem for unincorporated groups since they generally do not have such documents. Specific issues for consultation (chapter 6) Should the current deduction for donations to Māori associations be extended so that it includes donations to organisations with approved donee status? 59 Chapter 7 TAXATION OF THE MĀORI TRUSTEE Proposed policy • The “agent” tax rules applying to the Māori Trustee would be removed. • The proposed Māori authority rules would apply to the taxation of income from all properties administered by the Māori Trustee. The tax rules applying to the Māori Trustee 7.1 The Māori Trustee is an independent “corporation sole” created by the Māori Trustee Act 1953 to act for Māori as trustee or agent in the administration of their properties. The Māori Trustee is in a unique position because the properties he manages may fall within three very different sets of tax rules. 7.2 The income of the properties administered by the Māori Trustee is taxed in one of three ways: • When the Māori Trustee acts as a trustee for properties with 20 or fewer members, the tax treatment for “small” Māori authorities applies. • When the Māori Trustee acts as a trustee for properties with more than 20 members, the tax treatment for “large” Māori authorities applies. • When the Māori Trustee acts as an agent for the collection and distribution of rents, royalties and interest, the Māori Trustee is specifically excluded from the definition of a Māori authority. Income dealt with in this role is taxed under section HK 14 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Section HK 14 7.3 Under section HK 14, the income derived from properties administered by the Māori Trustee is subject to tax at the rate of 25 percent unless it constitutes beneficiary income. If the income constitutes beneficiary income, then it will be taxed in the hands of the individual owners (on whose behalf that income was collected) and at their marginal tax rates. 7.4 The beneficiary-income rule applies when the Māori Trustee acts as agent for another trust (for example, when an interest in the land is held by the executors of a deceased estate) and the other trust’s arrangements for vesting or distributing income means that the income is deemed to be beneficiary income. 60 Policy intention under section HK 14 7.5 Before 1974, the income derived from properties administered by the Māori Trustee was taxed under the Māori authority rules. So it was taxed at a flat rate of 7.5 percent before it was distributed to the owners of the properties. 7.6 This treatment gave rise to inequitable outcomes, because some of the property owners were superannuitants on low incomes who were not in fact required to pay tax on that income (and so were over-taxed). 7.7 Furthermore, other agents were not required to deduct tax before passing on payment to their principals. This inconsistency was made worse by the fact that many of the property owners did not have a choice about whether the Māori Trustee administered their lands or not. 7.8 The Ministry of Māori and Island Affairs, the Māori Trustee, the New Zealand Māori Council, and some tax practitioners dealing with Māori land viewed this inequity as a form of discrimination. They sought to have the Māori Trustee excluded from the definition of Māori authority when he acted as agent in the collection and distribution of rents, royalties and interest. This was put into effect in the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1974. 7.9 The legislation was later amended so that the Māori Trustee could account for retained rent, royalty or interest income at a flat rate; and so that subsequent distributions could be treated as capital distributions (which were tax-exempt) in the hands of the owners. Practical difficulties with section HK 14 7.10 Compliance costs are now the main problem for the Māori Trustee. Unlike other Māori authorities, which are affected by only one set of Māori authority rules, the Māori Trustee is confronted with both sets of rules for Māori authorities as well as the rules applying in his capacity as an agent. So when properties move between all these sets of rules, a number of practical difficulties (and compliance costs) arise. 7.11 Owners who receive distributions from the Māori Trustee under section HK 14, receive these with tax of 25 percent already deducted unless the distribution is regarded as beneficiary income. Owners do not have to include this income as part of their taxable income; it is tax-exempt for individual taxpayers. However, if the owner’s marginal tax rate is lower than 25 percent, these distributions are over-taxed. Conversely, if their marginal tax rate is over 25 percent, they are under-taxed. This is a problem because the owners cannot correct this over-taxation and under-taxation. 7.12 The Government considers that the “agent” tax rules for the Māori Trustee are no longer necessary and should be removed. 61 Proposed reform 7.13 The Government proposes to remove the “agent” tax rules applying to the Māori Trustee in his role as collector of rents, royalties and interest. The new Māori authority rules would apply to the Māori Trustee in every instance. 7.14 The taxation of income from properties administered by the Māori Trustee would depend on which Māori authority rules and remedial changes are put into effect. Since Māori authorities would be able to elect out of the Māori authority rules under these proposals, the Māori Trustee could also choose to administer his properties under the general tax rules (provided he meets the criteria for those general rules). Advantages and disadvantages 7.15 The main advantage from the removal of the “agent” tax rules is the compliance cost savings. The Māori Trustee will no longer have to determine what tax treatment applies to the different types of properties he administers. 7.16 Any other advantages and disadvantages for the Māori Trustee and the owners he represents would depend on which option for Māori authority tax rules is adopted. Consultation with the Māori Trustee 7.17 Initial discussions with the Māori Trustee on this issue have already taken place. The Māori Trustee agrees with the proposed reform in principle, subject always to the new Māori authority tax rules being both administratively manageable and equitable. Specific issues for consultation (chapter 7) What are your views on removing the Māori Trustee “agent” tax rules? Part III Taxation of Māori organisations seeking “charitable” tax exemption This part of the discussion document discusses the policy proposals for clarifying how aspects of the law of charities apply to Māori organisations (including marae) that seek a “charitable” tax exemption. 65 Chapter 8 THE “CHARITABLE” TAX EXEMPTION Proposed policy Changing the “public benefit” test An entity would not cease to be eligible for charitable status simply because its purpose is to benefit a group of people connected by blood ties. Charitable status for marae Marae would be eligible for a “charitable” tax exemption, provided that: • They apply their funds to specific purposes. (These purposes would include maintaining the physical structures of the marae and supporting activities traditionally carried out on the marae.) • Their activities are not carried on for the private financial gain of any person. Māori organisations seeking a “charitable” tax exemption 8.1 The Government recognises a need to clarify the “public benefit” test for charitable status, and to develop options for amending that test to give greater certainty to iwi-based or hapū-based structures and other entities seeking a “charitable” exemption for tax purposes. In particular, the tax status of marae needs to be made clearer. Although it was not specifically mentioned in the review’s terms of reference, the status of marae was one of the issues raised most consistently during the various consultation hui. Those consulted strongly believed that the tax status of marae should be considered as part of this review. The wider review of charities 8.2 The proposals contained in the discussion document Tax and charities are also relevant to Māori organisations that currently have or are seeking a “charitable” tax exemption. The core proposals relate to redefining what constitutes a “charity” for tax purposes and what reporting requirements there should be for entities with a “charitable” tax exemption. 66 Acquiring a “charitable” tax exemption 8.3 An entity wishing to take advantage of the “charitable” tax exemption in the Income Tax Act 1994 must first satisfy the common law meaning of a charity. The common law meaning of charity imposes a two-step test on most entities. Firstly, the entity must be established for a charitable purpose. Secondly, it must exist for the benefit of the public or an appreciably significant section of the public. This second step is known as the “public benefit” test. First step: charitable purpose 8.4 A charitable purpose is a purpose for: • the relief of poverty; • the advancement of education; • the advancement of religion; or • any other purpose that is beneficial to the community. These categories of charitable purpose are prescribed by case law and may appear to be quite wide. However, “any other purpose that is beneficial to the community” is restricted to purposes similar to those listed in the preamble to the United Kingdom’s Charitable Uses Act 1601. Second step: public benefit 8.5 All entities other than those established for the relief of poverty must meet the “public benefit” test. Although the question of whether an entity meets this test is considered on the facts of each case, the courts have developed a number of general tests for determining whether the benefiting group is the public – or at least an “appreciably significant section” of the public. 8.6 Through cases such as Re Compton 3 and Oppenheim v Tobacco Securities 4 , it has been established that the number of beneficiaries must not be negligible. In addition (and even if the number of beneficiaries is large), those beneficiaries must not be determined on the basis of a personal relationship such as blood or contractual ties. If they are, the entity will not be for the public benefit. Instead, it will be for the benefit of private individuals and therefore not “charitable”. 5 3 \[1945\] 1 All ER 198 4 \[1951\] 1 All ER 31 5 In Oppenheim’s case a gift for the education of the children of the employees and former employees of the company and its subsidiaries failed to qualify as a charity because the employees of a firm were not a public class. This was in spite of the fact that at the testator’s death the number of employees exceeded 110,000. 67 8.7 The House of Lords (Lord Cross) in Dingle v Turner 6 has questioned the Re Compton and Oppenheim tests, suggesting that the existence of a personal connection such as blood ties or contract should not be determinative of whether an entity provides a public rather than a private benefit. Rather, consideration should also be given to the nature of the entity and the charitable purpose for which it was established, the number of beneficiaries, and the degree of connection between the beneficiaries. 8.8 Although the Re Compton and Oppenheim tests have continued to be applied in the English courts, Lord Cross’s comments have been noted with approval in two recent New Zealand cases. 7 Consequently, there is now a degree of uncertainty in New Zealand about whether trusts whose beneficiaries are determined by a blood or a contractual relationship will satisfy the “public benefit” test. Problems with the “public benefit” test 8.9 The inability of an entity to qualify for charitable status when its beneficiaries are determined on the basis of bloodlines has been raised by the Māori community as a major concern, although it is by no means an issue limited to Māori. Although Māori authorities often provide benefits of a charitable nature to iwi and hapū, they might not qualify for an exemption because their benefit extends to a specified group of people connected by blood ties. 8.10 Those consulted considered that the general view of the “public benefit” requirement is inappropriate to New Zealand society because it fails to recognise New Zealand’s unique cultural groupings. 8.11 The issue of members connected by contract has been referred to the wider review of charities as it was considered to be an issue of more widespread interest, whereas the blood-ties issue is likely to be of most relevance to Māori organisations. Changing the “public benefit” test Proposal 8.12 The Government considers that if an entity provides charitable benefits, then it should not automatically be excluded from the “charitable” tax exemption simply because it fails to meet the “public benefit” requirement. 6 \[1972\] AC 601 7 New Zealand Society of Accountants v CIR \[1986\] 1 NZLR 147; Educational Fees Protection Society Incorporated v CIR (1991) 12 NZTC 8,203. 68 8.13 This review was intended to consider whether entities could be “charitable” if they benefited persons connected by a personal relationship, such as blood ties or contract. Initial consultation with Māori groups, however, focused solely on the issue of blood ties; and so the review has limited its consideration of this issue to blood ties only. 8.14 The Government therefore proposes changing the requirement for charitable status so that an entity will not cease to be eligible for this simply because its purpose is to benefit a group of people connected by blood ties. How this proposal will work 8.15 This proposal will apply to both Māori and non-Māori entities, and it is especially relevant to iwi-based and hapū-based entities. However, it should be noted that to obtain charitable status an entity must still meet the other requirements of a charity – that is, it must have a “charitable purpose” and it must be for the benefit of the public or an appreciably significant section of the public. 8.16 In determining whether an entity benefits an appreciably significant section of the public, it will be necessary to consider other factors such as the nature of the entity, the number of potential beneficiaries, and the degree of relationship between beneficiaries. 8.17 For example, whānau trusts may qualify for a “charitable” tax exemption if their pool of beneficiaries is large enough and inclusive enough to constitute an appreciably significant section of the public, or if the purposes for which they are established confer a wide public benefit. However, if the entity benefits a few family members only (so that it is actually a private family trust), it will not be regarded as benefiting an appreciably significant section of the public. 8.18 In practice, the application of this proposal will require some guidance so that an entity can determine whether it benefits an appreciably significant section of the public. We seek your views on what guidance should be provided and in what form such guidance should take. Advantages and disadvantages 8.19 The main benefit of this proposal is that it will remove the barrier that some Māori entities have come up against when applying for a “charitable” tax exemption. The proposal will also recognise that when an iwi-based or hapū- based organisation is established for charitable purposes and confers a public benefit, that entity should be able to satisfy the “public benefit” requirement. 8.20 One potential disadvantage with this proposal is that any land or income included in a charitable entity must always be retained for charitable purposes. If the entity is wound up or dissolved, the land and any remaining assets must be applied to further charitable purposes. This creates potential for the alienation of any assets associated with the “charity”. 69 Key question What factors should be taken into account in determining whether an entity has sufficient “public benefit”? Charitable status for marae 8.21 As mentioned earlier, marae will generally fail to meet the “public benefit” test for a charity and therefore will not be able to access a “charitable” tax exemption. This is because marae are usually established for the benefit of hapū or iwi affiliated to the marae. A further complicating factor is that it is not clear if the purposes for which marae are established meet the common law meaning of “charitable purpose”. 8.22 Those initially consulted favoured giving marae a “charitable” tax exemption. They considered that an exemption would recognise that marae are institutions serving the cultural needs of the Māori community and have similar functions to churches and public halls (both of which are likely to qualify for a “charitable” tax exemption). 8.23 This issue has become a matter of priority for marae that wish to access funding from other charitable entities such as community trusts. Charitable entities can only apply their income to charitable purposes – if they fail to do so, they risk losing their tax exemption. Therefore charitable entities will often only fund other entities that have a “charitable” tax exemption. If marae do not have this exemption, they generally cannot access this funding. Proposal 8.24 The Government considers that marae should be recognised as “charitable” for tax purposes, provided that certain requirements are met. This recognition acknowledges the important role marae play in supporting a way of life for New Zealanders within a structure of Māori culture and values. It also acknowledges that marae have a function similar to that of churches and public halls. How the proposal would work 8.25 It is proposed that marae be given a “charitable” tax exemption if they meet certain requirements. These requirements are: • Marae must apply their funds to specific purposes. These purposes will include maintaining the physical structures of the marae and supporting activities traditionally carried out on the marae. • Marae activities must not be carried on for the private financial gain of any person. 70 8.26 If a commercial business is carried out on the marae and the income for that business is applied towards the maintenance and upkeep of the marae premises and no individual member associated with that marae or any other person is able to derive a private financial benefit, then that marae will be regarded as “charitable” for tax purposes. If a member receives some private financial benefit from the marae such as a dividend payment, share of profits, or other payment and that member has not provided any services in return, the marae’s charitable tax exemption would cease to apply. Marae would need to ensure that payments to members for services rendered are reasonable and do not exceed what would normally be paid for those services. In practice, the marae would determine whether it meets these requirements by applying them to its particular facts. Key question What “specific purposes” should be included in the requirements that marae must meet to get a “charitable” tax exemption? Advantages and disadvantages 8.27 Most marae should be able to gain a “charitable” tax exemption, provided they meet the new requirements. However, as noted earlier, one disadvantage of charitable status is the potential for alienation of property. When property is vested in a charity, that property must be applied to another charitable purpose when the original charity is dissolved or wound up. The property cannot be returned to its original members. Treatment under the proposed Māori authority rules 8.28 If marae meet the requirements for a “charitable” tax exemption, they would not be treated as a Māori authority. 8.29 Marae that do not meet the requirements for a “charitable” tax exemption will be treated as a Māori authority – but they could elect to be treated as a non-profit body if they meet the requirements for “non-profit”. Non-profit bodies can claim a tax deduction each income year of an amount equal to the lesser of its net income or $1,000. As non-profit bodies tend to derive little (if any) income, most of them do not pay tax. Proposed registration proposal 8.30 One of the proposals that could emerge from the wider review of charities is a requirement for entities to register their charitable status with the Inland Revenue Department. This requirement would also apply to marae that meet the requirements for a “charitable” tax exemption. Appendix 73 HISTORY OF THE MĀORI AUTHORITY TAX RULES A survey of the history of the Māori authority tax rules is useful for an appreciation of how Māori authorities are taxed today. The first specific set of rules applying to Māori authorities appeared in 1939 and formed part of the Land and Income Tax Act 1923. The 1939 rules were subsequently replaced in 1952, as a result of the recommendations made by a Commission of Inquiry. The Commission was established mainly in response to assertions that some Māori authorities were not complying with the prevailing tax law. The original scheme of the 1952 rules has remained largely unchanged, with only minor changes such as increases in the Māori authority tax rate. Pre-1939 tax rules Before 1939, two separate taxes were levied on income: income tax and a social security charge. The social security charge (including the national security tax from 1940 until 1947) was payable at a flat rate, while the income tax was payable at graduated rates. Māori had always been subject to these taxes in the same way as any New Zealand resident taxpayer. However, section 550 of the Māori Land Act 1931 contained restrictive provisions that effectively prevented trust monies from being used for paying tax on the income derived by some Māori authorities on behalf of their members. Because there were considerable numbers of reserves, funds and lands administered by Māori land boards and the Māori Trustee, this presented a problem for Māori in satisfying their income tax obligations. This problem persisted from 1929 (when farming profits became subject to income tax for the first time) until the 1939 rules were introduced. The 1939 tax rules The 1939 rules came into force on 7 October 1939 (section 29 of the Land and Income Tax Act Amendment Act 1939). These rules were aimed at defining tax obligations for Māori authorities and facilitating the collection of tax by charging it at source. The authority was responsible for paying income tax on behalf of individual members; and the tax was based on their respective shares of the net income earned by the authority, regardless of whether that income was distributed as a dividend or not. The authority was also responsible for the collection and payment of the social security charge for its members. 74 In effect the authority was assessed as agent on behalf of its members. This placed the authority in the same situation as an ordinary trustee. Key features of the 1939 rules The 1939 rules applied to the various working entities that administered blocks of farmland owned in common – that is, they were not within the ownership and responsibility of any individual or their immediate family. These entities included the Board of Māori Affairs, the Māori Trustee, the Māori land boards, special statutory trusts (such as the East Coast Commissioner), and land trusts established under the Māori Land Act. These entities were specifically included in the definition of “Māori authority”. The definition of “Māori authority” also included any other body, authority, or person administering or controlling property in trust for the benefit of Māori. The restrictions in section 550 of the Māori Land Act 1931 were overridden so that any income tax liability could be met from income earned by the authority. The income was treated as being earned by the authority as “agent” for individual members. In effect, the members were regarded as “partners” in the authority and the authority was responsible for calculating and paying income tax (on behalf of members) on each member’s respective share of the whole of the income earned by the authority. There was a clear intention on the part of the original policy makers to avoid assessing Māori authorities as trusts or companies as this would have meant higher-than- expected taxation. These rules were largely concerned with, but not limited to, revenue from Māori land. Non-compliance with those rules Most Māori authorities experienced practical difficulties in calculating their income tax liabilities in accordance with the new rules. Some authorities ignored the new requirements altogether. The East Coast Commissioner and various corporate bodies assumed that their obligation was limited to paying only the social security charge and the national security tax – and to doing this only on the amounts actually paid to members. The Māori Affairs Department also had difficulties in complying with section 29. The rules could be applied relatively easily to properties that had a small number of members. But, as the number of members grew, satisfying the requirements of the rules became more of a burden. The department considered that because there was little income tax payable on the income from Māori land, the work that was required to calculate and pay tax on behalf of each member was not justified. 75 Initially there was little loss of revenue to the Government. Māori authorities were earning moderate sums of income and, owing to the large number of members in many authorities, little (if any) income tax was payable on an individual’s share of the authority’s income. By 1950, however, the development of land began to be reflected in increased levels of income, at which point the Commissioner of Taxes made a determined effort to enforce the Māori authority tax rules. This action was resisted by Māori authorities and led directly to the establishment of the Commission of Inquiry. The 1952 tax rules The Luxford Commission of Inquiry was set up to investigate the situation that had resulted from certain Māori farming concerns not complying with their tax obligations. In its report The Working of the Law relating to the Taxation of Māori Authorities , published in 1952, the Luxford Commission made a number of recommendations to reform the 1939 rules. The Commission found that while the purpose of the 1939 rules was to treat members as partners in relation to their property and so minimise their tax burden, the rules were unworkable and ineffective so far as income tax was concerned. The main reasons for this finding were: • Most properties that came under the control and management of Māori authorities involved a large number of members. • The move from leasing land to being owner-farmers meant that Māori authorities accumulated wealth; but this was only possible by retaining (that is, not distributing) a considerable proportion of the authority’s income. Key features of the 1952 rules From 1952, Māori authorities that derived income from properties for 20 or fewer members were treated as “agents”. The authority was responsible for the collection and payment of tax for each member according to their share of the authority’s income. This continued the 1939 tax treatment. The number “20” was chosen because a small group was analogous to a partnership, and at that time the legal maximum number of people in a partnership was 20. Although the Commission realised a flat rate of tax could impose an undue burden on members whose landholdings were small, it considered that any disadvantage to them would be outweighed by the benefits that would accrue by working the land as part of a larger unit. 76 Māori authorities that derived income from properties with more than 20 members were treated as separate tax-paying entities and were assessed for income tax on “undistributed income” at a flat rate. A flat rate equivalent to the existing social security charge of 7.5 percent was applied to the net income of the authority. The rate of tax on “undistributed income” was set at the minimum rate then in force (12.5 percent), making total tax on undistributed income 20 percent. These rates in effect represented a “composite” low rate of income tax that recognised the low-income levels of Māori-land owners. Owners were required to include their share of the “distributed income” from the authority in their personal returns and pay any tax liability on that income themselves. Reasons underlying the Commission’s recommendations The tenor of the Luxford Commission’s report was one of practicality. The Commission accepted the fundamental premise that Māori ownership of land had a particular character that required a special system of taxation. So its recommendations were aimed at achieving simplicity of administration within the framework of the existing taxation system. The Commission considered that, although it might appear that the treatment proposed for Māori authorities was more favourable than that for companies or trustees, there were good reasons for such a “concessionary” treatment. Having regard to all the circumstances, the Commission believed that the proposed system of levying income tax at minimum rates on income retained by a Māori authority was fair and reasonable. Glossary 79 Allowable deductions Business expenses and costs. Further defined in section BD 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Approved donee status To qualify for donee status an entity must meet the requirements in section KC 5(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994, which includes entities established for charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand or that are specifically listed in this section. Entities interested in obtaining donee status must apply to the Inland Revenue Department. Beneficial owners The owner of a beneficial interest in land. If the land is vested in trustees, those trustees own the land as legal owners on behalf of the beneficiaries who hold their individual shares in the land. Beneficiary income For tax purposes, beneficiary income means income derived by a trustee in a given income year which: • vests in the beneficiaries in terms of the trust deed during that year; or • is paid to (or applied for the benefit of) the beneficiary during that year or within six months after the end of that year. Charitable purpose A charitable purpose is a purpose for: • the relief of poverty; • the advancement of education; • the advancement of religion; or • any other purpose that is beneficial to the community. These categories of charitable purpose are prescribed by common law and may appear to be quite wide. However, the courts in determining whether the purpose of an entity is for “any other purpose that is beneficial to the community” have restricted the purposes similar to those listed in the preamble to the United Kingdom’s Charitable Uses Act 1601. 80 Modern examples of type of activities that come within this purpose are: • providing public halls, public recreational facilities, botanical gardens, parks, libraries and museums; • social rehabilitation – integrating people back into the community; • providing an ambulance service, district fire brigade or life saving service; • repairing highways and bridges, providing a water supply, paving and lighting a town; and • the afforestation or making of public domains or national parks. Charitable status An entity has charitable status when it meets the legal requirements for a “charity”. Charities are exempt from income tax. Company The definition of a “company” for tax purposes is broad. It includes any body corporate or other entity that has a legal personality or existence distinct from those of its members, whether that body corporate or other entity is incorporated or created in New Zealand or elsewhere. Certain entities such as unit trusts are deemed to be companies for tax purposes, whereas Māori authorities are specifically excluded from that definition. Company tax rules Key features of company tax rules in the Income Tax Act 1994 are: • Companies are subject to a flat tax at a rate of 33 percent. • Companies are separate legal entities, and the members have an “interest” in the company, usually defined by shareholding. • The benefit of tax paid by a company can be passed on to shareholders as imputation tax credits attached to dividends. Gross dividends are included as gross income of the shareholder, but individual tax liabilities are satisfied in part by the amount of any tax credits that have been allocated to the dividend. • If a taxpayer receives a dividend that has more imputation credits attached than the level of tax payable on that dividend, and the taxpayer has other income, the excess tax credit can be used to satisfy this tax liability. 81 • Tax losses can be carried forward to be offset against the future income of the company, subject to maintaining certain membership requirements from the beginning of the year of loss to the end of the year of carry forward. • Charitable gifts may be deductible if they are provided to organisations with approved donee status. (This concession is not available to closely held companies.) The deduction is subject to certain limits. • Capital gains are taxable when distributed to shareholders but not when distributed in the course of liquidation. • Available subscribed capital for initial investment in a company is defined as capital, and is non-taxable when distributed. Compliance costs Compliance costs are the other costs that people and businesses incur when they pay their tax, over and above the actual amount of tax they pay. These other costs can have a money value, in that they may involve time, fees paid to tax advisers, and other costs. They can also be “psychological” costs, such as the stress that comes from not being certain that you have met all the rules correctly, or even what those rules are. Court order A document prepared by and signed under the seal of a court to give effect to a decision of a judge of the court. Distribution(s) The term “distribution” includes any amount that is paid, credited or advanced by a Māori authority for the individual personal benefit of a Māori. The definition also includes any property that is transferred or otherwise disposed of by a Māori authority to a Māori. Hapū Subtribe or kin group linked by a common ancestor. Hui Meeting or conference. 82 Imputation tax credits Imputation tax credits reflect the tax paid by a company. When companies pay dividends to their shareholders they can attach imputation tax credits to the dividends. The dividends are taxed in the hands of the shareholders, who can use those credits to offset their personal tax liability. If the credits cannot be used, they can be converted into a tax loss by shareholders and used in the next income year. Income statement Most individuals who receive salary, wages, interest, or dividends will have their final income tax liability determined by means of an income statement instead of being required to file an annual tax return. These statements are commonly referred to as “personal tax summaries”. The personal tax summary is a summary of a taxpayer’s income and tax information. It tells you whether you will need to pay tax or if you are due a refund. Individuals Natural persons. Iwi Traditional Māori tribal hierarchy and social order made up of hapū (kin groups) and whānau (family groups) having a founding ancestor and territorial (tribal) boundaries. Kaitiaki trust See Māori land trusts. Kōhanga reo Māori language nests or pre-schools. Kura kaupapa Māori educational institutions, usually primary and secondary schools. 83 Māori The term “Māori” is defined in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 to mean a person belonging to the aboriginal race of New Zealand and a person descended from a Māori. 8 The definition also includes (except for the purposes of the definition of “Māori authority”) any person legally or beneficially entitled to any gross income of a Māori authority. “Large” authorities Māori authorities with more than 20 members. Māori associations A “Māori association” is defined in the Māori Community Development Act 1962 and means a Māori Committee, a Māori Executive Committee or a District Māori Council. All of these bodies are committees of the New Zealand Māori Council. Māori freehold land This is land whose beneficial ownership has been determined by the Māori Land Court (that is, the Māori Land Court has created a title for the land and has determined the beneficial owners of that land). Under current law, the status of the land will continue to be Māori land unless the Māori Land Court makes an order changing the status of the land. Māori incorporations A Māori incorporation is a structure similar to a company established to facilitate and promote the use and administration of Māori freehold land on behalf of the owners. Māori incorporations were designed to manage whole blocks of land and are some of the most commercial types of Māori-land management structures. Māori incorporations are established under Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 (also known as the Māori Land Act 1993). 8 There is a section reference error in the definition of “Maori” in the Income Tax Act 1994. The reference to sections HH 1 to HH 5 should be a reference to sections HI 1 to HI 5. 84 Māori land trusts Māori land trusts referred to in this discussion document are those trusts established under Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993. The purpose of these trusts is to reduce the high transaction costs of managing fragmented lands with numerous owners, by amalgamating the land titles under a single entity and by delegating the management of the entity to a committee of owner representatives. The different types of Māori land trusts established under the Act are: • Ahu whenua trust – the most common Māori land trust. It is designed to promote the use and administration of land in the interest of its owners. These trusts are often used for commercial purposes. • Whenua tōpū trust – an iwi-based or hapū-based trust designed to facilitate the use and administration of the land in the interest of the iwi and hapū. This type of trust is used for receiving Crown land as part of any settlement. • Kaitiaki trust – established solely for individuals who are minors or have a disability, and who are unable to manage their own affairs. • Whānau trust – a whānau-oriented trust. It allows the whānau to bring together their Māori land interests for the benefit of the whānau and their descendants. • Pūtea trust – allows owners of small and uneconomical interests to pool their interests together. Ahu whenua and whenua tōpū trusts are land-management trusts and involve whole land blocks. Whānau and pūtea trusts are share-management trusts and relate primarily to specified shares in land. Kaitiaki trusts are for minors or persons with a disability, and can include all their assets. Whenua tōpū and pūtea trusts allow spending for “Māori community purposes”. Māori community purposes are defined in Te Ture Whenua Māori Act as purposes that are for the promotion of education and vocational training, health, and social, cultural and economic welfare. Whānau and ahu whenua trusts may also use funds for Māori community purposes, if their trust orders allow and if the owners agree. The trust order will define who will benefit from Māori community-purpose funds. 85 Māori trust boards Māori trust boards are established under the Māori Trust Boards Act 1955 to manage tribal assets for the general benefit of their members. The boards are able to provide money for the benefit or advancement of their members and to apply their funds towards the promotion of health, social and economic welfare, and education and vocational training. Some boards were set up to administer compensation received as settlement of grievances by Māori against the Crown, while other boards were established to secure Government recognition (in order to take up service contracts), or to secure a mandate in order to pursue Treaty of Waitangi claims. Treaty settlements have led to significant increases in the level of assets held by these entities. Marae Meeting place for the Māori community. Often an area of land set aside for the use of hapū or iwi, with buildings on it, such as a meeting house and dining hall. Marginal tax rates applying to individuals “Marginal” tax rates are the rates that apply to the last dollar earned by a taxpayer. These rates take into account the low-income rebate. This means that a taxpayer has an “effective” tax rate of 15% when his or her gross income is less than or equal to $9,500. The low-income rebate abates progressively until the taxpayer earns $38,000. The marginal tax rates for individuals are: 0 – 9,50015% 9,501 – 38,00021% 38,001 – 60,00033% 60,001 and over39% Member In relation to Māori authorities, the terms “beneficial owner”, “owner” or “beneficiary” are commonly used in place of the term “Māori”. In this discussion document, however, the term “member” is used because of its inclusiveness and the express reference in the Tax Act to a Māori including “a person legally or beneficially entitled to any gross income of a Māori authority”. 86 Out of income This expression is only used in the Māori authority rules and describes an amount that is revenue in nature (and therefore subject to tax). Partnership There is no definition of “partnership” in the income tax legislation. The Partnership Act 1908 defines a “partnership” as the relationship between persons carrying on a business in common with a view to a profit. “Public benefit” All entities other than those established for the relief of poverty must satisfy the “public benefit” test. This means they must be established for the benefit of the public or at least an “appreciably significant section” of the public. In determining whether an entity benefits “an appreciably significant section of the public”, it will be necessary to consider factors such as the nature of the entity, the number of potential beneficiaries, and the degree of the relationship between beneficiaries. Resident withholding tax (RWT) Resident withholding tax is the tax that is withheld by a Māori authority from distributions it makes to its members – it is not a final tax. If the tax withheld is higher than a taxpayer’s marginal tax rate the difference in tax withheld is refunded. Similarly, if resident withholding tax is lower than a taxpayer’s marginal tax rate that taxpayer will have additional tax to pay. Rūnanga A board, assembly, caucus or council. Shareholder continuity rules Rules in the Income Tax Act 1994 that involve measuring a shareholder’s economic interest in a company by reference to his or her voting rights, or market value interests. “Small” authorities Māori authorities with 20 or fewer members. 87 Tax return A form that is completed by a taxpayer that shows his or her income and other tax information. Termination Winding up a business. Liquidation. Ceasing to operate as a business. Trust A trust is an equitable obligation under which a person (the trustee) who has control of a property is bound to deal with that property either: • for the benefit of identifiable persons (referred to as “beneficiaries”) and any other person who may enforce the obligation; or • for some object or purpose permitted by law. The property concerned is referred to as “trust property”. The person who created this trust relationship is referred to as the “settlor” and is the source of the trust property. The trustee has legal ownership of the trust property while the beneficiaries have a beneficial entitlement to that property. The trustee may also be one of the beneficiaries in a trust. Trust tax rules There are three types of trusts for tax purposes: qualifying, foreign and non- qualifying. The most common trust is a qualifying trust, which is defined for tax purposes as a trust that has been continuously liable for tax in New Zealand since being settled and which has met all of its tax liabilities. Trusts can also be “discretionary” or “non-discretionary”. Under a discretionary trust, a trustee has the power to determine who the beneficiaries are and the amounts distributed to them. The key features of the trust tax rules are: • A trust’s annual income is separated into two classes: “beneficiary income” and “trustee income”. “Beneficiary income” is the annual income earned by the trustee that is paid or applied to the beneficiary in that year or six months after, or that vests in the beneficiaries in terms of the trust deed. “Trustee income” is annual income earned by the trustee that is not beneficiary income – that is, income earned by the trust that has not been distributed within that timeframe or has not been vested in the beneficiaries. 88 • Trustee income is taxed at 33 percent, while beneficiary income is taxed at the beneficiary’s marginal tax rate (unless it is beneficiary income of a minor, in which case it is taxed in some circumstances at the trustee rate of 33 percent). • Losses cannot be passed on to beneficiaries. • Income retains its nature when it is distributed. Capital gains are distributed tax-free, and dividends with imputation credits attached may be distributed to beneficiaries. • Any income that is taxed as trustee income or that is added to the trust’s “corpus” can be subsequently distributed to beneficiaries tax-free. • Trustees are obliged to deduct tax from beneficiary income at an appropriate rate as agent for the beneficiary. Waahi tapu An area (usually of land) that is sacred to Māori. Whānau Family – extends beyond the concept of immediate family (parents and siblings). “Whānau” links people of one family to a common tipuna or ancestor.
More time for business Tax simplification for small business A Government discussion document Hon Dr Michael CullenHon Paul SwainJohn Wright MP Minister of FinanceAssociate Minister of Parliamentary Under-Secretary Minister of RevenueFinance and Revenue to the Minister of Revenue First published in May 2001 by the Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department, P O Box 2198, Wellington. More time for business – tax simplification for small business; A Government discussion document. ISBN 0-478-10342-5 PREFACE This is the first in a series of Government discussion documents that put forward proposals for simplifying the tax system. More time for business looks at tax simplification from the point of view of small businesses, addressing many of their concerns about the requirements of the tax system. The Government is serious about tackling these concerns, so that small- business people will have more time for doing what they do best – running their businesses. The focus of the proposals is on reducing risk. Most small businesses attempt to meet their tax obligations, but the complexity of tax rules, however, raises the fear that they may make costly mistakes. This is a real burden on small businesses. Reducing tax risk is a difficult and complex process, one that requires continuous effort. Earlier tax simplification changes have made progress, but more needs to be done, especially for small businesses. In developing the proposals contained in this discussion document, the Government has created an opportunity for the first major reductions in the tax-related compliance burden on small business in many years. The discussion document raises a number of ideas that need to be explored. To make the most of this opportunity, we need the contributions of businesses, their tax advisers and other interested parties. We welcome your submissions.

As a consequence of that complexity, the costs of compliance and the risks associated with involuntary non- compliance have increased greatly. 1.2 The Government is aware of small businesses’ concerns about the requirements of the tax system. These concerns include difficulties matching flows of income to tax payments, difficulties communicating with and providing information to Inland Revenue, and potential exposure to penalties and use-of-money interest. 1.3 The focus of this discussion document is on reducing the stress, uncertainty and risk that these concerns place on small businesses. It is also aimed at reducing the need for all businesses, irrespective of their size, to communicate with Inland Revenue. 1.4 If a business does need to contact Inland Revenue, the use of information technology, backed up by improved Inland Revenue assistance, will play an important role in helping businesses meet their obligations. As a result, businesses will be able to free up resources which can be better directed to increasing productivity and effectiveness. 1.5 Reducing compliance costs is a complex process. It requires a focused, continuous effort and a genuine commitment to simplifying the tax system. 1.6 In presenting the measures contained in this discussion document, the Government is endeavouring to move a step closer to the elusive goal of true tax simplification. We welcome the views of taxpayers, their advisers and other interested parties on how we can best achieve this. 1.7 This document is the first of four initiatives by the Government to reduce tax compliance costs. Others to be released within the next few months include: • a discussion document on the income tax treatment of Mäori organisations and businesses; • a draft of the rewrite of Parts C, D and E of the Income Tax Act 1994; and • a discussion document outlining the results of the post-implementation review of the compliance and penalty legislation. 2 Benefits of tax simplification 1.8 The main benefits expected to arise from the measures outlined in this discussion document include better alignment of tax payments with cash- flow and reduced exposure to penalties and use-of-money interest. The need for taxpayers to contact Inland Revenue is also expected to lessen. The proposals will simplify some tax calculations, and reduce the amount of information that businesses have to provide to Inland Revenue. 1.9 Creating these benefits necessarily involves reconsidering some of the trade- offs in the tax system between administration costs, efficiency costs, compliance costs, and the cash-flow benefits businesses have from retaining tax payments. For example, to reduce the risks that taxpayers face from not making a payment on time it will be necessary for them to lose some of the benefits of retaining tax payments. 1.10 Similarly, options that give businesses more flexibility in how they calculate or pay tax necessarily reduce the simplicity of the tax system, and taxpayers will incur costs to work out which option gives them the best result. 1.11 Although focused on reducing the costs associated with provisional tax, the proposals in this discussion document cover a broad range of tax issues. SUMMARY OF PROPOSALS Simplifying provisional tax (chapter 4) A provisional tax system based on three equal payments spaced evenly throughout the year does not suit some small businesses whose income fluctuates during the year or for whom it is difficult to estimate how much income they will earn. Two proposals are aimed at helping small businesses overcome these problems by allowing them to pay tax as income is earned, thereby approximating cash-flow better than the current provisional tax rules do. They are voluntary alternatives to the current provisional tax system. Other proposals are aimed at reducing interest costs associated with the current system. Withholding tax on business income Banks would automatically deduct a proportion of all deposits into a business’s bank account and send those payments to Inland Revenue as instalments of income tax. The business would be required to deposit all its income into that account. This system is similar to the way that employers deduct PAYE from employees, except that the rate of deduction would be selected by the business to accommodate its individual circumstances. 3 Paying provisional tax with GST Small businesses that file GST on a one-monthly or two-monthly basis would pay a proportion of their GST sales and income along with their GST as instalments of income tax. It would be up to the business to decide what proportion of its sales and income it pays as income tax. It would not be necessary to send any other payments to Inland Revenue during the year under the withholding tax option or the GST option. The square-up of the year’s income tax liability would be done after the end-of-year tax return is filed. Interest would not be charged or paid on the difference between the amount paid during the year and the actual income tax liability. Businesses that did not come reasonably close to paying the right amount of tax during the year would not be able to use these options in following years. Pooling provisional tax Businesses would be allowed to pool their provisional tax with that of other businesses, and underpayments could be offset by overpayments within the pool. The arrangement would need to be made through an intermediary who would also arrange for the businesses to be charged or compensated for the offset. This option would mean that interest paid to or paid by businesses would be more favourable than the use-of-money interest rates applied by Inland Revenue. Removing interest No interest would be charged or paid to taxpayers who pay provisional tax based on last year’s tax liability plus 5% if their payments during the year meet 90% of their income tax liability for that year. Reducing PAYE obligations (chapter 5) Employers who use an intermediary such as a recognised payroll firm to calculate and pay PAYE would have their exposure to penalties and interest largely removed. There is an option under this proposal for employers who wish to delegate only the calculation functions and prefer not to use an intermediary to pay the tax. Those employers would still be responsible for making payments on time, so would still be exposed to late payment penalties and interest. Reducing end-of-year tax adjustments (chapter 6) The Government has considered whether the costs associated with end-of-year income tax calculations can be reduced. Trading stock Small businesses that can reasonably estimate that they have less than $5,000 worth of trading stock at the end of the year would not be required to value that stock nor include any change in the value of that stock in their calculation of income. 4 Depreciation Several options to reduce compliance costs associated with depreciation are put forward. They would: • provide businesses with easy to use Internet-based tools that calculate depreciation deductions accurately and with certainty; • increase the value of individual assets that can be pooled for depreciation from the current threshold of $2,000; and • reduce the restrictions on immediate deductibility for assets purchased from the same supplier at the same time. Building on the tax simplification reforms for wage and salary earners (chapter 7) The benefits of the tax reforms that removed the need for 1.2 million wage and salary earners to file tax returns would be extended to more taxpayers. Reducing filing for beneficiaries of trusts Beneficiaries of trusts are currently required to file a tax return regardless of how much tax has been paid on their behalf. The proposal is that beneficiaries of trusts would not be required to file a tax return if enough tax has been paid on their behalf. This proposal has the potential to reduce filing requirements for around 57,000 beneficiaries of trusts. Voluntary withholding on non-cash employment income Receipt of non-cash income from employment, such as share benefits, raises compliance costs associated with filing returns, and provisional tax obligations for taxpayers who are essentially wage and salary earners. It is proposed to give employers the option of withholding tax on this type of income through the PAYE system. Doing so would mean that tax would be paid as income is earned, and no residual obligations to file tax returns or pay provisional tax arise. Reducing the need to file tax returns on behalf of deceased taxpayers Income tax returns must be filed on behalf of deceased taxpayers who if alive would have met the criteria for non-filing. The proposal is to include executors and administrators acting on behalf of a deceased taxpayer’s estate amongst those not required to file a tax return. Doing so would reduce both the compliance costs associated with filing as well as stress on the families of deceased taxpayers who may otherwise have to wait unnecessarily for an estate to be wound up. 5 Minimum threshold for filing Earning any income that has not had tax withheld on it, regardless of how small it is, raises the obligation to file a tax return. It is proposed to introduce a $200 threshold for income from which tax has not been withheld, before a tax return has to be filed. Although it would reduce compliance costs for those who do file returns for small amounts of income, more importantly, it would remove exposure to penalties and interest for taxpayers who choose not to file returns because the compliance costs of filing a return are disproportionate to the income. Simplifying family assistance Family tax credits would be paid to the principal caregiver instead of both spouses. This would reduce filing requirements and the likelihood of families inadvertently getting into debt with family assistance. The calculation of family assistance would be simplified by removing most of the complex adjustments that are currently made. This would make it easier to determine entitlement, and it would also reduce the risk of debt. These changes are generally expected to increase entitlement to family assistance, although it may reduce for some families or change within a given period. Simplifying other areas of tax (chapter 8) Non-resident contractors’ withholding tax (NRCWT) The Government proposes to remove the need for contractors from countries with whom New Zealand has a double tax agreement to apply for a certificate of exemption from tax in New Zealand if they are here for less than 62 days. Although entitled to an exemption, some contractors and their employers do not apply because it is a burden to do so. Consequently, they face exposure to penalties. Although a non-resident contractor may not initially be subject to NRCWT, later events could result in a tax liability arising. The proposal is to prevent penalties from applying if employers exercise reasonable care in determining that the non-resident contractor was not initially subject to NRCWT, and it subsequently turned out that he or she was. Submissions are sought on whether NRCWT should be assessed by employers instead of Inland Revenue. Resident withholding tax (RWT) Banks, financial institutions and other payers of interest are required to give RWT information in the form of a certificate to earners of interest. It is proposed to change the legislative requirements on how the information in the certificates can be communicated, to keep up to date with technological changes in the banking industry. Changes could include putting the information on bank statements, sending it by e- mail, or making it available on bank web sites. 6 Banks do not automatically send deduction certificates to savers who earn less than $20 a year in interest. It is proposed to increase that threshold to $50. Imputation credit accounts (ICAs) Companies applying for a refund of ICA credits are sometimes required to file an interim IR4J return, despite already providing the necessary information in other returns. This requirement would be removed, thereby making the refund process faster and less costly. Role of information technology (chapter 9) Information technology provides new opportunities for tax simplification in areas such as the calculation of tax owing, filing tax returns and making payments. Initiatives are currently under way to improve taxpayer access to information, improve the way Inland Revenue uses information, increase the flexibility with which payments can be made, and increase electronic filing of returns. Inland Revenue is also developing a long-term strategy to improve taxpayer services that can be provided via the Internet. It may also be possible to use electronic technology to reduce the risks that taxpayers face. One way of doing so could be to provide taxpayers with on-line tools to calculate tax. Inland Revenue would be responsible for the calculation and taxpayers would be responsible for providing accurate source data. Another way of reducing risk for taxpayers is to automatically remind them of upcoming due dates. It may also be possible to improve communication with Inland Revenue by making both tax technical information and personal tax information easier to obtain. Improvements in information technology could also allow Inland Revenue to customise its services and the requirements it places on taxpayers. For example, in the future the information sent to businesses could be better tailored to the individual needs of the business, and returns could be made at frequencies more convenient than allowed for by the current rules. Inland Revenue’s administrative improvements (chapter 10) As part of Inland Revenue’s long-term and continuing commitment to simplifying the tax system and reducing compliance costs, it is proposed to: • extend the free small business advisory service by providing information and support to businesses that will benefit most and at a time that is most useful; • encourage more employers to use the recently enhanced electronic filing facilities; • improve the level of telephone services by making more resources available to answer phones at critical times and improve the capacity to forecast and plan for peak demand as well as to consider what the optimum design for call management should be; and • improve the layout and content of forms, statements, and brochures produced by Inland Revenue. 7 The benefits of the proposals Lower risk of penalties Rem oving or reducing use-of-money interest Lower risk of accumulating end-of-period debt Easier access to w elfare / assistance M ore equitable tax treatm ent Less uncertainty in tax treatment M ore accurate calculation of tax liabilities Fewer form s to fill in / fewer tax calculations Reduced need to com m unicate w ith IRD Easier and more flexible access to tax affairs M ore qualitative information Lower risk of avoidance Lower interm ediary costs Simplifying provisional tax Withholding tax on business income !!!!!!!

Key questions 1.13 Before making final decisions on whether to proceed with the various tax simplification measures discussed here, the Government wishes to seek the views of interested people. Key areas in which the Government seeks feedback are: • whether the tax simplification measures considered in this discussion document should be adopted; and • other compliance cost measures that should be considered. Submissions 1.14 Submissions should be addressed to: The General Manager Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 WELLINGTON Or e-mail:policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz 1.15 Submissions should be made by 15 June 2001. They should include a brief summary of their major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for officials from Inland Revenue to contact those making the submission to discuss their submission if required. 10 Chapter 2 TAX SIMPLIFICATION PAST AND FUTURE 2.1 Small businesses can face high compliance costs, especially the costs of setting up systems for ensuring that they meet their tax obligations. As well, they are less able than large businesses to employ specialist staff to handle their tax matters. As tax laws have become increasingly complex in some areas, the difficulty involved in meeting tax obligations has grown. As a result, small businesses face increasing compliance costs and an increasing risk of accidentally not complying with the law. Fact What are tax compliance costs? Tax compliance costs are the other costs that businesses incur when they pay their tax, over and above the actual amount of tax they pay. These other costs can have a money value, in that they may involve time, fees paid to tax advisers, and other costs. They can also be “psychological” costs, such as the stress that comes from not being certain that you have met all the tax rules correctly, or even what those rules are. The Government wants to reduce costs for businesses, even though it will never be possible to remove them altogether, simply because some effort on the part of taxpayers will always be necessary. 2.2 The business environment has also changed in recent years. Businesses face increasing competition, both in New Zealand and in the global marketplace. This commercial pressure focuses attention on the wide variety of issues that can affect the competitiveness of businesses. 2.3 The Government is committed to creating an environment attractive to business and investment. That commitment involves ensuring that the burden imposed on businesses to meet their tax obligations is minimised. Fact Why are small businesses important? Most New Zealand businesses are small. More than 95 percent employ fewer than 20 people, while 84 percent employ fewer than 5. For this reason the high cost of compliance to small businesses is a matter of particular concern to the Government. Reducing these costs for small businesses will help to increase their productivity and effectiveness. 11 Tax simplification and the Government’s tax policy work programme 2.4 Much of the work the Government has already done on tax simplification has focused on ensuring that the tax system encourages voluntary compliance without placing an excessive burden on taxpayers. This is especially important when they are having difficulty meeting their obligations or have inadvertently failed to comply with the law. This discussion document represents a shift in focus towards reducing the risk of not complying in the first place. 2.5 The Government’s overall tax policy work programme also places emphasis on increasing taxpayer certainty and making compliance as straightforward as possible. This is reflected in Government projects such as: • clarifying the interest deductibility rules for companies; • clarifying the tax treatment of research and development expenditure; • legislating for the practice of taxpayer self-assessment; and • rewriting the Income Tax Act in plain language. 2.6 A draft of Parts C, D and E of the rewritten Income Tax Act is to be released later this year, as are discussion documents on the reviews of the compliance and penalty rules and the tax dispute resolution rules. All these measures will contribute towards the refinement of the tax system and the development as much as possible of requirements that are simple to comply with and do not impose an excessive compliance burden on small businesses in New Zealand. A new type of tax simplification 2.7 The aim of the proposals in this discussion document is a significant reduction in the stress, uncertainty and risk small businesses face in meeting their regular tax obligations. 2.8 This reflects a change in emphasis away from earlier tax simplification measures, such as simplifying tax forms, and towards more substantial reductions in the obligations imposed on businesses. Achieving this goal will mean that small businesses will be able to spend more time on business and less time on tax. 2.9 This discussion document also reflects major developments in information technology over recent years. Reductions in the costs associated with moving information and performing transactions have made new approaches to tax administration feasible. 12 The Government’s business compliance cost reduction programme 2.10 Last year the Government established the Business Compliance Cost Panel, which is made up of businesspeople and is chaired by Alan Dunn, the Managing Director of McDonalds New Zealand. 2.11 The panel’s task is to identify unnecessary compliance costs imposed on businesses and report to the Government on ways of reducing business compliance costs generally. The panel is working with officials and the private sector to identify major sources of compliance costs in the economy, signal priorities and propose workable solutions from a business perspective. 2.12 One key area for regard by the panel is the cumulative effects of Government regulation. There is a need to ensure that Government-imposed requirements are neither redundant nor inconsistent with each other, and that they support efficient administration and do not cause unnecessary delays for businesses. 2.13 The Government has already taken two important steps to ensure that future policies and legislation in areas other than tax do not impose unnecessary compliance costs on businesses and to allow the business community to have input into policies that will affect it. These steps are: • the establishment of test panels representing businesses directly affected by proposed legislation to audit the workability of proposals and the likely compliance costs they will impose, with the panel reports to be published; and • the introduction of a requirement that business compliance cost statements be included in all Cabinet papers that propose laws in other areas affecting businesses. Both that statement and the regulatory impact statement will be published as a matter of course. 2.14 The Business Compliance Cost Panel issued a discussion paper on business compliance costs in March 2001, and has been seeking the views of New Zealand businesses on ways to reduce the compliance costs imposed by the Government. A copy of the discussion paper can be found at the panel’s web site at www.businesscompliance.govt.nz. Fact The Government’s tax compliance cost reduction programme The Government’s commitment to simplifying the tax system plays a key role in its programme to reduce business compliance costs. The Business Compliance Cost Panel is a separate exercise from the Government’s tax simplification programme, which is already under way. This discussion document is the latest step in the process of reducing the compliance costs imposed by the tax system. Submissions raising tax issues with the Business Compliance Cost Panel will be considered as part of the Government’s tax simplification programme. 13 Recent reviews of the tax system 2.15 Three major reviews of the tax system have been carried out in recent years, all of which have considered ways of reducing tax compliance costs. Each of these reviews has recommended tax simplification in a number of areas, especially tax payment methods, the imposition of penalties and interest, and the treatment of debt. Commerce Committee Inquiry into Compliance Costs for Business 2.16 Parliament’s Commerce Committee reported in November 1998 on its inquiry into compliance costs imposed on business. Recently the Government reviewed progress made to implement the recommendations made by that committee. 2.17 The committee made three recommendations relating specifically to tax: • to consider aligning payment dates for different types of tax so that there would be fewer due dates for businesses to remember, and businesses could pay a single lump sum covering several types of tax all due on the same day; • to adopt a more lenient approach to applying penalties to small and medium-sized businesses; and • to simplify and modernise payment mechanisms, such as introducing direct crediting. 2.18 The committee also made a number of general recommendations aimed at all government departments. They were to rationalise requests for information, simplify forms, adopt standardised formats for electronic filing, maximise the use of technology to collect information efficiently and incorporate targets for reducing compliance costs within departmental purchase agreements. Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance 2.19 The Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance was established in March 1998. The committee’s terms of reference broadly required it to consider and make recommendations on tax compliance costs and the robustness of the tax system against avoidance and evasion. The committee reported in December 1998, presenting the following simplification recommendations to the Government: • investigate the amalgamation of tax payment dates; • standardise the treatment of payments that fall due on a non-working day; • remove liability for use-of-money interest from those who choose to pay fringe benefit tax annually; • reduce the incremental penalty for late payment of tax from 2% to 1% a month; 14 • not apply the initial late payment penalty to those who pay their tax a few days late; and • include GST on fringe benefits in the FBT return rather than in the GST return. Finance and Expenditure Committee Inquiry into the Powers and Operations of the Inland Revenue Department 2.20 In 1999 Parliament’s Finance and Expenditure Committee received over 180 public submissions and heard over 50 hours of oral presentations in relation to its Inquiry into the Powers and Operations of the Inland Revenue Department. In its October 1999 report the committee made numerous recommendations covering many aspects of tax policy and administration. The key simplification recommendations made by the committee were that: • A past record of “good behaviour” should be taken into account when deciding whether to impose a penalty. • Greater flexibility should be exercised when deciding whether shortfall penalties should be applied. • Shortfall penalties should not be imposed in the case of an inadvertent error. • The method for determining use-of-money interest rates should be reviewed. • The area of debt write-offs should be reviewed. • Taxpayers should be given clear directions as to their options, rights and obligations with respect to repayment arrangements. • The need for ministerial approval of instalment arrangements and remission should be removed. Tax simplification measures already implemented 2.21 Before these three reviews, work had already been done to simplify tax obligations for wage and salary earners. The result of that work was freeing 1.2 million New Zealanders from the requirement to file IR 5 income tax returns. The removal of IR 5 returns has saved some 1.5 million hours annually – an hour for each person, plus half an hour of another person’s time for the 50 percent of those who required help to complete their returns. 2.22 Work developing the recommendations from the three major reviews culminated in a discussion document, Less taxing tax , which was released in September 1999. The document proposed a series of modest tax improvements focused on enhancing the existing tax system rather than making large changes to tax administration. The proposals had six goals: • reducing penalties for overdue tax; • providing for more lenient treatment of businesses in difficulties; 15 • simplifying payment and return dates; • making fringe benefit tax more flexible and more certain; • reducing the impact of use-of-money interest and penalties on provisional taxpayers; and • reducing the information required of taxpayers. 2.23 Those proposals that received support in submissions have been introduced into legislation. Outstanding simplification issues 2.24 The main area where the Government has not followed recommendations arising from one or more of the reviews is the alignment of tax due dates. Generally, small businesses were opposed to the initiative because fewer but larger payments could have debilitating effects on their cash-flow. This was not such a problem for larger, more tax-organised businesses, but there was no consensus on which option was most suitable. Discussion in focus groups indicated an overall preference for the status quo. The gains from simpler payments seemed outweighed by the risk that many small businesses would suffer significant cash-flow problems. 2.25 Reducing the number of payments that have to be made to Inland Revenue and the cost of those payments are still important issues for tax simplification. This discussion document proposes new tax payment methods that may make alignment of due dates more viable in the future. Of particular interest are the alternatives to the way that provisional tax is paid. 2.26 Work to develop more convenient ways of filing tax returns and making payments is continuing. Recent developments in information technology are also making new payment methods feasible and cost-effective. As part of its general business strategy, Inland Revenue has made and continues to make significant progress in the areas suggested for consideration by the Commerce Committee – electronic payment and filing methods, improved customer contact and simplification of tax forms. 2.27 Inland Revenue is part of the collaborative e-Government project being co- ordinated by the State Services Commission. It has had a lead role in the e- billing initiative, which is aimed at creating standardised mechanisms for internet delivery of invoices, returns and payments. The department also contributes to the advancement of other e-Government project initiatives. 2.28 Inland Revenue has a well-developed system for electronic filing of tax returns, using privately developed software packages. They follow Inland Revenue specifications and formats, and are tested by the department. 16 2.29 Inland Revenue has accepted electronically filed tax returns and associated documents since 1992. It has extended the range of documents and services that can be sent electronically to include rebate claim forms, information from payers of interest, requests for information, PAYE-related forms and tax guides. Tax simplification in other countries 2.30 New Zealand’s efforts to simplify the tax system are mirrored in a number of other countries that are often used for economic and welfare comparison purposes. These countries include Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada. Many share New Zealand’s interest in areas such as: • using information technology to simplify communication, reduce tax return filing requirements and introduce convenient payment methods; • reducing compliance costs for small businesses; and • rewriting tax law in plain language. 2.31 Although countries differ in the specific measures they adopt and their timing, there is considerable similarity in their overall goals and approaches. For example, the United States is concentrating on improving its administrative structure and eliminating return filing obligations where possible by 2007, while New Zealand has already made significant headway in these areas. The delegation of employer tax obligations to payroll intermediaries is well established in the United States, whereas it is still at the proposal stage in New Zealand. 2.32 For more detail about the tax simplification measures adopted by those countries, see appendix 1. 17 Chapter 3 REDUCING THE RISKS OF THE TAX SYSTEM 3.1 One of the major issues identified in earlier tax simplification work is the high “psychological” cost that some parts of the tax system impose on business taxpayers. Many of the tax rules businesses feel most strongly about impose relatively small time and money costs, but they can be difficult to understand. They also carry an inherent risk of exposure to penalties or use-of-money interest for businesses that fail to comply, for whatever reason. 3.2 This discussion document looks at ways of reducing risk for taxpayers and simplifying contact with Inland Revenue. Reducing taxpayer risk 3.3 Many of the tax risks that confront businesses arise from their obligation to assess their tax liability themselves rather than have Inland Revenue calculate it for them. Those who do not calculate their tax liabilities correctly may be penalised. They may also attract penalties if they do not file the necessary returns or pay their tax on time. 3.4 Calculating tax can be complex, as can completing tax returns. Furthermore, these obligations are imposed on businesses that may have little knowledge of tax law. This means that they have to incur costs by taking time to understand their tax obligations or by employing a tax specialist to help them. Most businesses in New Zealand meet their more frequent tax obligations themselves and employ tax agents to prepare their annual tax returns. Fact Self-assessment New Zealand’s tax administration is based on a system of self-assessment because it imposes lower overall costs than a system based on assessment by Inland Revenue. It also creates a fairer outcome because taxpayers are in the best position to know the facts to which the tax laws apply. Transferring risk to intermediaries 3.5 The tax system relies on the work that intermediaries, who are third parties between taxpayers and Inland Revenue, do to calculate, withhold, and pay tax on behalf of taxpayers. Some intermediaries are engaged by taxpayers to do this work, such as tax agents and payroll firms. Other intermediaries have responsibilities defined by law, like employers, who pay tax on behalf of employees, and banks, which withhold tax on behalf of those who earn interest. 18 3.6 One way of reducing the risks imposed by the tax system is to transfer tax obligations from a person who is not a tax expert to another who is. This would help reduce risk for small businesses because: • Tax obligations would be transferred to entities who know and understand them and who are in a better position to establish systems to ensure that they are met. • The fixed costs associated with establishing computerised systems to meet tax obligations could be borne by intermediaries who could spread those costs over numerous clients. In this way, businesses would not need to bear the full cost of establishing their own systems, and the overall costs imposed by the tax system would be reduced. • The risks that remain with business taxpayers would tend to relate to the provision of accurate information rather than to the application of tax laws. • Inland Revenue could more easily ensure that businesses were complying with tax obligations by checking the compliance of a smaller number of intermediaries rather than auditing individual businesses to the same extent that they are audited at present. Using technology to reduce risk 3.7 Recent developments in information technology have created possibilities for tax simplification not available in the past. First, information technology allows information to be moved at very little cost. This means Inland Revenue could undertake tax calculations, based on information provided by businesses, rather than businesses having to apply the tax laws themselves to determine their tax liabilities. 3.8 Second, information technology makes it possible to reduce the transaction costs associated with the payment of tax. Instead of large, infrequent payments of tax, businesses could make smaller, more frequent payments at little cost. This would allow tax payments to match cash-flow and so reduce the risk of late payment. 3.9 Third, information technology can make it easier for businesses to work out complex tax calculations. Complexity of the changes 3.10 Expanding the role of intermediaries in the tax system is a more complex initiative than previous tax simplification reforms. Previous tax simplification measures have involved the Government determining, after consultation, beneficial changes to the tax system which were then implemented. The proposals in this discussion document rely on voluntary changes in both taxpayer and intermediary behaviour. For this to work all parties must see an advantage in change. Therefore these proposals require more difficult trade-offs between the various objectives of the tax system and the needs of the taxpayers involved. 19 3.11 The principal trade-off is between risk reduction and the date tax has to be paid. Employers’ retention of withholding taxes, such as the PAYE they deduct from employees’ salaries, for a period before the tax must be paid to Inland Revenue provides them with a form of compensation, a cash-flow benefit, for the compliance costs imposed on them by the PAYE system. Removing the risk associated with PAYE also means removing the cash-flow benefit of retaining the deductions. 3.12 Businesses that receive a cash-flow benefit that exceeds their compliance costs might see little advantage in transferring their obligations or payment to an intermediary to reduce their compliance costs further if it means losing the cash-flow benefit. 3.13 On the other hand, the cash-flow benefit needs to be carefully managed in order to ensure that the funds can be paid to Inland Revenue when due. Unexpected cash-flow problems resulting in failure to pay are a major cause of business failure. It was one of the contributing factors in many of the cases heard by the Finance and Expenditure Committee during its Inquiry into the Powers and Operations of the Inland Revenue Department. The Government encourages small businesses to consider carefully the benefits and risks of retaining tax payments. Simplifying contact with Inland Revenue 3.14 When it is necessary for businesses to communicate with Inland Revenue, that process should be made as easy as possible. Gains in this area will arise from improvements in administration and the increased use of information technology. 3.15 Information technology could also enable businesses to have easier access to technical tax information as well as other information pertaining to their case. 20 Chapter 4 SIMPLIFYING PROVISIONAL TAX 4.1 The aim of the provisional tax rules is to ensure the payment of tax on income earned by businesses during the year in which they earn the income. Provisional taxpayers are required to make regular payments of tax on their income. 4.2 In achieving this simple aim, however, the provisional tax rules do not reflect the reality of everyday life for many small businesses. The provisional tax payments that businesses make often do not match their flows of income, and they can have cash-flow problems if their tax payments are due but are not matched by receipts. 4.3 A second major problem with provisional tax is the difficulties many small businesses face when estimating how much income they will have earned by the end of the year, and therefore how much provisional tax they should pay during the year. Overpayment of tax results in money that a business could use to grow or reduce debt being “deposited” with Inland Revenue at a cost to the business. Underpayment of provisional tax means businesses may face an unexpected interest charge that might exceed their cost of “borrowing”. Provisional tax Removing or reducing use-of-money interest Lower risk of accumulating end-of-period deb t More equitable tax treatment Less uncertainty in tax treatment More accurate calculation of tax liabilities Fewer forms to fill in / fewer tax calculations Reduced need to communicate with IRD Lower risk of avoidance Small businesses Medium sized businesses Large businesses Banks and other intermediaries The proposals Withholding tax on business income !!!!!!!!! Provisional tax payments based on GST returns !!!!!!!! Pooling of provisional tax !!!!!! Reducing application of use-of-money interest !!!!!! The benefits of the proposalsWho benefits 21 Fact Use-of-money interest rates Many business taxpayers feel that the use-of-money interest rates do not adequately compensate them if they overpay their tax, and that they are over- charged if they underpay their tax. The use-of-money interest rates reflect the fact that the Government is an involuntary borrower if taxpayers overpay and an involuntary lender if taxpayers underpay. The underpayment use-of-money interest rate is roughly equivalent to the cost of unsecured bridging finance borrowed by a small firm. Lowering this rate would reduce the incentives for taxpayers to pay tax on time, probably resulting in smaller businesses not paying provisional tax till the terminal tax date. Increasing the overpayment rate might result in some taxpayers overpaying tax simply to have access to a rate better than that provided by the private sector. 4.4 Although use-of-money interest has disadvantages, it has been effective in ensuring payment of provisional tax. Figure 1 demonstrates how the provisional tax payments at the first, second and third provisional tax dates evened out from 1994-95, following the introduction of interest from the first provisional tax date.

For this reason we are proposing to introduce two voluntary alternatives and two changes to the current system. Fact What are the provisional tax rules? Under the provisional tax rules, a taxpayer with residual income tax (RIT) for the income year exceeding $2,500 is a provisional taxpayer. RIT is the amount of income tax payable less any tax credits, but before the crediting of any provisional tax paid or any voluntary income tax payments. Provisional tax payments are generally required only if the preceding year’s RIT also exceeds $2,500. This prevents taxpayers from finding at the end of the year that they were required to make payments even though they did not anticipate that their RIT would exceed $2,500 for the year. Provisional taxpayers can choose between two methods of calculating their provisional tax: the estimation method, or the standard method of using last year’s RIT plus an “uplift factor”, currently 5%. In both cases a final terminal payment may be required once the taxpayer completes the end-of-year return and income tax liability is determined. Provisional tax is normally due in three equal instalments, except in the case of new businesses. Other provisional taxpayers (around one in five) pay interest on underpayments and receive interest on overpayments of provisional tax. Individuals whose RIT is less than $30,000 and who use the standard method of calculating provisional tax are not exposed to use-of-money interest. Options for change 4.6 The diversity of businesses in their activity, structure, size and level of organisation prevents any one option being developed that will deal with all the concerns about provisional tax. A key issue with regard to all businesses, however, is the risk of exposure to use-of-money interest. All of the options discussed later are designed to deal with this risk. 4.7 While achieving the desired simplification outcomes, any options adopted must still ensure that tax continues to be paid in the year it is earned. Although deferring tax payments provides short-term benefits, in the longer term it exposes businesses to the risk of having to pay tax at a time when there may not be sufficient income to meet the liability. 23 Options assisting with cash-flow and seasonal income 4.8 The Government is considering two options for dealing with the frequent mismatch between payment dates and a business’s cash-flow. The first is a withholding tax on business income. The second is for businesses to pay provisional tax along with GST. Both these options are based on easily measurable cash-flows received by businesses. Payments based on these cash-flows might be better aligned with the earning of income than they are now. Only businesses with an annual turnover of less than $1.3 million would be eligible to use these two options. 4.9 Measures changing the timing of provisional tax payments to recognise seasonal income and cash-flow would have two effects on tax payments for businesses: • Payments would naturally vary from those made under the current provisional tax rules, resulting in more or less tax payable throughout the year. • Payments would be more frequent and hence some would be made earlier than at present. Withholding tax on business income 4.10 The more far-reaching option is to introduce a voluntary withholding tax on business income. 4.11 Instead of businesses paying provisional tax, banks would withhold a percentage of any deposit into a bank account. Payments received by the bank would be paid regularly to Inland Revenue – for example, on a monthly basis. 4.12 Businesses would nominate their withholding tax rate, which would be based on a ratio of their expected tax liability to their deposits during the year. They would also be able to adjust the nominated withholding rate if they thought it no longer correct, in the same way that provisional tax can be estimated. 4.13 As a starting point for determining an appropriate rate for the year, Inland Revenue could provide businesses with a ratio that would have been correct for a previous year. It should be a simple matter for businesses or their tax agents to work out their ratio for the current year. 4.14 It might be necessary for a business to establish a second bank account, into which capital payments could be deposited without being subject to withholding tax. For example, if a business sold a motor vehicle and intended to use the funds as a deposit for a new vehicle, putting the proceeds from the sale into a separate account would ensure the full sum was there for the deposit. Some businesses may already have multiple accounts that could serve this purpose. 24 4.15 If a business decided to move back into the current provisional tax system its payments would be calculated using the estimation option and would be due at the next provisional tax payment date. Use-of-money interest would then apply. Tax paid during that year would be treated as normal provisional tax payments for that year. 4.16 Any difference between the payments made during the year and a business’s RIT for that year would be due at the terminal tax date. 4.17 The benefits of the withholding tax option are: • Tax payments would match cash-flow. The payment profile should closely approximate sales made by a business. • It ensures that a business regularly puts aside money to meet its tax liabilities. This reduces the risk that the business might not be able to pay its tax on time, since tax would be paid on each deposit as it is made. • The business would not be exposed to use-of-money interest. 4.18 The withholding tax option would allow businesses to pay their tax during the year without the need to interact with Inland Revenue and the provisional tax system. This would remove the risks of forgetting to make a provisional tax payment, the possible application of use-of-money interest and the need to contact Inland Revenue three times a year. 4.19 The principal disadvantage of the withholding tax option is that it could result in insufficient payment, with businesses facing a large tax debt at their terminal tax date if the withholding rate has not been accurately determined. As well, deposits may not match profitability. 4.20 Furthermore, some businesses could be at a disadvantage in that they would pay tax earlier then they do at present, thus losing the cash-flow benefit of retaining the tax. 4.21 There is also the risk that the option could be abused by businesses that select a very low withholding rate to defer paying tax. This matter is discussed in detail in the section on the need for safeguards. Key question How can the risks of underpayment, both accidental and deliberate, be minimised? 25 Allocation of risk 4.22 Who bears the risk if a business makes a payment to an intermediary but the intermediary does not pay the money to Inland Revenue? There are two options. The first is that the business is still obliged to pay the tax. Alternatively, the business could be viewed as having paid its tax when it was deducted, with the obligation now falling on the intermediary to make the payment. 4.23 The Government’s view is that, given that the proposals are intended to reduce risk for taxpayers, if the business has made a payment to the intermediary, it has met its tax obligations. The Government can address risk issues in relation to intermediaries when negotiating contracts with them. Payments based on GST returns 4.24 As with the withholding tax option, aligning provisional tax payments with GST payments is designed to help relieve cash-flow problems and remove risk of exposure to use-of-money interest for small businesses. 4.25 Instead of making three equal payments of provisional tax during the year, a business would pay smaller but more frequent instalments towards its income tax at the same time it pays its GST. 4.26 The GST option would be available only to small businesses that file their GST returns once a month or every two months. The infrequency of payments made by six-monthly filers would not allow tax payments to match their cash-flow, and they would end up making only one payment a year. F IGURE 2: P ROVISIONAL T AX P AYMENTS B ASED O N GST R ETURNS F OR 2002-03 $0 $5,000 $10,000 $15,000 $20,000 $25,000 April May June July August September October NovemberDecember January February March Income Year (March balance date) Income (Tax) Tax Payments under provisional tax GST based payments (two monthly return cycle) GST based payments (monthly return cycle) Income 26 Example of provisional tax payments based on GST returns A small business with a March balance date estimates its income for the 2002-03 income year to be $89,000. Under the provisional tax rules, three instalments of $9,790 would need to be made, on 7 July and 7 November 2002, and on 7 March 2003. The instalments are calculated by multiplying the estimated income by the company tax rate (33%) and dividing the tax liability into three equal payments. In this example, the business may experience cash-flow problems at each of the provisional tax payment dates, as its tax liability exceeds income. Further, the business could also have an end-of-year tax bill (due on 7 February 2004), if its income is higher than estimated. If the business earned income of $110,000 in 2002-03, it would have to pay $6,930 in terminal tax as well as interest on the shortfall. The GST option will not, however, result in tax being perfectly aligned with income flows because GST is paid after the period it relates to, creating a lag of one month. This can result in instances where the tax owing is high, although sales are not, as can be seen in the month of February in figure 2. 4.27 A business would set the amount of tax payable on each GST due date as a percentage of its GST sales and could vary it as it sees fit. As with the withholding tax option, Inland Revenue could provide a guide ratio, although the responsibility for working out an accurate ratio would remain with the business. 4.28 Any difference between the payments made during the year and the business’s RIT for that year would be due at the taxpayer’s terminal tax date. 4.29 The benefits of the GST option are: • Tax payments would match cash-flow. As GST sales and income increased, the amount of income tax paid would also increase, while declines in sales would result in less tax paid. • It would allow improved cash-flow management. The more frequent tax payments would result in smaller payments, reducing the risk that a payment was too large to meet or that the tax due had been spent by the business. • The business would not be exposed to use-of-money interest. 4.30 A key disadvantage of this option over the withholding tax option is that small businesses would still have to budget, rather than the tax due being deducted immediately. There is also a risk that the sales information might not match profitability. 4.31 Payment would generally be slightly later than under the current provisional tax rules because GST is paid up to three months after the sales to which it relates. 27 Need for safeguards 4.32 There is a risk that both these options, which are intended to help businesses, could be misused by those seeking to defer their tax payments to the last possible date. The Government therefore proposes several safeguards. 4.33 The best approach seems to be to remove a business’s ability to use these options if it abuses them. We propose that a business would be returned to the provisional tax payment system for a period of four years if: • total tax withheld for the year was less than, say, 80% of the year’s RIT; or • any difference between total tax withheld for the year and the year’s RIT was greater than $2,500. Key question Can these thresholds be made more appropriate, to prevent abuse while not resulting in those who are trying to comply being returned to the provisional tax system? 4.34 An additional safeguard is required to prevent businesses choosing, under either option, a low withholding rate at the beginning of the year, and then attempting to balance this by setting a high rate at the end of the year to meet these tests. Therefore, as a safeguard, the Government is also proposing that businesses not be allowed to use either option under certain circumstances – if a business’s lowest elected percentage in the first half of the income year was less than 75 percent of the ratio of its RIT to total income. 4.35 A final requirement would be that no more than 20 percent of a business’s income was derived from an associated party. This is to prevent associated parties on different provisional tax payment systems manipulating the rules so that neither would pay provisional tax during the year. 4.36 It is most likely that failure to meet these standards would only be determined once a tax return for an income year had been filed, meaning that a business might already be using an option for the following year. In this case, any amounts the business paid from the beginning of that subsequent year would be treated as estimated payments of provisional tax. Payments would be credited to the next provisional tax instalment date. Given that the payments would be treated as estimated payments, use-of-money interest would apply. 4.37 The tax ratio selected by a business would have to be reasonable, in the same way that estimates of provisional tax payable must be reasonable. Neither of these two options may be suitable for businesses that are unable to select a reasonable rate. 28 Simplified part-year calculations 4.38 A third option would involve businesses carrying out simplified part-year calculations. It is fundamentally different in approach from the withholding tax option and the GST option but has the same aims, to reduce cash-flow problems, allow tax payments to reflect the income earning process, and remove the risk of paying use-of-money interest. 4.39 Instead of the business making three equal payments of provisional tax during the year, the amount payable at each of the three provisional tax payment dates would be determined according to simplified part-year income calculations, carried out on a rudimentary cash accounting basis – that is, sales less expenses. The calculations would not include non-cash expenses such as depreciation. Inland Revenue could issue a calculation sheet to help businesses. 4.40 The Government has been approached to introduce this option, and we understand that a number of tax agents use an informal equivalent to calculate how much should be set aside to meet provisional tax payments. 4.41 For businesses with sophisticated accounting systems the benefits of this option are clear and significant – tax payments could accurately reflect the tax payable. 4.42 Adopting this option, however, would raise a significant concern for the Government. Unlike the withholding tax and GST options, it would see businesses calculating their own tax to pay throughout the year, without reference to any set, objective criteria that could be readily referenced by Inland Revenue. Even though they would still have to file an end-of-year return, they would be able to manipulate payment of their tax throughout the year without exposing themselves to use-of-money interest for underpayment. For example, a business could prepay its expenses, reducing income for the first part of the year. Similarly, it could also defer income receipt. A combination of both approaches could have a significant impact on provisional tax payments. 4.43 This risk could be reduced but not eliminated by: • Inland Revenue targeting audit resources at businesses using this option. However, these resources are scarce and they are currently used on higher-value activities, such as detecting evasion and tax avoidance. • Increasing the complexity of the calculations. At an extreme the calculations would be similar to those carried out to prepare a tax return. This outcome would not be simpler than the current system. 4.44 Neither of these solutions is considered effective. Accordingly, the Government considers the revenue risk associated with this option is significant and cannot be reduced in a practical way. Therefore we are not considering adopting it. 29 Key question The Government is unable to advance this option unless the concerns raised are addressed. We would welcome submissions on whether this option can be made feasible. Reducing impact of use-of-money interest rules 4.45 The difference between what some businesses pay during the year as provisional tax and their total income tax liability for the year attracts use-of- money interest. About one in five provisional taxpayers falls into this group. 4.46 Difficulties in forecasting income mean that some taxpayers underestimate their income and are charged use-of-money interest, whereas others overestimate their income and are paid use-of-money interest. Two options discussed here are specifically designed to reduce the impact of the use-of- money interest rules. Fact Implications of lowering the underpayment rate Reducing the underpayment rate of interest is not a feasible solution. Any reduction would raise the possibility that the unpopular and now repealed underestimation penalty would have to be reinstated to ensure compliance. Further, compliance and administrative costs would increase as processes to enforce payment were substituted to compensate for any reduction in the incentive to comply. For example, Australia has detailed rules outlining how taxpayers determine the amount of provisional tax they pay. Lowering the incentive to comply would increase the likelihood that such rules would be needed here. See appendix 2 for details of how the underpayment rate compares with commercial rates. Pooling of provisional tax payments 4.47 A possible way of dealing with this problem is to allow businesses to pool their provisional tax payments, so that underpayments by some in the pool could be offset against overpayments by others in the same pool. In effect, an underpaying taxpayer in a pool would be able to borrow from a person who has overpaid at a rate lower than that charged by Inland Revenue on underpayments. 30 4.48 Figure 3 outlines how two taxpayers, one with an underpayment and one with an overpayment, can pool their provisional tax payments to lower the interest paid on underpayments and receive more interest on overpayments. In this example, the taxpayer who overpays would have received $1,219 from Inland Revenue, but instead receives $1,487 from the intermediary, so is better off by about $268. The taxpayer who underpays would have had to pay $2,681 to Inland Revenue, but instead pays $2,124 to the intermediary, so is better off by about $557. 4.49 The pooling arrangement would have to be coordinated by an intermediary such as a financial institution or a tax agent. Participation would be by arrangement between businesses and the intermediary. Participating businesses would make provisional tax payments during the year in the same way as they do now, except that the payments would be made to the intermediary rather than Inland Revenue. The intermediary would send the pooled payments as one total payment to Inland Revenue. 4.50 Once the participants’ tax liability was determined at the end of the year, businesses would know whether they had underpaid or overpaid their provisional tax. At that stage the intermediary would offset underpayments against overpayments within the pool and give instructions to Inland Revenue as to how the pool should be divided between the participants. F IGURE 3: H OW P OOLING W OULD W ORK Pool Taxpayers No Pool Interest Intermediary $5,000 overpayment $5,000 overpayment $5,000 overpayment $5,000 underpayment $5,000 underpayment $5,000 underpayment 7 Nov 01 7 Jul 01 7 Mar 02 Total underpayment $15,000 Total overpayment $15,000 7 Nov 01 7 Jul 01 7 Mar 02 $637.40 7% / $1,487.26 10% / $2,124.66 IRD pays $1,219.55 IRD receives $2,681.32 Govt rate 5.74%12.62% Govt rate Tax pay er 1Tax pay er 2 31 4.51 Preferences for how the intermediary carried out this offset between underpayments and overpayments would be made by arrangement between the business and the intermediary. 4.52 Inland Revenue would still apply use-of-money interest if, after the pool was divided and transferred to taxpayer accounts, underpayments or overpayments remained. Interest on underpayments or overpayments would be charged or paid directly to the businesses concerned. 4.53 In order to match underpayments with overpayments received in the same bulk payment, each pool would be restricted to businesses with common due dates for provisional tax. This could result in multiple pools being co- ordinated by the same intermediary. Pools would need to contain a minimum number of participating businesses – at least one hundred. The concern is that the compliance and administrative costs associated with smaller pools would outweigh any benefits. There is also a risk with small pools that there would be insufficient underpayments and overpayments to provide any real benefits to the participants. 4.54 For administrative simplicity, participants would need to be identified to Inland Revenue before the due date of their first provisional tax payment, and would have to participate in the arrangement for the whole year. Transfers between pools would not be permitted, but businesses could make payments to Inland Revenue in addition to those made to the intermediary. 4.55 The benefits of the pool are: • The use-of-money interest costs for those who participate would more readily reflect the true commercial cost of borrowing or lending by the businesses concerned. • The impact of incorrect forecasting of provisional tax would be reduced. In turn, the resources that need to be devoted to determine tax payments correctly might also be reduced. • The risk to businesses of late payment penalties would be reduced, since the obligation to make payment on the due dates would be passed to intermediaries. 4.56 The main cost of this option is the degree of complexity. However, for a business that chose to participate, little more would be needed than to pay the amount of provisional tax to the intermediary when required. The complexity of management would lie with the intermediary. 4.57 The intermediary would gain from the opportunity to manage the arbitrage between those in a pool who overpay and those who underpay. (In the example in figure 3, the intermediary would gain $637.40.) The intermediary would also be able to offer participation in a pool as part of a package of services including preparation of income tax returns and similar services. 32 Allocation of risk 4.58 The same issues of risk allocation arise with the pool option as with the withholding tax option. However, these issues can be resolved by the intermediaries informing Inland Revenue of the payments they have received from their clients, and that information being available to the clients from Inland Revenue. It would ensure that the client could check the transfer of the payment by the intermediary. On this basis, the onus for ensuring that tax payments have been made to Inland Revenue would remain on the business. Reducing application of use-of-money interest 4.59 Under a final option, businesses would continue to calculate and pay their provisional tax as they do under the present system. However, for those who overpay or underpay their tax slightly, use-of-money interest would not be imposed. In the case of taxpayers who pay roughly the right amount of tax, the compliance and administrative costs of paying and charging interest are not worth the benefits. 4.60 This restriction in the application of use-of-money interest would be limited to businesses that pay provisional tax based on last year’s RIT plus a 5% “uplift factor”. There is a risk that if this option were available to businesses that use the estimation option some might start reducing their estimated payments, with the goal of paying just above or below the point at which interest applies rather than trying to pay their actual liability. 4.61 Unlike the other options, this measure would be applied automatically and would become a core part of the provisional tax rules. It would not be an option that taxpayers chose to adopt. 4.62 The Government proposes a 10% margin, which would have the benefit of removing the need for interest to be imposed on or paid to approximately 4,000 taxpayers. Involvement of financial institutions 4.63 Two options presented in this chapter require the involvement of financial institutions. The Government does not wish to legislate for their involvement, although we hope they will become involved, for two reasons: • The options described here are commercially attractive. Financial institutions would benefit from retaining tax payments for a period before they were paid to Inland Revenue. They would also benefit from the arbitrage between the provisional tax underpayment and overpayment use-of-money interest rates. • Their customers will benefit from involvement in the proposals. 33 4.64 This matter, however, is clearly and correctly a commercial decision which has to be made by financial institutions. Their role in these initiatives would be one of supporting taxpayers in meeting their obligations rather than one of collecting tax on behalf of the Government. Therefore flexibility is required in the design of the proposals, which would have to take into account: • the degree of compensation the financial institutions would require; • the need for a contractual rather than legislative approach to the measures; • the role of penalties if there is a failure at some point in the process; and • taxpayers’ privacy. 34 Chapter 5 REDUCING PAYE OBLIGATIONS 5.1 The efficient administration of the tax system relies on the work done by employers to calculate, collect, and pay PAYE (Pay As You Earn). The PAYE system is the backbone of New Zealand’s tax system. 5.2 Recent changes to the PAYE system as part of the Government’s measures to remove the need for wage and salary earners to file tax returns have also benefited employers: three-quarters of employers surveyed by Inland Revenue expressed a preference for the new system over the old. On the whole, both small and large employers find the new system simpler and easier to manage, although the number of staff enquiries and the amount of contact employers have with Inland Revenue remain the same. See appendix 3 for more details on this research. 5.3 The Government proposes that employers who use an intermediary, such as a recognised payroll firm, to calculate and pay their PAYE would have their exposure to penalties and interest largely removed. In effect, a third party could take over the PAYE obligations for the employer, reducing compliance costs. 5.4 This proposal reflects the fact that the Government wishes to ensure that PAYE legislation does not prevent the development of solutions by the private sector that have the potential to reduce compliance costs for employers. PAYE obligations Lower risk of penalties Removing or reducing use-of-money interest Lower risk of accumulating end-of-period debt More accurate calculation of tax liabilities Fewer forms to fill in / fewer tax calculations Reduced need to communicate with IRD Lower risk of avoidance Employer Banks and other intermediaries The proposal Reducing PAYE costs !!!!!!!!! The benefits of the proposalWho benefits 35 Fact The PAYE system In New Zealand there are about 160,000 employers, and around 95,000 of them employ five or fewer staff. PAYE makes up over a third of the Government’s tax revenue. Therefore changes to the way that PAYE is calculated or to the way it is paid could have a significant impact on both the overall amount of revenue collected and the Government’s day- to-day cash-flow. All employers have the use of PAYE deductions between the time they pay salaries and wages to their employees and the time they pay the PAYE deductions to Inland Revenue. This period is between 20 to 50 days for small employers and between 5 to 20 days for large employers. Concerns about PAYE 5.5 The Government recognises that the PAYE system imposes compliance costs on employers. Issues raised for businesses who employ staff are that: • Time spent keeping up to date with PAYE and calculating deductions could be better spent running the business. • There is a risk that deductions will be spent to meet business expenses and will not be available to be paid to Inland Revenue when required. 5.6 Of particular concern to the Government is the disproportionate cost to small businesses of hiring employees and applying the PAYE rules. The compliance cost of employing the first employee is higher than the cost of employing the second employee, with the marginal cost of employing each additional employee continuing to reduce significantly. Furthermore, the initial cost of becoming familiar with the PAYE rules and keeping up to date with changes is spread over an increasing number of staff. 5.7 Although employers are allowed to retain the PAYE they deduct for a while, this benefit may not be significant for small businesses. Businesses without well-managed budget processes run the risk that funds will not be available when PAYE payments are due. This is especially a problem for small businesses, and was an issue underlying many of the concerns raised at the Finance and Expenditure Committee inquiry. 5.8 To resolve these problems, some employers have delegated their payroll functions to intermediaries such as payroll firms. Payroll firms are technical specialists who can use economies of scale to do the work more efficiently than individual employers. 36 5.9 In the past, the cost of transferring information created a barrier to small businesses using payroll services. However, changes in information technology have resulted in new payroll services being developed that are suitable for small businesses. 5.10 Even though employers can delegate the payroll function, they still bear the statutory responsibility for applying the PAYE rules and the risk of penalties and interest if their PAYE is incorrectly calculated or is paid late. PAYE by intermediaries 5.11 Employers would need to provide the intermediary with payroll information about their employees. This would include both personal and remuneration information and would need to include facts such as an employee’s liability to repay a student loan. Over time that information would need to be updated for changes in employees’ tax obligations and changes to their salary or wages. 5.12 The intermediary would be responsible for calculating the PAYE deductions, and meeting all filing requirements. The intermediary would also be responsible for ensuring that PAYE deductions were paid to Inland Revenue on time. There are two options for doing this. The first is that the employer could pay the gross wages to the intermediary, who would then have responsibility for paying both employees and Inland Revenue. (See figure 4.) 5.13 The main advantage of this option is that employers would not be exposed to late payment penalties or interest. However, paying the gross wages to the intermediary would mean giving up the benefit of holding the deductions for a period, although that cost could be compensated for by the intermediary paying interest or reducing its fees. Employer Employee IRD Payroll and employee information PAYE deduc tionPAYE returns Intermediary Gross wages Net salary F IGURE 4: W AGES A ND PAYE D EDUCTIONS P AID B Y I NTERMEDIARY 37 5.14 Under the second option, the employer would give the intermediary authority to direct that payments be made from the employer’s bank account to Inland Revenue. (See figure 5.) 5.15 This would mean that employers would retain the ability to use the PAYE deductions in their business until they paid them to Inland Revenue. However, employers would continue to face the risk they currently face of incurring late payment penalties and interest if they do not manage their cash-flows and the deductions are not available to be paid by the due date. 5.16 To ensure that calculations are correct, employers would still have to provide correct and timely information to their intermediary. Employers would be able to transfer responsibility for calculating and paying PAYE only if they had provided the intermediary with both the correct payroll information and sufficient control to make PAYE payments. Fact Payroll firms in the United States A similar model has been followed in the United States for more than a decade. More information on that system can be found on the web sites of leading US payroll firms. For example, see www.adp.com, and www.paychex.com .

The payments would have to be made to Inland Revenue electronically. Employer monthly schedules would also need to be filed electronically. The type of information collected by Inland Revenue would not change. Certification of intermediaries 5.18 The Government considers that intermediaries would need to be certified by Inland Revenue to ensure integrity in the PAYE system. 5.19 Certifying intermediaries means that some of the risk that the right amount of deductions is not paid would move from employers to the Government. This risk would be reduced if Inland Revenue had the power to withhold certification if prospective intermediaries were found to have inadequate processes. The process of certification would be similar to traditional payroll audits. 5.20 Intermediaries would need to use an electronic format, specified by Inland Revenue, in order to exchange information and make payments. 5.21 The certification process would also need to set minimum standards for processes that ensure security of payment. Deductions held by intermediaries before being paid to Inland Revenue might need to be secured by being deposited into trust accounts, with the interest payable to the intermediary or the employer, to ensure that the deductions are available to be paid to Inland Revenue on time. 5.22 Employers would need to be confident the service provided by intermediaries was reliable and continuing. Realistically, only employers would be able to make this evaluation, and certification would not automatically mean that employers’ requirements would be met. 5.23 Inland Revenue would not be involved in determining what methods employers used to transfer information to intermediaries or the method used by intermediaries to authorise payment of PAYE deductions. Similarly, Inland Revenue would not have a role in determining exactly what services a certified intermediary could offer employers or how it could charge for those services. Key questions Can the certification requirements be made less restrictive without compromising the integrity of the proposal? What else should be part of the certification process? 39 Penalties and interest 5.24 To what extent should late payment and shortfall penalties apply to intermediaries? The Government considers that penalties should reflect the risk to revenue and maintain equity within the tax system; however, they should not over-penalise the person involved. 5.25 Intermediaries, as specialists in the area of PAYE, are less at risk of miscalculating PAYE than employers. The reasons employers may fail to pay PAYE deductions on time range from simple omissions to the unavailability of funds because the deductions have been used to meet business expenditure. Intermediaries are unlikely to fail to make a payment for these reasons. Shortfall penalties 5.26 The Government sees no reason to amend the shortfall penalties set out in law as their application requires consideration of the reasons for non- compliance before application of any penalty. Intermediaries’ exposure to shortfall penalties would be reduced through the certification process. 5.27 If an employer provided incorrect information to the intermediary, the employer would remain responsible for any underpayment of PAYE and subsequent penalties. For example, if the employer were to make an extra payment to an employee and not advise the intermediary, the employer would be liable for outstanding tax and penalties on that payment unless it separately calculated and paid the correct PAYE in respect of the payment. Late payment penalties 5.28 Intermediaries, like employers, should be eligible for remission of penalties on the basis of “reasonable cause”. Penalties can be remitted if failure to meet tax obligations was caused by an event or circumstance beyond the taxpayer’s control. The standard of behaviour required for remission is aimed at preventing both negligence and wilful non-payment. This principle could equally well be applied to circumstances faced by intermediaries. 5.29 Employers would not be responsible for the accuracy of payments authorised by the intermediary. If the intermediary failed to direct a payment to Inland Revenue and the deduction was still held by the employer, the late payment penalty would be imposed on the intermediary, although the employer would have an obligation to pay the tax. Interest 5.30 Very few circumstances permit Inland Revenue to remit use-of-money interest. This is because interest is intended primarily to compensate both Government and taxpayers for not having the use of the tax. It is also to encourage taxpayers to pay the correct amount of tax on time. The Government is not, therefore, proposing any changes to the use-of-money interest rules. 40 5.31 Intermediaries would need to accommodate the cost of use-of-money interest that arose from a failure on their part. However, if an employer caused the underlying failure by, for example, not having sufficient funds to meet the PAYE payment, interest would be imposed directly on the employer rather than on the intermediary. Key questions What sorts of situations would justify remission of penalties for intermediaries? Do the remission provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994 need to be expanded to take into account those situations? Future possibilities 5.32 It may be possible to extend the proposal to include fringe benefit tax and ACC payments. The Government sees this as a logical extension because of the way the calculation of these payments is linked to the information already provided in PAYE returns. Inland Revenue’s information technology strategy for the future includes extending electronic filing. That support would have to be in place before the extension of this proposal. 41 Chapter 6 REDUCING END-OF-YEAR TAX ADJUSTMENTS 6.1 The rules governing the calculation of income tax are generally the same regardless of the size of the business. Income is measured on an accrual basis (when it is earned) rather than on a cash basis (when it is received). Furthermore, capital items are depreciated over time rather than being immediately deducted. 6.2 Small businesses, however, tend to operate on a cash basis, creating a source of compliance costs as annual accounts have to be created on an accrual basis to calculate tax liability. This chapter looks at how some of the costs of going from a cash basis to an accrual basis may be reduced in relation to trading stock and depreciation. Going from cash surplus to tax profit 6.3 The costs of preparing accrual accounts to determine tax liability are twofold. First, compliance costs are incurred to gather information needed to calculate the income adjustments and the depreciation allowance. Second, the profit calculated under an accrual system may seem overstated compared with the cash surplus that a business has available at the end of the year and, therefore, has the potential to create cash-flow problems. 6.4 The main reasons for the differences between cash surplus and accrual profit are that capital expenditure and purchases of trading stock reduce cash-flow immediately. However, depreciation allowances for capital items are not immediately available, and the change in value of trading stock is an item that affects income. Large differences between debts and credits can also have a significant effect. End-of-year tax adjustments Lower risk of penalties Less uncertainty in tax treatment Fewer forms to fill in / fewer tax calculation s Reduced need to communicate with IRD Lower risk of avoidance Small businesses The proposal Trading stock exemption threshold !!!!!! The benefits of the proposalWho benefits 42 6.5 Businesses that are required to prepare financial accounts for reasons other than tax will still need to make these adjustments. Fact End-of-year calculations Most small businesses manage their financial affairs with a focus on cash-flow, tracking their position using a cashbook that does not include accrual adjustments. These records are generally designed to support GST return obligations and reflect the fact that small businesses are eligible to return GST on a cash basis rather than an accrual basis. Profit is considered to be the amount of cash available, plus any drawings that have been taken. However, when it is time to calculate tax owing or to prepare financial accounts, the small business must convert its cash records kept during the year into accrual accounts. The main steps that make up this process are: • valuing trading stock so that a trading stock adjustment can be made for changes in the value of stock; • calculating amounts owed to and by the business so that adjustments can be made for debtors and creditors; • separating capital expenditure and receipts from other income and expenditure; and • preparing a depreciation schedule to calculate depreciation deductions. 6.6 Measures aimed at reducing the compliance costs associated with these types of adjustments will be implemented in Australia later this year. A summary of these reforms can be found in appendix 1. More detailed information can be found at www.rbt.treasury.gov.au. Trading stock valuations 6.7 The Government proposes that small businesses with less than $5,000 of trading stock at the end of the year not be required to value it accurately or make an accrual adjustment for it. 6.8 The main compliance costs of making a trading stock adjustment are the time and effort spent in valuing stock. Making the adjustment is a simple calculation. 43 Fact The trading stock valuation rules These rules are aimed at matching the time that income and expenditure relating to that income are recognised. Trading stock must be valued at the end of each year, and the difference between the value of stock at the end of the year and the value of stock at the end of the previous year is included in the calculation of income – this is the adjustment for trading stock. The valuation must be done regardless of how little stock is held or how small the change in the value of stock is since the previous year. Some retailers and small taxpayers are eligible to use simpler methods of valuing trading stock than other taxpayers. 6.9 Businesses eligible to return GST on a cash basis would be eligible for this concession. Although it would be impossible to determine accurately whether a business had less than $5,000 worth of trading stock without actually counting and valuing it, this proposal would result in compliance cost reductions for businesses that knew they were well below the threshold. They would be entitled to carry over the last end-of-year valuation they had made. 6.10 A significant proportion of small businesses return trading stock valuations smaller than $5,000. This group is likely to include businesses that have a small amount of trading stock but do not go through the process of valuing it at their balance date. Although removing the requirement to value small amounts of trading stock would not reduce the tax compliance work for these businesses, it would reduce the risk associated with non-compliance. 6.11 Businesses would still be able to value their stock if they wished. For example, if the change in the value of trading stock was likely to be a negative figure, making an adjustment for it should reduce their tax liability. 6.12 As with all tax thresholds, exceeding the $5,000 threshold for the first time would create transitional costs. The main costs would be for putting in place a process to value trading stock, and a sudden one-off increase in tax liability of over $1,500. 6.13 The Government does not favour a higher threshold because the one-off increase in tax liability would be significant, as would the deferred tax revenue. A higher threshold would also increase the effect of understating income and move the tax treatment of trading stock further away from best accounting treatment, thereby increasing compliance costs for businesses that prepare financial accounts. 44 6.14 A threshold based on the change in the value of trading stock is less likely to reduce compliance costs because an accurate valuation of trading stock would need to be done, regardless of whether the adjustment needed to be made or not. 6.15 It might be necessary for the Government to introduce rules to prevent large amounts of stock from being held without ever being subject to an end-of- year valuation. Possible avoidance measures could include: • introducing a requirement that an end-of-year trading stock valuation be done at least once in five years; and • giving Inland Revenue a discretion to direct that an end-of-year trading stock valuation be done. Adjustments for debtors and creditors 6.16 The Government does not consider it worthwhile to introduce measures to significantly reduce the compliance costs of making adjustments for debtors and creditors. Fact Debtors and creditors Trade debts owed to a business must be included as income of that business, and amounts owed by the business are subtracted from income – these are the adjustments for debtors and creditors. 6.17 The compliance costs associated with making adjustments for debtors and creditors arise from the need to identify amounts of income that have been earned by the business but not received, and expenses that have been incurred but not yet paid. Determining whether income has been earned or expenditure incurred is generally not a complex task for a small business, and the calculations to make the adjustments are simple. If a business is owed significantly more than it owes, cash-flow problems can arise because taxable income is significantly larger than cash profit. 6.18 Good business practice dictates that debtors and creditors are monitored. Because it is an essential part of managing liquidity, most small businesses already collect the information that is necessary to make adjustments for debtors and creditors. Relatively few businesses make adjustments for only small amounts of debt and credit. It is doubtful, therefore, whether compliance costs would reduce significantly if a minimum threshold were to be introduced before adjustments needed to be made for debtors and creditors. 45 6.19 Furthermore, allowing some businesses to calculate their income on a cash basis would create opportunities for tax avoidance that could be minimised only by introducing complex rules to prevent a business from calculating tax on a cash basis if an associated party is using an accrual basis. Rules would also be needed to prevent premature recognition of expenses that are actually future expenses. Depreciation 6.20 The Government would like to know how useful it would be to increase the value of assets that can be pooled for depreciation, or be immediately deducted, although purchased from the same supplier at the same time. We are also considering providing businesses with on-line calculation tools to create and maintain accurate depreciation schedules. We do not consider it worthwhile to increase the value of assets that can be immediately deducted. 6.21 The compliance costs associated with depreciation are incurred in identifying and separating out transactions that involve capital and in creating and maintaining a depreciation schedule. The costs associated with the schedule are a function of the number of items in it as well as their nature. Fact Tax deductions for depreciation Depreciable items used in the production of income generate depreciation deductions. The rate of depreciation is determined by the economic life of the item. The rate is increased by 20 percent for most items. Depreciable items worth less than $200 can be treated like normal expenditure and deducted immediately. There is an exception to this rule for goods with the same depreciation rate that are purchased from the same supplier at the same time. 6.22 Raising the threshold for immediate deductibility is not a fiscally viable option in the short term. However, the legislation does provide some relief in that low-value items can be pooled and depreciated together. Individual assets that are worth less than $2,000 or that have an adjusted tax value of less than $2,000 are eligible to be pooled. 6.23 Although pooling does not have the advantage of accurately reflecting the reduction in value of individual items, the trade-off is the lower cost in not having to identify each asset separately for depreciation purposes. If a business chooses to pool property, that property must be pooled for as long as it is owned, and the lowest rate is used if items with different rates are included in the pool. Separate pools may be maintained for different categories of assets. 46 6.24 Raising either of these thresholds would also unfairly advantage businesses that rely on a large number of low-value assets rather than high-value assets. 6.25 The three recommendations made by the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance on depreciation issues were that: • There should be no increase in the threshold for immediate deductibility. • The threshold for immediate deductibility for goods purchased from the same supplier should be increased to $500 (provided that no asset exceeds $200 in value). • The benefits of not having a restriction on the value of assets that can be pooled be evaluated. 6.26 As noted by the committee, the costs and benefits of raising these thresholds cannot be determined without a survey of taxpayers and purchased assets. Over the next few months the Government will conduct a survey on the assets of small businesses to see whether raising these thresholds or extending pooling has the potential to reduce the compliance costs of depreciation calculations. 6.27 Another approach to reducing costs associated with depreciation would be to provide small businesses with easy-to-use electronic calculation tools that would accurately calculate depreciation deductions and, if used, would remove any risk that the calculation was incorrect. Proposals in relation to such tools are discussed in chapter 9. Key question How useful would it be to increase the threshold for pooling, given that it would reduce deductions for depreciation? 47 Chapter 7 BUILDING ON THE TAX SIMPLIFICATION REFORMS FOR WAGE AND SALARY EARNERS 7.1 The 1999 income year was the last year that most wage and salary earners had to file an income tax return. Those who still have to file returns do so because there are no mechanisms for withholding tax on some of their income from employment or because they earn small amounts of income that cannot have tax withheld on it. Furthermore, certain forms, including personal tax summaries, need to be completed by taxpayers who receive family assistance, so their entitlements can be checked against their income. The Government is concerned about the compliance costs imposed on these taxpayers. 7.2 The initiatives outlined in this chapter build on the recent reforms for wage and salary earners by extending the number of taxpayers who do not have to file a tax return and by simplifying the family assistance rules. Extending non-filing for wage and salary earners 7.3 Four measures to increase the number of individuals who are not required to file tax returns have been identified. They are to: • make beneficiaries of trusts eligible not to file; Building on earlier simplification Lower risk of penalties Removing or reducing use-of-money interest Lower risk of accumulating end-of-period debt Easier access to welfare / assistance More equitable tax treatment Less uncertainty in tax treatment More accurate calculation of tax liabilities Fewer forms to fill in / fewer tax calculations Reduced need to communicate with IRD Lower risk of avoidance Salary and wage earners Trusts and executors Beneficiaries of trusts The proposals Extending non-filing eligibility to trust beneficiaries !!!!! Extending PAYE to include employee share benefits !!!!!!! Deceased taxpayers eligible for non-filing !!!!! Threshold for paying tax on non-withheld income !!!!! Paying family tax credits to principal caregiver !!!!!!!! Removing adjustments for family assistance !!!!!! The benefits of the proposalsWho benefits 48 • allow tax on non-cash benefits to be withheld through the PAYE system; • reduce filing requirements for administrators and executors for the estates of deceased taxpayers; and • introduce a $200 threshold for earning income from which tax has not been withheld, below which it is not necessary to file a tax return. Reducing the need for beneficiaries of trusts to file tax returns 7.4 All taxpayers who receive income from trusts are required to file a tax return, regardless of the amount of tax paid by trustees on their behalf. This creates unnecessary compliance costs for beneficiaries of trusts. The Government proposes to remove the need for beneficiaries of trusts to file tax returns if trustees have paid enough tax on their behalf. 7.5 Beneficiaries would need to inform trustees of their marginal tax rate, and would be responsible for determining whether they meet the non-filing criteria. Trustees would be responsible for deducting and paying the tax through their provisional tax payments. Fact How many people receive income from trusts? In the 1998-99 income year at least 57,000 individuals received income from trusts. 7.6 Not all trustees will be able to pay enough tax on behalf of their beneficiaries. However, in practice, a significant proportion of trusts do pay enough tax to meet beneficiaries’ tax liabilities, and this initiative is expected to support current practice. Voluntary withholding on non-cash income from employment 7.7 Some taxpayers who are essentially wage and salary earners receive non- cash income in relation to their employment that has not had tax paid on it or fringe benefit tax applied. One example of this type of income is employee share benefits. 7.8 Receipt of this type of income raises an obligation on the employee to file a tax return. It can also raise an unexpected end-of-year tax liability and, depending on the size of the benefit, exposure to use-of-money interest for the year in which the benefit was received, as well as provisional tax obligations for the following year. 49 7.9 The Government proposes to reduce compliance costs for these taxpayers by allowing their employers to withhold tax on the benefits through the PAYE system at the time the income is earned. The amount of the withholding payment would be calculated in a way similar to the way tax is calculated for extra emoluments – lump-sum payments such as bonuses, redundancy payments and retirement payments. No end-of-year tax liability would arise in relation to that income if sufficient tax were withheld at the time that the benefits are derived. 7.10 Paying withholding tax on the income at the time it is earned, rather than making an end-of-year payment, could mean that tax is paid sooner than it would otherwise be. The option provides taxpayers with an avenue to trade off the advantages of an increased cash-flow against the compliance costs of filing an end-of-year return, and possible exposure to interest and the need to meet provisional tax obligations in the following year. 7.11 Some problems might arise if the employee did not have sufficient cash income to meet the withholding payment. However, we do not expect this to be a significant barrier to using the option because employees and employers have the facility to plan ahead to meet the extra withholding payment. For example, the employee could make a payment to the employer to meet the value of the deduction. 7.12 Problems with valuing some benefits, such as shares in unlisted companies, or determining when the income is received, such as in the sale of options, might prevent accurate withholding on some forms of benefits. In these cases an end-of-year liability or refund might still result. Key question Are there other types of income from which tax could be withheld through the PAYE system to prevent an end-of-year tax liability? Eliminating the need to file tax returns for deceased taxpayers 7.13 Taxpayers who meet the non-filing criteria, those who have had tax correctly deducted at source, are not required to file tax returns. However, this rule does not apply to executors and administrators acting on behalf of deceased taxpayers, who must file a tax return on their behalf. This return is for the year in which the taxpayer died, up to the date of death. Income earned by the estate after the date of death is returned separately. 50 7.14 This means that, although the taxpayer would not have been required to file a return if he or she were alive, a return will have to be filed upon the taxpayer’s death. The Government recognises that this requirement imposes unnecessary compliance costs on the executors of the deceased person’s estate and stress on the family of the deceased person. 7.15 We consider that executors and administrators should be allowed to apply the non-filing criteria in relation to date-of-death returns. Doing so would mean that a trustee or executor of a deceased taxpayer’s estate would file a return only if income was earned that had not had tax correctly withheld. The proposal would not alter deceased taxpayers’ liability – it would only mean that a return did not need to be filed on their behalf. A threshold for paying tax on non-withheld income 7.16 Taxpayers who earn small amounts of income that is subject to the withholding tax rules can take advantage of a $200 gross income threshold before needing to file a tax return. On the other hand, those who earn small amounts of income from which tax has not been withheld are required to file a tax return, regardless of the amount of that income. 7.17 The Government proposes to introduce a similar threshold for earning non- withheld income before it is necessary to file a tax return. For simplicity, we are proposing a $200 (gross) threshold which, when allowable deductions are taken into account, is comparable to the threshold for incorrectly withheld income. 7.18 Only a few taxpayers return small amounts of non-withheld income. This is more likely to be a result of a failure to return small amounts of income than a case of taxpayers not earning small amounts of income. Therefore, although the introduction of the threshold would not reduce compliance costs for taxpayers who are already choosing not to file returns, it would reduce the risks associated with not filing a return, such as being audited by Inland Revenue, and exposure to interest and penalties. Simplifying family assistance 7.19 The family assistance rules have been in existence since 1986. The last significant change to reduce compliance costs occurred in 1991 with the removal of the requirement for employers to pay family assistance credits to employees out of PAYE deductions, and for Inland Revenue to pay family assistance to all non-welfare recipients. 51 Fact Family assistance Family assistance is a package of tax credits that provides financial assistance to families with children. These tax credits are an integral part of the social welfare system, and provided assistance to 300,000 families in the 1999 income year. Family assistance consists of family support, the family tax credit, the child tax credit and the parental tax credit. Family support is the only one of these credits that families receiving a social welfare benefit, New Zealand Superannuation, a student allowance or ACC for more than three months can claim. Family support is normally paid to these families by the Department of Work and Income, along with the other financial assistance they receive from that department. However, once a family’s income reaches $20,000, its family support entitlement begins to abate, and Inland Revenue then takes over payment so that the abated entitlement can be calculated. The other family assistance credits all abate according to family income, and they are always paid by Inland Revenue. They are not available to families that receive a social welfare benefit or New Zealand Superannuation. The child and parental tax credits are not available to a family that receives a student allowance or ACC for more than three months. These credits are designed to encourage movement from welfare to employment by providing financial assistance to low-income working families. 7.20 The Government proposes that the family tax credit entitlement be paid to the principal caregiver in a two-parent family rather than split between the parents, as it is at present. 7.21 The Government also proposes to remove most of the adjustments that are currently required in the calculation of family assistance. This would make the income used to calculate family assistance closer to taxable income and make the calculation of family assistance entitlements simpler. 7.22 The major compliance issues that family assistance presents are: • Families need to fill out application forms at the beginning of the year and declarations at the end, and personal tax summaries are also required for the end-of-year square-up. • The transition from a social welfare benefit to employment is not a smooth process. • The fear of a family assistance debt resulting from the square-up leads families to apply for it either at year-end or not at all, with the result that some families may not receive the family assistance to which they are entitled. 52 7.23 Inland Revenue is already taking steps to address these problems. The family assistance application form and the end-of-year declaration have been redesigned to make them easier to understand. Furthermore, it is no longer necessary to reapply to Inland Revenue for family assistance, since Inland Revenue will send out a statement showing the next year’s entitlement. A family is required to respond only if the details are incorrect. 7.24 Inland Revenue is also considering how families that are being overpaid family assistance can be identified from information contained in employer monthly schedules. A pro-active approach to identifying and contacting these families will help to reduce the likelihood of end-of-year family assistance debts. 7.25 The Government is currently looking at the issues relating to the transition from social welfare benefits to employment, with the aim of smoothing this transitional process. Also being considered is how Inland Revenue and the Department of Work and Income administer family assistance, to see whether their processes impose barriers or costs for people moving off the benefit and, if so, to work towards reducing them. Paying the family tax credit to the principal caregiver 7.26 Paying family tax credits only to the principal caregiver would simplify family assistance because all family assistance would be paid to only one person in the family (the principal caregiver). Only one bank account number would be required, and only one end-of-year declaration would need to be completed. 7.27 Furthermore, the proposed change would make family assistance less complex to administer. The end-of-year square-up for the family tax credit, which has to be done manually because of the complexity added by splitting the entitlement, could be automated. There would also be fewer payments to be made during the year. 7.28 The amount of the entitlement itself would not change. Moving towards a taxable income basis for assessing family assistance entitlement 7.29 The family is the sole source of information for the majority of the adjustments involved in the calculation of family assistance, and a significant portion of this information is not required for the assessment of income tax. Therefore families incur compliance costs in determining whether these adjustments apply to them and, if so, in providing the necessary information. 7.30 The removal of most of the adjustments would reduce the compliance costs for families of determining whether any adjustments are required when applying for family assistance. It would also reduce the risk of overpayments resulting from applying those adjustments incorrectly. 53 7.31 It would also allow further simplification of forms, which currently cover all the adjustments, even though most adjustments apply only to a small number of families. As well, entitlement could be tracked more accurately by using information from the employer monthly schedule. 7.32 The adjustments the Government proposes to remove are as follows: • Exempt income. Certain income that is exempt from income tax is added back for family assistance purposes (excluding scholarships and bursaries). • Income equalisation accounts. Adjustments are made for deposits and refunds to and from income equalisation accounts. • Income spreading. Certain forms of income that are allowed to be spread to future years for tax purposes are included as income in the current year. • Depreciation on buildings . Depreciation claimed on a building is added back to income. • Development expenditure. Certain development expenditure relating to agriculture, farming, forestry, and aquaculture that is deductible for tax purposes is added back to income. • Scholarships and bursaries. Scholarships and bursaries are added back to income. 7.33 Adjustments that are not considered suitable for removal, either because they are anti-avoidance measures or because their removal could result in a significant mismeasurement of income, are as follows: • Child support and maintenance. A deduction is allowed for child support or maintenance payments made, and child support or maintenance payments received are added back to income. • Losses. Losses from qualifying companies and current-year business losses are excluded from the calculation of income. • Earnings from a close company. Earnings from a close company are attributed to a taxpayer for family assistance purposes in proportion to his or her shareholding in the company, so as to ensure that dividends are not withheld in order to reduce family income. • Distributions from a superannuation fund. Distributions from a superannuation fund are included in income if the employer has made contributions within the last two years and the taxpayer is still employed by that employer. 54 7.34 Removing the adjustments would affect the entitlements of some families. Most of them would have their income for family assistance purposes reduced and would, therefore, have a slightly higher entitlement to family assistance. On the other hand, some families would have their income for family assistance purposes increased and would, therefore, have a reduced entitlement. The number of families in this category is expected to be small. Some families could also have reduced entitlements in some periods but increased entitlements in others. 55 Chapter 8 SIMPLIFYING OTHER AREAS OF TAX 8.1 A number of other areas in the tax system could also be simplified. They include certain aspects of the international tax rules, the resident withholding tax rules and the imputation rules. Non-resident contractors’ withholding tax rules 8.2 The Government believes that the non-resident contractors’ withholding tax (NRCWT) rules can be simplified by: • introducing an exemption for most short-term contracts; and • not applying penalties in circumstances when employers have exercised reasonable care, but have still failed to comply. 8.3 The Government is concerned that the process for applying for exemption from NRCWT may create unnecessary compliance costs in cases where it is later confirmed by Inland Revenue that no tax liability existed in the first place. The Government is also concerned that the employer is required to withhold NRCWT regardless of whether the non-resident contractor is eventually held liable for the tax. Other areas of tax Lower risk of penalties Removing or reducing use-of-money interest Lower risk of accumulating end-of-period debt More equitable tax treatment Less uncertainty in tax treatment Fewer forms to fill in / fewer tax calculations Reduced need to communicate with IRD Lower risk of avoidance Lower intermediary costs Small businesses Medium to large businesses Employers Banks and other intermediaries Non-resident contractors The proposals NRCWT exemption threshold !!!!!!!!!!!! Restriction of NRCWT penalties !!!!!!!! Alternatives for communicating RWT information !! Increasing threshold for RWT notification !! Removing redundant ICA refund forms !!!! The benefits of the proposalsWho benefits 56 Fact Non-resident contractors’ withholding tax Since 1982, contract payments made to non-resident contractors have been subject to a 15% withholding tax under the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979. This is known as the non-resident contractors’ withholding tax (NRCWT). This has been an extremely successful measure for countering non-compliance by a mobile group of workers who, in the past, often left the country without meeting their tax obligations. It has also been very successful in ensuring that non-resident contractors register for other types of tax, such as PAYE. If the non-resident contractor or the person making payments to the contractor wish to be exempt from the rules they must apply to Inland Revenue for a certificate of exemption. Exemption threshold 8.4 Short-term contract activities are usually exempt from tax in New Zealand under our double tax agreements with other countries (agreements between countries to prevent taxpayers being taxed in both countries on the same income). Therefore the requirement that a certificate of exemption be obtained in relation to such activities normally has little benefit. 8.5 Some employers ignore the law to overcome the administrative burden of obtaining a certificate of exemption, with the consequence that they will face penalties for failure to comply. 8.6 The Government proposes to remove the need to apply for an exemption for non-resident contractors from countries with whom New Zealand has a double tax agreement if they are present in New Zealand for less than 62 days. 8.7 Employers who were unsure as to whether an exemption would be appropriate could still make the usual application to Inland Revenue. Restricting penalties 8.8 Although a non-resident contractor may initially not be subject to NRCWT, subsequent events might result in a tax liability arising. This can occur, for instance, when the non-resident is present in New Zealand for a longer period of time than initially expected, or if he or she creates a permanent establishment in New Zealand. 8.9 In these cases, employers who do not withhold NRCWT from the beginning of the contract will face penalties. The result is that employers genuinely endeavouring to comply with the law could be penalised. 57 8.10 The Government proposes to prevent penalties from applying if an employer exercises reasonable care in determining that a non-resident contractor was not initially subject to NRCWT, and it later transpired (through an unforeseen circumstance) that NRCWT should have been deducted. 8.11 The employer would, however, be required to make a catch-up payment for the NRCWT that should have been deducted, and to do so within, say, 30 days of the change in circumstances that caused the NRCWT liability to arise. Use-of-money interest would still apply from the original due date. Employer assessment of NRCWT 8.12 The Government is also considering whether an NRCWT liability could be assessed by employers instead of Inland Revenue. The employer would determine whether NRCWT should be deducted from contract payments made to the non-resident contractor. The Government will consult further on this proposal with New Zealand employers who frequently apply for certificates of exemption from NRCWT. Key questions Would the introduction of an exemption for short-term contracts reduce compliance costs? Would the proposed 62-day exemption threshold be appropriate? Would moving the NRCWT rules to a form of self-assessment reduce compliance costs? Resident withholding tax certificates 8.13 The Government proposes to: • allow interest payers more flexibility in the way they communicate information about resident withholding tax (RWT) to interest earners; and • increase the exemption threshold for notification from $20 to $50. 8.14 Banks, financial institutions and other interest payers deduct RWT each time interest is credited to taxpayers’ bank accounts. When more than $20 in interest is earned, interest payers send interest earners a RWT deduction certificate showing the amount of interest deducted for tax purposes. 8.15 Legislative requirements on how this information is communicated to interest earners have not kept up with changes in the banking industry. 58 More flexibility in communicating RWT information 8.16 Alternative means of communicating RWT information could include: • printing it on bank statements; • sending the details by e-mail or fax; or • making it available on bank web sites. 8.17 Neither the type of information provided nor the time by which it must be provided would change. Increasing the exemption threshold 8.18 The threshold for notification would be raised from $20 to $50. Earners of interest of less than $50 would be eligible to receive a RWT certificate if they requested it. 8.19 Although this change could lead to additional compliance costs for certain interest payers, experience with the $20 threshold suggests that the additional compliance costs imposed as a whole on interest earners would be minimal. Key questions What alternative means of communicating RWT information would be suitable? Should the interest threshold below which interest payers do not have to notify taxpayers of the amount of RWT deducted be raised from $20 to $50? Imputation credit account refund process 8.20 It is proposed to remove the requirement to file an interim IR4J form so that imputation credit account credits can be refunded faster and at less cost. 8.21 The dividend imputation system allows companies to pass on to their shareholders credits for income tax they have paid in New Zealand. Tax credits available for transfer are recorded in the company’s imputation credit account. 8.22 Companies occasionally find that they are eligible for a refund of tax for which credits have already been passed to shareholders. When that occurs, the refund is limited to the amount of the credit balance in the imputation credit account at the end of the year to which the refund relates. 8.23 Companies must file an imputation return at the end of the year, either on an IR4J form or as part of a company income tax return form (IR4). 59 8.24 Despite filing an IR4J or IR4 form, if a company applies for a refund and Inland Revenue has not processed the return, the company must file an interim IR4J form. This is to prevent refunds exceeding the credit balance in the imputation credit account as at the previous 31 March. 8.25 The requirement to file an interim return creates unnecessary compliance costs. Imputation accounts with a debit balance attract a penalty of 10% of the debit. This penalty is sufficient discouragement to prevent companies applying for refunds in excess of their balance. 60 Chapter 9 THE ROLE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 9.1 One of the key sources of compliance costs for businesses is the time and effort involved in communicating with Inland Revenue, whether by way of tax return or by telephone. Complex and difficult communication imposes time and money costs on taxpayers, diverting resources which could be used for more profitable activities. 9.2 Another source of compliance costs is the complexity of tax calculations. Complex calculations are sources of error which leave taxpayers exposed to the risk of penalties. 9.3 This chapter discusses ways in which advances in information technology can help make communication with Inland Revenue and calculations simpler. It also outlines how Inland Revenue is using recent developments in information technology to improve administration of the tax system. Recent initiatives 9.4 Information technology provides new opportunities for tax simplification in areas such as the calculation of tax owing, filing tax returns and making payments. In turn, being able to modify these obligations presents opportunities for the removal of some of the tax risks faced by businesses. 9.5 Information technology can reduce transaction costs, including those associated with payment of tax. For example, in place of large, infrequent payments of tax, businesses could make smaller, more frequent payments without an increase in cost.

The benefits Who benefits 61 9.6 Inland Revenue is committed to expanding its use of information technology to reduce compliance costs. A number of initiatives are under way. Improved access to information for taxpayers 9.7 Taxpayers are able to gain access to information electronically. The service includes tax forms sent to agents on CD-ROM and Inland Revenue’s automated telephone service, INFOexpress, which allows secure access to personal information using a PIN number. 9.8 Both tax technical information and administrative information are available on Inland Revenue’s web site (www.ird.govt.nz). Inland Revenue is also working with the State Services Commission’s e-Government unit towards providing all forms on-line. Improved use of information by Inland Revenue 9.9 Inland Revenue is also using information technology to improve the internal use of information. Information is being standardised to increase consistency in responses to taxpayer inquiries. Information technology at call centres helps to allocate enquiries to staff best able to provide an answer. 9.10 Through the use of a data warehouse, common taxpayer errors and misunderstandings can be identified. This information can then be used to better target education and written material to help taxpayers meet their obligations. Methods of payment available to taxpayers 9.11 Customers of WestpacTrust can make tax payments electronically through the WestpacTrust Bank web site. Meetings with each of the major banks and the Bankers’ Association will be held over the next three months to encourage other banks to provide a similar service. Customers will be able to link to this service via the Inland Revenue web site or through their bank web site when they are paying other bills. It is possible that additional trading banks will be offering this option by the end of the year. 9.12 Inland Revenue is taking a lead role in the State Services Commission’s e-Government project to introduce electronic billing and payment options across Government agencies. Electronic filing 9.13 Employers are able to file employer monthly schedules electronically using Inland Revenue’s ir-File system. They can either submit their monthly PAYE schedules electronically to a secure web site or allow Inland Revenue to upload the data. Once a schedule is submitted by the employer, a receipt is provided and the data is transferred to Inland Revenue’s main processing system. 62 9.14 The ir-File system eliminates the need for employers to complete paper returns and provides timely feedback to employers if there are omissions or errors. 9.15 Since the early 1990s, tax agents have been able to file income tax returns electronically on behalf of their clients. Fact Electronic filing of tax returns There are approximately 160,000 employers in New Zealand. About 10,000 employers are required by law to file their PAYE details electronically, and another 2,500 employers use the ir-File system voluntarily. Inland Revenue is making improvements to the system and projects growth of 10 percent a year in the number of participating employers. Inland Revenue receives about 750,000 tax returns electronically each year from agents. Inland Revenue’s e-business programme 9.16 Inland Revenue is developing a long-term strategy for increasing taxpayer services through the Internet. It will be flexible to accommodate changes both in available technology and in taxpayer needs. The first step is to revamp the existing Inland Revenue web site to make it more user-friendly. This will be completed by July 2001. The next step is provision of “look-up” services and calculators, due for completion over the next twelve months. 9.17 A key, long term benefit of this work may be to allow taxpayers to have access to their personal information on-line. Future opportunities Reducing risk through electronic technology 9.18 It may be possible for Inland Revenue to provide on-line tools to calculate tax, such as a depreciation calculator allowing taxpayers to create and maintain a depreciation schedule. Another example would be a tool to calculate fringe benefit tax. Businesses would enter basic information about their assets or fringe benefits into the calculator, which would work out the tax result. Inland Revenue would be responsible for the accuracy of the calculation, while taxpayers would remain responsible for the information they provide. 63 9.19 Thus the role of taxpayers would change to one of gathering source data, rather than having to invest large amounts of time in carrying out the calculations themselves. 9.20 Information technology could also allow Inland Revenue to remind taxpayers automatically of upcoming due dates, which would help reduce the risk of forgetting a payment or return due date. 9.21 Another key way that information technology can reduce risk is that tax errors could be identified promptly because information provided electronically can be processed quickly. Earlier notification to businesses would mean that mistakes which would otherwise lead to tax shortfalls and penalties could be rectified. These benefits in turn would build taxpayer certainty and assurance. Improving communication with Inland Revenue 9.22 Information technology also provides more flexible ways for taxpayers and Inland Revenue to talk to each other. 9.23 Information technology will also enable businesses to gain access to information more easily. For example, they will be able to search Inland Revenue’s technical databases using plain English, as well as easily gaining access to tax technical information relating to their type of business. 9.24 Over time, information technology could give businesses the ability to update their records, check and alter transactions, and control the format and frequency of information sent to them by Inland Revenue. As if they were using an Internet banking service, businesses should be able to track their tax payments, confirm or request messages from Inland Revenue, and review statements tailored to their needs. 9.25 Electronic communication also allows the tax administration to be more flexible. Automated telephone services and Internet sites can be operated 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In the future, Inland Revenue may, therefore, be able to meet all but the most complex needs of taxpayers at any time convenient to the taxpayer. Customisation and flexibility 9.26 Businesses have different needs and different information requirements. Information technology allows customisation of the environment in which taxpayers and Inland Revenue interact. 9.27 Another benefit of customisation is that the information sent to businesses by Inland Revenue could be better tailored to the individual needs of the business. For instance, if an adjustment is found to be incorrect, Inland Revenue could send the business information on how to make the calculation correctly. 64 9.28 The return process has traditionally driven the tax system. Its inflexibility reflects the needs of the tax system rather than taxpayers’ needs. For example, an arbitrary period for filing tax returns is not convenient for all taxpayers. Arbitrary due dates for payment of tax creates similar problems. With the help of information technology, it may be possible for businesses to file tax returns at times more convenient to them – for example, some businesses may prefer to provide tax payment and information on a weekly rather than monthly basis. Key questions How could information technology be used to: • help small businesses calculate their tax? • make tax payments easier? • reduce the need for small businesses to contact Inland Revenue? • customise their relationship with Inland Revenue? 65 Chapter 10 INLAND REVENUE’S ADMINISTRATIVE IMPROVEMENTS 10.1 Although the Government can change the legislation to reduce risk for businesses, reducing taxpayer contact and simplifying any remaining contact requires improvement in administrative systems. For this reason, Inland Revenue has a long-term, continuing commitment to simplifying the tax system and reducing compliance costs for taxpayers. 10.2 Designing and implementing simplification measures, from large initiatives such as administering the removal of the need for wage and salary earners to file tax returns to small day-to-day projects such as updating forms, is a key and continuing focus for Inland Revenue. It is also a primary consideration when designing the information technology systems that underpin Inland Revenue’s work. This chapter discusses: • Inland Revenue’s approach to simplifying the tax system for small businesses; and • proposed modifications to the support services for small businesses that it already provides. Administrative strategy for reducing compliance costs 10.3 Inland Revenue’s strategy for simplifying the tax system for small businesses has three objectives. They are to: • minimise the administrative obligations imposed on small businesses; • help businesses understand their tax obligations; and Administrative improvements Lower risk of penalties Removing or reducing use-of-money interest Lower risk of accumulating end-of-period debt Easier access to welfare / assistance Less uncertainty in tax treatment More accurate calculation of tax liabilities Fewer forms to fill in / fewer tax calculations Reduced need to communicate with IRD Easier and more flexible access to tax affairs More qualitative information Lower risk of avoidance Small businesses Medium to large businesses Employers Salary and wage earners Banks and other intermediaries The proposals Advisory service for small businesses !!!!!!!!!! Electronic filing of PAYE returns !!!!!!!!! Telephone service !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Forms and notices !!!!!!!!!!!! The benefits of the proposalsWho benefits 66 • help businesses to ensure that they have appropriate procedures in place to help them to comply with their obligations. 10.4 These objectives reflect Inland Revenue’s role of maximising voluntary compliance by taxpayers, which involves both support and enforcement. Changes to the way that businesses are supported 10.5 Inland Revenue is considering changes to its small business advisory service and its business call centres, to better target their resources. It also plans to promote electronic filing of returns and to make forms, statements, and brochures easier to understand. Advisory services 10.6 The main way that Inland Revenue provides small businesses with information and advice is through brochures and newsletters. For example, employers receive a monthly newsletter, the Payroll News , informing them of changes in PAYE, specified superannuation contribution withholding tax and fringe benefit tax. Payroll News also provides answers to frequently asked questions and gives information on new customer services. 10.7 In recognition that new businesses need extra assistance to make sure they start out on the right foot in their tax affairs, Inland Revenue also provides them with a free information and advisory service – the Business Tax Information Advisory Service. The service generally provides advice on keeping records, filing returns, and meeting tax payment requirements, although it can include more specific advice, such as how to treat a specific GST transaction. 10.8 Inland Revenue has 57 specialised staff providing advisory services, and in the 2000-01 year they will make around 22,300 advisory visits and conduct over 300 education seminars. Part of the service is delivered by Mäori Community Officers, who focus on the needs of Mäori groups. 10.9 The business tax advisory services are generally carried out as a one-on-one interview and can be done at the business’s premises. Inland Revenue also provides general advice from time to time in the form of seminars. Businesses have the choice of requesting an advisory visit when they first register for GST or, as an employer, or at any time following registration. Fact Inland Revenue’s advisory service More information on the advisory service can be found at www.ird.govt.nz/sitemap/business/newbusiness/smartbusiness-taxhelp 67 10.10 The role of the advisory service is to provide assistance with meeting tax obligations, with a view to improving voluntary compliance. The advisory service does not provide general business advice. It would not be appropriate for Inland Revenue to become involved in that function, which is currently provided by third parties. Smart business kit 10.11 An important resource available to small businesses is the Smart Business Kit . It is the core package on which the advisory service is based and is the result of significant effort. It is made up of a video and booklets and is regularly updated on the basis of feedback supplied by staff who make advisory visits and by other Inland Revenue staff. 10.12 Inland Revenue started from scratch with the goal of putting in one place both information about a new business’s tax obligations and advice on simple book-keeping and record-keeping systems, such as a cashbook, that taxpayers can use to meet those obligations. The care taken in preparing the kit is evident in such small things as providing sticky labels for taxpayers to add to their existing calendar to remind them of their obligations, rather than simply providing a separate calendar which may not get used. Mäori Community Officers 10.13 Most Inland Revenue offices have an officer who can assist Mäori organisations (including new or existing businesses, Mäori authorities, kohanga reo and individuals) with their tax obligations. The goal of this service is increasing the understanding of tax obligations and compliance with those obligations within the Mäori community and Mäori organisations through the establishment of liaison networks and organisational relationships. Expansion of advisory services 10.14 Inland Revenue is considering a number of changes to the advisory service to improve the information provided and to ensure that each business receives advice that is appropriate to its needs, and at the most useful time. 10.15 The emphasis will be on providing information and support as early as possible in the business’s life cycle. This is because many businesses fail in the first two years of their operation. Providing services early reduces the risk of non-compliance and the risk that a business fails because of tax requirements. 10.16 This approach is seen as more likely to reduce compliance costs on a new business and, importantly, the high level of stress associated with being a new business. 68 Providing information to other agencies 10.17 Inland Revenue will increase its liaison with other agencies that interact with potential new businesses (for example, banks, enterprise agencies and trade associations) and provide them with basic taxation information for the benefit of their clients. The information could include pamphlets or fact sheets giving a brief overview of taxation requirements, the process to follow and how to contact Inland Revenue. An advisory visit could be provided if businesses request one before registration. 10.18 Inland Revenue intends to highlight other advisory services available within the locality of the business, such as BIZinfo, tax agents, software developers, and mentoring services. To achieve this the relationships between Inland Revenue and these agencies would need to be strengthened. Key questions Would it be useful for Inland Revenue to make contact with small businesses before they start up? How useful would this approach be? How should prospective businesses who are to be offered this service be selected? Visits targeted at those who will benefit most 10.19 As a way of improving its advisory services, Inland Revenue is considering targeting them at taxpayers most at risk of failing to meet their tax obligations. This would involve Inland Revenue contacting by telephone those businesses registering for GST or becoming an employer, to assess whether a visit is required, rather than waiting for businesses to request a visit. The type of information gained from these calls could include whether the business: • has received advice from an accountant on tax issues; • is aware of its tax obligations; and • will be using technology-based or paper-based systems. (Technology- based systems have advantages, as described later, and many Inland Revenue forms, booklets and sources of advice are available on-line.) 10.20 That information would be used to tailor the advisory visit, should one be necessary. 69 Follow-up visits 10.21 Although the number of advisory visits currently provided varies from business to business, a structured, more effectively targeted approach to follow-up visits could result in significant benefits. A possible process would be as follows: • The first visit would occur after registration and would provide some basic tools and assistance. • The second visit would generally occur at the time the first return is required, and assistance would be given to fill in the return. • The third visit would either be at the request of the business or when a business defaults on filing a return or paying tax. If a subsequent default occurred the business would be advised to obtain professional help in the form of a payroll intermediary, an accountant or a mentoring service. Working with other government agencies 10.22 Inland Revenue is only one of a number of government agencies that place compliance costs on small businesses. Others include Customs New Zealand, the ACC, the Department of Labour and Statistics New Zealand. There could be benefits in providing small businesses with advice on a range of compliance issues that affect them. This could be handled jointly by a number of government agencies or by one department contracting work for other agencies. An across-government approach would be required for either delivery mechanism. 10.23 The Government acknowledges that such a liaison would be complex and that other organisations, such as small business advisers and the NZ Chambers of Commerce, already fulfil some of this function. Key questions How useful would a collaborative approach across several government agencies be to small businesses? What would be the most useful way to deliver the service? Electronic filing for employers 10.24 The ir-File service, launched in April 1999, enables employers to file their employer monthly schedules electronically to Inland Revenue via the internet. The schedule, filed monthly by all employers, contains details of employees’ gross wages, PAYE deducted and any deductions of child support and student loans. 70 10.25 In February 2001, Inland Revenue introduced an enhanced ir-File service which is more flexible, easier and faster to use and more responsive. It provides a more efficient helpdesk service by introducing on-line help screens to complement the existing 0800 telephone service. 10.26 Inland Revenue will be marketing the ir-File system during 2001 to encourage smaller employers to use it, since electronic filing has the potential to reduce their costs. A particular focus will be encouraging tax agents and their clients to use the system. Telephone services 10.27 Over the last five years Inland Revenue has increasingly encouraged taxpayers to contact it by telephone. It is generally accepted that using the telephone is the most cost-effective and convenient way to contact the department. Even so, although Inland Revenue is handling greater telephone volumes than ever before, demand still regularly exceeds capacity. 10.28 As a result, Inland Revenue has analysed the performance of its call centres and has identified three key factors that have caused problems: • Call volumes have been greater than expected. Inland Revenue did not fully appreciate the level of demand in the first year of operation of its call centres, particularly the impact on the number of calls arising from the implementation of the tax simplification reforms for wage and salary earners. • The average length of business calls has been longer than predicted. In the planning phase of the call centre development there was little information available to enable the department to predict accurately the average length of business calls. In reality, the average length of business calls in the first year was about twice what was expected. • Staff turnover at the business call centre has been much higher than anticipated. 10.29 As a result of this analysis, it is clear that more work is required to lift the level of service to an acceptable standard. The department has implemented several measures that will improve the service in the short term: • Other, smaller call centres were established around the country for a period of around 12 months. • A more flexible approach to allocating staff was implemented, so more people are available to answer the telephone at times of greatest need. This has involved setting new balances between the requirements of call management and the service and processing centres. 71 • The department is improving its capacity for forecasting and planning of call peak demands, which will help to ensure that the right number of staff are available to answer the telephones when needed. Accurately predicting demand is complex, requiring the close collaboration of many parts of Inland Revenue, including segment design, processing, information technology and service centres. The day-to-day work of these groups can significantly influence the volume and timing of calls. 10.30 For the medium term, Inland Revenue’s structure for handling calls, which was designed in 1998 before the tax simplification reforms took effect, is being reviewed. This project, which started in December 2000, is reviewing the set-up, resourcing and workflow, and the performance of the call centres. 10.31 The project will consider the optimum design for call management in Inland Revenue, having regard to the emerging understanding of taxpayer requirements in the wake of tax simplification for salary and wage earners, and the investment made in the call centres to date. The project will present its findings shortly, and the implementation of the recommendations is expected to result in further improvements to service over the next 18 months. Forms and notices 10.32 Inland Revenue recognises that the accuracy and readability of the forms, statements and brochures it produces needs to be improved. Work to improve the form and content of these documents is continuous, and most recently highlighted by the new documents produced for the tax reforms for wage and salary earners. 10.33 Inland Revenue will also be improving its capacity to reflect changing customer requirements, and plans to make progressive changes to the “look and feel” of its forms and statements over the next 12 months. 72 73 Appendix 1 TAX SIMPLIFICATION IN OTHER COUNTRIES Australian tax simplification measures Major changes to the Australian tax system were introduced on 1 July 2000. Some of the main changes are: • the introduction of GST, the removal of wholesale sales taxes and reductions in income tax rates; • increases in family payments, pensions and allowances; • the introduction of PAYG (“Pay As You Go”) – an integrated system for reporting and paying withholding amounts and tax on investment income; and • the introduction of the Australian Business Number (“ABN”), a single number for all business communications with the Australian Tax Office, and the Business Activity Statement (“BAS”), a single form for reporting most business tax entitlements and obligations. Measures that aim to reduce compliance costs for small businesses (those with a turnover of less than $1million) have also been introduced. These are: • allowing assets costing less than $1,000 to be written off rather than depreciated; • allowing pooling of other depreciable assets with an economic life of less than 25 years and a depreciation rate of 30% for those assets; • allowing income to be calculated on a modified “cash accounting” basis rather than on an “accruals” basis; and • removing the need to make adjustments to income tax calculations for trading stock valued at less than $5,000. Australia is also rewriting its tax legislation, although it has a low priority given the scale and importance of the recent reforms. United States tax simplification measures In the United States, most of the reform effort in federal taxation is being put into initiatives to restructure the Internal Revenue Service into teams focused on different classes of taxpayer, and to improve its public relations and customer service. The Internal Revenue Service Restructuring Act of 1998 requires the Secretary of the Treasury to implement a return-free system for appropriate individuals by 2007. The Internal Revenue Service is working with other federal and state agencies under the Simplified Tax and Wage Reporting System initiative, with the aims of improving customer service, establishing a Harmonised Wage Code database and developing a pilot for single-point filing of federal and state employment returns. 74 United Kingdom tax simplification measures In the United Kingdom, the requirement to file income tax returns has been removed for most employees. As in New Zealand, employees normally have income tax deducted at source. Taxpayers who are liable for the higher tax rate (40%) and those who have more complex tax affairs are still required to file returns, but a number of measures have been adopted to make filing and payment easier: • The relevant forms have been simplified. • Income tax, VAT and PAYE returns, as well as various other forms, can now be filed electronically, and Inland Revenue is offering discounts to encourage electronic filing. • Payment options using direct credits, debit cards, telephone-based banking and internet-based banking are being developed. The number of non-filing taxpayers is also to be increased by the raising of the threshold for minor sources of income that PAYE taxpayers are allowed to earn before being required to file a return. A rewrite of the United Kingdom’s tax legislation into clearer, simpler language has been under way since 1996. The project team has issued various discussion documents, and the first bill effecting the rewritten legislation was introduced into Parliament in January. Further reforms include a joint four-year research programme with Customs into business compliance costs and a £30 million Government investment over the next two years in helping new businesses to ensure their payroll systems are robust and reliable. The payroll initiative will be supported by doubling the size of the Inland Revenue Business Support Teams and offering a payroll support service through the Inland Revenue telephone helpline. Canadian tax simplification measures In 1999 the Canadian Government set itself the goal of becoming a model user of information technology and the internet by 2004. The Canadian Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA) has produced a Strategy for Electronic Service Delivery outlining its plan to create a variety of secure, automated, self-service channels to enable taxpayers to meet their tax and custom’s obligations. The CCRA already has an on-line presence and offers electronic registration for filing of GST returns, electronic filing of individual tax returns and a telephone-based information system where taxpayers can find out both general information and personal details such as the status of a tax refund they are waiting for. The CCRA also allows certain forms of electronic payment, such as direct credits and payment by credit card. A review of corporate tax has been announced. It is expected to take five years and will focus on client service and e-commerce. 75 Appendix 2 USE-OF-MONEY INTEREST COMPARED WITH COMMERCIAL RATES Figure 6 shows that the interest rate on underpayments of tax is less than that charged for similar unsecured borrowing by way of credit card and that charged for similar unsecured personal and small business borrowing.

They also enable errors to be picked up as they occur, rather than waiting until the end of the year to reconcile. Employer monthly schedules have eliminated the annual reconciliation process and the preparation of IR12 and IR13 forms, which caused considerable stress and anxiety, especially for larger employers. Most employers’ preference for the present system of employer monthly schedules is shown in figure 7. F IGURE 7: E MPLOYER P REFERENCES F OR P RESENT S YSTEM O F E MPLOYER M ONTHLY S CHEDULES Most employers consider the new system either just as easy or easier than the previous system.

Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 1 OVERVIEW STATUS OF THIS DOCUMENT This exposure draft has been prepared by the project team responsible for rewriting New Zealand’s Income Tax Act 1994. It contains a full rewrite of Parts A to E of the Act, together with some provisions from other Parts that we consider should be brought into this framework or are consequential changes that need to be done at the same time. Public submissions are invited on this work, with the closing date for submissions being 30 November 2001. Submissions should be made to: The Rewrite Project Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON. The electronic address is policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz Please note submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with the Act. If you feel any part of your submission could be properly withheld under the Act (for example, for reasons of privacy), please indicate this clearly in your submission. We are rewriting the law as it currently stands. 1 Changes to the law, other than minor ones in the interests of clarity or simplicity, will continue to be handled through the normal legislative programme. The presence or absence of provisions in the rewritten legislation does not indicate any future change in tax policy. The exceptions to this approach have already been subject to public scrutiny through discussion documents and issues papers. For example, the August 1998 discussion document Legislating for self- assessment of tax liability proposed the removal of various discretions given to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and, when appropriate, their replacement with a set of criteria. The draft incorporates this change. 2 1 The draft includes all changes resulting from taxation amendment Acts up to, and including, the Taxation (Beneficiary Income of Minors, Services-Related Payments and Remedial Matters) Act 2001, which came into force on 27 March 2001. 2 For the full implications of self-assessment, see the Taxation (Annual Rates, Taxpayer Assessment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, introduced in April 2001. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 2 HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT This document is in 3 volumes. Volume 1 provides an overview and is divided into 5 chapters. Chapter 1 provides a background on the rewriting of the Income Tax Act. Chapter 2 outlines some important aspects of our approach to the work. Chapter 3 provides a background on the proposed structure of the rewritten Parts C, D, and E of the Act and the interaction of Parts A and B (the core provisions) with other key rules such as timing. Chapter 4 summarises the proposed rewrite changes. These are minor changes that are intended to improve the legislation. They fall into 4 main types: • changes in approach or concepts but not in underlying law; • changes to the law and policy; • changes to the law but not to policy (such as when the law does not reflect policy); and • removal of unnecessary material. Rather than present the changes according to these categories, however, we have presented them according to subject matter. So, for example, the changes in relation to dividends are presented with a background on dividends. This provides a lead-in to the detailed legislation and commentary in the next volume. Chapter 5 presents further notes on the drafting of the rewritten provisions. Volume 2 contains the rewritten Parts A to E, together with detailed commentary. The commentary is provided in boxes below each draft section. Also in each box is a list of the defined terms used in the section as well as the equivalent current legislative reference. Volume 3 contains: • the consequential amendments to the definitions in section OB 1; • notes on the consequential amendments to the rest of the Act; • a summary of the cross-references in a table of destinations; and • a table identifying which of the current Z provisions have been rewritten. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 3 CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION Background New Zealand’s Income Tax Act is a very old piece of legislation, dating back to 1891. In the intervening period the Act has expanded significantly to become a more comprehensive measure of income and to reflect the changing nature of business in New Zealand. The Act had been recast on several occasions but not until the 1990s was it comprehensively reviewed from a fundamental structural and presentational perspective. Over the past decade various reports and papers have discussed the rewriting of the Income Tax Act. There have been reports by 3 bodies – the Consultative Committee on the Taxation of Income from Capital (the Valabh Committee), the Working Party on the Reorganisation of the Income Tax Act 1976, and the Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department – as well as government discussion papers and issues papers prepared by government officials. The first significant report was that of the Valabh Committee in 1990. The committee highlighted various weaknesses in the numbering, formatting and reorganisation of the legislation, including: • the core provisions not being properly integrated with each other and the rest of the Act; • the scheme and purpose being difficult to discern; • the structure of the Act and the ordering of its sections not being logical; • the organisation not adequately reflecting the Act’s role, that role being to quantify taxable income, to impose the tax liability on that income and to set out the process of assessment and collection; and • inconsistent drafting styles, redundant wording, cumbersome sections, and repetitive provisions. To resolve these problems the Valabh Committee proposed: • the division of the existing legislation into separate Acts; • the division of those Acts into parts and subparts; • the reorganisation of the legislation into a more logical and coherent scheme; • the consolidation of certain legislation; Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 4 • the use of purpose clauses and extra-statutory references; and • a commitment to modern drafting techniques and to plain language. Following on from the recommendations of the Valabh Committee, the Working Party on the Reorganisation of the Income Tax Act recommended in 1993 that the Act be reordered, reorganised and progressively rewritten. The report of the Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department in 1994 also supported the rewriting of the Act. Some of these recommendations have been implemented. The substantive reordering of the Income Tax Act 1976 and the Inland Revenue Department Act 1974 was completed in 1994. This produced the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. New core provisions for the Income Tax Act 1994 were enacted in 1996, with effect from the 1997-98 year. As a result, the Income Tax Act is now organised by parts based around a set of core provisions under an alphanumeric numbering system, there has been some consolidation of material by topic, and the definitions have been brought together in one section. Work over the last few years has focussed on refining the new structure and progressively redrafting Parts A to E of the Act using plain language techniques. The exercise began in 1997 and has now reached the exposure draft stage. During that time, the following documents have been issued for discussion: • a discussion document on the possible structure and content of Parts C, D, and E and their relationship to the new core provisions (published in September 1997); and • two issues papers identifying policy issues that had arisen in the course of rewriting (published in March 1998 and June 1998). New Zealand has not been alone in seeing the need for rewriting its tax legislation. Similar rewrites have begun in Australia and the United Kingdom. Our purpose The key aim of the rewrite is to produce tax legislation that is clear, uses plain language and is structurally consistent. Rewriting the Income Tax Act has always been seen as integral to increasing voluntary compliance with the tax laws. This is because legislation that is clear, uses plain language and is structurally consistent should make it easier for taxpayers to identify and comply with their income tax obligations. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 5 Tax laws that are easier to understand reduce compliance costs for taxpayers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue in the following ways: • Lower compliance costs. There should be less need for taxpayers to seek expert advice and, when advice is sought, the cost should be less. Fewer disputes should need to be resolved by litigation and, when litigation is necessary, the cost of the legal process should be less. There should also be less likelihood of economically desirable transactions not proceeding because of uncertainty about tax implications. • Lower administrative costs. It should be easier for Inland Revenue to interpret the law and collect income tax. We will have succeeded if: • The rewritten legislation is accepted by all main users as clearer and easier to apply and as preserving the effect of the present legislation, apart from the agreed changes in policy. • The lessons learnt from rewriting the legislation are used as a best practice guide for future tax legislation. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 7 CHAPTER 2: MAIN FEATURES OF THE REWRITE PROJECT Project structure The Rewrite is run on project lines. Our project team comprises law drafters, policy analysts, and a tax professional who has been contracted from the private sector. The Parliamentary Counsel Office has also been involved in drafting some of the legislation. The project has been overseen by an advisory panel chaired by Mr Colin Blair. In addition to the independent chair, the panel comprises one representative each from the New Zealand Law Society, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, the Treasury and Inland Revenue. The panel’s core functions have been to ensure that a procedure is in place to identify any policy issues that might arise (and to refer them to Ministers with relevant comments) and to act as a ‘steering committee’ to monitor progress and adherence to agreed processes. The advisory panel has met on an ‘as needs’ basis. Consultation Consistent with New Zealand’s generic tax policy process, we are committed to proceeding with our work on the basis of full consultation at every stage. 3 As drafts of segments have been completed they have been referred to the advisory panel for comment. Also in the lead-up to public consultation, we have subjected the drafts to quality assurance by seeking feedback from specialists both within and outside the Inland Revenue Department. Following consideration of submissions on the exposure draft, we will put together a tax bill specifically for the rewritten legislation. Interested parties will have another opportunity to comment as the bill goes through the parliamentary process. Techniques We use a number of techniques when rewriting the legislation. These are all different ways of meeting our paramount objective of making the legislation easier for the reader to understand, while preserving its technical accuracy. The rewrite cannot, however, eliminate all the complexity and inconsistency 3 The generic tax policy process is the process by which policy changes to the tax laws are made. The process builds in consultation at key stages of policy development before the legislative stage. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 8 of tax law because the subject matter is inherently complex. The challenge is to ensure the complexity results from the concepts rather than from the way the information is presented. Even then, the least complex way of expressing the concepts should be found. Structure of the legislation By far the most useful of these techniques is to establish the correct structure for the purpose of the legislation. 4 This process involves the detailed analysis of all the existing material on a particular topic, including case law and original policy documents, followed by a reconstruction of the propositions in a more logical order. This restructuring has proven to be much harder and more time-consuming than originally anticipated. The restructuring at a detailed level is complemented by the restructuring of Parts C, D, and E at a broad level. This restructuring is explained in Chapter 3. Drafting style We have used the propositions set out in the discussion document Rewriting the Income Tax Act – objectives, process, guidelines (December 1994) in conjunction with the Parliamentary Counsel Office drafting manual as the basis for drafting style. 5 In certain areas we have also developed a set of guidelines to achieve greater consistency of style. It becomes particularly important to maintain consistency when several drafters are involved. We have used colloquial English wherever we can, adopting shorter sentences that use the active, rather than the passive, voice and grammar that is more consistent with normal usage. We have replaced archaic expressions with more modern ones, taking care not to change the law inadvertently by rewriting words or expressions that have a well-understood meaning. In some cases we have used new terms when a term has a meaning that varies from its ordinary non-tax meaning. However, some terms have had to be retained because there is a depth of case history behind them, and more simple words of equivalent meaning cannot be found. We have tried to harmonise definitions throughout the Act where possible, and then make it easier to find defined terms. The detail of definitions specific to particular provisions has been relocated from section OB 1 and 4 While the purpose of the Act has always been to tax income, what has been defined as income has changed over time. For example, the introduction of comprehensive rules for financial arrangements. 5 Key parts of the Parliamentary Counsel style include: ! the use of introductory sections to help readers understand what groups of sections are about; ! the clear identification of ideas and the setting out of those ideas in their own right, for example: - the arrangement of material in such a way as to aid understanding; - the use of one idea per subsection, paragraph, or subparagraph; - the use of short sections, except when dividing material would make an artificial break; - the use of plenty of headings. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 9 placed within the relevant provisions, although a reference to the definition has been retained in section OB 1. We group similar rules together in one place, and make greater use of signposts to guide the reader to other relevant provisions. Format and layout The way the text is presented on the page can make an important contribution to the overall clarity of the legislation. We have developed a new format for the exposure draft, although we are constrained for the purposes of the legislation to the style used by the Parliamentary Counsel Office. We have made no changes to the numbering system but we have limited the number of levels, going down only as far as subparagraphs. 6 Readers’ aids For the purposes of the exposure draft, we have included detailed commentary in the boxes below each section. The boxes also contain the current section cross-references and a list of the defined terms in the section. These boxes will not be included in the final legislation, but the lists of defined terms will be retained. Also, draft Part B continues to use flow charts. Although the exposure draft does not use any other readers’ aids, it is intended that the final legislation will use readers’ aids more widely. Technical accuracy To achieve our overall aim the rewritten legislation has to be not only clear, but also technically accurate. It must reproduce the effect of the existing legislation, except when we have made minor changes in the interests of clarity or simplicity or to reflect intended policy or when we are proposing policy changes. As part of our process of ensuring accuracy, the exposure draft has been scrutinised by internal and external experts before its public circulation. Minor changes in the current law typically involve clarifications, or dropping material from the current legislation that has become unnecessary or obsolete. Many of the issues have already been raised through issues papers or discussion documents. In some cases, however, the first public exposure of the issue is through this exposure draft. These issues are noted, together with an explanation, in this commentary. We are, therefore, providing the opportunity for each change to be fully examined before it is incorporated into the bill. The main changes are highlighted in Chapter 4. 6 We have, however, made some changes to the sequence of the subparts; see Chapter 5. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 10 Only one change is proposed that is potentially more than a clarification. This is an adjustment to the Act’s dividend provisions so that the value of services supplied by a company to one of its shareholders, beyond what the shareholder supplies by way of consideration, is treated as a dividend in the shareholder’s hands. A similar rule currently applies to supplies of property. We specifically invite comment on this change. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 11 CHAPTER 3: PROPOSED STRUCTURE OF PARTS C, D, AND E Introduction The structure of the revised Act has been the subject of much discussion from the time of the Valabh Committee report, culminating in the September 1997 discussion document on Parts C, D, and E. That document set out a detailed structure for the 3 parts. The importance of the three as a group is that, together, they define the elements that determine net income. The discussion document recognised that creating a clearer scheme for the Act requires a logical organisation of the material that takes into account both the function of provisions and their subject matter. Accordingly, improving the structure has been a key aim of the rewrite project. The core provisions enacted in 1996 gave the Act a more consistent scheme, establishing the notion that each part of the Act has a specific function. The rewrite applies this notion across Parts C, D, and E and also clarifies the interaction of those parts with the core provisions. Therefore the exposure draft also contains rewritten core provisions. General structural principles used have been: • Organising from the general to the specific. Parts, subparts, and sections generally begin with more widely used rules and conclude with less widely used rules. • Using general rules to perform a pivotal role. General rules have been used to overarch more specific rules. The general deductibility provision in Part D is a prime example. This approach helps to identify the inter-relationships between the provisions and any common policy intent. • Minimising overlap. An aim has been to make the categories used to group items as self-contained as possible. • Grouping like with like. Like functions or subject matter have been grouped for the reader’s convenience and to put provisions within a context. • Reducing repetition. An aim has been to minimise duplication. Applying common sets of rules is one technique that has been used to achieve this. • Using a consistent format. This aids accessibility by improving the flow of the text. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 12 • Providing a link back to the core provisions. Purpose provisions have not been inserted into subpart A on the basis that the title, structure, index and sub-indexes should adequately clarify the role of the Part. 7 Instead, for Parts C and D, subpart A sets out the general rules that link back to the core provisions. Part E does not have a similar set of general rules because it contains a disparate set of regimes. • Placing terminating provisions into a separate subpart at the end of each part. This is a continuation from the current Act but we have significantly culled the contents of subparts CZ, DZ, and EZ because many of the provisions are either spent or, as noted in issues papers, are unlikely to have future relevance. Deleting these provisions does not remove their application to relevant past situations, but it does reduce the size of the Act. Structure in detail Core provisions A consequence of rewriting the legislation in phases is that the rewrite of later parts can necessitate changes to previously rewritten parts. This is true of the core provisions. The exposure draft largely follows the existing core provisions but with the following key changes: (i) Terminological changes that use plainer language – mainly: • ‘Gross income’ has become ‘income’ and ‘annual gross income’ has become ‘gross income’ (see draft section BC 2). ‘Gross income’ was a useful term to emphasise the change from a net to a gross basis as part of the core provisions but we consider that this change has now been sufficiently understood and embedded to allow the simpler term ‘income’ to be used. Also, some items of ‘gross income’ are, in fact, net concepts and the term is, therefore, inaccurate. • A new concept of ‘counted income’ distinguishes amounts of income that are taxable from amounts, such as exempt income, that are not (see draft section BD 1 (4)). The term ‘counted income’ is used both in the core provisions and in cases where the current term ‘gross income’ needs to be read as excluding exempt income – for example, when deductions are authorised. (Work is continuing on identifying other areas when the use of the narrower term is appropriate.) 7 When the Act was restructured in 1994, subparts CA, DA and EA were reserved for provisions setting out the purpose of the relevant part (as recommended by the Second Report of the Working Party on the Reorganisation of the Income Tax Act 1976, page 16). Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 13 • We consider that this approach preserves current law, under which references to ‘gross income’ must be read as excluding exempt income (see further discussion on issues related to ‘counted income’ on page 14). • ‘Annual allowable deduction’ has become ‘gross deduction’ (see draft section BC 3). Likewise, ‘allowable deduction’ has become ‘deduction’ (see draft section BD 2). This does not imply any change to the apportionment rules (currently contained in section BD 2). The discussion document on Parts C, D, and E argued that apportionment would not be necessary if expenditure rather than the deduction was reduced, but this issue has been left until the rewriting of Part F. • ‘Taxpayer’ is replaced by ‘person’. The Act currently applies these terms without any uniformity – some subparts refer to taxpayers while others refer to persons. We have chosen to apply ‘person’ across the board because the subtleties of the definition of ‘taxpayer’ are not evident from the term. Against this, there may be a question of whether readers understand that the term ‘person’ includes companies. • ‘Tax year’ has been defined as the period from 1 April to 31 March. ‘Income year’ has been retained in recognition that individual taxpayers may have assessment periods that end other than on 31 March. These terminological changes also apply more generally throughout the rewritten parts. 8 (ii)Definitions of ‘derived’ and ‘incurred’ have been included, based on practice and case law (see draft sections BD 3 (3) and BD 4 (3)). We specifically invite comment on these definitions. An amount needs to be derived or incurred to take on the quality of income or expenditure. These concepts also determine the income year in which the amount in question should be recognised. Common law recognises income when it is derived and allows deductions when expenditure is incurred, although some provisions override the common law in specific cases. We have retained this status quo. (iii) The deduction rules in current section BD 2 have been shifted to Part D (see draft section BD 2). This change was signalled in the discussion document on Parts C, D, and E. That document had also signalled current sections BD 3 and BD 4 being moved to Part E. This is no longer proposed because Part E is no longer to have the role of being a comprehensive set of all the timing rules in the Act. 8 Other terminological changes are discussed in Chapter 5. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 14 (iv) The rules on allocating income and deductions (draft sections BD 3 and BD 4) acknowledge that there are sets of rules that are not general timing regimes but nevertheless allocate amounts to income years other than simply on a derived and incurred basis, as understood by the common law (see draft sections BD 3 (2) and BD 4 (2)). The discussion document on Parts C, D, and E proposed that these timing regimes be included in non-exhaustive definitions of ‘derived’ and ‘incurred’, on a deemed basis. The reason for not adopting the discussion document approach is that we considered it would be easier for readers if we kept the timing rule and the associated income/deduction provision together, as many of the timing aspects are ancillary minor modifications and closely linked with their respective income and deduction provisions. (v)Certain provisions have been omitted. Section AA 2, which attempts to identify whom the Act covers, has been omitted because of its inaccuracy. Section AA 3 (1) has also been omitted because it duplicates an equivalent provision in the Interpretation Act 1999. Even though the discussion document had noted the benefit of section AA 2 as an indication to readers as to whether they are covered by the Act, it is too inaccurate as a general statement and would become too detailed if made accurate. Overall, the core provisions retain their role of stating the principal rules on what is income, what is a deduction, and how that income or deduction is timed. Parts C, D, and E then provide the associated detail. Issues related to ‘counted income’ We are seeking comment from readers on certain outstanding issues related to the concept of ‘counted income’. First, in view of the overriding effect of the prohibition on deduction of amounts incurred in deriving exempt income, it may be unnecessary for the general permission authorising a deduction for amounts incurred in deriving income to refer to the narrower concept of ‘counted income’, rather than simply to ‘income’. Second, we are considering introducing a provision to clarify explicitly that the category of ‘excluded income’ (as distinct from ‘exempt income’) consists of items that do not have any adverse effect on the ability of a person to deduct expenditure. A possible alternative is to eliminate the ‘excluded income’ category entirely and make all such amounts ‘exempt income’; the deductibility issue would, however, require consideration. Third, although the non-New Zealand income of non-residents is currently simply not taxable rather than being exempt, we are proposing that it be treated as exempt income to remove any implication that a deduction can still arise for related expenditure. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 15 Net regimes As signalled in the discussion document on Parts C, D, and E, it has not been feasible to put the rules for some areas on a gross basis. Those areas are the financial arrangement rules (current subpart EH), the international rules (controlled foreign companies and foreign investment funds – current subpart CG) and the life insurance rules (current subpart CM). These are specialist, self-contained areas that produce a net amount that is either income or a deduction. Hence, even though these regimes have not been rewritten on a gross basis, they still fit within the general scheme of the rewritten Act. Proposed structure of Part C The proposed function of Part C is to define ‘income’ and to identify the taxpayer to whom the income belongs. It also defines amounts that would be income but are, nevertheless, exempted or excluded from income. The structure of Part C largely follows that set out in the discussion document on Parts C, D, and E, taking into account the submissions on that document; for example, business income has been given greater prominence than proposed in the discussion document. There are 4 general categories of income under the proposed structure: • income from business or trade-like activities; • income from holding property (divided into 2 subparts – equity and other); • income from employment; and • government entitlements (such as pensions and grants). There is no overlap between these categories. They are brought to account through the draft subpart CA and are detailed, respectively, in draft subparts CB, CC, CD, CE, and CF. In addition, there are a number of specific regimes that give rise to income: • Income from controlled foreign companies and foreign investment funds, life insurance, superannuation funds, petroleum mining, and mineral mining are respectively contained in draft subparts CQ, CR, CS, CT, and CU. Provisions that quantify and time when the income is recognised have been moved to Part E. • Entity specific rules for group companies, primary producer cooperatives and crown research institutes are contained in draft subpart CV. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 16 Income can also arise through draft subpart CG. This subpart brings together the separate provisions throughout the Act relating to recoveries and adjustments for the purposes of either: • negating the effect of a deduction previously allocated to an income year, such as in the case of a recovered bad debt; or • limiting the effect of a deduction in the year to which it is allocated, such as trading stock adjustments or when a government grant or suspensory loan is provided under current subpart DC. A catch-all provision has been included in draft section CA 1 to pick up any amounts outside these categories that would be income under ordinary concepts. Amounts that are exempt income or excluded income are, respectively, specified in draft subparts CW and CX. Exempt income covers amounts that would normally be considered to be income but are exempted by virtue of the nature of the income or who receives the income. The exemption is achieved by way of specific exemption. Excluded income covers those other amounts that the statute excludes from tax other than by specific exemption, such as an amount recoverable by an insurer in current section CC 1, as well as those items, such as fringe benefits, that are equivalent to income or would be income were it not for the fact that someone else pays the tax. The discussion document on Parts C, D, and E proposed putting items charged with taxes other than income tax into a separate subpart in Part C on the basis they were equivalent to income or would be income were it not for another person being charged with tax. Rather than follow that approach, at this stage, we propose simply that there be ‘flags’ signalling, say, that an exempt dividend is subject to a foreign dividend withholding payment. Draft subpart Y notes that there are provisions in other parts of the Act that make items income. Likewise, Part D contains a comparable subpart DY for deductions elsewhere in the Act. The placement of the provisions outside Parts C and D will be revisited as the other Parts of the Act are progressively rewritten. Subpart Z has been retained for terminating provisions. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 17 Proposed structure of Part D The purpose of Part D is to define amounts that are deductions. The discussion document on Parts C, D, and E proposed dividing deductions into 3 categories: • deductions for expenditure or loss that satisfy the requirement of the general deductibility rule for a link with deriving gross income; • deductions for expenditure or loss that expand on the general deductibility rule; and • supplementary deductions created by statute. A deduction can be denied if a general or specific limitation applies. The non-deductibility of private or domestic expenditure is an example of a general limitation, whereas the non-deductibility of bad debts, unless they are written off (current section DJ 1), is an example of a specific limitation. A general limitation can also be overridden, such as with depreciation amounts, that are allowed even though they breach the capital prohibition. A deduction for depreciation is a deduction in relation to a capital asset. The principle behind the discussion document’s approach was to make explicit whether a specific rule narrows or expands the general deductibility rule and to clarify the relationship between expansions and limitations; for example, expansions are usually subject to the general limitations. The draft legislation adopts aspects of this approach. A general deductibility rule, entitled ‘general permission’, is set out in draft section DA 1. The rules in the current section BD 2 are also brought into Part D (via draft section DA 2) as ‘general limitations’ to the ‘general permission’, and draft section DA 3 provides that specific rules may override the general rules. Specific deduction provisions are contained within subparts DB to DF and DN to DX, which cover the limitations to the general deductibility rule, a range of specific entity regimes, and supplementary deductions. There is no further grouping of the rules, however, according to whether they expand or limit the general rule. Instead, we have taken on board the thrust of submissions that favoured the retention of a subject-based approach. This approach was seen as giving taxpayers greater comfort that, once they have dealt with the provisions in a discrete block, there are unlikely to be other provisions elsewhere that also need to be taken into account. Nevertheless, there is still a need to identify which rules override which. Hence, each section that allows a deduction concludes with a provision identifying its relationship with other deduction rules. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 18 General deductibility rule The general deductibility rule is an amalgam of the current section BD 2 (1)(b)(i) and (ii). These provisions allow deductions for expenditure incurred by the taxpayer either in deriving gross income or in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving the taxpayer’s gross income. We have retained the ‘in the course of business’ test at this stage but have reservations about whether it materially extends the ‘deriving gross income’ test. The discussion document proposed that the general rule also include section BD 2 (2)(e), which precludes deductions for capital expenditure (unless specifically allowed in the Act). The capital prohibition has not been included in the general deductibility rule but has instead been included in the general limitations (as the capital limitation). Grouping it with the other limitations was seen as a more appropriate location. General limitations The general limitations set out in draft subpart DA are, therefore, expenditure or loss: • of a capital nature (the capital limitation); • of a private or domestic nature (the private limitation); • incurred in deriving exempt income (the exempt income limitation); • incurred in deriving income from employment (the employment limitation); • incurred in deriving schedular gross income subject to final withholding (the withholding tax limitation); and • that is recoverable under insurance or a right of indemnity (see current section DJ 1 (c)) (the indemnity limitation). Some items are not subject to the general limitations. Deductibility of interest An advantage of restating the general deductibility rule in Part D is that rules merely replicating the general rule can be deleted. The prime example of this, cited in the discussion document on Parts C, D, and E, is the interest deductibility rule in current section DD 1 (b)(i) and (ii). Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 19 Since that discussion document, the Government has proposed clarifying the law in relation to interest deductions claimed by companies, which would have a material impact on section DD 1. Those proposals are being dealt with through the ‘business as usual’ legislative process. Hence, in the interim and for the purposes of the exposure draft, the draft legislation does not include the proposed changes. Subject-based approach to rest of Part D Following the decision to group the specific deduction provisions according to subject matter, draft subparts DB to DF and DN to DX cover specific subjects. Draft subpart Y notes that there are provisions in other parts of the Act that make items income, and draft subpart Z covers terminating provisions. Proposed structure of Part E The purpose of Part E has varied somewhat over time and has been subject to further review in the course of preparation of this exposure draft. The discussion document proposed dividing the rules in Part E into 3 categories: valuation rules, retrospective allocation rules, and legislative extensions of ‘derived’ and ‘incurred’. This approach would have brought all timing rules together in Part E. The discussion document envisaged a general valuation rule covering trading stock, depreciable assets, revenue account property, unexpired accrual expenditure, and deferral of gross income. The rule was to be based on that currently applied to trading stock, which effectively produces an adjustment for the difference between opening and closing values. Submissions did not favour a wide valuation rule, particularly in relation to depreciation and the proposed treatment of depreciation clawback on realisation of a depreciable asset. After further consideration, our proposed general approach to Part E is now to revert to the Working Party on the Reorganisation of the Income Tax Act’s concept of Part E as a home for sets of rules that have a predominant focus on matching or allocation. As a number of the existing sets of such rules deal with quantification, it seems appropriate to signal this in the title of the Part. Given that Part E, under this approach, would contain a range of provisions and sets of rules with differing operative effects, we do not propose at this stage to have some general opening provisions. To some extent, such rules are already contained in the core provisions. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 20 Nor do we do propose that every element of a specific provision that has a timing aspect, such as a simple rule that clarifies for the avoidance of doubt when an amount is derived or incurred, should be shifted to Part E. This is because splitting every provision would provide difficulties, from a reader’s perspective, as many provisions are closely linked with their respective income and deduction provisions. We propose, instead, that ancillary timing rules remain with the specific provision creating income or a deduction. Necessarily, there has had to be an exercise of judgment as to what is ‘ancillary’, bearing in mind that the ultimate aim is to achieve an enhancement in the ease with which the target audience can find its way to the correct conclusion on application of the legislation. In addition to the rules on depreciable assets, trading stock and revenue account property, the draft Part E also contains regimes within which the timing, income and deduction rules cannot easily be separated, such as the accrual rules, the international rules and the life insurance rules. However, these groups of rules have been drafted to preserve, for Parts C and D, the actual provisions that make the timed and quantified amount either income or a deduction. Specific timing rules Specific timing rules may defer all or part of the income or deduction to one or more subsequent income years or, conversely, permit the income or deduction to be allocated to an earlier income period. Some timing rules do not allocate income or deductions, as such, but merely have the effect of modifying the allocation that would otherwise occur. A good example is the trading stock valuation rules, which make adjustments separate from the actual deduction claimed for the cost of the trading stock. The key specific timing rules are: • accrual expenditure (current section EF 1); • revenue account property (current section EF 2); • depreciation (current subpart EG); • financial arrangement rules (current subpart EH); and • valuation of trading stock (current subparts EE, EL, and EM). Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 21 Derived and incurred In the absence of specific timing rules, timing is determined on a derived or incurred basis. The discussion document on Parts C, D, and E referred to this as the ‘default rule’. What is meant by ‘derived’ and ‘incurred’ is supported by case law, and the rewritten core provisions contain a definition of ‘derived’ based on case law. ‘Derived’ is defined as: • when the income earning process is complete, if the income is from business activity (other than a cash basis profession); or • in all other cases, the earlier of when it is received by the person and when it is credited in the person’s account or, in some other way, dealt with in the person’s interest or on the person’s behalf. Other structural changes We have moved a number of administrative rules to the Tax Administration Act 1994. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 23 CHAPTER 4: PROPOSED REWRITE CHANGES This part summarises the proposed rewrite changes, which are minor changes intended to improve the legislation. They fall into 4 main types: • changes in approach or concepts but not in underlying law; • changes to the law and policy; • changes to the law but not to policy (such as when the law currently does not reflect policy); and • removal of unnecessary material. The changes are not categorised by these types but rather by subject matter. Many of the changes have been presented in earlier policy documents such as issues papers 1 and 2 and discussion documents and, therefore, take into account the submissions received on those documents. Rather than repeat all those proposals, we have mostly confined our discussion to additional policy changes or decisions not to proceed with previously signalled changes. The other changes are covered in the detailed comments that accompany the rewritten draft legislation (see volume 2). Depreciation Current referencesSubject matter subpart EGDepreciation Background These provisions cover the various methods that are currently available for calculating depreciation for tax purposes. Depreciation is unusual from a legislative perspective in that it provides a deduction for a capital item and, therefore, overrides the capital prohibition rule. Depreciation represents an estimate of the wasting of an asset over its useful life. An asset’s value reflects its ability to generate a future income stream. For many assets this income stream is expected to reduce over time. This reduction can occur for various reasons: the asset becomes obsolete, or naturally wears out, or simply has a fixed life. When the progressive loss in economic value occurs in generating income, a deduction is provided for depreciation even though it is a non-cash expense relating to a capital asset. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 24 Given that the deduction is only an estimate, in most cases an adjustment is done at the time an asset is sold to square up deductions with the actual change in value. A major revision of the tax treatment of depreciation was carried out in the early 1990s following the recommendations of the Valabh Committee that tax depreciation should: • be claimable as of right (rather than at the discretion of the Commissioner); • reflect economic rates; and • extend to intangible property that has a finite life. An interim regime was put in place during the early 1990s pending the calculation of economic rates for the various asset classes. Because of these changes, the legislation has to address the various permutations that are possible, depending on when an asset was purchased and what type of asset it was. The legislation also covers a range of options designed to lower compliance costs: • a pooled depreciation method that enables low-value assets of a similar type that are difficult to identify separately to be collectively, rather than individually, depreciated; • a write-off of assets that are no longer used; • a write-off of low-value assets; and • an option not to claim depreciation. The remaining provisions essentially cover what happens on the disposal of assets that have been depreciated, such as an adjustment when the depreciation that has been claimed is higher than the actual loss, and how to value assets when they are transferred between associated parties. Approach used in the draft To be consistent with the approach adopted for other sets of rules in Part E, the depreciation rules are drafted so as to preserve for Parts C and D the role of specifying what is income or a deduction. Hence, the focus of the depreciation rules is now on the quantification of an amount of depreciation loss. The general rules in Part DA must then be applied to identify whether or not a deduction is allowed for the loss (but with a specific override of the Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 25 limitation preventing deductions for capital amounts). This approach also clarifies the relationship between the depreciation rules and the general rules relating to deductibility of expenditure and loss. It avoids duplication of wording designed to require a link with income production appearing in both the general rules and the depreciation rules. In the draft, specific depreciation-related definitions have been brought into the body of the text. At present, the definitions are spread between subpart EG and section OB 1. The most important definition affected by this change is ‘adjusted tax value’. We have also brought together the provisions relating to ownership, and have specifically allowed for joint ownership. At present, the only express acknowledgement of the possibility of joint ownership is in current section EG 19 (8), which refers to disposals by partnerships. For reasons of clarity, we have also divided disposals between actual disposals and other events that are currently deemed to be disposals. The approach we have used differs from that outlined in the discussion document on Parts C, D, and E in that the valuation rule 9 is not applied, and depreciation is expressed as a net rather than a gross concept. On disposal, only the net gains or losses are taken into account rather than the consideration received being gross income and the book value of the asset being treated as a deduction. Policy issues The draft contains no significant policy changes. The treatment of improvements has been made explicit. At present, the practice is for improvements to be treated separately from the main asset in the year that they are made, and to be eligible for a part-year depreciation deduction. After the end of the income year, the improvement can either be incorporated into the main asset, or continue to be treated as a separate depreciable item. This practice is not, however, explicitly provided for in the current legislation. If the improvement is a separate item, the draft treats it as separately depreciable. Otherwise, the expenditure is incorporated into the cost of the asset. In either case depreciation of the improvement begins from the time the improvement is made. 9 This rule would have required the identification each year of opening and closing values for depreciable assets and the subtraction of the closing value from the opening value to determine the amount of the depreciation loss for an income year. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 26 The discretion of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue in current section EG 12 has been removed. We have also included the proposed changes outlined in issues papers 1 and 2 for depreciation: • the removal of terminating sections EZ 3 and EZ 8; and • changing the reference in item ‘b’ in current section EG 19 (4) from ‘cost’ to ‘base value’. Dividends Current referencesSubject matter subpart CF Dividends Because we have used a substantially different approach to presenting the dividend provisions from that in the current legislation, we provide a detailed explanation of our approach below. Background The dividend provisions in the Act are currently contained in subpart CF. Those provisions have a varied history. Before 1958, dividends were not taxed directly. From 1958 to 1988 both the company and the shareholder were taxed with, generally, no recognition of any tax paid by the company when an amount was distributed. In 1988 the imputation system was introduced. This system allows individual dividend recipients an offset for any New Zealand tax paid by the company on the distributed income. Also in 1988, the definition of ‘dividend’ in the Act was rewritten because it had become unwieldy, not only as a result of incorporating imputation but also through the introduction of various withholding tax rules, fringe benefit tax, and a range of policy amendments. Those policy amendments essentially widened the dividend definition to bring in non-cash items. 10 In the early 1990s the Valabh Committee reviewed the definition of ‘dividend’ and several changes were made as a result. The key change was the introduction of an explicit shareholder capacity test. This test limited the definition’s coverage to distributions arising from a shareholder’s ownership interest in a company. 11 Since then, the main change to the 10 For example, the remission of loans to shareholders, the acquisition of property at above market rates from shareholders, the making available of company property for the private use of shareholders and the provision of low interest loans to shareholders, and shares in lieu of dividends. 11 A person may receive a payment from a company in many possible capacities – for example, as an employee (in the form of wages), or payment for the provision of other services (say as a contractor), or from the sale of an asset to the company. From the perspective of a dividend, what is important is that there is a link between the payment and a person’s shareholding in the company. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 27 definition has been to provide for the tax consequences of company law reform that facilitated the buy-back of shares. Case law Key cases underlying the law on dividends are Smout v CIR (1982) 5 NZTC 61,158 and CIR v Brierley (1990) 12 NZTC 7,184. These cases found the definition of ‘dividend’ was a code and exhaustive of the primary taxability of transactions between a company and its shareholders. A code attempts to embody everything (including the common law and existing statutes) in a coherent piece of legislation. The presumption behind these 2 cases was that distributions from a company to a shareholder that were not dividends were capital in nature and were, therefore, not taxable elsewhere within the Act. Changes to the law since these 2 cases limit their effect. Under current section CF 2 (15), for example, a share repurchase can give rise to gross income when held on revenue account, despite the fact that an amount is excluded from being a dividend. Other exceptions are the current paragraphs CF 3 (1)(g) and (h) which, respectively, relate to fringe benefits and certain monetary remuneration received by shareholders. Although these 2 items are not dividends, they are not excluded (that is, tax-free) income in the Act. Approach underlying the rewritten provisions The central idea behind the definition of ‘dividend’ is to encompass all corporate distributions to shareholders. Accordingly, the starting point for a rewritten definition is that a dividend is any (net) transfer of value that is obtained by virtue of a shareholder’s ownership interest in a company. This underlies the concept of ‘transfer of value’ in the draft. But there are certain limitations to this wide coverage because not all transfers of value are treated as dividends. Certain additions are also necessary. And some items are included in the legislation to remove doubt as to whether they are dividends. The adjustments are summarised in the following table. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 28 Type of adjustmentsReason adjustment necessary Additions Imputation and DWP creditsNot of value to company but are of value to shareholder Certain foreign tax credits and refunds of foreign tax Is a benefit to the recipient but not paid by the company Attributed repatriation by controlled foreign company Is a notional non-cash adjustment and so no transfer is made by the company Taxable bonus issueNo transfer of value as there is no distribution of property Certain non-cash benefits of shareholder-employees Is a transfer of value but not necessarily received in shareholder capacity Subtractions Returns of capital – share cancellations, treasury stock etc Are transfers of value but no net gain to shareholder Capital distributions on liquidationAre transfers of value but are capital rather than income in nature Taxed elsewhere: subject to FBT, monetary remuneration, cash distributions in relation to notional distributions, FIF interest calculated under certain methods To ensure no double taxation Property from amalgamating company that does not exist after the amalgamation Is conceptually not a transfer of value as the amalgamating company remains in existence as part of the amalgamated company Property made available by flat- owning company No real transfer of value as is merely a form of ownership Use of associated company’s propertyDe minimis rule applies and also exclusion for “downwards” transfers only caught because of breadth of “associated person” rules Included in legislation to remove doubt Non-taxable bonus issuesNo transfer of value as no property distributed. Share splits reduce the value of existing shares. Included in legislation to confirm that they are excluded income The approach is similar to that outlined in the discussion document on Parts C, D, and E. One major exception is that the draft follows the present legislation in making the shareholder capacity test explicit. 12 We have also retained the indicative criterion for measuring shareholder capacity (that is, the payment is made on terms different from that applying to non- shareholder relationships) even though this is only one possible factor for assessing capacity. 12 The reason for making the capacity test explicit rather than implicit is to put the application of the test beyond doubt. Making the test explicit also removes the need specifically to exclude payments by a company to its shareholders in relation to services provided to the company. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 29 Key policy change Conceptually, this approach would include not only benefits arising in relation to property but also benefits from services provided by the company to its shareholders for inadequate consideration. Consequently, we intend to extend the definition of dividend to cover services provided by all organisations, not just closely-held companies. 13 This would be a change in the law. Benefits of this approach The main benefits of defining ‘dividend’ generically followed by specific adjustments are that it: • allows readers to tell at an early stage whether they need to delve further into the subpart; • focuses on the essence of a dividend, which is a net transfer of value from the company to the shareholder in the capacity of shareholder; • simplifies the presentation by removing the need to list all possible instances when a distribution is a dividend. ‘Transfer of value’ covers the current section CF 2 (1)(a)-(k) (apart from ‘taxable bonus issues’ in (f)); and • facilitates future changes to the definition, since they can more readily be accommodated through changes to the adjustments. Specific drafting style The approach used in the draft legislation differs from the current legislation in a number of main areas. Terminology – Use of ‘company’, ‘share’ and ‘shareholder’ These defined terms have been rewritten and rationalised. The aim is to have a consistent set of words defining when non-standard entities, such as unit trusts, category A group investment funds and producer boards, are treated as companies. Although this stretches the natural meaning of the terms ‘company’ and ‘share’, it is necessary to use a single defined term which is not so generic as to be meaningless to readers, and the relevant entities are generally ‘bodies corporate’ in nature. The various explanations and qualifications that relate to the individual adjustments to the general rule are now located with the adjustments, and detailed calculation rules are dealt with subsequently and separately. 13 It can be argued that current paragraph CF 2(1)(j) captures services in relation to closely-held companies. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 30 The current legislation is divided between what is a dividend (section CF 2 (1)) and what is not a dividend (section CF 3 (1)). Following each of these subsections is a series of provisions found both in the rest of subpart CF and elsewhere within the Act. The reader needs to go through these provisions to establish whether there are any limitations to an item specified in either section CF 2 (1) or section CF 3 (1) or, alternatively, how to calculate the amount that is, or is not, a dividend. These additional rules have generally either now been located alongside their relevant lead provision or else shifted (to avoid obscuring the basic rules) into a separate segment containing detailed calculation rules. Complex and directly relevant definitions are incorporated back into the rules At present, key definitions are spread between subpart CF and section OB 1. The definition most affected by this is ‘available subscribed capital’. To assist readers, complex and inter-linked definitions have generally been converted into sections located in the relevant segment of draft subpart CD.

This includes amounts currently included in the definition of ‘monetary remuneration’ and benefits under share purchase agreements. • Amounts that employees would ordinarily be required to account for as income, but that are specifically exempted, are brought together in an ‘Employee or contractor income’ division of draft subpart CW (Exempt income). Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 31 • Fringe benefits are identified in a ‘Fringe benefit’ division of draft subpart CX (Excluded income). • The specific deduction provisions for employers, currently in subpart DF, now appear in draft subpart DC (Employee and contractor expenditure). The provisions’ relationship to general deductibility rules has been made clearer. • The rules limiting deductions for expenditure on entertainment, currently in subpart DG and schedule 6A, now appear in draft subpart DD (Entertainment expenditure). Policy issues Several policy issues arise in this segment. All the issues were raised in issues papers 1 and 2, and most of the changes proposed in the papers have been given effect in the draft legislation. In a few cases, however, the changes proposed by the issues papers have not been introduced following the receipt of submissions and further consideration of the issues. • Current section CC 2 (payments to employees or former employees while on naval, military, or air service) has not been rewritten. Its repeal was proposed in issues paper 2, page 4. • The rules about deductibility of expenditure on food and beverage if provided or consumed in an area of the taxpayer’s premises reserved for senior staff and their guests have been clarified. Currently, part A (4)(c)(ii) of schedule 6A suggests that expenditure on food and beverage is subject to the limited deduction effect of current section DG 1 only if provided or consumed in an area of the taxpayer’s premises reserved for senior staff and their guests. Draft section DD 4 in subpart DD now provides that the limited deduction rule applies regardless of whether guests are involved. This was the original policy behind the current provision, and the clarification was proposed in issues paper 2, page 22. • Current section DF 2 (Contributions to employees’ benefit funds) has been retained and rewritten as section DC 7 of the draft. Its removal was proposed in issues paper 1, page 45, in the context of ensuring that all employer contributions to employee benefit funds, not just the sick, accident and death funds currently identified in section CI 1 (e), were subject to fringe benefit tax. The provision has been retained because of the proviso that a deduction for employer contributions is allowed only if the rights of employees to receive benefits are fully secured. • The first part of current section DF 3 (1) (Contributions to employees’ superannuation schemes) has not been rewritten. In allowing a deduction for employer superannuation contributions, it merely replicates the general deduction rule. The part of subsection (1) that allocates the deduction to the time when the contribution is made has Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 32 been combined with current section EO 1 in a new, comprehensive timing rule for employer superannuation contributions (see draft section EK 19). Subsection (2), which denies a deduction for employer superannuation contributions to schemes that are not superannuation funds or companies has not been rewritten either. The denial pre-dates, and is now superseded by, the current foreign investment fund rules, and its removal was proposed in issues paper 1, page 46. Subsection (3), which directs a reversal of earlier deductions allowed for employer contributions to a superannuation scheme if the employer receives a benefit from the scheme, has been replaced by an income provision (draft section CG 7). This change is consistent with proposals in the discussion document on Parts C, D, and E and was specifically proposed in issues paper 1, page 46. The current limitation to contributions made in the preceding 12 months has also been removed, as proposed in the issues paper. • Current section DF 4 (1) (Pensions payable to former employees) has been retained and rewritten as section DC 2. Its removal was proposed in issues paper 1, page 47, but the provision has now been retained to counter doubt that expenditure incurred in paying pensions to former employees has sufficient connection with deriving income or with carrying on the employer’s business to satisfy the general deductibility rule. • Current section DF 6, which allows employers a deduction of up to $8 a week for payments made to employees or former employees called up for service in the armed forces, has not been rewritten. Its repeal was proposed in issues paper 2, page 21. Farming and forestry Current references Subject matter section CC 3Forestry encouragement grants section CJ 1Income from minerals, timber, or flax section DJ 13ACost of minerals, timber, or flax subpart DLForestry expenditure subpart DOPrimary sector expenditure subpart EIIncome equalisation section EJ 1Spreading on disposition of timber section EJ 2Compensation for scrapie section EK 1Apportionment of fertiliser expenditure Policy issues Several policy issues arise in this segment. In most cases, the changes proposed in either issues papers or discussion documents have been given effect in the draft legislation. In a few cases, the proposed changes have not been introduced following the receipt of submissions and further consideration of the issues involved. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 33 The changes that have been included are: • Current section CC 3 (forestry encouragement grants) has not been rewritten because grants are no longer available. Repeal of the provision was proposed in issues paper 1, page 14. • The reference to ‘flax’ in current section CJ 1 has not been rewritten. Removal of the reference was proposed in issues paper 2, page 19, on the grounds of redundancy. Amounts derived from a disposition of flax will continue to be identified as income, when appropriate, by current sections CD 3 (Business) and CD 4 (Personal property). Expenditure incurred in deriving such income will continue to be deductible under general deductibility rules. • Current sections DO 3 and DO 4 have been rewritten as sections DO 1 and DO 4, and the current overlap between the 2 provisions has been removed. Currently, section DO 3, introduced in 1991, allows certain expenditure on assets to be deducted in the year of incurrence. At the same time, current section DO 4, an older provision, continues to direct that some of the same expenditure is to be recognised over the life of the assets under a depreciation-type scheme. The draft now provides that the expenditure in question should be deducted in the year of incurrence. This is the preferred treatment and was the intention when section DO 3 was introduced. The clarification was proposed in issues paper 1, page 32. • Current section DO 6 allows lessors of farm land a deduction for expenditure identified in current section DO 3, which they are able to claim if they, rather than their tenants, are carrying on a farming business on the land. It has been rewritten as section DO 5, and now extends to expenditure of the type identified in current section DO 4. The change was proposed in issues paper 1, page 33. • Current section EJ 2 has not been rewritten. The provision recognises as income compensation paid in connection with an outbreak of scrapie and allows the gross income to be spread back to the year in which the relevant animals were slaughtered. Repeal of the provision was proposed in issues paper 2, page 36. • Current DJ 13A, which provides a specific deduction for the cost of minerals, timber, and flax (and times the expenditure), has not been rewritten. The provision essentially duplicates the general deductibility rule and revenue account property rules. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 34 • Consistent with the principles of self-assessment outlined in the discussion document Legislating for self-assessment of tax liability, in particular Chapter 4, ‘Commissioner’ discretions have been removed from several provisions. An example is the requirement in current section DO 4 (4) for the Commissioner to be satisfied that vines or trees have ceased to exist or be used in the derivation of gross income (see draft section DO 4 (6)). Films Current referencesSubject matter section CJ 2Income derived from films section CN 2Non-resident film renters section DK 1Limitation of deduction for certain film expenditure to amount at risk sections EO 3Costs acquiring any film or any right in any film section EO 4Cost of producing films section EO 4AArrangement for expenditure on film and sale of property section EO 4BNo time bar for adjustment resulting from EO 4A section FB 6Apportionment of film expenditure section GC 11Anti-avoidance provisions relating to section EO 3 section GD 12Other film related anti-avoidance rules Background The structure of the law currently contained in the film expenditure provisions in sections EO 3 and EO 4 generally follows that outlined in the discussion document on Parts C, D, and E. The discussion document preceded the enactment of the film expenditure reimbursement provisions contained in current sections EO 4A and EO 4B. The main structural changes made by the rewritten draft are to separate the allowable deduction and timing elements of the current film expenditure provisions in current sections EO 3 and EO 4 and move them to Parts D and E respectively. The rewritten film expenditure provisions reduce the current overlap between the film expenditure rules and arrange them in a more logical order. Policy issues The policy proposals flagged in the issues papers have been incorporated in the draft. Several additional policy changes have also been included, as set out below. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 35 The following changes were proposed in issues paper 2 and have been given effect to in the draft legislation. No opposing submissions on these changes were received. • The overlap between current sections EO 3 and EO 4 for expenditure incurred in producing a film has been removed (by removing the rules in section EO 3 relating to film production). This simplification of the legislation should not result in a substantive change in policy because section EO 3 is subject to section EO 4. Currently, a film owner who incurs expenditure in producing a film must use section EO 4 to deduct that expenditure. • The draft provisions that replace section EO 4 provide that they are the only provisions under which ‘film production expenditure’ can be deducted. • Broadcasters have been excluded from the rewritten film production expenditure provisions. • We have clarified that broadcasters who incur production expenditure on a film are excluded from the film expenditure rules only if the film is produced mainly for the purpose of being broadcast in New Zealand. • The anti-avoidance provision, current section EO 4 (12), relating to expenditure that is deemed to be incurred at the time of payment, has been relocated to Part G. The following changes have not previously been signalled but are included in the draft: • The reference to ‘right’ as an amount that is dependent on or calculated by reference to income from the sale, use, rental or other exploitation of a film (currently contained in section EO 4A (2)(a)(ii)) has been incorporated into the replacement provisions for sections EO 3 and EO 4. As a result, these sections constitute a code for all film-related expenditure incurred by persons who own a right in a film. This change simplifies the drafting of the replacement provisions to sections EO 4A and GD 12. • As a result of removing the film production rules in current section EO 3, the associated anti-avoidance provisions (in subsections GC 11 (3) and (4)) have also been omitted. (The corresponding provisions for the film expenditure rules in current section EO 4 to sections EO 4 (12), GD 12 (1) and (1A) have been retained). • Current section FB 6, which deals with the apportionment of expenditure in the acquisition of a film if the film is acquired together with other property, has been omitted because we consider it to be unnecessary. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 36 Ancillary issues • We have confirmed that the film expenditure rules override the matching rules for the cost of revenue account property (current section EF 2). Because all amounts received from the disposal of a film are income, films would come within the definition of ‘revenue account property’. The same issue arises with mining. • The discussion document on Parts C, D, and E proposed relocating a number of administrative rules in the film expenditure provisions (such as section EO 4 (10), which allows the New Zealand Film Commission to revoke any provisional or final film certificate) to the Tax Administration Act 1994. However, we have retained these rules in the Income Tax Act because we consider they are integral to what is allowed as a deduction. Financial arrangements rules Current references Subject matter subpart EHFinancial arrangements Policy issues The rules for calculating and allocating income and expenditure under financial arrangements were revised in 1999. The 1999 revisions were implemented by making the sections in subpart EH into division 1 and adding a division 2. Some minor amendments were made to division 1, but essentially it was left unchanged so as not to disturb the law under which existing financial arrangements had been made. We see no advantage in departing from that approach and rewriting it now. The draft is, therefore, a rewritten version only of subpart EH, division 2. Division 1 will be shifted to subpart EZ in the bill that implements the rewrite. Issues paper 2 contained several suggestions for changes but they were of relevance only to division 1. Accordingly, the changes have not been made in this rewrite. The only change that may have had some flow-on to division 2 was the proposed repeal of current section EH 1 (9)(c)(i) (EH 1 (8)(c)(i) at the time issues paper 2 was published (see page 31)). The effect of the section’s repeal would have been to remove from trustees of personal injury trusts their exemption from accounting for financial arrangements of the trust under the accrual rules. This change was not favoured by submissions and no change has been made in respect of either division 1 or division 2 arrangements. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 37 International Current referencesSubject matter subpart CG Attributed foreign income subpart DP Attributed foreign losses and foreign investment fund losses The structure of these provisions has been altered in a number of ways: • Provisions relating to both the controlled foreign company (CFC) rules and the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules have been re- ordered. • Provisions that merely create the income amount or deduction amount have been included in, respectively, draft subparts CQ (Attributed income from foreign equity) and DN (Attributed losses from foreign equity). This is consistent with the structural approach in the exposure draft. Each of these subparts is subdivided to deal separately with the CFC and FIF rules. Each subpart has a section listing the criteria that must be satisfied for amounts to be attributed under either the CFC or FIF rules. These provisions cross-refer to the relevant provisions in Part E that detail the specific rules in the CFC and FIF regimes. • The remaining detailed rules within the CFC and FIF regimes have been shifted from Part C, where they are currently located, into Part E. Because the rules apply equally to the calculation of income amounts and loss amounts, it is inappropriate to put them in Part C. Also, because the rules deal in significant part with both timing and quantification aspects, Part E is a more appropriate location. • Some very detailed definitions have been shifted from section OB 1 into the body of the operative provisions in the new subpart EI. For example, the definition of ‘interest in an employment-related foreign superannuation scheme’ is so detailed that it best appears as a specific provision in draft subpart EI. • Some spent provisions have been omitted, and in one case a terminating provision (relating to FIF interests held on 1 April 1993) has been shifted to Part EZ. • Provisions in the FIF rules that deem non-market transactions to take place at market value have been shifted into Part G, subpart GD, on the basis that the Act’s structure requires subpart GD to be used for circumstances when transactions are deemed to take place at market value. However, a ‘flag’ is left in subpart EI directing readers to the relevant provision in subpart GD. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 38 • In draft subpart EI the detailed rules of the CFC and FIF regimes have been restructured and subdivided to make it easier to understand how the detail of those regimes functions to produce a result in terms of income or loss for a taxpayer. • Some new terminology has been introduced. In particular, the term ‘attributing interest’ has been used in the FIF rules to avoid having to use the existing term ‘interest in a foreign investment fund’ to define both what constitutes a fund and what constitutes an interest that gives rise to FIF income or loss. Also, to reduce verbosity, the acronyms CFC and FIF are used widely. Policy issues The issues papers raised no policy issues in relation to the international rules. As in other areas, various discretions of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue that are, in substance, objective tests have been drafted as objective tests. This is consistent with the principles of self-assessment. Investments Current referencesSubject matter subpart CE Investment and land income Policy issues Several issues were raised in the issues papers in relation to current subpart CE. Most of those proposals have not been proceeded with. • Issues paper 1, page 15, proposed that section CE 1 (1)(b) not be rewritten on the basis that it was redundant, given the accrual rules. After further consideration, we have retained section CE 1 (1)(b) for 2 reasons. It covers the timing issue for cash basis persons in relation to benefits that are received that would not otherwise be taken into account until a base price adjustment is made. It also covers certain arrangements that are exempt from the accrual rules altogether. For example, short-term agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services are not within the accrual rules. If a benefit is received as part of such an agreement, current section CE 1 (1)(b) would be needed to treat the amount as income. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 39 • Issues paper 1, page 17, proposed that section CE 3 (1)(a) be repealed on the basis that a separate provision is not necessary for the amount received on redemption of a commercial bill, and instead such redemptions be included in the definition of interest. On further consideration, we decided that this approach was not appropriate and have retained current section CE 3 (1)(a). • Issues paper 2, page 7, proposed treating investment society dividends under the definition of interest (with accrual rules implications) rather than separately under section CE 1 (1)(a). Again, after further consideration and in light of submissions, this has not been done. Not all investment society dividends are truly interest. • Issues paper 2, page 8, proposed that section IE 1 (4) should be repealed and the general rule in section CE 4 relied on instead; the effect of the ordering rule in section IE 1 (4)(d) should be relocated to section CE 4 and the deduction for post-remission payments in section IE 1 (4)(g) should be relocated to Part D. We have incorporated the proposal into draft sections CG 2 and DB 35. • Issues paper 2, page 8, proposed that when amounts of expenditure or loss for which a deduction has been allowed in one year are remitted in a subsequent year, the remitted amount be treated as income and allocated to the year in which the remission occurs. Currently, the remitted amount is treated as income but is backdated to the year the original deduction was taken, requiring an amendment to the tax return for that year. We have incorporated the proposal into this draft. Therefore there is no need to refer to the Commissioner having a power to amend returns to adjust for any remission amounts (current section CE 4 (3)). Life insurance, general insurance and superannuation funds Current referencesSubject matter subpart CMLife insurer income sections CN 3 to 5Non-resident and resident insurers sections DK 3 to 3ELife insurer deductions and general insurers’ and DK 5Reserves section CL 2Superannuation fund income from life policies section DI 3Superannuation fund expenditure Background These provisions deal with sections of the Act that specifically relate to the taxation of life insurers, general insurers and superannuation funds. The main structural changes relate to the life insurance provisions. These have been put into a more systematic format in Parts C, D, and E. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 40 Policy issues Various issues were raised in issues paper 2, pages 16, 20 and 57 to 71. Submissions on a number of points were received, and the following changes have been incorporated: • The definition of ‘superannuation scheme’ has been changed to align it with that in the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. This provides for consistency between the Acts. • The transitional provisions relating to non-life insurers contained in the current section CZ 6 have been omitted as they are no longer applicable. • Current section CL 2 provides that the trustees of investing superannuation funds are not taxed on the proceeds of life insurance policies that have been issued in New Zealand. The section has been rewritten as draft section CX 36 and altered to extend coverage to life insurance policies offered or entered into in New Zealand. This makes the provision consistent with the other parts of the life insurance tax regime. • Current section CM 2 treats annuity business as though it were life insurance business. This section has been absorbed into the definition of ‘life insurance’. • Current section CM 18 deals with the transfer of life insurance business between companies in a wholly owned group. The provision has been rewritten as draft section EG 42, and a change has been made to make it clear that both companies in a wholly owned group must be in the same group at the time of that transfer rather than at any time during the year. • Current section CM 18 sets out the opening balance of the actuarial reserves that a transferee must use in performing the policyholder base income or loss calculation under section CM 15. It is the ‘aggregate of the actuarial reserves of the life insurer in respect of all policies of life insurance for which the life insurer was the insurer immediately after the transfer’. A change has been made to make it clear that the pre-existing life insurance business of the transferee is also included in the opening actuarial reserves figure. • Current section CN 3 (2) makes it clear that non-life insurance business of a life insurer is taxed under the normal provisions of the Act. This provision was used under the former schedular approach to the taxation of life insurance. It has not been rewritten because it is no longer needed under the global/gross approach. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 41 Livestock Current referencesSubject matter subpart EL Valuation methods for livestock including high-priced livestock subpart EM Valuation of bloodstock Background These provisions set out the options available to owners and bailees of livestock for valuing livestock on hand at the end of the year. Taxpayers are required to elect a particular valuation option. As with trading stock, the purpose of valuing the livestock on hand is to establish the extent to which an adjustment needs to be made to ensure that what is claimed as a deduction is only the cost of the goods that are sold. But, in the case of the herd scheme, the adjustment serves a different purpose – to ensure that any change in an animal’s average value does not have a tax impact. At present, the livestock valuations fit into the general trading stock rules (through current section EE 2) by subtracting the opening value from the closing value to produce a valuation adjustment. Livestock is specifically included within the definition of ‘trading stock’. In the exposure draft, ‘livestock’ is separated from the definition of ‘trading stock’. The reason for not treating livestock as trading stock is that ‘livestock’ is an amalgam of ‘plant’ and goods produced for sale. 14 Despite this separation, livestock will continue to be on revenue account. We considered moving the bloodstock and high-priced livestock schemes to the depreciation rules as their effect is very similar. The effect of the depreciation rules is also to produce an annual valuation adjustment. But we have left them with the other livestock valuation methods, on the basis that all livestock are treated as revenue account property, even though some livestock may not be procured for the purpose of being sold at a profit. This has led us to merge bloodstock into the new subpart ED rather than, as at present, have it as a separate subpart. In contrast, the depreciation rules cover capital assets. For most depreciable assets, the clawback of any gains on sale is limited to the amount of depreciation, whereas for bloodstock and high-priced livestock there is no equivalent limit. 14 The herd scheme option for valuing livestock for tax purposes is provided in recognition that animals can be on hand to produce other goods (such as offspring, wool and milk) rather than merely as goods in their own right. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 42 We have not attempted to define ‘livestock’ and, because we wish to treat livestock as much as possible under a general trading stock-type framework, we have not defined ‘cost price, market value, or replacement price’. Policy issues The policy changes incorporated in the draft are minor. They are detailed below. The draft also includes a further proposal to clarify that a valuation election applying to a partnership does not also apply to a partner’s other interests. Otherwise, the general rule is that an election covers all of the taxpayer’s livestock. This new provision merely gives effect to the policy intent. The issues raised in the issues papers that have been incorporated are: • clarification of the treatment of bailment deficiencies under the herd scheme (issues paper 2, page 46), for which only a minor modification to the current section EL 5 (4) seemed necessary; and • the removal of the spent provision EZ 1, relating to the spreading of 1992/93 income (issues paper 1, page 37). Current subsection EL 10 (7) has also been removed on the basis that it is no longer relevant. That subsection set out the method of valuing livestock that were classified as high-priced livestock under the previous livestock valuation rules. Our expectation is that none of that livestock will still be on hand when the rewritten legislation comes into force. There is also a question as to whether current section EZ 4 should also be eliminated as it is a transitional provision pertaining to bailments in place on 2 September 1992. At this stage it has been rewritten as draft section EZ 23. The issues pertaining to the inter-relationship between bloodstock and trading stock (issues paper 2, pages 43 and 44) have been addressed through excluding livestock from trading stock. Partnership elections separate from other interests To overcome confusion as to whether a valuation election applies to all activities of a taxpayer when that taxpayer has an interest in a partnership as well as other interests, we have included a provision that makes it clear that the partnership interest is to be treated separately. The standard rule is that an election applies to all the taxpayer’s livestock. But the intention was that taxpayers could make a separate election for the partnership interest from that of their individual interests. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 43 Therefore, taxpayers who own their own farm and are also a partner in another farming venture do not have to apply the same valuation method chosen for the partnership to livestock on their own farm. Ancillary issues • The exposure draft explicitly refers to livestock having to be used in a business to qualify. This is not a change as the test is implicit in the current legislation through the general trading stock rules referring to ‘a taxpayer that carries on or owns a business’. • There are minor terminology changes. The titles of the livestock blocks have been changed – ‘specified livestock’ has become ‘listed livestock’ and ‘non-specified livestock’ has become ‘other livestock’. The names of the schemes are unchanged. • Provisions setting out the procedures to make a valid valuation election have been relocated to the Tax Administration Act 1994. Mining Current referencesSubject matter sections CJ 3-CJ 7 Income in relation to petroleum mining section DK 2 Deduction for expenditure or loss incurred by persons associated with petroleum miners subpart DM Petroleum mining expenditure subpart DNMineral mining expenditure Provisions relating to both petroleum and mineral mining have been reordered: • Provisions identifying income from mining and related activity are brought together in draft subparts CT (Income from petroleum mining) and CU (Income from mineral mining). Much of this material is currently located in Part D. • Provisions allowing deductions related to mining activity are brought together in draft subparts DT (Petroleum mining expenditure) and DU (Mineral mining expenditure). Policy issues The issues papers did not cover problems relating to mining. However, the exposure draft does contain 2 minor proposed modifications. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 44 The first is to correct a cross-referencing error to reinstate the original policy intent. The error, which involves the current section DM 4, occurred when the Income Tax Act 1976 and the Inland Revenue Department Act 1974 were reordered into the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. Current section DM 4 (2)(a)(i) provides that excess expenditure incurred before 16 December 1991 is allowed as a deduction in accordance with section DM 1 (2). That reference, however, should have been to section DM 1 (3). Current section DM 1 (3) allows petroleum mining development expenditure to be spread over 10 years, and that was the intended treatment for the excess expenditure. Section DM 1 (2), on the other hand, provides that exploratory expenditure can be written-off in the year it is incurred, and that development expenditure should be written-off over 7 years. The second change is to remove sections DM 11 and DZ 6 as the Maui B project is now complete. Ancillary issues We have clarified that the specific petroleum mining deduction provisions override the revenue account property rules (current section EF 2). As amounts derived from the sale of petroleum are income, petroleum satisfies the definition of ‘revenue account property’. To avoid this overlap, we have specifically excluded petroleum mining deductions from being covered by the revenue account property rule. Property Current references Subject matter section CD 1 Land transactions section CD 2 Royalties section CD 3 Business section CD 4 Personal property section CD 6 Property obtained without colour of right section CE 2Income from use or occupation of land section DJ 6 Patent expenses section DJ 14 Expenditure on acquiring land section DJ 15 Expenditure incurred in acquiring personal property section DJ 16 Expenditure incurred on acquiring commercial bills section DJ 18 Expenditure incurred in restitution section EN 1 Timing of payments received for non-compliance with covenant to repair section EN 2 Timing of sums received from sale of patent rights section EN 3 Spreading of income from assignment or grant of interest in copyright section EN 4 Spread of income from acquisition of land by Crown Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 45 section EN 5 Timing of income derived from property obtained without colour of right section EO 2 Deduction to lessee in non-specified lease section EO 2A Deduction to lessee under operating lease section EO 5 Payment for non-compliance with covenant to repair Provisions relating to property have been reordered: • Income provisions that are currently grouped within single sections have been split into separate sections. For example, the 3 limbs of current section CD 4 (Personal property) now appear in 3 different sections, with their subject matter clearly signalled. The different rules in current section CD 1 (Land transactions) are similarly separated. • Amounts that are royalties, but that are currently identified in the definition of ‘royalty’ in section OB 1, are brought into the substantive royalty provision in Part C. • Provisions that allow a deduction for expenditure incurred following non-compliance with a covenant to repair, currently in sections EN 1 and EO 5, now appear in a ‘Premises costs’ division of draft subpart DB (Specific rules for expenditure types). • Spreading options for income and expenditure appear in a ‘Land’ division of draft subpart EJ (Spreading of specific income) and a ‘Leases’ division of draft subpart EK (Spreading of specific expenditure). However, ancillary timing rules such as current section EN 5, which times income derived from stolen property, have been relocated with the income or deduction provision to which they relate. Policy issues Several policy issues arise in relation to property. • The timing of the associated person tests in current section CD 1 (2)(b), (c), and (d) has been clarified. Draft sections CB 6, CB 7 and CB 8 make clear that the test of association applies when land is acquired or, in the case of builders, improved, rather than at the time of disposal. The proposed clarification was not raised in the issues papers but is consistent with the purpose and scheme of current section CD 1, the Commissioner’s view of the current law as expressed in Public Binding Ruling 00/05, and views expressed by the Tax Education Office. • Changes to current section CD 2 proposed in issues paper 2 have not proceeded following the receipt of submissions. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 46 • Current section CE 2 has not been rewritten. Its predecessor was introduced in 1939 at a time when farmers whose land had an unimproved value of £3,000 or less were not liable to pay income tax. The intention of the government of the day was to ensure that farmers would pay income tax on the same basis as other income earners. However, that policy objective is now achieved by the general business rule so section CE 2 is superfluous. • Current section EO 2 has been rewritten as section EK 17 but the application dates in current subsection (2) have not been included. Their removal, on the grounds of obsolescence, was proposed in issues paper 2, page 37. A proposal that section EO 2 be subsumed into current section EF 1 (Accrual expenditure) has not proceeded. Trading stock Current referencesSubject matter subpart EETrading stock sections FB 3 and FB 4 Disposals of trading stock Background These provisions set out the valuation rules for trading stock that are used to value stock on hand at year-end. This value is then compared with last year’s closing value (equivalent to this year’s opening value) to derive an annual valuation adjustment. The approach adopted in the draft is consistent with the approach outlined in the discussion document on Parts C, D, and E in that the adjustment feeds into either Part C or Part D rather than, as at present, the closing value being income and the opening value a deduction. The definition of ‘trading stock’ has been incorporated into the draft. However, livestock has been excluded from the definition, as have bloodstock and excepted financial arrangements. This makes no practical difference as livestock and bloodstock already have their own subparts. The reason for excluding livestock from the definition of trading stock is explained in the section on livestock. There are 2 reasons for our excluding excepted financial arrangements from the definition. The excepted financial arrangement provisions do not fit well with the trading stock rules because they apply to all excepted financial arrangements that are revenue account property, not just those that are trading stock. Moreover, excepted financial arrangements can be valued only at cost, whereas trading stock in general can potentially be valued at either its cost, market value or replacement price. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 47 Even though livestock, bloodstock and excepted financial arrangements have been separated from trading stock, they are all put through the same process to calculate a combined annual stock adjustment (see draft section EB 1). Policy issues As the rules for valuing general trading stock were revised in 1999, the draft does not contain any substantive policy changes. Partnership issues, such as whether all partners ‘dispose’ of their trading stock when a partner leaves the partnership, have not been addressed in the draft. These issues are to be handled separately, probably as part of a general review of the tax treatment of partnerships, rather than through the rewrite.

The provision is obsolete and its repeal was proposed in issues paper 1, page 2. • Current section CB 2 (1)(c), which exempts personal services income earned by visitors to New Zealand if the visit ‘does not exceed a period of 92 days’ has been rewritten as section CW 15 and now makes clear that the day of arrival and the day of departure each counts as a whole day for the purpose of calculating the 92-day period. The change makes the provision consistent with section OE 1 (4), which directs part-days to be included when calculating the 183-day period for residence, and is a clarification proposed in issues paper 1, page 6. • An adjustment to the exclusion contained in the second proviso to current section CB 2 (1)(c), proposed in issues paper 2, page 1, has not been made. The proviso currently says that personal service income of a visitor that would otherwise be exempt is not exempt, in an income year, if the visitor is present in New Zealand for more than 92 days in aggregate during that income year. The issues paper proposed excluding the exemption if the visitor is present in New Zealand for more than 92 days in aggregate in any twelve-month period. However, the change is not being made, pending further research. • Current section CB 3 (b)(i), which exempts any amount derived by a local authority other than ‘an amount received in trust’, has been rewritten as section CW 29 and now makes clear that the amounts intended to be excepted from the exemption are amounts that a local authority receives as a trustee. • Current section CB 3 (b)(ii) provides that amounts derived by local authorities from a local authority trading enterprise (LATE) or certain similar trading enterprises are exempt only if the amounts are rates. Issues paper 2, page 3, proposed widening the reference to rates to include any amounts derived from the local authority performing its ‘normal civic responsibilities’. Examples given were tip fees, water charges, and fees for consent applications. However, the change has not proceeded following the receipt of submissions. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 49 • Current section CB 3 (d), which exempts the income of Geothermal Development Limited, has not been rewritten. The provision is obsolete, and its repeal was proposed in issues paper 1, page 9. • The following current provisions: CB 2 (1)(a)(ii)Non-resident entertainers CB 4 (1)(b)Scientific research societies CB 4 (1)(f)Veterinary council and clubs CB 4 (1)(g)Herd improvement societies CB 4 (1)(h)Amateur sport promoters have been rewritten as sections CW 16, CW 38, CW 39, CW 40 and CW 35. Each denies exempt status to income of an institution if the institution is carried on for the ‘private pecuniary profit of any proprietor, member, or shareholder’. However, the policy underlying that wording is defeated if any person, not just a proprietor, member or shareholder, is able to obtain a private pecuniary profit. The class ‘any proprietor, member or shareholder’ has, therefore, been widened to ‘any person’ in each case. The change was proposed in issues paper 1, page 5. • Current section CB 5 (1)(d), which exempts certain retiring allowances of former public servants of the Cook Islands and Western Samoa, has not been rewritten. The payments identified in the provision are now deemed not to be income by section HH 3 (5), the provision that provides generally that distributions to beneficiaries from a qualifying trust are not income. The provision is, therefore, superfluous. Its repeal was proposed in issues paper 1, page 11. • Changes to section CD 2 proposed in issues paper 2 have not been made following the receipt of submissions. • Current section CK 2, which provides that certain amounts are income of energy trading operators, has not been rewritten. No energy trading operators remain in existence and so the provision is obsolete. Its repeal was proposed in issues paper 1, page 18. • Current section CZ 3, which imposed fringe benefit tax in limited circumstances during the period April to October 1989, has not been rewritten. The provision is obsolete, and its repeal was proposed in issues paper 1, page 22. • A rationalisation of current section CK 3 (2) (now rewritten as draft section CV 2) with the dividend rules, proposed in issues paper 1, page 20, has not proceeded at this stage. • Draft section DE 2 allows Inland Revenue Mileage Rates to be used to measure business use of a motor vehicle. The change was proposed in issues paper 2, page 39. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 50 • Current section DJ 4 (now rewritten as draft section DB 30), which allows a deduction for certain gifts made by companies not closely held, continues to apply just to companies not closely held. A proposal in issues paper 1, page 31 to extend its application to closely held companies that are listed on the Stock Exchange has not yet proceeded, but was included in the recent discussion document Tax and Charities. • Current sections DZ 1 to DZ 4, and EZ 1 to EZ 3, and EZ 7 and EZ 8 have not been rewritten. Their repeal was proposed in issues paper 1, pages 34 to 41. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 51 CHAPTER 5: FURTHER NOTES ON THE DRAFT LEGISLATION Provisions presented as if law The rewritten provisions are presented as if they were the law, not as if they were a bill. One consequence of this approach is that cross-references in the text are not in bold, a drafting device that readers may be used to seeing in bills. Another consequence is that the commentary in the boxes uses the terms ‘section’ and ‘subsection’ for material that, when it is in a bill, is referred to as a clause or a subclause. Numbering In Parts C and D, sections applying to all taxpayers occupy the top of the alphabet, and sections applying to particular groups of taxpayers occupy the bottom of the alphabet, 15 leaving a gap in the middle. The gap allows drafters some leeway in future to avoid the use of subparts with 3-letter identifiers – for example, a subpart CEA inserted between subparts CE and CF. Terminology Terminological changes made in the draft, in addition to those outlined in Chapter 3, are: • Acquisition. The rewritten provisions use ‘acquisition’ and ‘acquire’ in place of expressions such as ‘acquires or becomes possessed of’, ‘acquired or created’, and ‘purchase or creation’. • Disposal. The rewritten provisions use ‘disposal’ in place of ‘sale or other disposition’, ‘sale or other transfer’, ‘alienation or transfer’, and similar expressions. The verb used is ‘dispose’. • Mainly. The rewritten provisions use ‘mainly’ in place of ‘primarily and principally’ and similar expressions. The expression ‘primarily and principally’ was considered by Eichelbaum J in Newman Tours Ltd v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,027 (High Court). The judge interpreted the expression as requiring that the purpose not only be the main one, in the sense of outweighing all the other purposes, singly or collectively, but also the primary one, that is, the first one. We consider that sufficiently similar connotations can be conveyed in the single word ‘mainly’. 15 Except for subparts CZ and DZ, which have been reserved for terminating provisions. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft General commentary 52 • They. The rewritten provisions use ‘they’ as the singular pronoun in place of expressions such as ‘the taxpayer’s’ or ‘the person’s’, the pronouns for which are, in traditional grammar, ‘his, her, or its’. ‘They’ as the singular pronoun is already used occasionally in the Act – see, for example, section EH 33 (4)(b); its use in the rewritten provisions achieves consistency. • Treated. The rewritten provisions either omit ‘deemed’ or use the word ‘treated’ in its place. Defined terms in boxes The list of defined terms in the boxes below each section may contain terms that are not used in the text of the section in the form in which they are defined – for example, if a section uses ‘matures’ in the sense of the defined term ‘maturity’, ‘maturity’ is listed as a defined term. This approach is authorised by section 32 of the Interpretation Act 1999, which provides that ‘\[p\]arts of speech and grammatical forms of a word that is defined in an enactment have corresponding meanings in the same enactment’.
Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft iii Foreword The Government welcomes the publication of this exposure draft of the rewritten Parts A to E of the Income Tax Act 1994. Legislation that is clear, written in plain language, and easy to use has obvious advantages: it saves time, increases certainty, reduces compliance costs, reduces administrative costs, and is generally easier to comply with. Tax is an inherently complex subject, so it is especially important that the law relating to it is as clear and accessible as possible. Rewriting the Income Tax Act is a massive undertaking. The publication of this first exposure draft of rewritten legislation, which has been prepared by officials, is a milestone for the project. The exposure draft includes the rewritten legislation in what are probably the most used parts of the Act, Parts C, D, and E, which deal with income and expenditure. How that law is rewritten will have a widespread effect on those who use it. Therefore we encourage the tax community to comment to the project team on this first stage of the rewritten legislation. Your feedback is vital to the consultative process and will help to influence this and future stages of the rewrite of the Act.
