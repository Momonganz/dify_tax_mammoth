Subsequent to public feedback, the Government made decisions on the package and these have been incorporated into this tax bill. The proposed amendments aim to simplify the rules and reduce compliance costs, while ensuring that the rules remain robust and in line with intended policy. Closely held companies typically have only a few shareholders but can have widely varying net worth and business focus. They also make up a significant proportion of the total number of companies in New Zealand. Many use the standard company tax rules but there are also specific tax rules available for very closely held companies, in particular the look-through company (LTC) rules and their predecessor, the qualifying company (QC) rules. 1 The LTC and QC rules recognise that companies are taxed differently fro m individuals and it is important that this tax difference does not influence business decisions on whether to incorporate as this may impede growth. For example, a business may start off as a sole trader and as it grows it decides to become a company, given such legal benefits as limited liability. The LTC rules in effect enable individual tax treatment to continue to apply to owners’ LTC interests even though the LTC is legally a company for other than tax purposes. On the other hand, it is important that these rules be available only to those that could have genuinely alternatively operated through direct ownership. The proposals in this bill make a number of changes to the LTC rules. They also affect QCs and, through a number of proposed changes to the dividend rules, other types of companies. The key changes relate to the following: LTCs • Eligibility criteria • Entry tax • Deduction limitat ion rule • Debt remission 1 A LTC is a company that, like a partnership of individuals, is “looked through” for tax purposes, with its income and expenditure being attributed back to owners and taxed at their personal tax rates rather than at the company tax rate. A QC is only partially “look-through”, being taxed like an ordinary company except that un-imputed dividends are tax-free. Both LTCs and QCs allow capital gains to flow through tax-free to owners during the course of business, as would be the case under direct ownership, but not for a standard company. 3 QCs • Continuity of ownership Other companies • Tainted capital gains • Resident withholding tax on dividends • Taxation of shareholder-emplo yees’ emplo yment inco me. Application date Most of the proposed changes apply from the beginning of the 2017–18 income year, although some, such as those relating to debt remission, have been backdated where appropriate. 4 LOOK-THROUGH COMPANY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA (Clause 262) Summary of proposed amendments Several amendments are proposed to tighten the LTC eligibility criteria to ensure that LTCs operate as closely controlled companies, as originally intended. They relate in particular to who can have an interest in a LTC and how the five or fewer “counted owners” test applies. These proposed changes are as follows: • The way that beneficiaries are counted when determining whether the counted owner test is met is to be broadened. • Charities and Māori authorities will be precluded from being LTC owners, directly or indirectly, subject to certain exemptions and grandparenting. • Trusts that own LTCs will be precluded from making distributions to corporate beneficiaries. • The foreign income that a foreign-owned LTC can earn annually will be limited. • The restriction that requires a LTC to have only one class of shares will be relaxed. Application date These amendments will come into force on 1 April 2017, except for the Māori authorities’ grandparenting arrangements, which will apply to Māori authorities’ interests in LTCs entered into before the date of introduction of this bill. Key features The definit io n o f “look-through counted owner” in section YA 1 provides the mechanism for counting owners when testing the “five or fewer counted owners” requirement for a company to qualify to become a LTC. The proposed amendments introduce a new limb to the definition with respect to LTCs owned by trusts to broaden the way that beneficiaries are counted, by including any beneficiary who receives any distribution from any source from the trust. The definition of “look-through company” will also be amended to preclude charities and Māori authorities from becoming LTC owners (either directly or indirectly through a trust). The proposed new restrictions will not apply to Māori authorities that currently have ownership interests in LTCs, in effect grandparenting current structures. Further, to ensure these prohibitions do not inadvertently discourage charitable giving, a new rule is proposed to allow trusts that own LTCs to continue making distributions to beneficiaries that are charities, so long as the distribution is akin to a donation or is received by the charity as a residual beneficiary of the trust. 5 To bolster the current legislative prohibition on direct corporate ownership of LTCs, the definit io n o f “look-through company” will be further amended to prohibit a trust that owns a LTC from making any distributions to any corporate beneficiaries. To restrict the use of LTCs as conduit vehicles for international investment, the foreign income that can be earned by a LTC whose ownership interests are held more than 50 percent by foreign LTC holders will be limited to the greater of $10,000 and 20 percent of the LTC’s gross income in the relevant income year. A new definition of “foreign LTC holder” provides the rule for determining how the foreign ownership of LTCs is tested when applying the new foreign income restriction. An amendment to the definition of “look-through interest” is proposed, to enable LTCs to have more than one class of shares. This amendment will enable LTCs to have shares carrying different voting rights, provided all shares have uniform entitlements to all distributions. Background The eligibility criteria limit the type of entity that can elect to become, and continue to be, a LTC as well as the type of owner that can hold LTC interests. They serve to ensure that the use of the LTC rules is appropriately targeted according to the policy intent underlying their design, which is that the rules should only be available to those that could have genuinely alternatively operated through direct ownership. LTCs are not designed to be widely held investment entities. This concern covers not only direct ownership but also indirect ownership through benefiting from a distribution from a trust that has an ownership interest in a LTC. For example, the current rules allow for charities and Māori authorities to hold LTC interests, either directly or indirectly through a trust. Both charities and Māori authorities have potentially wide pools of beneficiaries and are therefore, conceptually, not part of the LTC target audience. The proposed amendments primarily focus on strengthening the rules supporting the requirement for a LTC to have no more than five counted owners, which is to ensure that the company is “closely controlled” by individuals. Corporate ownership is precluded given the scope that it would allow for widely held ownership. Another LTC can be an owner but is looked through to its owners for the purposes of the counted owners test. Family trusts can be owners but specific rules determine the extent to which the trustee(s) and beneficiaries are counted owners. No change is planned to the rule that states that if a LTC fails to satisfy the eligibility criteria during an income year it loses its LTC status from the beginning of that income year. 6 Detailed analysis Definition of “look-through counted owner” Shareholding trusts For LTCs owned by trusts, when determining the number of look-through owners, the rules count the trustee (grouping multiple trustees as one) when the LTC income earned by the trust is not fully distributed to beneficiaries, as well as all beneficiaries who have received LTC income from the trust as “beneficiary income” in the current and preceding three years. This is too narrow. The definit io n o f “look-through counted owner” will be amended to count all distributions to beneficiaries, irrespective of whether they are from the LTC or from other sources, or whether they are received by the beneficiary as beneficiary income, trustee income, trust capital or corpus. The amendment is necessary to ensure the test counts all persons who, though they may not receive beneficiary income, nevertheless benefit from the trust owning LTC shares. Including all distributions is necessary to also ensure the rule is not undermined by the fungibility of money, which makes the result fro m tracing the source of a distribution arbitrary. To ensure this rule applies only prospectively, given that the counted owner test looks back to the current and preceding three income years, the strengthened test will apply only to income earned from the beginning of the 2017–18 income year. Income earned and distributed to beneficiaries or retained by the trust prior to the 2017–18 income year will be counted under current rules. Similarly, to ensure the strengthened test incorporating all distributions to beneficiaries does not result in double counting of owners, amendments are being made to the way trustees are counted, to ensure that the test is phased out as the strengthened test is brought in. For example, the current test counts a trustee that retains LTC income and ignores the future distribution of that income as “trustee income” to beneficiaries; whereas the proposed test will count all distributions in the hands of the beneficiary, including the receipt of trustee income. To prevent the test from counting the trustee and the beneficiary in relation to the same income when it has been retained by the trustee in one year and distributed to beneficiaries in the following year, the proposal restricts the current trustee count test to apply only to income earned prior to the 2017–18 income year. This means that for 2017–18 onwards, trustee income retained by the trust will not be counted until it is distributed to the beneficiaries, and receipts by beneficiaries of trustee income earned prior to 2017–18 will be ignored for the purposes of counting the beneficiary as an owner. In effect, by 2021–22 only the strengthened test should be applicable. Definition of “look-through interest” Voting rights Currently, in order to simplify the attribution of a LTC’s income and expenditure to its underlying owners, LTCs can only have one class of share. This rule is overly 7 restrictive as it can limit legitimate commercial structuring or generational planning and inhibit some companies from becoming LTCs. The proposed revision to the definition of “look-through interest” relaxes the requirement that a LTC can only have one class of share by allowing LTCs to have shares that carry different voting rights provided that all shares still have the same rights to distributions. Definition of “look-through company” Corporate beneficiaries Currently, a trust that owns a LTC interest can have a corporate beneficiary but direct ownership by companies, other than other LTCs, is expressly prohibited. The trust is looked through and the shareholders of the corporate beneficiary are counted if it receives any beneficiary income. This, coupled with the way that the number of owners is determined for trusts, unintentionally provides widely held non-LTC corporates with a way to circumvent the prohibition on direct ownership. The definition of “look-through company” will be amended to expressly prohibit trusts which own LTCs from making distributions to corporate beneficiaries. This approach in effect allows for grandparenting of current structures involving corporate beneficiaries, by not expressly prohibiting LTC owning trusts from having corporate beneficiaries while strengthening the present prohibition on ownership of LTCs by standard companies. Charities and Māori authorities To ensure that the LTC rules are reserved for closely controlled entities, the proposals will extend the trust approach of looking through to the ultimate beneficiaries to LTCs owned by tax charities (as defined in the Income Tax Act) and Māori authorities. The proposals will effectively preclude direct ownership by charities and direct or indirect ownership by Māori authorities. There will be, however, some exceptions: • Given that many LTC-owning trusts are likely to have charitable beneficiaries and may want to make charitable distributions, the proposed revised definition of “look-through company” will expressly allow for distributions to charities that have no influence over the LTC or trust from which they receive the distribution. In this case the distribution is truly a gift equivalent to a donation or received by the charity as the residual beneficiary upon the wind up of the trust. • To prevent Māori authorities incurring the compliance cost of converting their LTC interests to limited partnerships, another look-through vehicle that is often used to achieve the same outcome as a LTC, it is proposed to grandparent current Māori authorities that had interests in LTCs before the introduction of this bill. A definition of “grandparented Māori authority” will be added to section YA 1, which includes not only direct ownership interests but also a Māori authority beneficiary of a trust that is an owner in a LTC, and a Māori authority which has entered into an arrangement to become a LTC owner before the date of introduction of the bill. 8 Foreign income restrictions Although LTCs are envisaged primarily as a structure for domestically focussed companies, there are no restrictions on either foreign investment by LTCs or on LTCs having non-resident owners. This combination unintentionally allows for LTCs to be used as conduit investment vehicles – that is, vehicles used by non-residents to invest in foreign markets generating income that is generally not taxable in New Zealand. This gives rise to reputational risks for New Zealand. To address these risks, the revised definition of “look-through company” includes a proposed rule for a foreign-controlled LTC (a LTC that is more than 50 percent held by non-residents) that will restrict it to deriving foreign income annually that is no more than the greater of $10,000 or 20 percent of the LTC’s gross income for the year. Breach of this requirement will lead to loss of LTC status. The rule tests foreign control by looking at the direct and indirect ownership of the LTC, and testing the tax residence of the owners. Standard tests of residency will apply to determine the residency of individuals. The definition of “foreign LTC holder” will include a trustee of a trust if the trust has a non-resident settlor or a person that is non-resident who has power to appoint or remove a trustee of the trust. The current source rules are relied on when determining foreign income for the purposes of this new rule. The thresholds are intended to provide flexibility for some degree of combined non- resident shareholding and foreign income, and should prevent a domestic family business inadvertently falling outside the rules through an owner emigrating. On the other hand, the proposal is intended to prohibit LTCs being used by non-residents purely as conduit investment vehicles. 9 LOOK-THROUGH COMPANY ENTRY TAX (Clauses 14, 106, 178, 239 and 262) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments to section CB 32C modify the income adjustment calculation (commonly known as the entry tax) done when a company converts to a LTC to ensure that: • the taxable income that arises to LTC owners as a result of the calculation is taxed at each shareho lder’s personal tax rate; and • for QCs converting to LTCs, that the entry tax formula does not tax owners of QCs any more than they would be if they liquidated before the conversion. An associated amendment to section HB 13 will clarify that a company that elects to become a LTC effectively steps into the shoes of the superseded company and must, therefore, use the tax book values of the company at the time of entry for all purposes under the LTC rules. Application date The amendments to section CB 32C will apply to the 2017–18 and subsequent income years. The amendment to section HB 13 will apply from the start of the LTC rules on 1 April 2011. Key features The proposed revised formula treats the resulting income that flows through to the LTC owners as a dividend, with imputation credits attached where available, thereby ensuring that the income is taxed at the owners’ personal tax rates in all cases. This overcomes a problem with the current formula, which bases the calculation on the company tax rate and can lead to under- or over-taxation, depending on an owner’s marginal tax rate. A further formula is proposed for situations when a QC has insufficient tax credits to cover distributions of all reserves. The amendment to clarify that the tax book value of assets and liabilities of a company that elects into the LTC regime become the opening book values for the LTC, is for the avoidance of doubt. For example, revenue account property transfers at tax book value, and not market value, meaning that unrealised gains and losses are not recognised at that point. 10 Background The LTC entry tax adjustment applies when a company elects to become a LTC. It triggers a tax liability on un-imputed retained earnings by deeming the company to have been liquidated immediately prior to conversion. This adjustment is intended to ensure that reserves that would generate taxable income for shareholders if distributed before entering the LTC regime and that would be able to be distributed tax-free once the company becomes a LTC, are taxed to owners at the time of entry. The tax rate used in the current formula is 28%, which means that no further tax is paid on the company’s retained earnings. It is only the untaxed reserves that are taxed at the shareholders’ personal tax rates. The 28% rate was used in the formula to reduce compliance costs, but this can provide a tax advantage for shareholders whose top personal tax rate exceeds 28% (that is, those on the 30% or 33% marginal tax rate) as well as a disadvantage for shareholders whose personal tax rates are below 28%. Further, the entry tax formula currently applies to tax all un-imputed retained earnings except eligible capital profits. For QCs that elect into the LTC rules, this means that tax is charged to the extent that the earnings are not eligible capital profits. This is inconsistent with the QC rules, which allow for tax-free distribution of un-imputed earnings as exempt dividends to QC shareholders. As a result, the current entry tax formula can over-charge tax on the un-imputed reserves, which may be deterring some QCs from converting to LTCs. Detailed analysis The current formula in section CB 32C(5) is: dividends + balances – assessable income – balances – exit exemption tax rate where: dividends is the sum of the amounts that would be dividends if immediately before becoming a LTC the property of the company, other than cash, were disposed of at market value and the company met all its liabilities at market value and it was liquidated and the net cash amount was distributed to shareholders without imputation credits or foreign dividend payment credits attached. In other words a liquidation took place; balances is the sum of the balances in the imputation credit account and foreign dividend payment credit account immediately before becoming a LTC, plus amounts of income tax payable for an earlier income year but not paid before the relevant date, less refunds due for the earlier income year but paid after the relevant date; assessable income is the amount of income that would arise as a result of liquidation less any deductions that the company would have as a result of liquidating. This includes depreciation gains or losses, bad debts and disposals of revenue account property; 11 tax rate is the company tax rate in the income year before the income year in which the company becomes a LTC; exit exemption is the exit dividends that, if the company had previously been a LTC and is now re-entering the LTC rules, would be attributed to any retained reserves from the previous LTC period that have not since been distributed. The proposed new formula in section CB 32C(4) is: (untaxed reserves + reserves imputation credit) x effective interest where: reserves imputation credit is the total amount of credits in the company’s imputation account, up to the maximum permitted ratio for the untaxed reserves under section OA 18 (Calculation of maximum permitted ratios) and is treated as an attached imputation credit included in the dividend calculated; effective interest is the person’s effective look-through interest for the look- through company on the relevant day; and untaxed reserves is calculated using the following formula: dividends – assessable income – exit exemption where: dividends is the sum of the amounts that would be dividends if the following events occurred for the company or the amalgamating company, immediately before it became a look-through company or amalgamated with a look-through company: (i) it disposed of all of its property, other than cash, to an unrelated person at market value for cash; and (ii) it met all of its liabilities at market value, excluding income tax payable through disposing of the property or meeting the liabilities; and (iii) it was liquidated, with the amount of cash remaining being distributed to shareholders without imputation credits attached; assessable income is the total assessable income that the company would derive by taking the actions described in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above; less the amount of any deduction that the company would have for taking those actions; exit exemption is the amount given by the formula in section CX 63(2) (Dividends derived after ceasing to be look-through company), treating the amount as a dividend paid by the company for the purposes of section CX 63(1), if section CX 63 would apply to a dividend paid by the company. The terms “dividends, “assessable income” and “exit exemption” are therefore the same as in the current formula. 12 This proposed formula will treat the retained income and imputation credits that would arise on liquidation of the company as being distributed to the individual LTC owners who will need to include the income and imputation credits in their return of income. This approach leaves it to each individual shareholder to determine what tax rate applies to their share of the income, and results in a fairer tax outcome. The formula will apply to companies converting to LTCs, including QCs with sufficient imputation credits to fully impute the dividend, as well as companies that amalgamate with LTCs. However, it will not apply to those QCs converting to LTCs for which the entry tax formula would result in a dividend which is not fully imputed. Qualifying companies with limited imputation credits Instead the proposed additional formula in section CB 32C(8) is to be used to calculate the entry tax payable when a dividend by a QC on liquidation would be only partially imputed and, therefore, only partially a taxable distribution. The proposed formula in this case is: (balances – balances) + balances imputation credit) × effective interest tax rate where: balances is the sum of the following amounts: (i) the balance in the company’s imputation credit account; (ii) an amount of income tax payable for an earlier income year but not paid before the relevant date, less refunds due for the earlier income year but paid after the relevant date; tax rate is the basic tax rate for the income year of the company that contains the relevant day; balances imputation credit is the same as the amount of the item balances, and is treated as an attached imputation credit included in the dividend calculated; effective interest is the person’s effective look-through interest for a look- through company on the relevant day. Benchmark dividends An amendment to section section OB 61 (ICA benchmark dividend rules) ensures that the dividend which results from the entry tax formula is disregarded for the purposes of the benchmark dividend rules. This amendment is for the avoidance of doubt that the level of imputation attaching to the entry tax deemed dividend does not require a benchmark dividend ratio change declaration as the company is not an imputation credit account (ICA) company as defined in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act at the time that the dividend arises. 13 DEDUCTION LIMITATION RULE (Clauses 97 and 105) Summary of proposed amendments The coverage of the deduction limitation rule, which limits a LTC owner’s LTC deductions to the amount that they have economically at risk, will be restricted to LTCs in partnership or joint venture. To bolster the other rules in the Income Tax Act that help to stop LTC owners claiming excessive deductions, the existing anti-avoidance rule that deems a partner’s transactions to be at market value will be extended to owners of LTCs. Application date The amendments will apply from the beginning of the 2017–18 income year. Key features The first proposed change will mean that the deduction limitation rule in section HB 11 will not apply for most LTCs. The provision will be changed to specifically cover only LTCs that are in partnership or joint venture. The formula determining the “owner’s basis” in section HB 11 will otherwise be unchanged, although officials are continuing to explore options for simplifying and clarifying the formula. For those no longer covered by the rule, deductions previously restricted and carried- forward by the rule will be automatically freed up from the 2017–18 income year, and will be available for offsetting against their income from that year onwards. The specific anti-avoidance rule in section GB 50 will be extended to LTCs and their owners. The rule is designed to ensure that transactions between partners and their partnerships that have the effect of defeating the rules in sub-part HG (joint ventures, partners and partnerships) are treated as taking place at market value. Background The deduction limitation rule was designed to ensure that LTCs cannot be used to generate deductions in excess of the money that owners have at risk in the company. It was based on a comparable rule that applies to limited partnerships. It works by restricting an owner’s ability to use LTC deductions against their other income when the deductions are greater than the owner’s economic contribution to the LTC (referred as “owner’s basis”). 14 The rule results in undue compliance costs in many cases, as it requires each LTC owner to calculate their “owner’s basis” annually, which requires owners to keep track of what they have invested in and withdrawn from the business, and all income and expenditure attributed to them while they have been an owner. Over time this would require LTC owners to maintain records well beyond the standard record- keeping period for tax information. Furthermore, each owner must complete the calculation even though most will not have their deductions constrained by it because their share of expenditure is less than their owner’s basis. There are some technical issues with the rule and officials are continuing to work on these. Overall, given that this rule results in compliance costs that appear to outweigh the benefits provided from the operation of the rule, the rule is largely unnecessary in the LTC context. However, for LTCs working together in partnership or as a joint venture, the rule has relevance. This is because partnerships and joint ventures of LTCs are in many respects an alternative to limited partnerships where a deduction limitation rule is appropriate. They can also be potentially widely held investments. The removal of the rule for other LTCs appears appropriate given that the risk of LTCs being used to generate excessive deductions is ameliorated by other rules in the Income Tax Act, including the general and specific anti-avoidance provisions, and the debt remission amendments discussed in the following item. 15 DEBT REMISSION (Clauses 13, 56, 104 and 119) Summary of proposed amendments Amendments to the debt remission rules are proposed to deal with specific concerns about the way the rules work in relation to LTCs and partnerships. Application date The amendments will apply from the start of the LTC rules on 1 April 2011. Key features The first amendment ensures that remission income does not arise to either a LTC owner or a partner who remits a debt owed to them by the LTC or partnership, including a limited partnership (referred to in the proposed amendment as “self- remission”). The second clarifies that in respect of a debt owed by a LTC to a third party, the market value of the debtor’s interest in the debt is adjusted for any credit impairment. While this was always the intention, some practitioners have argued otherwise. Both amendments are necessary to ensure that the debt remission rules operate as intended. Any refunds of overpaid tax as a result of the retrospective application can be claimed by taxpayers reopening past returns, but we do not anticipate many will need to do this. Any additional income that may arise as a result of retrospective application will only need to be brought to account in the 2017–18 income year (a transitional amendment achieves this). Background Debt arrangements with owners Debt remission, being the extinguishing of a debtor’s liability by operation of law or forgiveness by the creditor, gives rise to debt remission income to the debtor under the financial arrangement rules. Under current tax law, debt remission produces taxable income to the debtor. Problems arise from the interaction of the LTC (and partnership) rules with the financial arrangement rules that produce remission income in circumstances when, as a result of the transparency of the LTC or partnership, the debt is effectively self- remitted. When an owner of a LTC remits debt owed to them by the LTC, all the LTC owners derive debt remission income given the look-through nature of a LTC. 16 This includes the owner that remitted the debt who is required to pay tax on their share of the remission income despite making an economic loss (to the extent of the portion that is attributed to the other shareholders). Generally, they are unable to claim a deduction for the bad debt. Overall, this results in over-taxation of the owner who remitted the debt, which is not an appropriate policy outcome. Market value of debts The other proposed change involves amending the LTC rules to clarify that when calculating the market value of an owner’s interest as debtor in a financial arrangement with a third party, the amount of any adjustment for credit impairment must be taken into account. This clarification is necessary as Inland Revenue officials have become aware of certain interpretations being taken to the contrary. The amendment will ensure that the debt remission rules apply as intended so that debt remission income arises when a LTC is either liquidated or elects out of the LTC rules. This is important given the proposed limiting of the scope of the deduction limitation rules, as the debt remission rules are one of the backstops in the Income Tax Act that help to preclude excessive deductions. Detailed analysis To prevent debt remission income arising to a LTC owner or partner for debt remitted by them, a new concept of “self-remission” is being added to the base price adjustment formula in section EW 31 of the Income Tax Act. Specifically, the definition of “amount remitted” in section EW 31(11) is being amended to exclude “self-remission”. “Self-remission” is defined as an amount of remission for a person and a financial arrangement under which, and to the extent to which, because of the operation of sections HB 1 or HG 2 (which relate to LTCs and partnerships), the person is also liable as debtor in their capacity of owner or partner. Example As a result of the proposed amendment, if a LTC owes an amount to owner A, who owns 60 percent of the LTCs shares and is unable to pay, when owner A remits the debt, no debt remission income will arise to owner A. Remission income will still arise for the other shareholders to the value of 40 percent of the debt remitted but this is appropriate as it ensures that the economic benefit of not having to repay the debt to owner A is recognised in the hands of the remaining owners. The clarification that when calculating the market value of an owner’s interest as debtor in a financial arrangement, the amount of any adjustment for credit impairment must be taken into account, involves amending section HB 4. A transitional rule will ensure that any income that would have arisen in earlier income years through the retrospective application of this remedial clarification will be recognised prospectively in the 2017–18 tax year. This will reduce the consequences for taxpayers who should have had income arise in line with the intended operation of the disposal rules but who took a different tax interpretation. 17 Specifically, the formula under the proposed transitional rule in sect ion HZ 8 is: retrospective amount – current amount where: retrospective amount is the amount of income, for the person’s owner’s interest in financial arrangements as debtor, that would result from the application of section HB 4 for income years before the 2017–18 income year, treating that section as amended by the clarification that the market value of the interest must take into account the amount of any adjustment for credit impairment, for those income years; current amount is the amount of income, for the person’s owner’s interest in financial arrangements as debtor from the application of section HB 4 that the person returned for income years before the 2017–18 income year. 18 QUALIFYING COMPANIES – CONTINUITY OF OWNERSHIP (Clauses 98 and 262) Summary of proposed amendment The bill proposes that qualifying company (QC) status will cease if there is a change in control of the company. Application date The amendment will apply for the 2017–18 and later income years. Key features A change of control will be measured using a continuity test. The proposed new shareholder continuity limitation in section HA 6 of the Income Tax Act requires a “minimum continuity interest” of at least 50 percent for the “QC continuity period”. The continuity period will extend from the date the bill receives Royal assent to the last day in the relevant income year. The “minimum QC interest” is defined to mean the lowest voting interest or market value interest during the continuity period. A breach of this requirement will trigger the loss of QC status under the standard QC rules. For the purposes of the shareholder continuity measurement, changes to shareholding resulting from property relationship settlements or the death of a shareholder will be ignored when measuring a change of control. To ease compliance, the proposed continuity test will apply prospectively to changes in shareholding from the date of enactment. Background Qualifying companies are partial look-through vehicles that allow for the profits of the company to be taxed in the same way as a standard company but, unlike a standard company, capital gains and un-imputed dividends can be distributed tax-free to shareholders during the course of business. QCs in place when the new LTC regime came into force on 1 April 2011 were allowed to continue, pending an ultimate decision on the future of QCs. There are still around 70,000 QCs. As part of the Government’s decisions from the review of closely held company taxation, it was confirmed that these QCs could continue. Requiring all remaining QCs to convert to LTCs, or failing that to ordinary companies, would not only impose significant compliance costs on those businesses but would also not be practical as the LTC requirements might not be suitable for many QCs. 19 This meant that while no new QCs could be created, existing QCs could continue until they are either liquidated, elect out of the QC regime or fail to meet the QC eligibilit y criteria. In effect, this provides the grandparented QCs with some degree of permanent tax advantage, due primarily to the opportunity for tax deferral on income through the taxing of the income in the first instance at the company rate, which differs from (and is often lower than) the top personal rate, or the favourable treatment of capital gains relative to ordinary companies. The effective limitation on trading of QCs by ensuring that QC status is lost if there is a change in control of the company, supports the 2010 decision to grandparent QCs. This outcome ensures that existing QC owners are able to make some shareholder changes without sacrificing QC status while preventing the current owners fro m trading any tax advantage. 20 TAINTED CAPITAL GAINS (Clause 23) Summary of proposed amendments The scope of the “tainted capital gains” rule is being narrowed to address the current overreach of the rule, and make it much more targeted. Specifically, the rule will only apply to asset sales between companies that have at least 85 percent common ownership, with the original owners still retaining at least 85 percent interest in the asset at the time of liquidation. The rule currently applies to associated party transactions. Application date The amendments will come into force on the date of enactment and apply to distributions made on or after that date. Key features The current rule and exception relating to capital gains (and capital losses) made on asset sales between associated companies (sections CD 44(10B) and (10C)) will be replaced with a rule that measures commonality of ownership interest both at the time the asset is sold and at the time of the liquidation distribution. A capital gain or capital loss amount will not arise (in other words, the amount is tainted) if: (i) at the time of disposal, a group of persons holds, in relation to the seller company (company A) and the buyer company, common voting interests or common market value interests of at least 85 percent; and (ii) at the time of liquidation of company A, the company that owns the asset is company A or, if it is not company A, the percentage given by the following formula is 85 percent or more: commonality interest × ownership interest where: commonality interest is the percentage of common holding by a group of persons, for the owning company and company A, of common voting interests or common market value interests (if they are greater than the common voting interests); ownership interest is the percentage of ownership of the asset, by market value, for the owning company. 21 For example, an asset of a company (company A) may be sold to another company (company B) in the same wholly owned group for a capital gain and at a later stage be on-sold to a non-associated company for a further capital gain, with both companies being liquidated. Both gains will be non-taxable as the outcome of the series of transactions is that by the time of the liquidation distribution the asset has been sold to a company that has no common ownership with companies A and B. If the owner at the time of liquidation is a non-corporate, (ii) above is not relevant (as that leg of the test requires some portion of the asset to be owned by a company). The gain or loss will, therefore, not be tainted. The proposed threshold is set at 85 percent because a change of ownership to an unrelated third party of more than 15 percent provides sufficient assurance that the transaction is genuine and involves a real transfer of the underlying assets rather than, say being in lieu of a dividend. Background Capital gains derived at the company level cannot be distributed tax free by ordinary companies, except upon liquidation. The current tainted capital gain rule (in section CD 44(10B) of the Income Tax Act) taints a capital profit if it is realised through a sale of a capital asset to an associated person, making the gain taxable when distributed to shareholders in a liquidation. There is one exception to the rule which applies to gains derived by a close company (as defined in section YA 1) that arise during the course of liquidation. The policy rationale for this rule is that sales of assets between associated persons (for example, sales within a group of companies) can be for the purposes of creating additional amounts of capital reserves for tax-free distribution, rather than for general commercial reasons. This would allow a company to distribute “capital profits” tax free in lieu of dividends, which would have been taxable. The rule that governs which gains become tainted has its origins in the mid-1980s when some companies sold assets to associated companies to generate capital gains that they could use to pay out tax-free dividends. Major changes to tax settings since that time, in particular the introduction of the imputation regime and a comprehensive definition of what is a “dividend”, have made the rule less relevant. In practice, the rule can capture genuine transactions when the sale is not tax driven – for example, the transfer of an asset as part of a genuine commercial restructure. The restriction, therefore, extends beyond its intended ambit and currently applies to gains made on sales to any associated party, not just an associated company. Companies can often be inadvertently caught by the rule, resulting in their being unable to be subsequently liquidated without a tax impost. The rule still has a role in the case of sales between companies that have significant commonality of ownership, where it provides protection against arrangements that are in effect in lieu of a taxable dividend. The rule should, therefore, be confined to such instances. 22 RWT ON DIVIDENDS (Clauses 20, 239, 240, 241 and 242) Summary of proposed amendments Two amendments are proposed to deal wit h the current over-taxation of certain dividends under the resident withho lding tax (RWT) rules: • The first will allow a company to opt out of deducting RWT from a fully imputed dividend paid to corporate shareholders. • The second provides a new formula for determining the RWT obligation when cash and non-cash dividends are paid contemporaneously. A third proposed amendment deals with an unintended restriction, because of the need to deduct RWT, on the rule which allows a dividend to be backdated to clear a shareholder’s current account. Application date The first two amendments will come into force on the date of enactment. The third applies from 1 April 2008 for the 2008–09 and subsequent income years. Key features RWT on dividends between companies The proposed amendment will limit the definition of “resident passive income” in section RE 2(5) to exclude fully imputed dividends paid to a corporate shareholder if the paying company chooses to exclude the dividend from the definition. In effect this allows a company to opt out of withholding RWT on a fully imputed dividend paid to another company. This proposal reflects the fact that the obligation to withhold RWT on a fully imputed dividend paid to another company over-taxes the dividend. The ability not to withhold has been made optional because for some companies (particularly those that are widely held) an outright requirement not to withho ld RWT on fully imputed dividends may raise compliance costs. This is because they will need first to establish which shareholders are corporates and those that are not, and differentiate between these two groups within their systems. RWT on concurrent cash and non-cash dividends To deal with the current potential over-taxation of cash and non-cash dividends paid contemporaneously, proposed new section RE 14B will streamline the RWT obligations by treating the two dividends as a single dividend. The amendment 23 introduces a new calculation formula to calculate the amount of RWT owing on the dividends, which applies only if the cash dividend is equal to or greater than the amount of RWT payable under the formula. Further amendments are proposed to sections RE 13 (Dividends other than non-cash dividends) and RE 14 (Non-cash dividends other than certain non-share issues) to exclude concurrent cash and non-cash dividends (to be covered by proposed new section RE 14B) from their application. RWT impact on backdating a dividend An amendment to section CD 39(9) is proposed to ensure the rule operates as intended. The intention of the provision is to allow for a dividend that had no further tax owing (that is, it is fully imputed) to be backdated, to expunge, or at least reduce, an overdrawn current account balance. This avoids, or limits, the deemed dividend arising and reduces compliance costs. However, a requirement is that there has to be no RWT obligation. Taxpayers have continued to use the rule but due to an oversight at the time the company tax rate was changed, it technically does not work given the need to deduct RWT. The amendment provides certainty by clarifying that the rule should apply to dividends that are fully imputed, irrespective of any RWT obligation. Background RWT on dividends between companies The payment of passive income, such as dividends and interest to resident recipients is subject to an obligation to account for RWT, which is withheld by the company at the time of payment and paid to Inland Revenue in the month following payment. For dividends, a flat rate of 33% applies (less any imputation credits) and for interest, the RWT rate varies according to the recipient’s personal marginal tax rate. As a result of the lowering of the company tax rate to 28%, 2 even when a company pays a fully imputed dividend the dividend is still subject to an additional 5% RWT. For dividends paid to corporate shareholders (who will be subject to the company tax rate of 28%) this obligation to withhold RWT results in an initial over-taxation of these dividends. 3 This over-taxation may give rise to additional compliance costs for both the paying company, which must account for the additional RWT to Inland Revenue, and the recipient company, which is required to seek a refund when the RWT credit cannot be used. 2 This was as a result of two tax cuts – from 33% to 30% from the 2008–09 income year and to 28% from the 2011–12 income year. 3 The exception is if the two companies are part of the same wholly owned group, in which case the dividend is exempt from tax, or the recipient company holds a certificate of exemption from RWT. 24 RWT on concurrent cash and non-cash dividends When a company pays a non-cash dividend, such as a taxable bonus issue, the dividend is still subject to RWT. The non-cash dividend is required to be grossed up because the RWT cannot practically be withheld from the non-cash amount. When a company pays a non-cash dividend concurrently with a cash dividend, both dividends are subject to RWT. The two dividends are treated as separate dividends meaning that the non-cash dividend is still subject to the gross-up even when the concurrent cash dividend is sufficient to cover the RWT obligation on both dividends. This can result in the RWT obligation across both dividends being higher than it should be. RWT impact on backdating a dividend Under the dividend rules, shareholders who have overdrawn current accounts at year end are treated as having received a deemed dividend based on the interest that they would have had to pay had the overdrawn account been a loan. To simplify matters for taxpayers, the rule in section CD 39(5) was introduced, which allows a company to pay a backdated fully imputed dividend to clear, or at least reduce, an overdrawn current account. For dividends to qualify for backdating there must be no further tax owing, including RWT. The application of this rule was unintentionally limited as a result of the corporate tax rate change. It technically does not work, as a dividend can only be backdated if there is no RWT obligation on the dividend and, in practice, any dividend will have a RWT obligation, even a fully imputed dividend (which has a 5% RWT obligation). Detailed analysis Sections RE 13 and RE 14 calculate the RWT required to be withheld on cash and non-cash dividend respectively. When cash and non-cash dividends are paid contemporaneously, with the objective of the cash dividend being used to account for the RWT owing on the non-cash dividend, there is potential over-taxation because the two dividends are treated separately under these two sections. New section RE 14B will provide the payer with the option of combining cash and non-cash dividend payments and accounting for RWT as though they were a single dividend. The proposed new section will only apply when the cash dividend alone is sufficient to cover the total RWT owing, meaning that RWT will be paid by deduction rather than gross-up, and the payer has elected for the section to apply. The amount of RWT that the payer must withhold is calculated using the following formula: (tax rate × (dividends + tax paid or credit attached)) − tax paid or credit attached 25 where: tax rate is the basic rate set out in schedule 1, part D, clause 5 (Basic tax rates: income tax, ESCT, RSCT, RWT, and attributed fringe benefits); dividends is the total amount of the cash dividend and the non-cash dividend paid before the amount of tax is determined; tax paid or credit attached is the total of the fo llo wing amounts: (i) if a dividend is paid in relation to shares issued by an ICA company, the total amount of imputation credits attached to the dividends; (ii) if a dividend is paid in relation to shares issued by a company not resident in New Zealand, the amount of foreign withholding tax paid or payable on the total amount of the dividends. To ensure there is no overlap of the rules, neither section RE 13 nor section RE 14 will apply to the dividends if the payer chooses to apply proposed section RE 14B. 26 PAYE ON SHAREHOLDER-EMPLOYEE SALARIES (Clauses 234, 235, 236 and 262) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment proposes that shareholder-emplo yees of clo se co mpanies who receive both regular salary or wages throughout the year and variable amounts of other employment income will be able to elect to split their income so that the base salary is subject to PAYE and the variable amount is paid out before tax. Application date The amendment will come into force from the date of enactment. Key features New section RD 3C allows for a shareholder-employee of a close company to choose to split their earnings so that the base salary is subject to PAYE and the variable amount is paid out pre-tax, and is therefore likely to be subject to provisio nal tax instead. The proposal would allow additional flexibility for shareholder-employees who may be unduly constrained by the current rules. To ensure that the ability to switch between provisional tax and the PAYE system is not used inappropriately, if a choice is made to apply either provisional tax to all of the earnings (section RD 3B) or the new split method (section RD 3C), the other option becomes unavailable, and the choice is irrevocable. The approach must be applied consistently from year to year. The provisional tax option in proposed section RD 3B is available under the present rules but has been amended to accommodate the new option in proposed section RD 3C. The PAYE rules will also be amended to ensure there is no overlap with the new options. The opportunity has been taken to make some minor technical amendments to reorganise section RD 3 and its associated definitions, in particular, the definitions of “close company” and “shareholder-employee”. These do not alter the scope of section RD 3. 27 Background Shareholder-employees of close companies often do not derive regular amounts of salary or wages, or do not get paid in regular periods throughout the income year. For smaller companies, the remuneration of shareholder-employees also often depends on the performance of the business and, therefore, the annual salary will not be known until well after year end. This can make compliance with the PAYE rules difficult because the rules are designed for circumstances when employees’ salaries are known at the start of the income year and payments are made regularly (monthly, fortnightly or weekly) throughout the year. To alleviate this problem, the current rules allow for shareholder-emplo yees who do not derive regular amounts of salary or wages or who do not get paid for regular periods, to treat all amounts of income they receive through the year as not subject to PAYE, subject to certain condit io ns (sect ion RD 3). As a result, the amounts received are taxable in the employee’s tax return and may give rise to provisional tax obligations. The current rules, however, may not adequately relieve the compliance costs incurred by shareholder-emplo yees as it may not suit the myriad of shareholder-employee circumstances when paying a combination of PAYE and provisional tax might be preferable. There is no option currently to pay a combination of PAYE and provisional tax, the rule is all or nothing. 28 NRWT: Related party and branch lending 29 30 OVERVIEW New Zealand imposes non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on New Zealand- sourced interest paid to foreign lenders. The rate is 15%, usually reduced to 10% if the lender is resident in a country with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement. The obligation to withhold falls on the New Zealand borrower. NRWT is still a tax on the foreign investor and they will usually get a credit for the New Zealand tax against the tax they pay on the interest in their home jurisdiction. A New Zealand borrower can elect to pay the 2% approved issuer levy (AIL) instead of withholding NRWT but only if they are borrowing from an unrelated lender – such as a foreign bank. Foreign lenders cannot claim a credit for AIL against home jurisdiction tax. This means it can be more efficient for NRWT to be paid rather than AIL. Broadly speaking, there are three parts to the reform package in the bill: • changes to the NRWT rules to ensure they apply as intended to related party debt; • changes to the AIL registration process to reduce the risk that AIL is paid on loans from associated lenders; and • changes to the NRWT/AIL rules which particularly affect branch structures. The proposed NRWT reform is about correcting anomalies in the current rules to level the playing field for taxpayers to whom the NRWT rules apply (or are intended to apply). The proposed changes focus on ensuring that an NRWT liability arises on interest on related party debt at approximately the same time that an income tax deduction is available to the borrower for that interest. Under the existing rules a number of structures delay or remove the liability for NRWT or replace it with AIL. Changes are also proposed for related party lending by New Zealand banks. The proposed AIL registration changes will reduce the risk that borrowers will pay AIL (rather than NRWT) on interest payments to non-residents that they are associated with. The branch proposals are aimed at levelling the playing field between certain borrowers who can step around AIL and NRWT by operating an onshore or offshore branch, and other borrowers who cannot and are therefore subject to NRWT or AIL on interest paid to non-resident lenders. Much of the interest on funding that currently flows through a branch structure is ultimately paid to unrelated parties and will become subject to AIL although NRWT will continue to be available. One kind of structure involving related party lending and onshore branches will become subject to NRWT. 31 INTEREST ON RELATED PARTY LENDING PROPOSALS (Clauses 5, 15, 55, 246 to 248, 252, 253, 261 and 262) Summary of proposed amendments In broad terms, the approach taken in the bill addresses “ho les” in the NRWT base to ensure that the tax applies evenly to economically similar and easily substitutable transactions. It does not attempt to expand the NRWT base beyond its target of associated party interest, or debt which is logically indistinguishable from associated party interest. At present, differences in the legal form of a loan from a non-resident parent company to its New Zealand subsidiary can result in very different NRWT outcomes. For example, on an ordinary interest-paying loan, NRWT is payable every time interest is paid. However, for a zero-coupon bond, NRWT is not payable until the bond matures. This difference in the NRWT treatment is not mirrored in the income tax treatment for the borrower. The deduction for the borrower in an interest-bearing loan is similar to the deduction for the borrower in a zero-coupon bond. The deferral of the NRWT impost compared wit h the income tax benefit provides a significant timing benefit. Another issue arises with the boundary between NRWT and AIL. While AIL is unavailable when the New Zealand borrower is controlled by the non-resident lender, it is available when a group of lenders are acting together and control the New Zealand borrower (typically a joint venture or private equity situations). This situation is difficult to distinguish economically from the case of a single non-resident controller – the group of shareholders are able to act as if they were a single controlling shareholder – yet the availability of AIL differs. The effect of these (and certain other) issues is that non-resident investors who are able to take advantage of them face a lower effective tax rate in New Zealand than other investors. This is not appropriate. To address these issues the bill proposes the following: • to require NRWT to be paid at approximately the same time as interest is deducted by the New Zealand borrower, if the borrower and lender are associated. This will mean that the NRWT consequence of economically similar loan structures will be similar; and • to adjust the boundary between NRWT and AIL, so AIL is no longer available when a third party is interposed into what would otherwise be a related party loan or where a group of shareholders are acting together as one to control and fund the New Zealand borrower. These changes will bring the NRWT treatment of substantially similar transactions into line. 32 Application date The amendments will apply to existing arrangements on and after the first day of the borrower’s income year that starts after the date of enactment. For all other arrangements the amendments will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features Broadening arrangements giving rise to non-resident passive income (Clauses 253 and 262(65) and (91)) Non-resident passive income (NRPI) only arises when there is “money lent”. Although the definition of “money lent” is broad it, does not apply in all situations when there is funding provided under a financial arrangement. This can result in a New Zealand borrower incurring financial arrangement expenditure when the non- resident lender has no NRPI. The bill extends the definition of “money lent” to include any amount provided to a New Zealand resident (or New Zealand branch of a non-resident) by an associated non-resident under a financial arrangement that provides funding to the resident, and under which the borrower incurs financial arrangement expenditure. As “money lent” is a term used in other places in the Income Tax Act 2007, this change is limited to the NRWT rules. Reducing quantum mismatches between NRPI and financial arrangement expenditure (Clauses 253 and 262(52), (76) and (91)) To reduce mismatches between the NRWT and financial arrangement rules, when the new rules apply, the definition of “interest” will include a payment (whether of money or money’s worth) received by a non-resident from an associated New Zealand resident (or New Zealand branch of a non-resident), to the extent that the payment gives rise to expenditure to the borrower under the financial arrangement rules. Related party debt (Clauses 253 and 262(91)) “Related party debt” is a new defined term in the proposed rules. It means all financial arrangements where a non-resident provides funds to an associated New Zealand resident (or New Zealand branch of an associated non-resident) and the borrower is allowed a deduction under the financial arrangement rules. To prevent this being structured around, it also includes funding provided through an indirect associated funding arrangement or by a member of a non-resident owning body – these terms are explained below. A consequence of this definition is that money lent to exempt borrowers (such as charities) will not meet the “related party debt” definition. This is appropriate as no asymmetry can arise between income tax deductions and a lack of NRWT when there is no income tax deduction. Exempt borrowers will continue to be required to withhold NRWT under the existing payment rules, provided the other requirements are met. 33 Members of a banking group that are registered by the Reserve Bank are also carved out of having related party debt. This is because proposed amendments to section RF 12(1)(a)(ii) recognise that interest payments by New Zealand banks are directly or indirectly equivalent to third-party debt on which AIL can be paid. Although NRWT will continue to be available on interest payments by banks this can be eliminated by paying AIL instead and there is no proposal to apply AIL on an accrual basis. Accordingly, financial arrangements by banks and members of their groups will not meet the definition of related party debt. Calculating whether non-financial arrangement income arises (Clauses 248 and 262(69), (71), (76) and (91)) One of the principal concerns this bill addresses is where interest payments (and therefore NRWT) significantly lag accrued deductions. Although deductions can be accrued on a daily basis, interest is usually paid in arrears, frequently up to 12 months after the start of the interest period. These rules are not intended to apply to arrangements when interest is accrued up to balance date but paid shortly thereafter; they are instead intended to cover more substantial deferrals. To achieve this, taxpayers, for each related party debt will be required to complete a deferral calculation, at the end of the second and subsequent years following issue of a financial arrangement, to determine whether non-resident financial arrangement income (NRFAI) arises. Where the deferral calculation below is satisfied, NRFAI does not arise and the related party debt continues to be taxed under the current NRWT rules. The calculation should be undertaken separately for each related party debt. The calculation that must be made for each financial arrangement at the end of each income year is: accumulated payments ÷ accumulated accruals ≥ 90% where: accumulated payments is the total interest paid since the financial arrangement became a related party debt until the due date for filing the NRWT return for the second month after the end of the income year. accumulated accruals is the total expenditure the borrower incurs (excluding the effect of foreign exchange) while the arrangement is a related party debt until the end of the year preceding the income year. The period for the two variables is different, with “accumulated payments” covering payments made up to and somewhat beyond the end of the most recent completed income year while “accumulated accruals” excludes the most recently completed year. There are two reasons for this difference: • This approach ensures NRFAI does not arise simply because interest is paid annually in arrears. 34 • “Accumulated payments” only requires knowing what interest has been paid whereas “accumulated accruals” requires a calculation under the financial arrangement rules, which might often not be calculated until shortly before the income tax return is filed. Using “accumulated accruals”, excluding the current year means the majority of the necessary calculations will have already been completed in the ordinary course of business (that is, whether or not these rules were introduced). Applying a 90% threshold rather than a 100% threshold provides an additional buffer, so that the proposed rules do not need to be applied when the majority of interest payments are paid on a 12-month or less deferral basis, but there is a limited amount of accrued interest, for example, when a bond is issued at a slight discount. This 90% discount also partially equalises the effect on arrangements that are entered into at different points prior to a balance date and before the first interest payment is made. Once NRFAI arises in a year, NRWT will continue to apply on an accrual basis so long as the financial arrangement is related party debt. This means it will not be necessary for a taxpayer to repeat the above deferral calculation once the 90% threshold has been breached. Related party de minimis threshold (Clause 248) If a New Zealand borrower has only a small amount of related party financial arrangement expenditure, the amount of the NRWT deferral, compared wit h income tax deductions, may not be sufficiently large to justify the additional compliance costs of having to apply the NRFAI rules. A borrower (and their related party lenders) will not be required to apply the NRFAI rules, except in relation to arrangements already subject to NRFAI, if their expenditure on related party debt in the previous year is less than $40,000. Unlike the rest of the NRFAI rules, to minimise compliance costs, this threshold includes foreign exchange movements on those financial arrangements so that a separate calculation is not required to be undertaken. The threshold also includes expenditure incurred by entities with a common ownership (66%) of the borrower, to prevent taxpayers avoiding the NRFAI rules by borrowing through multiple entities. Timing of calculations and payment (Clauses 247, 253 and 262(71) and (76)) The above deferral calculation should be completed as part of the preparation of the NRWT return for the second month after the borrower’s balance date. This NRWT return is due on the 20th of the third month after balance date. This date is defined as the “NRFAI due date”. Once NRFAI arises for a year, it is deemed to be paid to the non-resident recipient on the final day of that second month. The exception to this timing is when a related party debt ceases during a year (the cessation date) in which case the income arising from the start of that year until the cessation date is treated as paid on the final day of the second month following the cessation date. 35 Voluntary election into NRFAI (Clause 253) The one year deferral test above means that NRFAI cannot arise for an arrangement, including one with no regular interest payments, before the end of the second year of the arrangement. However, in some cases (for example, a zero coupon bond) it is self-evident that the instrument will give rise to NRFAI and a borrower may find it easier to apply NRFAI treatment from the inception of the arrangement. Taxpayers can therefore elect to apply NRFAI from the first year the arrangement becomes a related party debt. Taxpayers can also elect to disregard the application of the related party de minimis threshold. One reason they may choose to do this is when they expect to be above the de minimis threshold in future years. First-year adjustment (Clause 253) The first year that a non-resident derives NRFAI on a related party debt, the borrower will need to calculate the non-resident’s income from the debt for that year using the financial arrangement rules. The non-resident is also treated as deriving an addit io nal amount of inco me, which removes the income deferral from that debt for all prior years, including any years the arrangement existed before enactment of the proposals. Including in income amounts deferred in years before enactment significantly reduces complexity by removing the need for a separate wash-up calculation upon maturity of the arrangement, and a number of transitional provisions. Taxpayers who wish to avoid paying NRWT on pre-enactment deferral can prevent this by making sufficient interest payments after the enactment of the proposals so that NRFAI does not arise. 36 Examples The following examples illustrate the main features of the new rules proposed by the bill. Example 1: Zero coupon bond Company A has a 31 March balance date and issues a zero-coupon five-year bond to an associated non- resident on 1 August 2017. Company A receives $700 on 1 August 2017 and will repay $1,000 upon maturity on 30 September 2022. Deductions are calculated on a YTM basis with a 243/365 ths apportionment between years. # Date Event Payments Deductions Deduction Payment Cash NRWT NRFAI NRWT 1 1 Aug 2017 Arrangement commences -700 2 31 Mar 2018 Balance date 34.46 3 20 Jun 2018 NRFAI calculation date N/A – First year 4 31 Mar 2019 Balance date 54.31 5 20 Jun 2019 NRFAI calculation date 0 ÷ 34.46 = 0% = NRFAI triggered (34.36 + 54.31) x 10% - 0 = 8.87 6 31 Mar 2020 Balance date 58.32 7 20 Jun 2020 NRFAI calculation date Not required 5.83 8 31 Mar 2021 Balance date 62.63 9 20 Jun 2021 NRFAI calculation date Not required 6.26 10 31 Mar 2022 Balance date 67.27 11 20 Jun 2022 NRFAI calculation date Not required 6.72 12 30 Sep 2022 Maturity 1,000 0 13 20 Dec 2022 Maturity NRFAI calculation 2.30 14 31 Mar 2023 Balance date 23.01 Total 300 300 30 The balance date entries in #2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 14 represent income tax deductions available for the return period ending on that date. These may not be calculated until after this date, though the requirement to calculate and pay provisional tax may mean that the company does in fact calculate them earlier than the balance date. The same also applies for the later examples. The maturity NRFAI calculation in #13 is due on the due date for the NRWT return for the period two months after maturity even though the income tax deduction may not be calculated until sometime after balance date. As this arrangement has no regular interest payments, Company A would be aware from the outset that NRFAI would eventually arise. Therefore, it may elect to apply NRFAI from the commencement date which would result in an NRWT payment of $3.45 at #3 and the NRWT payment at #5 reducing to $5.43. Although this would be cashflow negative it may reduce compliance costs. 37 Example 2: Interest paid less than interest accruing Company B has a 31 March balance date and borrows NZ$1,000 from an associated non-resident on 2 April 2017. Company B will pay $60 of interest on 1 April each year and $1,300 upon maturity on 1 April 2022.

New Zealand borrowers that meet the requirements of section RF 12(1)(a) can pay AIL on a payment of interest that is NRPI. When AIL is paid, this NRPI qualifies for a zero-rate of NRWT. Back-to-back loans and multi-party arrangements Unlike some other areas of New Zealand’s tax legislation, the AIL rules do not “look through” to the ultimate lender to a New Zealand borrower. Leaving aside the possible application of the general anti-avoidance provision, this allows a New Zealand borrower to interpose one or more third parties into what would otherwise be a loan from an associated person. An example of this type of arrangement is a back- to-back loan. Arrangements have also been entered into that are not back-to-back loans in the conventional sense but which also involve indirect funding by a non-resident lender to a resident associated borrower without the imposition of NRWT, while maintaining an income tax deduction calculated under the financial arrangement rules. These back-to-back loans and multi-party arrangements are defined as “indirect associated funding”. Interest payments on indirect associated funding will be ineligible for AIL and New Zealand-resident (or New Zealand branches of a non- resident) borrowers will have to consider whether NRFAI arises if interest payments on indirect associated funding have an inappropriate amount of deferral compared with income tax deductions. Indirect associated funding arises when a non-resident associate of a New Zealand borrower provides funding, directly or indirectly, to a third party so it can be provided to the New Zealand borrower or to reimburse the third party for funds provided to the New Zealand borrower. This is also intended to apply to arrangements where part of the funding is provided by an associated non-resident and part is provided by the third party. This is achieved by treating any amount lent by or repaid to the associate as being lent directly to the New Zealand borrower rather than the third party. Any interest payments made by the New Zealand borrower to the third party are treated as being made by the New Zealand borrower to the third party as agent for the associate, to the extent they are attributable to money lent by the associate. The proposals in the bill are intended to capture all arrangements involving a New Zealand borrower, third party and an associated non-resident if there is some linkage between the two amounts of funding provided, but not arrangements where there is no linkage, other than the existence of a common third party. 42 Example: Commercial arrangement Foreign Parent Ltd has $1,000,000 on deposit with Australian Bank Ltd while its subsidiary, NZ Sub Ltd, has a $500,000 loan from Australian Bank Ltd NZ Branch. Both the deposit and loan are on commercial arm’s length terms so Foreign Parent is not considered to have provided this deposit so that Australian Bank could lend it to NZ Sub Ltd. Therefore, this is not indirect associated funding. Example: Back-to-back loan NZ Co Ltd has a $1,000,000 loan from NZ Bank Ltd on which it pays 5% interest. NZ Co Ltd’s parent, Aus Hold Co has a $700,000 deposit with NZ Bank Ltd on which it receives 4.9% interest. Bank lending documents show NZ Co Ltd pays this interest rate, instead of 6% charged to other borrowers, due to Aus Hold Co’s deposit. This arrangement is treated as a $700,000 loan from Aus Hold Co to NZ Co Ltd and a $300,000 loan from NZ Bank Ltd to NZ Co Ltd. NZ Co Ltd makes $50,000 annual interest payments to NZ Bank Ltd and NZ Bank Ltd makes $34,300 annual interest payments to Aus Hold Co. The first interest payment is treated as a $34,300 interest payment from NZ Co Ltd to NZ Bank Ltd as agent for Aus Hold Co on which NZ Co Ltd must withhold NRWT (and NZ Bank Ltd will be required to if NZ Co Ltd does not) and a $15,700 interest payment from NZ Co Ltd to NZ Bank Ltd which is treated in the standard manner (NZ Bank Ltd has an RWT exemption certificate so no RWT is withheld; however, this is assessable income to NZ Bank Ltd). The second interest payment from NZ Bank Ltd to Aus Hold Co is treated as not occurring so no NRWT or AIL is required. Example: Back-to-back loan through a cash pooling arrangement US Parent Ltd has a $10,000,000 loan to NZ Subsidiary Ltd on which the interest payments are subject to NRWT. NZ Subsidiary Ltd repays this loan by withdrawing from an account with US Bank Ltd. This account is part of a cash pooling arrangement with other members of US Parent Ltd’s group. US Parent Ltd uses the $10,000,000 repaid by NZ Subsidiary Ltd to put on deposit with US Bank Ltd in an account that is also part of the cash pooling arrangement. Because these amounts offset each other US Parent Ltd does not receive any interest from US Bank Ltd but neither does NZ Subsidiary Ltd pay interest to US Bank Ltd. NZ Subsidiary Ltd pays $100,000 per month to US Parent Ltd as part of a transfer pricing agreement which is a deductible funding cost to NZ Subsidiary Ltd. Currently this is not interest as US Parent has not lent money to NZ Subsidiary Ltd; section RF 12I will however treat this arrangement as a loan from US Parent Ltd to NZ Subsidiary Ltd and the $100,000 per month payment as an interest payment to US Bank Ltd as agent for US Parent Ltd from which NRWT must be withheld. 43 Example: Multi-party arrangement NZ Company Ltd borrows $1,000 from NZ Bank Ltd with $100 annual interest payments and the $1,000 repaid in five years. Immediately after this, NZ Bank Ltd sells the principal repayment to Aus Parent Company, the ultimate owner of NZ Company Ltd for $600. Under the proposals in the bill, this is treated as two separate financial arrangements, a 5-year $400 amortising loan from NZ Bank Ltd to NZ Company Ltd and a 5-year $600 bullet loan from Aus Parent Company to NZ Company Ltd as follows: From To Arrangement commences Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Total interest NZ Bank NZ Company -400 100 100 100 100 100 100 Aus Parent Company NZ Company -600 1,000 400 There is no equivalent amount paid by NZ Bank Ltd to Aus Parent Company so the $100 interest payments by NZ Company Ltd to NZ Bank Ltd are treated as payments of principal and interest between two New Zealand residents under the financial arrangements rules. The $1,000 final payment, whether paid directly to Aus Parent Company or paid to NZ Bank Ltd as agent for Aus Parent Company is treated as a $600 principal repayment and a $400 interest payment from NZ Company Ltd to Aus Parent Company, therefore NZ Company Ltd must withhold NRWT. However, as NZ Company Ltd is claiming financial arrangement deductions for funding provided by an associated non- resident, this arrangement will trigger NRFAI on which NRWT will be required to be paid over the term of the arrangement. Acting together The current non-association tests for accessing the AIL rules rely on the associated persons definition in subpart YB. One of the tests in the associated persons definition states that two companies are associated if a group of persons exists whose total voting interests in each company are 50 percent or more. This means that where two or more companies each have ownership interests of less than 50 percent in a New Zealand borrower, these companies will not be associated with that borrower unless they are themselves associated. Transactions have been identified where two or more non-associated persons (investors), each with less than 50 percent of ownership interests in a New Zealand borrower, together provide debt funding to that borrower under an arrangement. Even though these investors may be genuinely not associated (for example, three pensio n funds for quite different groups of employees) they may make decisions about the borrower collectively, and in economic substance, operate in a similar manner as if they were a single owner. By operating in this manner, the investors can make decisions in a similar manner to a single owner such as inserting high levels of debt (subject to thin capitalisation requirements) in proportion to their ownership interests and thereby receive a return on their total (equity + debt) investment with a large proportion of this being deductible in New Zealand. 44 This problem is not unique to the NRWT/AIL rules. Until recently, the same structure meant the thin capitalisation rules did not restrict the New Zealand borrower’s interest deductions. It is proposed that related party debt will include funding provided by a member of a non-resident owning body. This means • interest payments on this funding would be ineligible for AIL; and • where interest payments are inappropriately deferred compared wit h deductions, the arrangement may generate NRFAI. A non-resident owning body is an existing concept within the thin capitalisation rules. This was explained in greater detail in Tax Information Bulletin Volume 26, No 7, August 2014. In short, a non-resident owning body is a group of non-residents or entities described in section FE 2(1)(cc) to (db) (such as trusts settled by non- residents), that have one or more characteristics indicating they are acting together to debt-fund a New Zealand company. These characteristics include: • having proportionate levels of debt and equity among the group; • an agreement that sets out how the company should be funded with member- linked funding if the company is not widely held (a term defined in section YA 1); • member-linked debt in the company in a way recommended by a person (such as a private equity manager), or implemented by a person on behalf of the members. Proportionality is a characteristic of acting together as it generally requires a degree of coordination to achieve. More generally, proportionality is also a situation where shareholders are able to substitute debt for equity. This is because, where there is proportionality, the level of debt in a company does not change shareholders’ exposure to the risk of holding equity in the company or shareholders’ overall return. Due to the ability to structure an arrangement to achieve this outcome without explicit proportionate debt, the test is structured to cover transactions that may not have proportionate debt but can still be considered the result of acting together. Prepayments of interest (Clauses 261 and 330) A proposed transitional prepayment rule will prevent a company effectively continuing the current non-imposit ion o f NRWT beyond application of the new rules by prepaying interest on a financial arrangement before the new rules take effect. This situation may arise when a borrower will be required to withhold NRWT on interest on an arrangement that will be a related-party debt after the new rules come into force but is not currently paying non-resident passive income (for example, because of the onshore branch exemption) or is paying AIL on interest to an unassociated party (for example, as part of an arrangement that will be treated as a loan from persons who are associated with the borrower because they are acting together). The prepayment rule will compare the amount of interest paid with any financial arrangement deductions taken to the date the new rules apply. Any excess interest paid will be treated as being paid on the first day the new rules apply and will 45 therefore be liable for NRWT. Any AIL previously withheld on these interest payments will be refundable. Example NZ Co is owned 25 percent each by four non-resident private equity funds. NZ Co has been making interest payments to each fund of $100,000 per year and paying $2,000 of AIL on each interest payment. As NZ Co knows its owners will be treated as acting together when the new rules apply to their interest payments after 1 April 2017 they agree that on 1 January 2017 NZ Co will make a one off interest payment to each fund of $800,000 with no further interest payments until after 1 April 2027. NZ Co pays $16,000 of AIL on each of these payments in its January 2017 AIL return. On 1 April 2017 it is calculated that interest payments exceed deductions by $700,000 for each fund; therefore, NZ Co is treated as paying $700,000 to each fund on 1 April 2017 and only $100,000 to each fund on 1 January 2017. $70,000 of NRWT is required to be paid on behalf of each fund. NZ Co can apply to the Commissioner to have $14,000 of AIL refunded for the interest payment to each fund that is no longer treated as being paid on 1 January 2017. Interest payments by a member of a registered banking group (Clause 252) For a New Zealand bank that is part of a wider worldwide banking operation, there are commercial reasons why the New Zealand bank may borrow from its parent or another associated entity. This can include the better credit rating held by the larger parent, economies of scale of a single funding operation and/or better name recognition of the parent, which allows funding to be raised more cheaply. It can reasonably be considered that funding on-lent to a New Zealand bank by its parent is ultimately largely borrowed from an unrelated third party and not generally provided by the parent bank’s shareholders as a substitute for equity. By restricting the offshore and onshore branch exemptions, as covered by this bill, New Zealand banks will no longer be able to rely on these structures to remove their NRWT liability. In the absence of further changes, New Zealand banks would have a tax incentive to raise all funding from third parties so that AIL could be paid instead of NRWT even when, in the absence of tax, it would be economically efficient to borrow through an associated party. Proposed changes to section RF 12(1)(a)(ii) will allow a member of a banking group to pay AIL on interest payments to an associated non-resident. These changes will not be extended to non-banks, including other businesses operating in the financial sector. This is because, unlike other industries, banks already have a clear definition which removes boundary issues and provides confidence that related-party funding is not an economic substitute for equity investment. This is consistent with the current legislation where New Zealand-registered banks are subject to more rigorous thin capitalisation requirements and greater regulatory oversight by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, than other financial sector taxpayers. 46 AIL REGISTRATION PROPOSALS (Clauses 246, 294 and 330 to 332) Summary of proposed amendments Proposed changes to the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 will restrict securities an approved issuer will be able to register and therefore pay AIL on. These restrictions focus on the borrower, the lender and/or the size of the borrower’s interest payments to non-residents, to ensure that borrowers registering a security for AIL are highly likely to treat payments to associated non-residents correctly. These proposals will increase the integrity of the AIL rules while minimising additional compliance costs on compliant borrowers. Application date The proposed amendment will apply to securities registered on or after 1 April 2017. Securities registered before this date will apply the proposed rules on 1 April 2018. Key features To access the AIL rules, a New Zealand borrower must be an approved issuer, and must make a payment of NRPI to a non-associated person on a registered security. There are currently very few requirements for a person to become an approved issuer or to register a security. There is no legislative requirement that an approved issuer cannot register a security that is issued to an associated party, or pay AIL on such a security. It is simply that the payment of AIL will not prevent NRWT applying to the interest paid to an associated person. This means that it is relatively easy for New Zealand taxpayers to borrow from non- resident associates and claim NRWT zero rating. While this approach is not in accordance with current law it can only be prevented after being detected by Inland Revenue. Amendments to the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 will restrict who can register a security for AIL, with the aim of reducing the possibilities for deliberate non- compliance. Three categories under which a security can be registered are proposed. The first two categories would comprise lenders and borrowers who are highly unlikely to treat, incorrectly for tax purposes, a payment of interest as made to an associated person. The third category would comprise borrowers with sufficient scale that it would be more cost-effective for the transaction to be audited to confirm that the parties are not associated. The first two categories are New Zealand borrowers and non-resident lenders respectively who have not been observed to be treating associated party transactions incorrectly and where it is reasonably straightforward for Inland Revenue to independently verify that they are not associated with each other. The third category 47 covers New Zealand borrowers who make, or expect to make, interest payments of at least $500,000 per year to non-residents. Restructuring a registered security Under new section 86I of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971, securit ies registered under the first two categories may become ineligible for AIL. This will occur if, at the time the interest is paid, the directors of the borrower know or could reasonably be expected to know (without making enquiries specifically for the purpose of applying the section) that the security could not be registered if registration was sought on the date the interest was paid. It is possible that a registered security becomes ineligible for AIL through the operation of this provision and a further change (for example, in the identity of the ho lder of the financial arrangement) means registration would be possible if sought at that later date. In that case, the security will automatically become re-eligible for AIL on interest payments after that later date. This section is intended to prevent a borrower entering into a temporary structure to register a security, then restructuring it as soon as, or shortly after, registration is obtained. It is not intended to cover changes in the commercial structure of a lender that are beyond the control of, and frequently unknown to, a New Zealand borrower. Example Property Development Ltd, a closely held New Zealand company, with less than $500,000 of expected interest payments to non-residents, borrows $1m in each of three separate loan transactions. Loan 1 is $1m from Singapore Finance Ltd. Singapore Finance confirms that it lends to more than 100 customers so this security is registered. The day after the security is registered, Singapore Finance sells the loan to one of the directors of Singapore Finance and advises Property Development that future payments should be made to that director. Although Property Development and the director are not associated, neither party would meet the requirements in section 86G(2) or (3) so this security is no longer eligible to have AIL paid and NRWT must instead be withheld from any interest payments. Loan 2 is $1m from United Kingdom Finance Ltd. United Kingdom Finance confirms that it lends to more than 100 customers so this security is registered. The day after the security is registered, United Kingdom Finance sells the loan to a UK SPV, a company wholly owned by one of the directors of Property Development. UK SPV is not associated with Property Development. Even if UK SPV and United Kingdom Finance do not tell Property Development of the sale – for example, by United Kingdom Finance collecting payments as agent for UK SPV, it is reasonable to expect that Property Development should have known about this sale, so this security is no longer eligible to have AIL paid and NRWT must instead be withheld from any interest payments. Loan 3 is $1m from Australia Finance Ltd. Australia Finance confirms it lends to more than 100 customers so this security is registered. Six months after the security is registered, a number of Australia Finance’s borrowers have repaid their loans so that Australia Finance now only lends to 95 people. Property Development has not been notified of this, and could not be reasonably expected to know, so they can continue to pay AIL on this security. 48 This section does not apply to a security that is registered under the third category. Securities registered under the third category will continue to be eligible for AIL, even when the borrower’s interest payments to non-residents drops below $500,000 per year, provided the test was met at the time of registration. $500,000 interest category To qualify to register a security under this category, a borrower must have paid, or expect to pay, at least $500,000 interest to non-residents in the previous year, the current year or the next year. This test includes the next year to cover situations when new borrowing occurs near the end of the current year so that the next year may be the first one with a full year of interest expense. Registrations under this category may include relatively new businesses where there will be limited records available to confirm whether an expectation of over $500,000 of interest expense to non-residents is realistic. To prevent a borrower claiming they expect to pay over $500,000 of interest when they do not genuinely expect to, new section 86G(5) of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 gives the Commissioner the ability to cancel a registration from the date of registration if the original claim was not reasonable. Example NZ Borrower 1 Ltd borrows from an unassociated non-resident during the year ended 31 March 2018. None of the criteria in section 86G(2) or (3) are satisfied. NZ Borrower 1, however, claims they will pay over $500,000 in the year ended 31 March 2019 so the security is registered. In the year ended 31 March 2019, the interest rate NZ Borrower 1 pays falls from 8% to 5% so it makes interest payments of only $450,000. NZ Borrower 1 could not have predicted this fall in interest rates would reduce its interest expense to non-residents below $500,000 so this security continues to be registered and AIL is available on any interest payments. NZ Borrower 2 Ltd borrows from an unassociated non-resident during the year ended 31 March 2018. None of the criteria in section 86G(2) or (3) are satisfied. NZ Borrower 2, however, claims it will pay over $500,000 in the year ended 31 March 2019 so the security is registered. In the year ended 31 March 2019 NZ Borrower 2 pays interest to non-residents of $85,000. An Inland Revenue audit ascertains that NZ Borrower 2 had agreed to borrow $2m from the non-resident so could not have reasonably expected to pay over $500,000 of interest in the year ended 31 March 2019. The registration is cancelled at the date of registration and NZ Borrower 2’s NRWT returns are reassessed to include the interest payments to the non-resident. Transitional rules These rules are proposed to apply to all new registrations made on or after 1 April 2017. Any securities registered before this date will continue to be registered, so that AIL can still be paid on interest payments, consistent with the existing rules. However, on 1 April 2018, a borrower will have to consider whether their existing security would meet one or more of the new categories. 49 If the security does meet one or more of these categories it will follow the same new rules as a security registered under the new rules. This means that a new registration is not required but the borrower will be subject to the same restriction on paying AIL in section 86I if they know, or could reasonably be expected to know, that the registration requirements would not be met at the date of an interest payment. If the security does not meet one or more of the new categories it is treated as having its registration cancelled on 1 April 2018 and any interest payments after that date (whether or not to an associated person) would require NRWT to be withheld. Determinations New section 91AAU of the Tax Administration Act 1994 proposes to allow the Commissioner to issue determinations for certain categories of borrower, lender or transaction that will mean a security is eligible to be a registered security. The purpose of these determinations is so that additional categories can be added in a timely manner. These determinations are intended to cover categories that would have been included in the legislation at the time of its enactment, had those categories been considered and/or existed at that time. It is anticipated that, from time to time remedial legislation would be introduced to bring a category covered by a determination within section 86G. Taxpayer-specific determinations will not be given. Example Steve borrows $2m from a friend living in Island X. Steve is not a person described in section 86G(2), and the transaction is not within the categories in section 86G(3). Steve does not expect to pay more than $500,000 of interest to non-residents so cannot meet section 86G(4). However, Steve knows he is not associated with his friend and considers that all lenders from tax havens are likely to be equally trustworthy. Steve applies to the Commissioner for a determination that all securities with interest payments to a lender from a country listed in the former schedule 26 of the Income Tax Act 2007 should be eligible to register under section 86G(3(v). The Commissioner considers Steve’s request for a determination but considers that lending from residents of these countries is not highly unlikely to involve associated persons. The Commissioner does not issue a determination so Steve cannot register the security and is required to withhold NRWT on interest payments. 50 BRANCH LENDING PROPOSALS (Clauses 5, 83, 246, 247, 269, 270, 279, 329, 332 and 333) Summary of proposed amendments The bill proposes a number of amendments to the NRWT rules and the source rules that will ensure that interest payments from a New Zealand resident (or a New Zealand branch of a non-resident) to a non-resident will be subject to NRWT or AIL irrespective of whether that funding is channelled through a branch or an entity that has a branch. This will ensure that funding transactions that are economically equivalent will have a consistent tax treatment. Offshore branch exemption Changes to the source rules will apply NRWT or AIL to an interest payment from the offshore branch of a New Zealand resident to a non-resident to the extent that the offshore branch lends money to New Zealand residents. Onshore branch exemption Changes to the NRWT rules will apply NRWT or AIL to an interest payment from a New Zealand resident (or New Zealand branch of a non-resident) to a non-resident if that non-resident has a New Zealand branch, unless the interest is derived by the New Zealand branch. These changes will not apply to a New Zealand resident (or New Zealand branch of a non-resident) that pays interest to a non-resident that they are not associated with and that has a New Zealand branch that holds a banking licence. Onshore notional loans New subpart FG and changes to the NRWT rules will apply NRWT or AIL (to the extent it is not already) to a notional interest payment from a New Zealand branch of a bank to its head office. This interest payment will be equal to the amount already included in the branch’s financial statements and claimed as a deduction against New Zealand income of the branch. Application date For existing arrangements, the branch amendments will apply to interest payments on or after the date shown in the table below. For all other arrangements, the branch amendments will apply to interest payments on or after the day the bill is enacted. 51 The ability for a member of a banking group to pay AIL on an interest payment to an associated party will apply from the date of enactment. Further detail is provided on application dates under Key features below. Key features Offshore branch exemption (Clauses 5, 269, 270, 279 and 333) NRPI includes only income that has a New Zealand source. One of the exclusions from having a New Zealand source is the offshore branch exemption. This applies when the interest is derived from money lent outside New Zealand to a New Zealand resident that uses that money for the purposes of a business it carries on through a fixed establishment offshore. This exemption is intended to apply to a New Zealand resident operating an active business through a branch in another country. If that offshore branch borrows money to fund its offshore operations, the interest on this funding should not be subject to NRWT. This treatment ensures that the offshore branch of a New Zealand company does not have to pay NRWT when a foreign incorporated subsidiary borrowing for an equivalent business would not have to. However, this exemption also applies when a New Zealand company sets up an offshore branch that borrows money for the purpose of providing funding to New Zealand borrowers, who may be associated or unassociated with the New Zealand company. The following diagrams illustrate the current and proposed rules for the offshore branch exemption. Scenario Borrower Lender Application date Clause Intended regime Onshore branches Related party NZ Corporate Foreign associate with NZ Branch Royal assent 5(5) NRWT Intra-bank Group NZ Bank Sub Foreign parent with NZ Branch 5 years 5(4)(b) NRWT or AIL Intra-bank Entity NZ Bank Branch Foreign head office 2 years 83(2) NRWT or AIL Corporate NZ Corporate including NZ Bank Third Party with NZ Branch 5 years 5(4)(a) NRWT or AIL Third party bank NZ borrower Foreign bank with NZ Branch No change 247(1) - RF 2(1)(d) Net income tax Offshore branches Wholesale funding NZ Bank Sub branch Third parties or Foreign parent 5 years 5(6) NRWT or AIL 52 Current application of offshore branch exemption The proposed amendments will result in an interest payment by an offshore branch of a New Zealand resident to a non-resident having a New Zealand source to the extent that the branch lends to New Zealand residents. Offshore Branch NZ Company 2 NZ Company Foreign Lender OffshoreNZ Interest (NRWT ) Interest ( no NRWT – offshore branch exemption ) Interest (no NRWT – between NZ residents ) 53 Proposed application of offshore branch exemption It is possible for an offshore branch of a New Zealand resident to have a business that includes lending to New Zealand residents and other business conducted outside New Zealand. In this instance, any interest payments by the branch will be apportioned based on the proportion of branch assets that are financial arrangements producing New Zealand-sourced income. De minimis provisions apply where assets deriving New Zealand-sourced income are less than 5% or more than 95% of a branch’s assets. To ensure that interest payments by an offshore branch are appropriately subject to New Zealand tax, the payment of AIL will be mandatory on relevant interest payments unless NRWT is withheld. Grandparenting of the onshore branch exemption proposals The changes to the offshore branch exemption will apply to interest payments on arrangements entered into before the enactment of the bill after a grandparenting period of five complete income years post enactment. This reflects that these offshore branches have entered into commercial arrangements, frequently with unassociated Offshore Branch NZ Company 2 Offshore Branch NZ Company 2 Foreign Lender Offshore NZ Foreign Factory NZ Company Foreign Lender Interest ( no NRWT – offshore branch exemption) Interest (NRWT – offshore branch exemption does not apply) Interest (no NRWT – between NZ residents) 54 parties, for terms that usually do not exceed five years, and that have been ultimately used to fund New Zealand borrowing, which is also often at fixed interest rates. All other interest payments by offshore branches will apply the new rules from the date of enactment. Onshore branch exemption (Clauses 5 and 247) New Zealand-sourced interest income derived by a non-resident is not currently NRPI when the non-resident lender is engaged in business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment in New Zealand. This exemption from NRPI is known as the “onshore branch exemption”. This exemption applies irrespective of whether the lending is made through the New Zealand branch. As with the New Zealand branch income, this non-branch (but New Zealand-sourced) income is subject to New Zealand net income tax. This means it is possible for a non-resident parent to lend money to its New Zealand subsidiary with no tax payable on the interest (other than income tax on a very slim margin). The parent can simply lend the money to the head office of a non-New Zealand group company which has a New Zealand branch. The head office of that company can then lend the money to a New Zealand group company. The following diagrams illustrate the current and proposed rules. Current application of onshore branch exemption The onshore branch exemption is proposed to be narrowed so that it will only apply to interest payments derived by the New Zealand branch of a non-resident. Foreign Sub 2 NZ Branch Foreign Sub 1 NZ Branch NZ Sub Foreign Parent Offshore NZ Interest (no NRWT – onshore branch exemption) Interest (NRWT – NZ source) Interest (no NRWT – no NZ source) Interest (no NRWT – onshore branch exemption) 55 Proposed application of onshore branch exemption One exception to this is the onshore branch exemption will continue to apply if the non-resident lender has a New Zealand branch that holds a banking licence and is not associated with the borrower. This is predominantly to minimise compliance costs for individual borrowers who are not currently, but would otherwise under the proposal, be required to withhold NRWT or pay AIL on interest payments to foreign banks for mortgages over foreign properties. Proposed application of onshore branch exemption to borrowing from foreign banks Grandparenting of the onshore branch exemption proposals When a New Zealand resident is borrowing from an associated non-resident that has a New Zealand branch, these proposals will apply from the date of enactment. These are related party transactions and the parties have ample time and ability to structure out of them if they wish to do so. Foreign Sub 2 NZ Branch Foreign Sub 1 NZ Branch NZ Sub Foreign Parent Offshore NZ Interest (no NRWT – onshore branch exemption) Interest (NRWT – NZ source) Interest (no NRWT – no NZ source) Interest (NRWT – onshore branch exemption does not apply) Foreign Bank NZ Branch NZ Bank Sub NZ Borrower Offshore NZ Interest (NRWT – onshore branch exemption doesn’t apply) Interest (no NRWT – onshore branch exemption) 56 When the New Zealand resident is borrowing from an unassociated non-resident that has a New Zealand branch, or when the borrower is a bank, these proposals will apply after a grandparenting period of five years. This is because these are, directly or indirectly, with unrelated parties and reflect arm’s-length transactions that are frequently entered into for longer terms. Onshore notional loans (Clauses 83, 279, 329, 332(2) and 333) The proposed amendments aim to equalise the tax treatment between foreign banks that channel offshore funding through their New Zealand subsidiaries and foreign banks that channel offshore funding through their New Zealand branches. In both cases the subsidiary and the branch can claim a deduction for an interest expense on funding provided by their foreign operations (specifically, a notional interest expense in the case of the branch). But whereas the subsidiary has to pay NRWT (or AIL going forward under other proposed amendments in the bill) on its interest payment, the branch pays neither because there is no actual interest flow to the extent that its payment is to head office rather than to a separate company (because it is not possible for one part of an entity to make a legally recognised payment to another – the “payment” is merely a movement of funds). The following diagram illustrates the current rule once changes in the onshore branch exemption discussed above are incorporated. Current treatment of deemed loans This is an inconsistent result and has the potential to distort behaviour. Australia has rules which are similar, in substance, to this proposal. The Australian rules apply a 5% withholding tax to a notional interest payment by a branch to its head office. The bill therefore proposes applying 2% AIL to the notional interest payment to ensure the effectiveness of the other proposed branch reforms. Foreign Bank NZ Branch NZ Bank Sub Foreign lenders Offshore NZ Interest (AIL – onshore branch exemption will not apply) Interest (no NRWT – onshore branch exemption) Interest (no NRWT – no NZ source) Notional Interest (no NRWT – no payment) 57 The bill proposes that an amount that the head office makes available to the branch, that is recorded in the branch’s accounting records, is a notional loan from the head office to the branch. When the branch is allowed a deduction as an interest payment on that notional loan it will be a notional interest payment that can be subject to NRWT or AIL. Like the offshore branch proposals discussed above, these notional interest payments will require AIL to be paid if NRWT is not withheld. Grandparenting of the notional loan proposals A degree of grandparenting is appropriate as these notional loans have been used to provide funding at fixed rates to New Zealand borrowers. However, unlike the offshore branch exemption and onshore branch exemption proposals discussed above, funding allocated to the New Zealand branch cannot be identified from a specific loan that may have a fixed maturity date (otherwise it would already be subject to NRWT/AIL). These rules will therefore apply to existing arrangements after a grandparenting period of two years. 58 GST current issues 59 60 OVERVIEW The proposed amendments make a number of changes to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The changes will help ensure that GST continues to function as a tax on consumption in New Zealand, and cover matters where the legislation does not fully give effect to the policy intention or where technical changes could improve the way the system operates. The proposed amendments contain four key amendments, and relate to the following issues: • the deductibility of GST associated with the costs of raising capital; • the eligibility of large, partially exempt, businesses to agree an alternative method of apportionment; • the ability to take a deduction for secondhand goods, for goods composed partially of gold, silver and platinum; and • the ability to zero-rate services provided in connection with land in New Zealand. In addition, a number of other technical and remedial amendments are proposed. The majority of the proposals were included in the officials’ issues paper GST - Current issues, which was released for public consultation on 17 September 2015. The submissions received on the items were generally supportive of the suggested changes. In addition to the matters consulted on in GST - Current issues, amendments are also proposed to align the rules of accounting for GST in relation to prize co mpet itions with the practice of the bloodstock industry. Finally, a number of minor, remedial changes are also proposed, which will address obvious errors or other situations where the legislation does not give effect to the intended policy. 61 GST AND CAPITAL RAISING COSTS (Clause 311(4)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment will allow businesses to recover GST incurred on goods and services used to raise capital, to the extent that the capital funds their taxable activity. Application date The amendment will come into force on 1 April 2017. Key features The proposed amendment will enable businesses to recover costs incurred in raising capital to fund their taxable activities. New section 11A(1)(rb) will allow deductions for capital raising costs by treating certain supplies of financial services as zero-rated. These supplies will be zero-rated to the extent the funds raised are expended in an activity of making taxable supplies. The supply would not be zero-rated to the extent that the funds were put to other uses (for example, in capitalising an activity making exempt supplies). Apportionment of deductions Treating the supply of the financial service as partly or wholly zero-rated will result in an input tax deduction being available for part or all of the GST incurred on the goods and services used to make the supply. Some apportionment of deductions may be necessary under the apportionment rules where, for example, the funds will not be raised only for expenditure in a taxable activity, or where goods and services are used for other, non-taxable, purposes (such as making exempt supplies as well as taxable supplies). Subsequent adjustment of deductions These apportioned deductions may also need to be adjusted. As the financial services are zero-rated to the extent that they are used to capitalise a taxable activity, the adjustment is expected to follow the actual use. This may require adjustment of the apportioned input tax deductions claimed. For example, when the activity funded has a different taxable/exempt make-up to that expected, an adjustment to the initially apportioned deduction may be required, so that the deduction reflects the actual proportion of funds used in the taxable activity. 62 Financial services and persons covered The section applies to the following supplies, which are financial services under section 3(1): • the issue or allotment of a debt or equity security; • the renewal of a debt or equity security; • the payment of an amount of interest, principal or dividend under a debt or equity security; and • the provision or variation of a guarantee of the performance of obligations to do one of the above. The amendment will not apply when the registered person principally makes supplies of financial services, or to the extent that they have made an election to zero-rate business-to-business supplies of financial services, and a deduction is already available as a result of these rules. Example 1 ACo is a GST-registered company that owns and leases out residential and commercial land. As part of an expansion, it decides to acquire new residential and commercial properties. This will be funded by bond and share issues. It incurs $10,000 GST in purchasing goods and services to issue the bonds and shares. Eighty percent of the funds raised will be used to acquire properties, which will be used to make taxable supplies. Twenty percent of the funds will be used to acquire residential properties that will only be used to make exempt supplies of accommodation. ACo claims an input tax deduction of $8,000. One of the costs incurred by ACo was for a supply of printed material that was used to advertise the bond and share issue to potential investors. The value of this supply was $6,900 (inc $900 GST). ACo claimed an input tax deduction for $720 (80 percent of the GST incurred). As the estimated use differed from the actual use, ACo may need to make an adjustment to the claimed GST. Background When businesses raise capital, such as by issuing shares or bonds, they will generally make a number of exempt supplies. The business issuing the shares or bonds will consequently not be able to recover GST incurred in raising the capital. Exempting financial services helps ensure that their consumption is taxed. However, in certain situations, exemption does not lead to the right policy outcome. This is because exempting financial services arguably leads to tax cascades where the unrecoverable GST is embedded in the cost of the supplies. 63 The case of capital raising costs for businesses which generally make taxable supplies presents a similar situation, when there is a strong argument that the costs incurred in raising the capital (and associated unrecoverable GST) must be passed on in the cost of the supplies to customers, and or be borne by the business raising the capital, and thereby effectively taxed twice. 64 AGREED METHODS OF APPORTIONMENT AND ADJUSTMENT (Clauses 314(3), (4), (5), 315(2)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment will enable businesses to apply alternative methods of apportioning and making adjustments to input tax deductions, to address high compliance costs some businesses experience in applying the legislated approach. Application date The proposed amendment will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features The proposed amendment will enable businesses to apply alternative methods of apportioning and making adjustments to input tax deductions. The method will eit her be agreed with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue by the business, if the business has a turnover exceeding $24 million, or by an industry association. Agreed methods must be fair and reasonable, and take into consideration the outcomes that could be reached if the existing apportionment and adjustment rules were applied. Background While most supplies of goods and services in New Zealand are subject to GST, some are exempt. Exempt supplies are instead effectively taxed by denying deductions for the GST incurred by the business making the supply. In some cases, a business may incur GST on goods and services that it uses to make both taxable supplies and exempt supplies. The business will generally need to apportion the GST it incurs. The rules dealing with apportionment of GST and, if applicable, subsequent adjustment of apportioned deductions, allow GST to be deducted to the extent that the goods and services are used for making taxable supplies. Businesses make an apportionment upon acquisition of goods and services, generally with limited further adjustments. However, when the use of the goods or services differs from that estimated upon acquisition, the business may be required to adjust the claimed deduction. It may then be required to repay an amount of claimed deduction, or be able to claim a further deduction. In some cases, businesses may be required to perform a greater number of adjustments to apportioned input tax deductions, and may incur greater difficulty in applying these rules. 65 For example, retirement village operators may make both taxable and exempt supplies of accommodation in their villages, and the same unit may be used to make both kinds of supplies over its lifespan. As a consequence, the usage of a large number of goods and services acquired by the village may need to be individually tracked and adjustments made. This can give rise to high compliance costs. Detailed analysis The new provisions are intended to address the high compliance costs by providing an alternative method to the apportionment and adjustment rules, which provides a simpler alternative but reaches a similar outcome to that under the current legislation. New sections 20(3EB) and 21(4B) allow a registered person to use an alternative method of apportionment and adjustment. The method is required to have regard to the outcomes that would be reached if the apportionment and adjustment rules were applied. In some cases there may be a change in the timing of a deduction, and it is expected that the agreement would take account of the time value (for example, by reducing the deduction slightly to reflect this advantage). While the legislation does not provide a list of factors that an agreed method must take into account, it is expected that agreements would usually contain information such as the following: • all relevant business activities of the applicant; • the methodology proposed (for example, calculation based on turnover, floor space, time spent, number of transactions or cost allocations); • categories of costs that can be directly attributed to either taxable or non-taxable supplies, and categories of costs that relate to both taxable and non-taxable supplies; • the methodology proposed for significant one-off acquisitions such as land; • the method by which disposals of assets will be dealt with (for example, what input tax adjustments will be made); • any adjustments that will be made in relation to goods and services that have already been acquired, including those that are subject to the current apportionment rules, transit ional rules or old apportionment rules; • details of any proposed variations to the minimum number of adjustment periods for which adjustments will be made; • details of any proposed variations to the period in which adjust ments will be returned; and • an explanation of why the proposed methodology is fair and reasonable, and how it reflects the outcomes that could be reached under the apportionment rules. 66 Eligibility The proposed amendments allow two groups to agree an alternative method of apportionment and adjustment with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue: • businesses with a turnover exceeding or expected to exceed $24 million in a 12- month period; and • industry associations. Businesses exceeding the turnover threshold would be able to agree a method with the Commissioner, which would apply to their own activities. Industry associations would be able to agree methods that could be applied by persons in that industry. The Commissioner and association would need to agree, as part of the agreement, the persons or class of persons that are eligible to apply the method (with any necessary adaptations). The turnover threshold is intended to help ensure that the administration costs of the scheme are managed, by restricting the number of potential applicants. The amendments will also help ensure that businesses participating within an industry have access to a similar method. Incidental changes Clause 315(3) and (5) make incidental amendments to the provisions, updating cross- references to other sections. 67 SECONDHAND GOODS, AND GOLD, SILVER AND PLATINUM (Clause 304(3), (5) and (6)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment will allow deductions to be claimed under the rules applying to secondhand goods, for goods composed of gold, silver and platinum, and of a kind manufactured for sale to the public. This will be achieved by expanding the definition of “secondhand goods”, by narrowing the exception that applies to goods composed of gold, silver or platinum. Application date The proposed amendment will come into force on the date of enactment. It also enables businesses to claim deductions for goods acquired in the four years preceding the date of enactment. Key features The proposed amendment expands the definition of “secondhand goods”, to include goods composed of gold, silver or platinum, and of a kind manufactured for sale to the public. It achieves this by narrowing the exception for goods composed of gold, silver or platinum. The new definition continues to exclude goods which are, or to the extent they are, manufactured from these metals, but inserts an additional requirement. The exception will now be restricted to goods that are not of a kind manufactured for sale to the public. This will allow deductions to be claimed for the gold, silver or platinum content of a variety of goods, such as jewellery. The proposed amendment also includes an application clause so that deductions can be claimed for goods acquired in the four years preceding the date of enactment, or from an earlier period when the period was reassessed within that four-year period. The proposed amendment applies from the date of enactment, but also contains an application provision, so that the rule will apply to goods acquired in the four years before the date of enactment, or to goods that were subject to a reassessment within this time period (including a consequential override to section 89DA of the Tax Administration Act 1994, so that the reassessment can be effectively undone). This recognises that industry practice has been mixed, and ensures that businesses that have claimed the deductions are not subject to reassessments but also that compliant businesses are not disadvantaged. 68 Background Registered persons who acquire a supply of secondhand goods may claim an input tax deduction even when GST is not charged on the supply (for example, because the goods are acquired from a consumer). This deduction recognises that GST will have been incurred by the supplier, and that this is embedded in the cost of the secondhand goods to the registered person. One of the exceptions to this is for gold, silver and platinum. Goods composed of gold, silver and platinum are excluded from these rules in two circumstances: • when the good is a “fine metal”; and • to the extent that the good is composed of gold, silver or platinum. This first exception recognises that the GST system is designed so that goods that are “fine metal” should not generally be taxed. Gold, silver or platinum are “fine metal” when they are of a fineness of 99.5% and 99.0%, respectively. The second exception is due to an historic concern that the treatment of fine metal could give rise to a fiscal risk from the conversion of fine gold, silver or platinum into a lower purit y, non-fine form, by a non-registered person. Allowing a deduction for the non-fine form under the secondhand goods rules would potentially provide a credit for untaxed gold, and could produce a fiscal risk. While the exception to the secondhand goods rules for gold, silver and platinum should avoid this risk, it also may affect persons dealing in other goods, which pose a lower risk o f this kind of fraud. This potentially leads to the consumption of these goods being taxed multiple times, contrary to GST’s purpose. The level of compliance with the technical requirements of these rules is also understood to be relatively low, and that a number of persons may already have claimed and be claiming deductions for secondhand goods composed of gold, silver or plat inum. 69 SERVICES CONNECTED WITH LAND (Clause 311(1) and (3)) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment will ensure that a wider range of services, and in particular professional services that closely relate to land in New Zealand, are subject to GST. The amendment will similarly ensure that, when these services are provided in relation to land outside New Zealand, they are not charged GST. Application date The amendment will come into force on 1 April 2017. Key features The proposed amendment will expand the range of services that are subject to GST when they relate to land in New Zealand and are supplied to non-residents, or that are zero-rated where they relate to land outside New Zealand. This expands the existing rules which apply to services that are “directly in connection” with land. The amendment supplements this existing rule by adding an alternative test – when the services are supplied in connection with land and are intended to enable or assist a change in the physical nature, or ownership or other legal status of the land. Services with such a close connection to land are better seen as consumed where the land is located. The amendment ensures that the GST-treatment stems from the location of the land, rather than the location (or residence status) of the recipient of the services. Services relating to land in New Zealand Currently, section 11A(1)(k) applies to zero-rate services supplied to non-residents who are outside New Zealand at the time the services are supplied. This is subject to certain exceptions, which exclude situations where the services will be consumed in New Zealand. Section 11A(1)(k)(i)(A) excludes services that are “directly in connection” with land situated in New Zealand. Clause 311(3) amends this requirement, by expanding the services that will not be zero-rated under section 11A(1)(k). Under the amended test, the services will not be able to be zero-rated under this section, when: 70 • they are directly in connection with land or an improvement to the land, that is located in New Zealand (the current test); and • when they are in connection with land or an improvement to the land, that is located in New Zealand, and are intended to enable or assist a change in the physical condition, ownership or other legal status of the land or improvement. Services relating to land outside New Zealand Currently, section 11A(1)(e) applies to zero-rate supplies of services that are directly in connection with land outside New Zealand. Clause 311(1) amends this section so that the broader test applies. As well as maintaining the existing test, services supplied in connection with land outside New Zealand will also be zero-rated under this section when they are intended to enable or assist a change in physical condition, ownership or other legal status of the land. Application of the new test The requirement that the services be supplied in connection with land (as described under the amendments) is intended to discriminate between supplies that have a close connection with specific land (such as relating to the purchase of a specific property) and can therefore be regarded as consumed in New Zealand, and those that only relate to land more generally (such as seeking general advice on land law or the housing market in New Zealand). Under the proposed test, the services must be intended to enable or assist a change in the physical condition, ownership or other legal status of the land or improvement. The reference to “services intended to enable or assist a change in physical condition” ensures that services that form an integral part of a process of physically changing the land, but do not do so themselves, are captured. The inclusion of services intended to “enable or assist a change in the... ownership or other legal status of the land” is expected to apply to a variety of professional services such as legal or real estate agents’ services as part of a land transaction, where the ultimate outcome is to change the legal nature of the land but the services do not involve any physical change or connection to the land. 71 The following examples illustrate the proposed change, assuming all providers are GST-registered. Services connected with land in New Zealand Yasmine is a non-resident who intends to purchase land in New Zealand. She hires Blake to act as her agent in bidding or tendering for various open homes. One tender submitted by Blake is successful, so Yasmine engages Ralph, a lawyer, to act for her in the transaction. Ralph’s services are intended to enable or assist a change in the legal nature of the land – that is, for the land to be acquired by Yasmine. The services are therefore not zero-rated. Blake’s services are also intended to enable or assist a change in the ownership of specific land (albeit unsuccessfully in a number of cases). His services are therefore not zero-rated. Services connected with land outside New Zealand Marama is a New Zealand-resident lawyer who is engaged by Wiremu in relation to the purchase of a condo in Hawaii. Marama’s services are in connection with the land and are intended to enable a change in the legal nature of the land. Her services are therefore zero-rated, as the land is outside New Zealand. Wiremu’s residency status or location does not affect the application of the rule for services connected with land outside New Zealand. Services not connected with land Felix is a photographer based in New Zealand, who is hired by Stella to take photographs of historic sites and places of natural beauty. Stella is a non-resident who is outside New Zealand, and who will use the photographs for a book being compiled. While the services do relate to specific land, they are not intended to affect the physical or legal nature of the land, and the new rule will not apply. Felix must therefore zero-rate the supplies. Background New Zealand’s GST system is based on the destination principle, under which supplies of goods and services are taxed in the jurisdiction where the goods and services are consumed. This means services supplied to non-residents who are outside New Zealand will generally be zero-rated, as the services will be regarded as consumed overseas. An exception is when the service supplied is so closely connected with land that the location of the land is the most appropriate place of taxation. Services supplied to non-residents who are outside New Zealand are not zero-rated when the services are directly in connection with land situated in New Zealand. Similarly, services that are supplied directly in connection with land situated outside New Zealand will be zero- rated (charged with GST at 0%). 72 These rules for taxing land-related services are consistent with the “place of supply” rules set out in the OECD’s International VAT/GST Guidelines. The Guidelines suggest that taxing rights over certain services connected with land may be allocated to the jurisdiction where the property is located. In particular, the Guidelines suggest that this treatment may be appropriate for: • supplies of immovable property itself or the right to use that property; • supplies of services physically provided to the immovable property itself; and • other supplies of services with a very close, clear and obvious link or associat ion wit h the property. However, the interpretation of the current “directly in connection” legislative test potentially results in a number of services in the third category above failing to satisfy the test. This results in the GST treatment of these services instead being determined by other rules, despite their very close connection with the land. This may result in the non-taxation of services that are consumed in New Zealand or the taxation of services consumed outside New Zealand. In particular, this may apply to professional services such as architectural, real estate or legal services, which are supplied with the intention of facilitating a change in the legal or physical nature of the land, but do not involve a more physical intervention with the land. In addition, the New Zealand rules are not aligned with the international approach, and this lack of alignment gives rise to a risk of the services being taxed in more than one jurisdiction, or not being taxed in any jurisdiction at all. 73 SUPPLIES OF LAND LEASES (Clauses 311(3) to (6) and 315(7)) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments address technical issues with the current rules that determine when commercial leases are excluded from the compulsory zero-rating of land rules or when certain other supplies are zero-rated. In addition, the new rules will be extended to supplies of land to GST-registered non-profit bodies, so that the supply is zero-rated in circumstances when the non-profit body would ordinarily be able to deduct GST incurred. Application date The amendments apply on and from 1 April 2011, except the amendment extending the rules to non-profit bodies, which will co me into force on the date of enactment. Key features The proposed amendments comprise four changes: • ensuring that a supply from landlord to tenant, as part of a lease surrender arrangement, is zero-rated; • reworking the test for whether an arrangement is a commercial lease, and therefore not a supply of land under the compulsory zero-rating of land rules, so that: - it applies to a supply under an agreement that provides for periodic payments, rather than when the land is supplied periodically; and - the position is retained so that when payments under the lease (other than regular lease payments) are anticipated not to exceed 25 percent of total consideration payable under the lease, the supply is not a supply of land under section 11(1)(mb). However, when this threshold is exceeded (for example, because the payment is higher than anticipated), the treatment of past payments is not affected; • ensuring that the procurement by a third party of a lease by way of novation (substituting a new lease with a new tenant for an existing lease, with the agreement of all the parties) is standard rated; and • where land is supplied to a non-profit body, for use other than in making exempt supplies, the supply may be zero-rated under section 11(1)(mb). The amendments ensure that the rules operate consistently with the policy intent to zero-rate commercial land transactions, by clarifying that certain transactions fall within the rules or correcting technical issues with the way the rules capture certain transactions. 74 The original policy intent was that the surrender of a lease would be a zero-rated supply of land. While the surrender of the lease is caught by existing section 11(8D)(a), the section does not zero-rate the landlord’s surrender of their contractual right to payment. New section 11(8D)(ab) provides that this is treated as a supply of land for the purpose of the compulsory zero-rating of land rules. New section 11(8D)(b) addresses two shortcomings of the current provision which ensures that certain supplies are not supplies of land for the purpose of the compulsory zero-rating of land rules. First, the current provision applies if the supply is made periodically. This has been replaced with a requirement that the supply is made under an agreement that provides for periodic payments. Leases may be subject to various rules around the time of supply, and when the lease provided for periodic payments to be made it was arguable that each payment was in relation to a separate supply, and therefore the supply of land was not made periodically. Secondly, new section 11(8D)(b) excludes a lease from the compulsory zero-rating of land rules if payments under the lease that are not regular rent payments are anticipated to not exceed 25 percent of the total consideration payable under the lease. If a payment does in fact exceed this amount (for example, if it is a contingent payment, or an un-quantified payment), then the payment and future payments under the lease are zero-rated. This replaces the current test, which arguably changed the treatment of past supplies to be zero-rated. New section 11(8D)(c) clarifies the GST treatment of agreements to procure a lease. The current rule is intended to apply to arrangements when a lease is novated – where, by agreement of all the parties, an existing lease between landlord and tenant is replaced with a new lease between the landlord and a new tenant – and the incoming tenant provides consideration to the outgoing tenant. This may occur because the lease could not be assigned. The existing section may not achieve this outcome. Under proposed new section 11(8D)(d) a GST-registered non-profit body would be treated as acquiring the land for the purpose of making taxable supplies, except to the extent it is acquiring it for making exempt supplies, for the purpose of the compulsory zero-rating land rules. This means that the non-profit body can provide a section 78F statement, and the supply may be zero-rated. Where the non-profit body is using the land partially to make exempt supplies, it may be required to account for output tax under section 20(3J) for the amount of GST it would have incurred, that it could not have deducted. Consistent with the general rule allowing non-profit bodies to recover GST, the rule only applies to GST-registered non-profit bodies that are resident in New Zealand. Background Compulsory zero-rating of land The compulsory zero-rating of land rules treat certain supplies of land as zero-rated rather than taxable. The rules were introduced to help combat phoenix fraud whereby 75 a supplier of land, generally supplied to a related-party, absconds or is wound up without returning GST, but the purchaser is still entitled to a deduction. Most transactions that are, economically, a supply of commercial land are captured by the rules. An exception is a commercial lease, which, to reduce compliance costs, is excluded unless it possesses the less usual feature of irregular large lump sum payments, which could suggest it could be substitutable for a transfer of land. Non-profit bodies Non-profit bodies are generally able to recover all GST they incur, except to the extent they incur the GST in making exempt supplies. This enables them to recover GST that relates to a non-profit activity that is not a taxable activity. However, the compulsory zero-rating of land rules do not apply in this way, and a non-profit body acquiring land outside the course of their taxable activity would instead be required recover the GST it incurred. 76 TIME OF SUPPLY WHEN CONSIDERATION IS UNKNOWN (Clause 308) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment provides a method for suppliers to account for GST on supplies of goods and services when the consideration payable (and therefore the amount of GST that must be accounted for) is not known at the time of supply. It will enable the supplier to account for GST to the extent that payment is made or an invoice for a payment is issued. This extends an existing rule and provides a practical way of accounting for GST. Application date The amendment will come into force on the date of enactment, and also applies to supplies before that date, when a business has previously accounted for GST consistently with the amendment. Key features The amendment proposes to treat a supply where the total consideration is not known at the time of supply, as more than one supply. A supply is treated as being made when payment is made or an invoice is issued. This will enable the supplier to account for GST to the extent that the consideration is or becomes known. It is understood that some registered persons may have accounted for GST in this way in the past. While an existing rule applies in some circumstances, it may have been applied to supplies of goods or services that were not technically covered, as a practical way of dealing with the situation. The amendment will therefore apply to past supplies when a person has taken that approach. Background The “time of supply” determines when a registered person must account for GST on a supply of goods and services. The time of supply will generally be when any payment is made, or when an invoice is issued in relation to the supply, whichever is earlier. In certain situations, a special rule may apply instead to determine the time of supply. One situation is when goods are supplied under an agreement, and the consideration payable is not known at the time goods are appropriated under the agreement. An example could be when the consideration payable depends on a subsequent event, such as the quality of the goods being ascertained and the value determined. 77 When this exception applies, the supplier can instead treat the supply as multiple supplies, in relation to any payment made or invoice issued. This enables a person to return GST or issue a tax invoice, to the extent the payment is known. The current provision is relatively limited, and does not apply to all supplies of goods or to any supply of services. However, similar issues could arise in these cases, which could give rise to difficulties in correctly returning GST or providing tax invoices. 78 GOODS AND SERVICES CONNECTED WITH EXPORTED BOATS AND AIRCRAFT (Clauses 310(1), (2) and 311(2)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment will align the tax treatment of goods and services provided in relation to newly purchased boats and aircraft that are to be exported under their own power, with those provided for temporarily imported boats or aircraft. Goods that are incorporated into, or consumed as part of a process of modifying to-be- exported boats or aircraft, will not be subject to GST. Similarly, services provided directly in connection with these boats or aircraft will also be zero-rated. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of the bill’s introduction. Key features The amendment comprises two key features. The supply of a boat or aircraft that is exported under its own power within 60 days is a zero-rated supply. The first amendment will likewise zero-rate goods and services that are provided in close connection with these boats and aircraft. This will effectively align the treatment of goods and services supplied in close connection with newly supplied boats and aircraft with similar goods and services supplied in close connection to temporarily imported boats and aircraft. The second amendment will enable persons who cannot export the boat or aircraft within the prescribed 60-day time period, due to the acquisition of these goods or services, to apply for an extension to the time period. Clause 310(1) amends section 11(1)(k) to provide that a supply of goods is zero-rated when the goods are supplied closely in connection with goods that are: • imported under a temporary import entry; or • that are supplied from outside New Zealand, destined for outside New Zealand and do not leave the craft on which they are embarked. To qualify for zero-rating, the goods must be incorporated into the boat or aircraft, or be used up or become worthless as part of servicing the boat or aircraft. Clause 311(2) inserts new section 11A(1)(ib) so that services that are provided directly in connection with the boats or aircraft will be zero-rated. 79 Clause 310(2) amends section 11(8). This section provides for the 60-day period in which export of a boat or aircraft must take place (if the supply of the boat or aircraft is to be zero-rated) to be extended. The period may be extended by the Commissioner if the inability to export the boat or aircraft within the prescribed period relates to the recipient acquiring goods incorporated into the boat or aircraft and services directly in connection with the boat or aircraft. Alternatively, the Commissioner may extend the period if circumstances beyond the control of the supplier and purchaser have prevented or will prevent export within the 60-day period (consistent with the current rule). Background In addition to zero-rating goods that are entered for export by the supplier, a boat or aircraft may be zero-rated if it is supplied to a person who exports it under its own power to a place outside New Zealand. Export must take place within 60 days of the recipient taking possession, although this time period may be extended when circumstances outside the control of the supplier and recipient prevent export within this timeframe. Another example is supplies of goods that are incorporated into temporarily imported goods, or services provided directly in connection with such goods. These goods and services are zero-rated as they will be consumed outside New Zealand, when the good is re-exported. This last exception means that goods and services provided in respect of temporarily imported boats and aircraft can be zero-rated. However, this exception does not strictly apply to boats and aircraft that are exported under their own power. This leads to potentially different treatments applying, based on whether a boat or aircraft has been purchased in New Zealand and is exported overseas, or whether it was brought in as a temporary import, before leaving New Zealand again. 80 SIX-MONTHLY FILING (Clauses 312 and 313) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment addresses technical issues with the eligibility to file 6- monthly, and introduces a self-assessed “one-off” exception that replaces the current discretion to allow a person to file 6-monthly, even if they do not satisfy the threshold. Application date The proposed amendment will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features The proposed amendment makes technical changes to the rules that govern eligibilit y to file six-monthly. In particular, the changes: • ensure that a person is eligible to file 6-monthly when they make seasonal supplies, regardless of whether they exceed the turnover threshold; • clarify that a person who exceeds the turnover threshold for 6-monthly filing must change their taxable period; and • replace the current discretion for 6-monthly filing with a “one-off” exception, which enables a business to continue to file 6-monthly when the threshold is exceeded. First, clause 312 amends section 15(2), which determines eligibility to file 6-monthly. New section 15(2) expands eligibility under the section to a larger group. A person may now have a 6-month taxable period when they make or are likely to make no more than $500,000 of taxable supplies in a 12-month period (the current test). A person is also eligible if they make most or all of their supplies within a period of 6- months or less, that falls near the end of the 12-month period. This last requirement is intended to allow businesses that make almost all their supplies in a single season, and prepare accounts at the end of the season, to file 6- mo nthly. Secondly, clause 313(2) amends section 15C(2) and introduces new section 15C(2B). These sections address the requirements around changing a taxable period. The amended section 15C(2) will require a person to change their taxable period fro m a 6-month period, when they exceed the threshold for 6-month filing and the exception for seasonal businesses does not apply. The person must change at the end of the next taxable period ending with or after the 12-month period when they do not meet the criteria. To do so, they will need to apply to file either 1-monthly or 2- 81 monthly before the end of the current period, so that it takes effect at the end of the current period. New section 15C(2B) overrides this requirement. It relieves a person of the requirement to change their taxable period where they are likely to not exceed the threshold in the following taxable period. For this exception to apply, the person must not have relied on the exception in the immediately preceding 12-month period. Background A GST-registered person’s taxable period determines the frequency with which they must file GST returns. Taxable periods must be 1-month, 2-months or 6-months, and certain rules govern when a person may or must have a taxable period of a certain length. A person whose taxable supplies exceed or are likely to exceed $24 million in a 12- mo nth period, must have a 1-month taxable period. Alternatively, any registered person may choose to have a 1-month taxable period. A person who is not required to have a 1-month taxable period may have a 2-mont h taxable period or, if their taxable supplies do not exceed and are not expected to exceed $500,000 in a 12-month period, they may choose to file 6-monthly. A person may change their taxable period to a different period, if they meet the criteria, by giving notice to the Commissioner. The change takes effect from the end of the current period. Currently, the Commissioner has discretion to allow registered persons, whose taxable supplies exceeded the $500,000 threshold, to file 6-monthly. When the rules were amended in 2006, this provision was not fully updated and there are a number of shortcomings with the current provisions. First, there is a list of criteria the Commissioner must consider, when directing a change of a person’s taxable period. The reference to directing a change in taxable period relates to the legislative approach before 1 October 2007, when the Commissioner directed changes to a person’s taxable period. (These instead now take place “automatically”, as above.) The criteria are also unconnected to any other requirement – so it is unclear how they are to apply. The criteria were intended to enable the Commissioner to allow a person who exceeded the threshold to file 6-monthly if they had a good compliance history, and other factors meant that they ought to be able to continue filing 6-monthly. For example, the person may unexpectedly exceed the threshold, or may make most or all of their supplies in a single season and prepare accounts at the end of the season. Secondly, the criteria relate to directing a change in taxable period – they arguably do not allow a person to continue to file 6-monthly if they exceed the threshold. There is also no provision that explicitly sets out obligations to change to a different taxable period when the threshold for 6-monthly filing is breached. 82 NOTIFICATION A REFUND IS BEING WITHHELD (Clause 322) Summary of proposed amendment Under the proposed amendment, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will have 15 working days to issue a notification that she was investigating the circumstances of a return or requesting further information. This will replace the current requirement that the notice must be received wit hin 15 working days. Application date The amendment will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features The amendment alters the requirement that the Commissioner give notice where she wishes to withhold a claimed GST-refund, pending further investigation of the return or requested information. The amendment will change the timing requirement so that the Commissioner must instead issue the notice or request to the person within the 15- working day period. Background When a person provides a GST return that is in a refund position, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue must provide a refund either within 15 working days or on the day following the day on which she has investigated the circumstances of a return, or reviewed the information requested, and is satisfied that the claimant has complied with their obligat ions. Section 46(5) applies when the Commissioner intends to investigate the circumstances of a return, or withhold a claimed refund pending the provision of an outstanding return. It provides that she must notify the registered person within 15 working days following the day on which the return is received. Section 46(4) applies when the Commissioner requests information concerning a return. She must give the request within a period of 15 working days following the day on which the return is received. The effect of giving notice or a request under either subsection is to enable the Commissioner to withhold the refund past the 15-working day time limit, pending her review or investigation, and her being satisfied that the claimant has complied with their obligat ions. 83 The Court of Appeal considered the timing requirements under these subsections in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Sea Hunter Fishing Ltd (2002) 20 NZTC 17,468. They were considered to apply when the person received the notice, or would have received the notice in the ordinary course of the postal schedule (as provided for under the Tax Administration Act 1994). Determining the timing based on when the notice is received creates uncertainty regarding whether a notice or request is issued in time. It also creates dependence on the postal schedule, and is affected by changes to delivery times. The amendment is not expected to alter the times by which taxpayers receive refunds, the overwhelming majority of which are released without the legislative processes for undertaking further investigation or seeking information being taken. The amendment is intended to help ensure more time is available for the tiny minority that are subject to further inspection, and to conduct further checks without entering into the formal process. 84 ALIGNMENT OF THE TIME PERIOD TO REPAY OVERPAID GST (Clause 321) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to refund overpaid tax after the expiry of the four-year period, when the person overpaid GST in the relevant period and there has not been an amendment to the assessment. This matches the treatment when an assessment has been amended or was in a net refund position. Application date The proposed amendment will come into force on the date of enactment. A transitional rule will ensure the amendment applies to claims received before the date of enactment. Key features The proposed amendment will allow the Commissioner to refund an amount of overpaid tax, within a four-year period following the expiry of the original four-year period in which overpaid tax must be refunded. The amendment applies where the application is received in or before the second four- year period, and the overpayment is due to a clear mistake or simple oversight, and the return. The proposed amendment also contains a transitional provision that ensures that the Commissioner may repay an amount in respect of existing claims, regardless of when the bill is introduced. This is intended to help ensure that the timing of a remedial amendment does not affect a person’s entitlement. Under this provision, the Commissioner could provide a refund when an application was received before the date the bill receives royal assent, so long as it was received within four years of the expiry of the original four-year period. The overpayment must still be as a result of a clear mistake or simple oversight. Background The Commissioner must refund an amount of overpaid GST, or pay an amount which a registered person could have deducted but did not, if she is satisfied that the person overpaid tax or did not receive their full refund entitlement. The payment must occur within a four-year period, applying from the end of the year in which a reassessment occurred or an amount was repaid, or within the general four-year time bar. 85 The Commissioner may also refund an amount after the expiry of this four-year period, within another four-year period. However, the overpayment (or failure to receive the full refund entitlement) must be due to a clear mistake or simple oversight. The addit io nal four-year period is also limited to when a person has been reassessed and overpaid tax, or when they have not received their full refund entitlement. It does not apply when the original assessment resulted in a GST liability and was not amended. 86 AGENTS ACTING FOR PURCHASERS (Clauses 320 and 326) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment will allow agents acting on behalf of purchasers and principals to opt out of the agency rules for a supply made to the principal. Opting out will allow the parties to account for GST as though the supply was two supplies: between the supplier and agent, and between the agent and principal. Application date The amendment will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features Clause 326 will allow agents and principals to opt out of the agency rules for a supply made to the principal. Opting out will allow enable the parties to account for GST as though the supply was two supplies: between the supplier and agent, and between the agent and principal. The agent and principal would need to agree in writing to treat a supply, or class of supplies, in this way. Clause 320 prevents a bad debt deduction being claimed for the supply by an agent to a principal. This would prevent the agent from claiming a deduction when they have made a supply to the principal, and the principal has not repaid them. This exception is intended to ensure that the amendment does not have an effect beyond helping to ensure that agents and principals do not need to update their systems and incur compliance costs in doing so. Under the existing rules, an agent would not be able to claim a deduction when they go unpaid by their principal. Background For GST purposes, when a supply is made by or to an agent acting on behalf of a person, the supply is treated as being made by or to the principal, rather than the agent, subject to a number of exceptions. In 2013 an “opt-out” to the agency rules was introduced for agents making supplies on behalf of their principal. The amendment enables an agent and their principal to agree to instead treat the supply as a supply between principal and agent, and then between agent and purchaser. 87 This addressed an issue when the agent’s and supplier’s accounting systems would automatically issue a tax invoice when they supplied the goods, potentially breaching a rule allowing only a single invoice to be issued for a supply. A similar issue can arise for agents making purchases on behalf of their principals, when multiple invoices are also issued, contrary to the GST legislation. This could occur, for example, when the agent also makes supplies on their own behalf for which they would need to issue a tax invoice. 88 ADJUSTMENTS AND EXPORTED GOODS (Clause 315(1)) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment provides that a non-resident who incurs GST when they import goods, and who subsequently re-exports the goods, does not need to make further adjustments to the claimed input tax deductions. Application date The amendment will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features New section 21(2)(ab) exempts a non-resident who incurs GST under section 12(1), when they import goods for home consumption, from the need to make adjustments to a claimed deduction. The exception applies when the non-resident has exported the goods in or before the adjustment period, and has disposed of them overseas or holds them overseas. This effectively allows the non-resident to retain the claimed GST. Background Under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, registered persons may recover input tax incurred on goods and services to the extent that the goods and services are used to make taxable supplies. This use must be periodically reviewed, and when the use differs from the estimated use or a previous adjustment, the registered person may be able to claim a further deduction or must repay some or all of a claimed deduction. Most supplies by New Zealand residents, other than exempt supplies, will be treated as taxable supplies (although GST may not in fact be charged on them if they are zero-rated). Consequently, most New Zealand resident businesses will be able to recover all the GST they incur, regardless of where the goods are used. However, not all non-exempt supplies by non-residents will be taxable supplies. Supplies of goods situated outside New Zealand at the time of supply fall outside the legislative framework. This leads to a potential issue when a GST-registered non-resident imports goods for sale in New Zealand, and pays GST to New Zealand Customs Service. While the importer may be able to deduct this GST, if the good cannot be sold and is instead exported for sale overseas, they are arguably effectively taxed under the adjustment rules by the claw-back of the claimed deductions. 89 CROSS-BORDER BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS NEUTRALITY REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS (Clause 324) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments make two changes to the non-resident registration rules that allow businesses outside New Zealand to register and recover GST they incur. The amendments relate to the associated base protection rules. The first amendment will ensure that a non-resident cannot register under these rules when they make supplies that are consumed in New Zealand. The second amendment will ensure the correct taxation of services consumed in New Zealand by allowing a non-resident who only incurs GST paid to New Zealand Customs Service to register under these rules. Application date The amendments will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features New section 54B(1)(c) replaces the current requirement with updated wording. Section 54B(1)(c) prevents a person who supplies services that will ultimately be consumed in New Zealand from registering under the non-resident registration rules. Currently, section 54B(1)(c) prevents registration where it is reasonably foreseeable that the services will be received in New Zealand by a person who is not a registered person. The proposed new section will prevent registration when the person receives the services other than in the course of making taxable or exempt supplies. This would ensure the correct treatment when services are reasonably foreseeably received by registered persons in a personal capacity. The proposed new wording is aligned with section 11A(2), which addresses a similar concern. The second amendment relates to the requirement that for a person to register non- resident registration rules, their first input tax credit claim must be likely to exceed $500 (section 54B(1)(b)). Under new section 54B(1)(b), the relevant criteria will also allow a person to register if the GST they incur is likely to only be levied in relation to the importation of goods that are received by another person or that the person delivers to another person (under section 12(1)). 90 This addresses a situation where unrecoverable GST could be incurred by a business that operates only as an importer. The effect of the 2014 amendment was to treat GST paid to New Zealand Customs Service on the import of goods, by a non-resident registered under these rules, as incurred by the recipient of the goods. This ensured that the rules could not be used to avoid the taxation of goods consumed in New Zealand. A side effect of this requirement was that a non-resident who only incurred this GST would be unable to register, as they would not have GST to recover (since it would instead be attributed to the recipient of the goods). However, as they could not register, the attribution rule did not apply, and they incurred the GST themselves. This led to a situation where the GST would be unrecoverable. The amendment allows the non-resident to instead register in this situation, so that the attribution rule can apply. Background In 2013, special rules were introduced to enable non-resident businesses to voluntarily register for GST (despite not carrying on a taxable activity in New Zealand) and recover GST they incur. As GST is a tax on the final consumption of goods and services, these rules were intended to help ensure that GST was not a cost for non-resident businesses and better ensure neutrality for cross-border business-to-business supplies. These rules included a number of special rules to help ensure the integrity of the GST system. One special rule was to prohibit registration when the applicant made supplies that would ultimately be consumed in New Zealand. Another special rule, introduced in 2014, treats GST paid to the New Zealand Customs Service by a non-resident registered under these rules, for imported goods to be delivered to a New Zealand resident purchaser, as being paid by the recipient of the goods. 91 GROUPING LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS (Clause 325(2)) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment ensures that limited partnerships can apply the grouping rules and file a joint return with other registered persons who share common control. Application date The amendment will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features The amendment allows limited partnerships to apply the test for persons other than companies, to form a GST-registered group. This recognises that while limited partnerships are treated as companies for GST purposes, the grouping test that applies to companies does not apply well to limited partnerships. It is more appropriate to apply the alternative “control” test that applies to other persons. Background Groups of registered persons can make an election to file a joint return for GST purposes. The effect of forming a group is that a representative member is treated as making or receiving all supplies that were made or received by the other members. The representative member files a return that includes all the members’ supplies. All members are liable for the joint return. There are two alternative tests for determining eligibility to form a group. Companies may form a group if they are a group, or part of a group, of companies under section IC 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (subject to other requirements). Alternatively, a group of persons that does not consist only of companies may form a group if a common control test is satisfied. Limited partnerships are treated as companies for the purpose of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, but are generally not companies for the purpose of the Income Tax Act 2007. This leads to a situation where a group of registered persons composed of limited partnerships and companies cannot form a group because: • they would not be a group of companies, or part of a group of companies under the Income Tax Act 2007, as they include limited partnerships; and • each member of the group is a company for GST purposes, so they cannot apply the alternative test. 92 The amendment allows a group of persons composed of a limited partnership and other limited partnerships and/or companies to apply the alternative test to form a GST-registered group. 93 HORSE RACING AND PRIZES (Clauses 306(3) and 309) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment codifies a practice of accounting for GST on race winnings used by the racing industry. Application date The amendment will apply beginning on 1 April 2012. Key features New section 5(11CB) treats a prize received by a horse owner as consideration for a supply of services provided to the racing club. The new section will apply when a registered person is carrying on the racing in the course of a taxable activity. As such, it is intended to codify the industry practice of treating winnings paid to registered horse owners, who enter the race in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity, as consideration for a taxable supply. It is not intended to alter the treatment of other persons, including causing an activity (which is not a taxable activity) carried on by a person to become a taxable activity. It is also proposed that section 10(14) be amended, so that a supply under new section 5(11CB) does not change the calculation of the consideration payable under the formula. The formula in section 10(14) determines the consideration for a prize competition, based on the amounts received less the prizes paid in money. Treating the prize as consideration for a supply means that the prize can be increased by the amount of the GST, without any economic change in the amount received by the winner or cost incurred by the racing club. The “prizes paid” amount is decreased by the input tax deductible by the organiser, so that the amendment does not unintentionally affect the calculation of consideration under the formula. Background There has been some historic uncertainty about how GST applies within the horse racing industry. A practice has developed of treating a prize paid to a winner as consideration for a supply. When the winner is a registered person and enters the race in the course of their taxable activity, they would charge GST and issue the racing club a tax invoice. The racing club would then claim a deduction based on this invoice. 94 This arrangement is GST-neutral, as any GST charged by the winner would be deducted by the racing club. The prize can be increased by the GST payable, so that the same posit ion is reached. However, as the prizes may not in fact be consideration for a supply, there is doubt whether this practice is technically correct. The proposed amendment applies to a registered person who enters a horse in a race, in the course of a taxable activity. If the person wins a prize, they are treated as making a supply to the race organiser. The prize is treated as being consideration for the supply. A consequential amendment ensures that a formula within the Act continues to operate correctly. The formula determines the GST payable for payments to enter the compet it ion. 95 BODIES CORPORATE (Clause 317) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment proposes to alter the application date of a “saving” provision that applies to past tax positions taken by members of unregistered bodies corporate, to claim deductions for supplies acquired by the body corporate. Application date The amendment will apply on and after 1 October 2011, which is the date of application of the original savings provisio n. Key features The amendment extends the application period of a saving provision that was introduced in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Act 2016. The provision preserved tax positions taken by GST-registered members of an unregistered body corporate to claim deductions for GST incurred by the body corporate. The saving provision applies to supplies acquired by the body corporate on or before 26 February 2015, and in a taxable period ending on or after 1 November 2010. A small number of businesses are now understood to have fallen outside the original provision, due to the technical requirements of the provision. The amendment extends the application period of the saving provision to include taxable periods ending before or including 3 November 2015 (the date the savings provision was introduced by SOP) and beginning after 1 November 2010. This will help ensure that their positions are also preserved by the provision so that all payments received by bodies corporate are treated in a consistent manner. 96 OTHER GST AMENDMENTS (Clauses 305, 306(1) and (2), 307, 309(1), 314(1), (2), (6), (8), 316, 318, 319, 323 and 325(1)) Summary of proposed amendment A number of minor amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 are proposed, where the legislation does not technically give effect to policy, or where there are obvious errors. Application date The proposed amendments will come into force on the date of enactment, with the exception of clause 306(2). Clause 306(2) will apply on and after 1 October 1986. Key features Clarifications and corrections The following proposed amendments clarify the relevant legislation, or correct a clear error. Sales under a security interest where incorrect statement provided (Clauses 306(1) and 323) The proposed amendment will make it clearer that a person who has granted a security over a good, which is sold by the security holder in satisfaction of a debt, and provides an incorrect statement to the security holder, is liable to return GST on the supply themselves. Under existing law, when a person exercises a power of sale over another person’s (the debtor’s) goods under a security, they are required to return GST on the supply unless they either: • receive a statement from the debtor setting out, in full, the reasons why the supply would not be a taxable supply if the debtor supplied the goods themselves; or • determine, relying on reasonable information they hold, that the supply would not have been a taxable supply. The Court of Appeal’s judgment in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Edgewater Motel Ltd \[2003\] 1 NZLR 425, at \[14\], confirmed that when an incorrect statement is provided, the position is reversed, and the debtor is liable to return GST on the supply. The amendment makes technical changes to the legislation consistent with this judgment, to make it clearer in the legislation that the debtor is liable where the 97 security holder does not return GST on the supply (for example, due to an incorrect statement). Supply of financial products upon registration (Clause 306(2)) The proposed amendment will better ensure that financial products are treated in the same way upon deregistration as if the person actually disposed of them, and were not inadvertently taxed. A registered person who deregisters is treated as supplying all the goods and services forming part of the assets of their taxable activity in the course of that taxable activity, immediately before they cease to be registered. This ensures that a person cannot achieve a better result by deregistering before disposing of the assets, and that the consumption of the goods and services is taxed. In certain circumstances, a financial asset could form part of the assets of a taxable activity. For example, when a supply has been made, but the purchaser has not yet made payment, the resulting debt security may be an asset of the taxable activity. Normally the supply of a debt security would be an exempt financial service, on the transfer of ownership of the security. However, there is no transfer of ownership upon deregistration. The proposed amendment will ensure that, if a transfer of the ownership of the security would be a financial service, the deemed supply on deregistration is treated as a transfer of ownership to ensure the same outcome is reached. Financial services and options (Clause 305) In 2000 an amendment was made under section 3(1)(kaa) to treat the supply of a financial option as a financial service. However, there were two shortcomings: • the section applied to the provision of an option, but not to the assignment; and • the payment of an amount arising under a financial option was not included as a financial service under section 3(1)(ka), similar to payments arising under other financial products. The proposed amendment will ensure that the transfer of ownership of a financial option or payment of an amount arising under a financial option are also treated as financial services. No apportionment for de minimis exempt use (Clause 314(2)) A registered person may claim deductions for all input tax they incur, subject to the need to apportion the deduction to reflect non-taxable (exempt and private) use. Section 20(3D) provides an exception to this, when a person makes incidental exempt supplies in carrying on their taxable activity. This has been a longstanding approach, and was previously embedded in section 21(4) before the new apportionment rules applied from 1 April 2011. 98 Under the previous section 21(4), it was clear that the rule removes the need to make adjustments in respect of only exempt supplies (rather than, for example, private use). The amendment to section 20(3D) makes this effect explicit again. Output tax by purchaser who acquires zero-rated land (Clause 314(6)) When a person acquires a supply that is zero-rated under section 11(1)(mb) they are required under section 20(3J)(a)(iii) to account for output tax on use that is not in making taxable supplies. This ensures the same result as if they instead incurred GST and claimed a deduction. As defined, output tax is normally GST charged on supplies made by a person. While this only applies unless the context requires otherwise, an amendment to section 20(3J)(a)(iii) clarifies that this amount is treated as output tax under section 20(4). Value of entertainment expenses (Clause 318) Certain entertainment expenses may not be fully deductible under the Income Tax Act 2007. This recognises that the entertainment may also confer a private benefit on the recipient. GST is imposed on this private consumptive element by section 21I(4) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The section treats an amount equal to the denied income tax deduction as consideration for a taxable supply. However, the denied income tax deduction is a GST-exclusive amount, while consideration is a GST-inclusive term. The proposed amendment to section 21I(4) instead treats the amount as the value of the supply (a GST-exclusive amount) so that the section applies as intended. Secondhand goods and variation of price (Clause 319) The proposed amendment will ensure that the rules dealing with changes in consideration apply correctly to input tax deductions claimed for secondhand goods supplied other than as a taxable supply. When the terms of a taxable supply are varied (for example, by a discount being subsequently offered), the supplier may be required to issue a debit or credit note to the recipient. This triggers obligations on both the supplier and recipient to correct their tax posit ion. This requirement does not apply well to supplies of secondhand goods, which are sold other than as a taxable supply. Although an input tax deduction will still be available, the debit and credit note rules do not apply well to correct a supply where the consideration changes. (As the recipient claims a deduction to the extent payment is made, it would seem to primarily be to the extent that they receive a refund of a payment). New section 25AB will help ensure that these rules apply correctly to supplies of secondhand goods. 99 GST group filing – liability of departing member for unpaid tax (Clause 325(1)) Section 55(7)(g) provides that when a person is a member of a GST-registered group, they are jointly and severally liable for tax payable by the representative member of the group. Section 57(3) performs a similar function for members of an unincorporated body. While in both cases a person will remain liable for an amount owed by the representative member while they were a member of the group or unincorporated body, section 57(3) is clearer. The amendment to section 55(7)(g) aligns the wording more consistently with the latter section, so this outcome is more apparent. Cross-references Finally, the bill proposes a number of incorrect or redundant cross-references, which can be updated or removed. • Section 6(5) provides a deeming rule, for the purposes of “subsections (3)(b), (c)(iii), and (4)”. However, the reference to section 6(4) is unnecessary, and can be removed (clause 307); • Section 10(13) refers to section 12. This should instead refer to subsection (12) (clause 309(1)); • Sections 20(3)(e) and 20(4)(c) link to sections that calculate amounts of deduction or output tax. When section 21FB was introduced, the sections were not updated to refer to this section. The amendment inserts this cross-reference (clauses 314(1) and (8)); and • Section 21D(3)(b) refers to accounting for output tax under section 21A. Output tax is instead attributed to a taxable period under section 20(4), and section 21D(3)(b) should instead refer to this latter section (clause 316). 100 Other policy matters 101 102 RELATED PARTIES DEBT REMISSION (Clauses 16, 22(1) and (9), 39, 41(1) and (6), 57, 58, 59, 262(17) to (19) and (75), 337, 338, 342 and 343(2) to (5)) Summary of proposed amendments Amendments to the debt remission rules are proposed to address the current asymmetric tax outcome that can arise when debt is remitted between related or associated parties. These parties are referred to as an “economic group” for the purposes of the bill. When a loan to an associated person is forgiven the asymmetric tax outcome arises because the creditor is denied a bad debt deduction for the principal of the loan, but the debtor is treated as having inco me of the amount remitted or forgiven. The proposed amendment will ensure that the debt remission rules do not produce debt remission income in circumstances where the debt remission causes no change in the net wealth of the economic group or dilution of ownership. Instead, the debt will be regarded as being fully repaid. This negates the impact of QB 15/01, 4 which deals with capitalising debt within an “economic group”. The economic group can refer to: • members of the same wholly owned group of companies; or • situations where the debtor is a company or partnership (including look-through companies and limited partnerships); and – all of the debt remitted is owed to shareholders or partners of the debtor; and – the debt remitted is held and remitted pro-rata to ownership. The proposed amendments do not generally alter the treatment of debt remission by a company to its shareholders, which except within a wholly owned group of companies, continues to be taxed as a dividend. When the creditor of the company or partnership is someone who could have forgiven the debt owned by the owner (shareholder or partner) for reasons of “natural love and affection” it is proposed that the actual debt to the company or partnership is treated as being advanced to the company or partnership by the owner. Some more technical amendments are proposed as a consequence of this core amendment, and to ensure that the bad debt and debt guarantee rules work as intended within the economic group context. 4 QB 15/01 concerns debt a company owes to its only shareholder being capitalised. It concludes that prima facie this is avoidance of the debt remission rules. The analysis in QB 15/01 can be extrapolated to cover a number of debt capitalisation scenarios that result in no change of ownership proportions of the debtor (i.e. companies with more than one shareholder, partnerships and look-through companies). 103 Application dates The core amendment and its associated changes are backdated to the commencement of the 2006–07 income year to provide certainty to taxpayers. However, positions taken before the commencement of the 2014–15 income year are final and it is proposed that reassessments would not be allowed. The bad debt and debt guarantee proposals will apply from the commencement of the 2017–18 income year. Key features The core rule Clause 57 proposes new section EW 46C, which provides the core machinery for dealing with debt remission within an economic group. The proposed new rule will mean that when there is a debt remission within an economic group, the debt will instead be treated as having been repaid in full. A consequence of this is that any unpaid interest will be deemed to have been paid. This is modelled on the section EW 44 debt forgiveness for natural love and affection mechanism. Proposed subsection EW 46C(1) applies when: • The debtor is a company or a partnership (including look-through companies and limited partnerships). • The creditor is a member of the “creditor group” of the debtor. • The debt forgiven is “pari passu” debt. If it applies, the debtor is treated as having paid the debt and the creditor to have received the payment on the date the debt is forgiven (proposed subsection EW 46C(2)). As in section EW 44 unpaid interest is also treated as being paid. Also, it is treated as being received. The new section confirms that the means of debt remission does not matter (proposed subsection EW 46C(3). Proposed subsection EW 46C(4) contains a number of necessary definitions to support the proposed amendment, including: • “creditor group” which is the group of creditors who are also owners of the debtor, and includes the “creditor’s associates”; • “creditor’s associates” which are either: – companies in the same wholly owned group of companies as the creditor; or – associated natural persons who have “natural love and affection” for the creditor. 104 • “pari passu debt”, being debt that is held and forgiven in proportion to ownership; • “creditor’s interests” is used within the “pari passu” definition to determine ownership interests. When calculating the “pari passu debt” held by the “creditor’s associates”, the debt held by “creditor’s associates” is regarded as being held by the owner for this test. Supporting detail Supporting detail includes: • When the debt remission is inside a wholly owned group the remission will not cause a dividend to have been paid with the removal of associated imputation considerations (see the proposed replacement of subsection CD 5(2) in clause 16). Given that within a wholly owned group a debt remission cannot change the economic wealth of the group, this remo ves the lo ng-standing overreach of the original rules. • When proposed section EW 46C applies and a company is the debtor, proposed new paragraph CD 43(6)(bb) (clause 22(1)) causes an increase in the debtor’s available subscribed capital. The debt remission is akin to a capital injection (as recognised by International Financial Reporting Standards). Bad debts Bad debt deductions for interest receivable in respect of debt advanced that could, under proposed new section EW 46C, be remitted tax free, will now not be deductible under the proposed insertion of paragraph (bb) into section DB 31(2) (clause 41(1) refers). This restores a symmetric outcome (deduction to the creditor and income to the debtor). Debt guarantees Proposed new section EW 49B (clause 59) provides the core rule for debt guarantees within the economic group. Essentially, regardless of whether the guarantor actually acquires any rights of recovery against the debtor, the guarantor will be deemed to have acquired the loan being guaranteed to the extent of the guarantee payments. If this results in the original financial arrangement being extinguished, the original loan is deemed to be repaid as between the original debtor and guarantor for the amount of the guarantee payments and a notional new loan is established for the same amount. If, eventually, the debtor repays more of the new loan than its carrying value, it is proposed to treat the excess as income of the guarantor and a deduction is available to the debtor (section DB 13 as amended by clause 39). This is modelled on the “debt parking” rules in section EW 49. 105 Income Tax Act 2004 Similar amendments to the Income Tax Act 2004 are proposed, to ensure taxpayer certainty. The proposed amendments are backdated to the commencement of the 2006–07 income year. Background The financial arrangement rules have always treated debtors’ gains from debt remission as economic income and therefore taxable. However, a deduction as a bad debt for the principal of a loan is only available for a creditor who is in the business of holding or dealing in such debt. Further, this deduction is denied when the debtor and the creditor are associated persons. This is on the basis that, at least domestically, debt and equity are substitutable, and allowing a bad debt deduction would cause a bias for debt as losses on shares would be much less likely to be deductible. In contrast, all increases in values would accrue to the shares, and none to the debt. The combination of these factors results in an asymmetric taxation outcome – income to the debtor and no deduction to the creditor. In the context of an economic group, this result is not appropriate from a tax policy perspective. However, for many years it was considered relatively easy to circumvent this asymmetric outcome by capitalising the debt, so the policy analysis was not an issue. Given a new interpretation of law concerning the capitalisation of debt (see QB 15/01) it became necessary to further consider from a policy perspective the law concerning the remission of debt within an economic group and the asymmetric outcome. This policy analysis was further complicated by both inbound and outbound investment. However, in the end, it was agreed that one solution should apply across both domestic and cross-borders. 106 LOSS GROUPING AND IMPUTATION CREDITS (Clauses 167, 175, 180 to 182, 186, 187(4) and 188(4)) Summary of proposed amendments Proposed amendments will allow companies that are commonly owned (having at least 66 percent common voting interests) but not wholly owned (100 percent) to transfer imputation credits as part of loss grouping. Imputation credits will be transferred to the company that receives the benefit of the loss grouping (the profit company) and be sourced from either the company that provides the benefit of the loss grouping (the loss company) or another company in the group that will receive the benefit of a dividend paid by the profit company (the imputation source company). Without this imputation credit transfer the profit company, due to the reduction in income tax it pays because of loss grouping, may not have sufficient imputation credits to pay an imputed dividend to its shareholders. If a company pays an unimputed dividend its shareholders will have to pay income tax on the dividend which effectively claws back the benefit of the loss grouping. Key features Companies will be able to transfer imputation credits to another company in a commonly owned group as part of loss grouping. These credits will come from the company transferring the benefit of the loss or another company with an ownership interest in the company accessing the benefit of the loss. Groups will elect to transfer credits equal to the tax effect of the total of loss grouping to a company within the commonly owned group that is in a profit position and the transfer will occur when, within four years, the profit company pays an imputed dividend to its shareholders. • Proposed section OB 19B sets out the amount and timing of the imputation credit received by the profit company. • Proposed section OB 46B sets out the amount and timing of the imputation credit transferred by the loss company or another company in the commonly owned group. • Proposed amendments to sections OB 71, OB 72 and OB 72B extend the imputation credit shopping rules to a commonly owned group that sells a company that has undertaken an imputation credit transfer and a wholly owned group that purchases a company that has undertaken an imputation credit transfer. • Proposed section OB 83 sets out who can make an imputation credit transfer election and the consequences of that election including that the imputation credits transferred must match with imputation credits attached to an imputed dividend paid. • Proposed section OB 84 sets out the timing and process for making an imputation credit transfer election. 107 Application date The amendment will apply for the 2017–18 and later income years. Background The Income Tax Act 2007 allows a loss company to elect to make the benefit of the loss available to a profit company in a commonly owned group. The loss co mpany does this by offsetting some or all of the loss against the net income of the profit company. Alternatively, a profit company can make a deductible subvention payment to the loss company. These are collectively referred to as “loss grouping.” A pro fit company that has benefited from loss grouping will pay less income tax and therefore generate fewer imputation credits. If the profit company is wholly owned by its parent company, any dividends will not be taxable due to the inter-corporate dividend exemption. However, if the profit company is not wholly owned as part of a group that includes the loss company, the reduced level of imputation credits may mean the dividend cannot be fully imputed. When a shareholder of the profit company receives a partially imputed dividend they will have to pay income tax to the extent the dividend is not fully imputed. 5 This income tax effectively claws back the benefit of the loss grouping and may leave the owners of the profit company worse off than if the loss grouping had not occurred. Example 1 illustrates the problem. Detailed analysis The proposals will allow imputation credits equal to the tax effect of loss grouping to be transferred to the profit company by another member of the group, provided the eligibility criteria are met. 5 This will depend on the shareholder’s marginal tax rate. Examples in this Commentary are simplified by assuming all shareholders have a 28% tax rate. 108 Example 1 LossCo has a 90 percent shareholding in ProfitCo (which makes it eligible to group losses). • LossCo’s $10,000 loss is transferred to ProfitCo via a combination of a $2,800 subvention payment and a loss offset election for the remaining $7,200 tax loss. • ProfitCo has $10,000 of profit after the loss grouping so pays $2,800 tax. It therefore has $14,400 of cash 6 and $2,800 of imputation credits. • ProfitCo pays 10 percent of its profits as a dividend to Minority shareholder. This is $1,440 cash and $280 of imputation credits. This dividend is not fully imputed so Minority shareholder has to pay extra tax of $202. • ProfitCo pays 90 percent of its profits as a dividend to LossCo. This is $12,960 cash and $2,520 of imputation credits. This dividend is not fully imputed so LossCo has to pay extra tax of $1,814. • LossCo pays its $10,000 interest bill and distributes its remaining $3,946 7 as a cash dividend with $1,534 of imputation credits attached. • This can be shown in a diagram as: EXTRA TAX of $1,8 14 Inland Revenue Minority shareholder ProfitCo $20,000 LossCo ($10,000) Ultimate shareholder $5,480 dividend: $3,946 cash + $1,534 ICs $1,720 dividend: $1,440 cash + $280 ICs $15,480 dividend: $12,960 cash + $2,520 ICs Group net income = $10,0 00 $10,000 interest EXTRA TAX of $2 02 $2,800 tax $2,800 ICs $2,800 subvention p aym ent As this issue does not arise within a wholly owned group, due to the inter-corporate dividend exemption, the current tax settings provide an incentive for groups to be wholly owned rather than take on minority shareholders. The proposals are intended to remove this tax disadvantage against non-wholly owned groups. 6 $20,000 less $2,800 subvention payment and $2,800 tax payment. 7 $2,800 subvention payment plus $12,960 cash dividend less $10,000 interest payment less $1,814 tax payment. 109 Example 2 • As part of the $2,800 subvention payment and $7,200 loss offset, LossCo also transfers $2,800 of imputation credits. • ProfitCo still has $10,000 of profit after the loss grouping so pays $2,800 tax. It therefore has $14,400 of cash and $5,600 8 of imputation credits which is the same as if no loss grouping had occurred. • ProfitCo pays 10 percent of its profits as a dividend to Minority shareholder. This is $1,440 cash and $560 of imputation credits. As this dividend is fully imputed Minority shareholder has no extra tax to pay. • ProfitCo pays 90 percent of its profits as a dividend to LossCo. This is $12,960 cash and $5,040 of imputation credits. At this dividend is fully imputed LossCo has no extra tax to pay. • LossCo pays its $10,000 interest bill and distributes its remaining $5,760 9 as a cash dividend with $2,240 of imputation credits attached. • This can be shown as: Inland Revenue Minority shareholder ProfitCo $20,000 LossCo ($10,000) Ultimate shareholder $8,000 dividend: $5,760 cash + $2,240 ICs $2,000 dividend: $1,440 cash + $560 ICs $18,000 dividend: $12,960 cash + $5,040 ICs Group net income = $10,0 00 $10,000 interest $2,800 tax $2,800 ICs $2,800 subvention p aym ent $2,800 imputation credit transfer Amount of credits The maximum amount of imputation credits that could be transferred as part of a loss grouping transaction would be: ( amount of subvention payment + amount of loss offset election ) x the company tax rate 10 There will be no restriction on a group of companies wanting to transfer less than the maximum amount. However, consistent with the underlying loss grouping, the imputation credit transfer election once made will be irrevocable. 8 $2,800 from the tax payment and $2,800 from the IC transfer. 9 $2,800 subvention payment plus $12,960 cash dividend less $10,000 interest payment. 10 The company tax rate for the return period that included the loss grouping. 110 Destination of credits The company receiving the imputation credits would always be the same company that received the benefit of the loss grouping (the “profit company”). Source of credits The company transferring the imputation credits could be one of the following companies, at the option of the group: • a company within the same commonly owned group that has transferred its loss to the profit company (the loss company); or • a company wit hin the same commonly owned group that has an ownership interest of at least 66 percent in the profit company (the imputation source company). Imputation credit transfer election In order to transfer imputation credits it is proposed that the loss co mpany must make an election to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to transfer imputation credits. This election would be emailed to ICA.transfers@ird.govt.nz at the same time that the income tax return (including the loss grouping) is due. It is proposed that the elect ion must include the following information: • the name and IRD number of the profit company; • the name and IRD number of the loss company; • the name and IRD number of the imputation source company (if applicable); and • the amount of the loss offset and/or subvention payment. Timing of imputation credit transfer Rather than when a loss grouping occurs, it is proposed that the imputation credit transfer will be recorded by an entry in the imputation credit account of each company at the time the loss company pays a dividend to its shareholders. This is the time at which the issue of insufficient imputation credits would arise and partially mitigates the risk that this mechanism could be used as a way of imputation “credit shopping” (see section below). The legislation achieves this by requiring that the imputation credits transferred are attached to a dividend paid by the profit company. If the amount of the imputation credits attached to the dividend is less than those elected to be transferred, the transfer is limited to the amount of the imputation credits attached to the dividend. Any remaining balance from the election would continue to be available to be transferred if and when a subsequent dividend was paid. 111 Limit on imputation credit transfers Irrespective of the amount of an imputation credit transfer election, credits cannot be transferred if any of the following events occur: • the loss company, profit company and imputation source company (if applicable) cease to be part of a commonly owned group or become part of a wholly owned group; • the loss company and/or the profit company and/or the imputation source company (if applicable) breach the shareholder continuity requirements for memorandum accounts for the period beginning on the first day after the year that contains the loss grouping; or • four years have passed since the end of the income year of the profit company that benefited from the loss grouping. Eligibility for transfers Companies would only be eligible to transfer imputation credits if all of the following criteria are met: • The profit company, the loss company and the imputation source company (if applicable) are all part of the same commonly owned group. • The profit company is not part of the same wholly owned group with either the loss company or the imputation source company (if applicable). • The profit company, the loss company and the imputation source company (if applicable) must be eligible to maintain an imputation credit account. • The profit company, the loss company and the imputation source company (if applicable) have all agreed to undertake an imputation credit transfer. • The loss company has elected to undertake an imputation credit transfer. Imputation credit shopping rules The imputation credit shopping rules are intended to prevent separate groups structuring so that one group can benefit from the tax payments or imputation credits of the other group. These rules, which currently apply only to certain transactions involving wholly owned groups, are proposed to be extended to cover transactions involving companies that have transferred imputation credits. Currently, section OB 72B calculates a restricted refund amount that can only be refunded if the company satisfies the Commissioner that the imputation credit that allows that refund arises from tax paid, or an imputed dividend received, by the company or another company that was part of the same wholly owned group before the company joined the new group. For the purpose of applying this rule to imputation credit transfers, the restricted refund amount will also be refundable if the imputation credit arises from an imputation credit transfer from a company that was part of the same group before the company joined the new group. 112 REMISSION INCOME, TAX LOSSES AND INSOLVENT INDIVIDUALS (Clauses 26, 27, 77 to 79, 123, 141 and 335(2)) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments cancel tax losses of an insolvent individual who is discharged from bankruptcy or is fully released from provable debts under Part 5 (not including subpart 1) of the Insolvency Act 2006 (for example, on discharge from the No Asset Procedure). The amendments seek to improve the alignment of the income tax system wit h: • the “fresh-start” principle of insolvency law; • current administrative practice; and • the neutrality of the tax system in relation to investment decisio ns. Proposed retrospective amendments remove potential adverse impacts to entitlements and obligations arising for social policy recipients of Working for Families and the Student Loan Scheme from the recent enactment of section CG 2B (relating to a discharge from bankruptcy). Application date The proposed amendments relating to the cancellation of tax losses apply to a person who, on or after Royal assent, is either discharged from bankruptcy or is released under Part 5 (other than subpart 1) of the Insolvency Act 2006 from each liability that is a provable debt under the Insolvency Act. The remedial amendments relating to Working for Families and the Student Loan Scheme recipients are proposed to apply retrospectively to persons discharged from bankruptcy after 1 April 2014. Key features An insolvent person is unable to carry forward tax losses after the date a person is either: • discharged from bankruptcy; or • released from fully satisfying provable debts under Part 5, other than subpart 1, of the Insolvency Act 2006. The main effect of the proposed amendment is that the person may not use carried- forward tax losses: • in calculating taxable income for any period after the loss cancellation date; or 113 • to satisfy a shortfall penalty incurred after the loss cancellation date. The proposed amendments also ensure that: • the tax value of assets vested in the Official Assignee are correctly taken into account in calculating taxable income of a person declared bankrupt for the part- year falling before the bankruptcy judgment; and • the law is clearer that an undischarged bankrupt is required to satisfy income tax obligations for income earned during the period of bankruptcy. Consequential amendments are proposed to ensure recent legislative amendments relat ing to the treatment of tax losses of a person discharged from bankruptcy are consistent with the objectives of Working for Families and the Student Loan Scheme. Background A person is able to carry forward unused tax losses to offset against net income in a future tax year on the assumption that a person will continue in business and make sufficient profits to absorb those earlier losses. This assumption is consistent with a principle that allowing losses to be carried forward encourages entrepreneurial risk- taking and that Governments share in the rewards of that business through taxes. However, the ability to carry-forward tax losses has always been contingent on the debtor fully satisfying his or her liabilities for expenses incurred that have been included in past tax losses. Current tax law potentially gives a non-neutral tax treatment for tax losses of a discharged bankrupt. This is because remission income arises for some types of business debt finance (for example, trade debts) but not for other forms of business finance (for example, capital, financial arrangement debt or a bank overdraft). These different tax effects may lead to taxpayers preferring one form of business finance over another. Income earned by an undischarged bankrupt is, under insolvency law, property of the Official Assignee. This rule is subject to the right of a bankrupt to retain sufficient funds from that income for personal maintenance. The Official Assignee’s website indicates that undischarged bankrupts are responsible for attending to personal income tax obligations for all income earned during the period of bankruptcy. The proposed amendments do not apply to debts that the Insolvency Act 2006 provides are to remain enforceable against a person either: • discharged from bankruptcy; or • released from provable debts under any provision of Part 5 of the Insolvency Act 2006, other than under subpart 1 of that Act. Recent amendments to the remission income rules in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014 may result in adverse outcomes for entitlements and obligations under Working for Families and the 114 Student Loan Scheme. These potential adverse outcomes are addressed in the proposed retrospective remedial amendments. Detailed analysis Proposed amendment to section CG 2 Proposed amendments to section CG 2(4) ensure that section CG 2 will cease to apply to a person for liabilities cancelled: • on discharge from bankruptcy; and • on release from repayment of all provable debts under any provision of Part 5 of the Insolvency Act 2006, other than under subpart 1 of that Act. An example of this would be debts cancelled when a person is discharged from the No Asset Procedure under section 377A of the Insolvency Act 2006. Proposed repeal of section CG 2B The proposed amendment ensures section CG 2B will not apply after Royal assent and consequently, remission income does not arise when debts are cancelled on discharge from bankruptcy. This is because, following the proposed amendments in subpart IA to prevent tax losses being carried forward by a person on discharge from bankruptcy, it will no longer be necessary to apply a remission income rule. Proposed amendment to sections FC 1, FC 2 and FC 10 The proposed amendments provide that the vesting of revenue account property and depreciable property in the Official Assignee will: • ensure that the value of trading stock, livestock and excepted financial arrangements are taken into account in calculating a person’s taxable income for the part-year before the person is bankrupt. Revenue account property subject to section EA 1 is proposed to be treated as a disposal and acquisition at market value on the date the person is declared bankrupt; • ensure that any unallocated deduction for other types of revenue account property as at the date of vesting is not deductible to the person declared bankrupt. Revenue account property subject to section EA 2 is proposed to be treated as a disposal and acquisition for a value equal to the original cost of the property to the bankrupt. As a result, there is no deduction allowed to the bankrupt for the property; and • provide that the Official Assignee has acquired revenue account property and depreciable assets at their tax values. For depreciable property, the Official Assignee is also treated as having also acquired the property with the same acquisition date and acquisition cost as the bankrupt. This enables the Official Assignee to have the relevant deduction or depreciation recovery income if the bankrupt estate is liable for income tax (for example, if the Official Assignee carries on the business formerly conducted by the bankrupt). 115 Proposed amendments to subpart IA The loss cancellation date is the date debts of an insolvent individual are released either due to: • discharge from bankruptcy; or • being released from all provable debts under Part 5 (other than subpart 1) of the Insolvency Act 2006 (for example, on discharge from the No Asset Procedure of the Insolvency Act). The amendments proposed in subpart IA will result in a person being unable to: • use the tax loss to pay a shortfall penalty incurred after the loss cancellation date; or • carry forward the tax loss as part of a loss balance to a period ending after the loss cancellation date. Proposed amendments to section MB 14 and the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 The proposed amendment ensures neither family scheme income nor the adjusted net income under the Student Loan Scheme Act include remission income derived under section CG 2B. For income tax purposes, the remission income under section CG 2B is intended to absorb tax losses for certain periods. That income was not intended to result in any change to benefits or obligations under Working for Families or the Student Loan Scheme. However, both of those schemes do not count tax losses in calculating the income related entitlements or obligations. Therefore, any remission income under section CG 2B should similarly not be counted. The proposed amendment applies retrospectively to the beginning of the 2014–15 income year, the time from which section CG 2B applies. When section CG 2B is repealed, no remission income will arise after that time for the cancellation of debts: • on discharge from bankruptcy; or • on being released from all provable debts under Part 5 (other than subpart 1) of the Insolvency Act 2006 (for example, on discharge from the No Asset Procedure of the Insolvency Act). 116 AIRCRAFT OVERHAUL EXPENSES: DEDUCTIBILITY AND TIMING (Clauses 28, 37, 42, 43, 47, 53, 72, 74 to76, 262(2), (95) and (111)) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments set out new rules for the deductibility and timing of: • the cost of an aircraft engine, including for helicopters, all systems relating to lift and propulsion. In both cases, these are termed “the engine overhaul component” in this Commentary item; and • the cost of an aircraft engine overhaul component. The proposed amendments result in: • the costs relating to the engine overhaul component being treated separately from the depreciation rules; and • the aircraft engine overhaul component no longer being included as part of the aircraft itself for depreciation purposes. Other aircraft maintenance and overhaul costs will continue to be deductible and allocated under the general deductibility and timing rules of the Income Tax Act 2007. Transitional rules apply to: • allow a catch-up deduction for the engine overhaul component of existing aircraft; and • recover accounting provisions for future overhaul expenses that were used to value tax deductions for aircraft maintenance expenses prior to the 2017–18 income year. Application date The amendments will apply from the beginning of the 2017–18 income year. Key features The proposed amendments apply to aircraft operators who are required, under Civil Aviation Rules published by the Civil Aviation Authority, to carry out scheduled overhauls on an aircraft from time to time. 117 Under these rules, it is illegal to operate an aircraft without it having a current airworthiness certificate. To retain an airworthiness certificate for an aircraft, the operator must comply with a maintenance programme, which includes scheduled and unscheduled overhauls of different systems of an aircraft. The main aspects of the proposed amendments are: • the engine overhaul component is no longer treated as part of the aircraft as a whole for depreciation purposes; • the cost of the aircraft engine overhaul component and subsequent overhaul of that component is an allowable deduction. This deduction is allocated to an income year on a time-in-service basis; • a deduction is allowed in transition equal to the undepreciated amount of the cost of an existing aircraft that relates to the engine overhaul component; • accrued provisions for future overhaul expenses, as at the beginning of the 2017–18 income year, are to be offset against those future overhaul expenses, when incurred; • the general deductibility and timing rules will continue to apply to all maintenance and overhauls other than expenditure incurred for the engine overhaul component; and • when an aircraft (or engine) is disposed of, engine overhaul deductions are proposed to be recovered in a manner consistent with the application of the depreciation recovery rules. As a consequence, the administrative practice of accepting the accounting practice of valuing overhaul deductions under a provisioning methodology will cease. Proposed allowable deductions The proposed amendments will change the income tax treatment of the acquisition cost of aircraft by: • estimating the value for an aircraft’s engine overhaul component at acquisition and excluding that value from the aircraft’s base value under the depreciation rules; • treating the acquisition value of the engine overhaul component as an allowable deduction, subject to a timing rule; • providing that the capital limitation is overridden in determining this deduction; and • clarifying that the cost of overhauling an engine overhaul component is an allowable deduction, and that the capital limitation is overridden, unless the overhaul includes a significant upgrade in engine performance. 118 Proposed timing rule The amendments propose a timing rule to allocate, on a time-in-service basis, allowable deductions for both the engine overhaul component at acquisition and for subsequent overhauls. Relevant use measures for the time-in-service basis for allocating the deductions are proposed to be determined from current regulated practice (that is, either from the manufacturer’s recommended time-in-service measures or under modifications to the manufacturer’s recommendations as set out in airworthiness directives issued by the Civil Aviation Authority). Recovery of overhaul deductions on disposal of aircraft On disposal of an aircraft, proposed new sections EJ 27 and CG 9 will apply in a manner consistent with the depreciation recovery rules that apply to the aircraft (not including the engine overall component). Key definitions An “aircraft engine” is proposed to be defined in relation to its function of propulsion, and in the case of a helicopter each relevant system that relates to the function of lift and propulsion. The proposed definition of “aircraft engine overhaul” is similar to the definition of “overhaul” in the Civil Aviation Rules issued by the Civil Aviation Authority. Due to the modular nature of the helicopter propulsion systems, the proposed definition of “aircraft engine overhaul” will be extended to apply to each system that relates to lift and propulsion of a helicopter. This ensures that the timing of deductions is applied to each of the systems, irrespective of whether any or all of those systems are overhauled at the same time. The proposed definition of “scheduled overhaul period” is defined by reference to the period or time between overhauls that an aircraft operator is required to perform. This definition is consistent with terms in the Civil Aviation Rules relating to the overhaul period. The proposed definition of “unpriced aircraft engine” refers to an aircraft engine acquired with an aircraft but for which no price for the engine is separately identified. Transitional deduction A transitional deduction is proposed in relation to an aircraft owned at the end of the 2016–17 income year and which continues to be used in the aircraft operator’s business in the 2017–18 income year. The proposed amendment allows a deduction for the proportion of the adjusted tax value (the tax book value) that relates to the engine overhaul component instead of continuing to depreciate that amount as part of the aircraft. 119 The timing of this deduction is related to when the first overhaul of the aircraft engine has or will be incurred. The adjusted tax value of the aircraft as a whole will be reduced by an amount equal to the transitional deduction allowed. Transitional adjustment relating to accounting provisions Prior to the 2017–18 income year, some taxpayers valued their overhaul deduct ions using a provisioning methodology, under which a provision for estimated future overhaul costs was calculated. This practice was based on a now withdrawn technical ruling, and the practice will not be accepted for calculating tax deductions for aircraft overhaul expenses, from the 2017–18 income year. A matching rule is proposed to offset accrued provisions as at the end of the 2016–17 income year with the related future overhaul expenditure, when incurred. However, if the aircraft (or engine) is disposed of before the relevant overhaul occurs, the provision is treated as income on disposal of the asset. Both treatments are consistent with the practice under the provisioning accounting methodology. Background The proposed amendments arise from a tax policy review of the deductibility and timing of aircraft overhaul expenses undertaken under the Generic Tax Policy Process. This review was undertaken in the context of: • the Commissioner publishing a draft statement concluding that the amount of an accrued provision for future overhaul expenditure is not expenditure incurred and did not meet the requirements of the general permission, which determines when an amount is an allowable deduction; • the regulatory environment in which aircraft are operated; and • the economics of the maintenance process. The main conclusions drawn from the tax policy review were as follows: • A regulatory obligation to carry out an overhaul arises when the relevant time- in-service threshold is reached or out-of-cycle maintenance is required if the aircraft operator wishes to retain an airworthiness certificate for the aircraft. • The legal test of when overhaul expenditure is incurred must be satisfied before a deduction is allowed for overhaul expenditure. • The costs of acquiring an aircraft engine component and subsequent overhauls should be matched with the income generated from subsequent use of the aircraft. This is consistent with the economics of the maintenance process and results in an appropriate measure of taxable income from year to year. • For leased assets, end-of-lease contractual conditions may require the lessee to incur expenditure. No change is proposed to the tax treatment of these obligations, as the current tax treatment of finance leases and the general deductibility and timing rules give the appropriate outcome. 120 Detailed analysis Proposed section DW 5 Application Proposed section DW 5 applies to aircraft operators who are required to comply with Civil Aviation Rules for performing engine overhauls on an aircraft (proposed section DW 5(1)). Deduction for overhaul expenditure Proposed section DW 5(2) allows a deduction for the cost of an overhaul. An engine overhaul is generally considered to be of a maintenance nature on the basis that the overhaul would restore the asset to its former condition. The cost of an overhaul is not defined but is expected to include the cost of labour, parts and other relevant direct and indirect costs. Non-engine overhauls are not included in these proposed amendments. Therefore deductions for overhaul expenditure relating to aircraft components such as the airframe check and landing gear will usually be timed to the years in which those expenditures are incurred. However, the tax treatment of aircraft engines (including relevant lift and propulsion systems for helicopters) under proposed sections DW 5(3) and (4) results in the separation of a substantial part of the cost of an engine from the aircraft as a whole. A submission during the policy review asked whether the nature and scale of an overhaul of an aircraft engine might result in the overhaul expenditure being viewed as having a capital nature. The submitter noted that the scale of overhaul expenditure relative to the engine (the identified asset) might be considered capital expenditure under ordinary principles, as discussed in the Commissioner’s Interpretation Statement IS12/03 Income tax: Deductibility of repairs and maintenance expenditure – general principles. 11 To address this issue, proposed section DW 5(6) overrides the capital limitation in applying section DW 5(2) to ensure that overhaul expenditure is generally treated as being on revenue account. An exception to this treatment arises if there is a significant performance upgrade to the engine during an overhaul. Proposed section DW 5(2) also ensures that if an overhaul results in a significant performance upgrade, the deduction allowed is limited to the amount that would have been incurred if no upgrade in performance had occurred. The non-deductible portion is proposed to be treated as an addition to the aircraft’s depreciation base value (and depreciated). 11 At paragraphs 8 and 178 of the Interpretation Statement IS12/03. 121 Deduction for part of the cost of an aircraft engine Proposed section DW 5(3) applies when an engine is acquired on a stand-alone basis, whether as a spare engine or the engine’s cost is identified as a separate item when acquiring an aircraft, including an engine or engines. Proposed section DW 5(4) applies when an aircraft is acquired, including an engine or engines, and no separate cost is identified for the engine or engines. Section DW 5(3) and (4) require the aircraft operator to estimate, at the time of acquisition, the cost of an overhaul for an aircraft engine, including all relevant direct and indirect costs. The estimated cost is to be determined from market prices. Proposed section DW 5(6) ensures that the capital limitation does not apply to the amounts allowed as a deduction under section DW 5(3) and (4) depending on whether the aircraft engine is at the beginning of a scheduled overhaul period or part-way through that period. If the engine cost is identified separately from the cost of the aircraft as a whole, the deduction may not exceed the cost of the engine. For example, the estimated cost of an overhaul would likely exceed the cost of an engine that is acquired shortly before an overhaul of that engine is due. If the engine cost is not identified separately from the aircraft as a whole, the amount of the deduction is normally to be determined from market prices but may be determined using a ratio agreed with the Commissioner. Proposed sections DW 5(3)(a) and DW 5(4)(a) value the deduction as the estimated cost of an overhaul of the engine, determined as at the time of acquisition. The amount of the deduction cannot exceed the cost of the aircraft engine. These proposed provisions apply only if the engine is new or has just been overhauled prior to acquisition. This value would be similar to the estimated value used by taxpayers that have used provisioning methodology in the past to value tax deductions. Example 1: Application of proposed section DW 5(3)(a) (engine cost identified) Aircraft acquisition cost of $1.4 million, engine cost separately identified as $460,00 Estimated cost of an overhaul at acquisition is $450,000. The estimated cost of an overhaul is less than the engine cost separately identified at acquisition. The allowable deduction is $450,000. The base value of the aircraft for depreciation purposes is – $1,400,000−$450,000=$950,000 Example 2: Application of proposed section DW 5(4)(a) (engine cost identified) Aircraft acquisition cost of $1.4 million. Estimated cost of an overhaul at acquisition is $450,000. The allowable deduction is $450,000. The base value of the aircraft is – $1,400,000−$450,000=$950,000 122 Proposed sections DW 5(3)(b) and DW 5(4)(b) require the taxpayer to estimate the cost of an engine overhaul at acquisition and then apportion that amount between the expired and the unexpired portion of that estimate (based on relevant use measures). The expired portion is included in the cost base of the aircraft under the depreciation rules (as part of the base value) and the unexpired portion is the allowable deduction under proposed sections DW 5(3)(b) and DW 5(4)(b). Example 3: Application of proposed section DW 5(3)(b) (engine cost identified) Aircraft acquisition cost of $1.4 million, engine cost separately identified as $460,000. Estimated cost of an overhaul at acquisition is $450,000. The time between engine overhauls is 3,000 hours and the unexpired time in the overhaul period at acquisition is 2,800 hours. The calculation under section DW 5(3)(b) is as follows – 450,000 × 2800 ÷ 3000 = $420,000 The result of the calculation ($420,000) is less than the engine cost identified at acquisition. The allowable deduction is $420,000. The base value of the aircraft for depreciation purposes is – $1,400,000−$420,000=$980,000 Example 4: Application of proposed section DW 5(4)(b) (engine cost identified) Aircraft acquisition cost of $1.4 million. Estimated cost of an overhaul at acquisition is $450,000. The time between engine overhauls is 3,000 hours and the unexpired time in the overhaul period at acquisition is 2,800 hours. The calculation under section DW 5(4)(b) is – 450,000 × 2800 ÷ 3000 = $420,000 The allowable deduction is $420,000. The base value of the aircraft for depreciation purposes is – $1,400,000−$420,000=$980,000 Proposed section DW 5(3)(c) applies if the acquisition cost identified for an engine is lower than the value of the deduction under either of proposed sections DW 5(3)(a) or (b). This proposed rule ensures that neither of sections DW 5(3)(a) or (b) can result in a value for the deduction for the engine overhaul component that exceeds the identified cost – for example, when the engine is part-way through the scheduled overhaul period. Proposed section DW 5(4)(c) applies if proposed section DW 5(4)(a) or (b) cannot be applied – for example, if the relevant market price information is not readily available. In this circumstance, the deduction allowed is based on an apportionment basis agreed with the Commissioner. 123 Example 5: Application of proposed section DW 5(3)(c) Aircraft acquisition cost of $1 million, engine cost separately identified as $19,000, as it is due for an overhaul. Estimated cost of an overhaul at acquisition is $450,000. The time between engine overhauls is 3,000 hours and the unexpired time in the overhaul period at acquisition is 200 hours. Under section DW 5(3)(b), the result of the calculation is 450,000 × 90% × 200/3,000 = $27,000 The allowable deduction is $19,000 (the engine cost identified). The base value of the aircraft for depreciation purposes is $1,000,000−$19,000=$981,000 Example 6: Application of proposed section DW 5(4)(c) (engine cost not identified) Aircraft acquisition cost of $1.0 million. Estimated cost of an overhaul at acquisition is $450,000 but non-market prices are used. The time between engine overhauls is 3,000 hours and the unexpired time in the overhaul period at acquisition is 200 hours. Under section DW 5(4)(b), the result of the calculation is 450,000 × 200/3,000 = $27,000 Under section DW 5(4)(c), the fraction agreed by the Commissioner for the proportion of a new aircraft’s acquisition cost that would be allowed as a deduction under section DW 5(4)(a) is 2.5%. This fraction would be adjusted by the ratio of unexpired hours to the total hours in the scheduled overhaul period as 25% x 200 ÷ 3,000 = 1.67%). The allowable deduction is 1.67% of the unpriced aircraft’s acquisition cost = $16,700. The base value of the aircraft is $1,000,000−$16,700=$983,300 No deduction under proposed section DW 5(3) or (4) for single aircraft owners Proposed section EJ 264 allows a single aircraft owner to elect out of the spreading rule set out in section EJ 24. If this election is made: • no deduction us allowed for the estimated cost of an engine overhaul under proposed sections DW 5(3) and DW 5(4); • the aircraft operator allocates the deduction for an aircraft overhaul to the year in which the expenditure is incurred; and • the full acquisition cost of the aircraft is the base value of depreciation purposes. 124 Proposed section DW 6 Application Proposed section DW 6 applies to an aircraft operator that: • acquires an aircraft with an engine or an aircraft engine under a finance lease; and • is required to make payments to the lesser in relation to return conditions set out in the lease agreement. Maintenance reserve payments A lease contract may contain an obligation for the lessee to make regular maintenance reserve payments during the term of the lease. These payments relate to redelivery conditions in the lease that require the lessee to return the aircraft or aircraft engine in a stipulated part- or full-life condition. The purpose of the maintenance reserve obligation is: • to protect the lessor’s investment in the leased asset, by providing a fund which can be drawn on by the lessee to pay for overhaul costs during the term of the lease; and • to protect the lessor from the credit risk that the lessee may not be able to meet redelivery conditions in the lease that require the lessee to return the aircraft or aircraft engine in a stipulated part- or full-life condit io n. Proposed section DW 6: • denies a deduction for these payments as they represent the accumulation of an amount (in effect a sinking fund) that will be used in the future to fund aircraft overhaul expenses; • provides that an amount drawn down by the lessee from the maintenance reserve fund is not income; • allows a deduction at the end of the lease for an amount equal to maintenance reserve payments that are retained by the lessor; and • ensures that the allowable deduction for an aircraft engine overhaul in section DW 5(2) is spread as intended. 125 Example 7: Application of proposed section DW 6 The lessee (an aircraft operator) is required to pay $10,000 per month to the lessee to be held in a maintenance reserve account for future engine overhaul expenses. This payment is in addition to the monthly payments for the right to use the aircraft. After six years, an overhaul of the engines is due, and the aircraft operator incurs $750,000 of overhaul expenditure. The maintenance reserve fund at this time has $720,000. The lessor pays the lessee this amount, and the lessee is required to fund the additional $30,000 from its own working capital. No deduction is allowed for any of the monthly payments. Nor is the draw-down in the year of overhaul treated as income. Instead, the aircraft operator is allowed a deduction for the $750,000 of overhaul expenditure and this deduction is allocated on a time-in-service basis under proposed section EJ 24. After 10 years, the lease is terminated and the aircraft is returned to the lessor, and an engine overhaul is due within one year. The lessor carries out that overhaul. The maintenance reserve fund at this time is $480,000, and this amount is retained by the lessor to fund the next engine overhaul. The $480,000 is allowed as a deduction to the lessee in the year the lease is terminated. End-of-lease adjustment payments Instead of providing for a maintenance reserve payment obligation, some leases provide for end-of-lease adjustment payments. The amount of an end-of-lease adjustment payment is also determined by redelivery conditions in the lease that require the lessee to return the aircraft or aircraft engine in a stipulated part- or full- life condition. These end-of-lease payments are also to protect the lessor’s investment in the leased asset. If the leased asset’s condition at redelivery is: • lower than stipulated, the lessee would make an end-of-lease adjustment payment to the lessee; or • higher than stipulated, the lessor would make an end-of-lease adjustment to the lessee. • proposed section DW 6(3) provides that an end-of-lease adjustment payment: • made by the lessee is an allowable deduction; or • received by the lessee is income of the lessee under section CG 4(2); and in both cases. The deduction or income for end-of-lease adjustment payments is allocated to the income year in which the expenditure is incurred or income is derived under the general timing rules in the core provisions or under proposed section EJ 25 (for IFRS taxpayers electing to apply section EJ 25). 126 Proposed section DZ 22 and EZ 23BA Transitional deductions for aircraft engine overhaul components Proposed sections DZ 22 and EZ 23BA apply to an aircraft operator in relation to each aircraft owned at the end of the 2016–17 income year. Proposed section EZ 23BA is an apportionment rule. It proposes: • to align the tax treatment of aircraft engine overhaul components for aircraft owned at the end of the 2016–17 income year with the proposal to remove the aircraft engine overhaul component from the depreciation rules; and • to reduce the depreciable cost of each aircraft (base value) and depreciated tax value of each aircraft (adjusted tax value) as at the beginning of the 2017–18 income year. The reduced values are proposed to be carried forward and used for calculating depreciation on the aircraft and for calculating any gain or loss. The proposed amendment in sections DZ 22(2) and (3): • allows a deduction for an amount equal to the reduction in the adjusted tax value for each of those aircraft (as reduced under proposed section EZ 23BA). This deduction represents the undepreciated amount relating to the engine overhaul component); and • that deduction to either the 2017–18 income year or to the 2017–18 and later income years. The timing of the deduction is proposed to depend on the year in which the first overhaul of the aircraft engine has occurred or will occur. Proposed section DZ 22(2) applies if an overhaul of the aircraft’s engine has occurred prior to the 2017–18 income year. In this case, the allowable deduction for the undepreciated amount of the engine overhaul component is proposed to be allocated to the 2017–18 income year. Proposed section DZ 22(3) applies if the first overhaul of the aircraft’s engine occurs after the start of the 2017–18 income year. In this case the deduction is allocated to the 2017–18 income year and later income years based on the unexpired amount of the relevant use measure (for example, flying hours, landing cycles) for the scheduled overhaul cycle. Example 8 illustrates the effect of proposed sections EZ 23BA and DZ 22 in aligning the timing of deductions for the aircraft overhaul engine component for aircraft already owned at the beginning of the 2017–18 income year. 127 Example 8: Transitional deductions Proposed sections DZ 22 and EZ 23BA: Apportionment of adjusted tax value (depreciated tax value) and base value (acquisition cost) Adjusted Base value Tax value Aircraft 1: $250,000 $1,000,000 (first overhaul of engine(s) during 2013–14 income year) Aircraft 2: $800,000 $1,000,000 (first overhaul of engines for 2019–20 income year): Both aircraft are assumed to be of the same type, and the fraction of the aircraft’s acquisition cost relating to the aircraft engine overhaul components referred to in proposed section EZ 23BA(1)(b) is 20%. Aircraft 1 Reduction in adjusted tax value = $250,000 ×20%=$50,000 Reduction in base value = $1,000,000 ×20%=$200,000 Aircraft 2 Reduction in adjusted tax value = $800,000 ×20%=$160,000 Reduction in base value = $1,000,000 ×20%=$200,000 Allowable deduction under proposed section DZ 22 Aircraft 1 The allowable deduction under proposed section DZ 22(2) is an amount equal to the reduction in the adjusted tax value = $50,000. This deduction is proposed to be allocated to the 2017–18 income year. Aircraft 2 The allowable deduction under proposed section DZ 22(3) is an amount equal to the reduction in the adjusted tax value = $160,000. The deduction for $160,000 is proposed to be spread between the 2017–18, 2018–19 and 2019–20 income years, based on actual time-in-service during each of those income years, and time-in-service remaining in the current scheduled overhaul period, taking into account the depreciation deductions already allocated to income years prior to 2017–18. Assume 1,000 hours time-in-service remain in the current scheduled overhaul period (3,000 hours) as at the beginning of the 2017–18 income year. Assume the following time-in-service hours from 2017–18 income year. 2017–18 income year: 400 hours 2018–19 income year: 350 hours 2019–20 income year: 250 hours The allocation of the deduction of $160,000 under section DZ 22(3) using the following assumed time- in-service from 2017–18 is proposed to be calculated as follows: 2017–18 income year: $160,000 – ( $160,000 ×600÷3,000 ) = $128,000 2018–19 income year: ($160,000 – $128,000) × ( 350÷600 ) =$18,667 2019–20 income year: ($160,000 – $128,000) × ( 250÷600 ) =$13,333 Total deduction allocated: $128,000+$18,667+$13,333 =$160,000 128 Proposed section DZ 23 Proposed section DZ 23 applies to a person who, prior to the 2017–18 income year, has used a provisioning accounting methodology to: • value a deduction (based on an estimate of future aircraft overhaul expenditure) in the calculation of taxable income for a tax year before the 2017–18 income year; and • the related overhaul expenditure is not incurred until after the beginning of the 2017–18 income year. The accrued provisions are proposed to be reversed against the cost of the next succeeding overhaul. If the provisions are accrued on an item-by-item basis (for example, by serial number or part number), the reversal against the actual overhaul cost should be made against the relevant overhauled or retired part. In the event the aircraft is disposed of before the next overhaul, the value of all provisions would be treated as income under existing law (section CG 2), as the provision represents a liability that is cancelled. This approach is consistent with the accounting provisioning methodology presently used. A non-engine overhaul (for example, airframe check or landing gear) against the incurred cost for that non-engine overhaul. For example, if an aircraft operator has accrued a provision of $50,000 for an overhaul of landing-gear accrued provision up to the end of the 2016–17 income year, the full amount of the provision is offset against the cost of the landing gear overhaul. If the amount of the provision exceeds the cost of the non-engine overhaul, that excess is treated as income in the year of the overhaul under section CZ 33. Proposed section DZ 23(3) offsets the value of an accrued provision for an aircraft engine overhaul against the related overhaul expenditure (for helicopters this would be matched to the relevant overhaul on a system by system basis). It may be possible that the accrued provision may exceed the actual overhaul cost when incurred. In this case, the excess amount is carried forward and applied against the cost of the next relevant overhaul. This has the effect, in transition, of: • reducing the amount of the allowable deduction for an aircraft engine overhaul after the beginning of the 2017–18 income year; • ensuring that the aircraft operator does not receive a deduction for both the provision for future overhaul expenses prior to the 2017–18 income year and again when the actual expenditure was incurred; and • spreads the tax effect of reversing a provision for aircraft engine overhauls over a number of years. 129 Example 9: Application of proposed section DZ 23(3) Company A has an accrued provision of $20,000 at the beginning of the 2017–18 income year for the replacement of the main rotor blades on a Bell Jetranger helicopter. The next overhaul is scheduled to occur after another 3,900 hours of flying time. Deductions allowed for that accrued provision for tax years before the 2017–18 income year are not adjusted. However, no further deductions are allowed for a provision for future overhaul expenditure as the amount of a provision will not meet the requirements to be an allowable deduction. The next scheduled replacement of the rotor blades is expected to cost approximately $100,000. The accrued provision of $20,000 is proposed to be offset against the cost of that next scheduled overhaul, resulting in the allowable deduction being $80,000. That deduction is then spread across the following scheduled overhaul period under proposed section EJ 24 (or section EJ 25 for IFRS taxpayers). Proposed section EE 7 The proposed amendment to section EE 7 is to ensure that an aircraft remains depreciable property even though part of the cost of the aircraft is to be an allowable deduction under proposed section DW 5. Proposed section EJ 24 Proposed section EJ 24 sets out the timing rule for deductions allowed under section DW 5 for the estimated cost of an aircraft engine overhaul. An IFRs taxpayer may elect (under section EJ 25) to use their IFRS reports as the basis for allocating deductions under sect DW 5 and DW 6. Under proposed section EJ 24(2), a deduction allowed under section DW 5 is proposed to be allocated to income years on a time-in-service basis. The relevant basis for determining time-in-service is the relevant measure set out in that aircraft’s maintenance schedule, which may be the earlier of a use measure or a period of time. Example 10: Application of proposed section EJ 24(2) Company A owns a Bell Jetranger helicopter. Its master transmission has been overhauled for a cost of $135,000 in the first month of the 2017–18 income year and is returned to service in the second month of the same year. Its next scheduled overhaul is due after 4,500 flying hours. The helicopter on average is in use for 500 hours each year. The helicopter has 460 flying hours in the 2017–18 income year following the overhaul. The allowable deduction is $135,000 and is proposed to be allocated as follows: 2017–18 income year: $135,000 × 460 4500 =$13,800 2018–19 income year: $135,000 × 500 4500 =$15,000 (assuming 500 flying hours) In the year of an engine overhaul, proposed section EJ 24(2) allocates the remaining portion of the deduction that has not been allocated in prior years. 130 Example 11: Application of proposed section EJ 24(3) Assume the same facts as in Example 10. The next scheduled overhaul would likely occur in the 2026–27 income year. Assume the helicopter has 40 flying hours in that income year prior to the overhaul. The amount of the deduction is proposed to be allocated to the 2026–27 income year as follows: $135,000 × 40 4,500 =$1,200 Under proposed section EJ 24(3), (4), and (5), the amount of any unallocated deduction for an overhaul component (by serial or part number) at the beginning of an income year is allocated to that income year if: • an out-of-cycle overhaul occurs, for example, because of bird strike; or • the aircraft (with an engine), or engine is leased and the asset is returned to the lessor. Proposed section EJ 25 Proposed section EJ 25 provides that aircraft operators who are required to adopt IFRS 12 for financial accounting purposes may agree a method with the Commissioner to value and allocate deductions allowed under proposed section DW 5, and based on their IFRS accounting treatment. This election is restricted to taxpayers that: • are a New Zealand resident; or • hold a valid certificate of registration for the aircraft from the Director of Civil Aviat ion. Proposed section EJ 26 Proposed section EJ 26 permits an aircraft operator having just one aircraft in the business to elect: • to not have the proposed deduction at acquisition for the estimated cost of an aircraft engine overhaul; and • to apply the general timing rules in the Income Tax Act 2007, which allocate deductions for aircraft engine overhaul expenses on an “as incurred” basis. This election is not available to an aircraft operator who, along with aircraft owned by associated persons, has more than one aircraft. Proposed section EJ 27 Proposed section EJ 27 applies, on disposal of an aircraft, to recover deductions for aircraft engine overhauls (including the deduction allowed under proposed section DW5(3) and (4)). The proposed effect is similar to the effect given by the rules applying on disposal of depreciable property. 12 International Financial Reporting Standards 131 Proposed section EJ 27(2) provides that the unexpired portion of a deduction allowed under section DW 5 (determined as at the date of disposal) is to be allocated to the year of disposal. Proposed section EJ 27(3) requires the consideration derived on disposal to be apportioned between the depreciable asset (the aircraft) and the engine overhaul component. • The portion of the consideration attributable to the depreciable asset is proposed to be taken into account in the depreciation rules applying to disposals. • The portion of the consideration relating to the engine overhaul component is proposed to be taken into account as income under section CG 9, subject to that amount being limited to the lesser of total deduction allowed under proposed section DW 5 for the current scheduled overhaul period and the portion of the consideration attributable to the engine overhaul component,. Any amount in excess of this limit is proposed to not be income of the taxpayer. Proposed section FA 9 The proposed amendment to FA 9 ensures that if the lessee acquires the lease asset at the end of a lease, the amount of a deduction allowed to a lessee under section DW 5 or DW 6 is not treated as part of the original cost of the aircraft as a whole. This ensures that income derived under section CC 1 from a subsequent sale of the aircraft by the lessee or associated person is measured against the correct cost base. Proposed section FA 10 The proposed amendment to section FA 10 ensures that an end-of-lease payment made on redelivery of the leased aircraft or engine (for example, life-condit io n payments) are not included in the amount of consideration under section FA 10 if that payment is an allowable deductions under proposed sections DW 5 or DW 6. Proposed section FA 11 The proposed amendment to section FA 11 ensures that the amount of a deduction allowed under section DW 5 or DW 6 is not included in the adjustment calculation for an operating lease that becomes a finance lease. 132 CLARIFICATION OF EMPOWERING PROVISION FOR NEW ZEALAND’S DOUBLE TAX AGREEMENTS (Clause 5) Summary of proposed amendments It is proposed that the Income Tax Act 2007 be amended to clarify that the empowering provision for New Zealand’s double tax agreements (DTAs) does not prevent the anti-avoidance rules contained in income tax legislation from applying to a tax advantage arising under a DTA. A remedial change to the current provision is also proposed, to ensure that it operates as intended in relation to the process for bringing DTAs into force. Application date The amendments will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features An amendment to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 will clarify that this section does not prevent the anti-avoidance rules contained in the Income Tax Act 2007 from applying in situations where a DTA applies. The amendment will make it clear that the general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR) can apply to deny any tax advantage obtained from a tax avoidance arrangement, whether the tax advantage arises under domestic law or the provisio n of a DTA. In addition, a remedial amendment to section BH 1 will ensure that the provisio n operates as intended in relation to the process for bringing DTAs into force. Background Interaction between section BH 1 and the anti-avoidance rules New Zealand, like many other countries, has a GAAR in its income tax legislation. The GAAR overrides other provisions of income tax legislation (under section BB 3) to deny the tax benefits of an arrangement if a more than incidental purpose of that arrangement is to obtain a tax benefit and the tax benefit is outside Parliament’s contemplation for the relevant provisions. The GAAR applies to all income tax transactions, including those with an international dimension (that is, New Zealand residents investing offshore or non-New Zealand residents investing in or through New Zealand). New Zealand also has anti-avoidance rules that target specific avoidance behaviour. These rules also apply to transactions wit h an international dimension. 133 DTAs are international treaties that are entered into primarily to prevent double taxation on income earned cross-border. The tax incidence for taxpayers entering into international transactions can be reduced when there is a DTA between the taxpayer’s country of residence and the country from which the income is sourced. Section BH 1 authorises the making of Orders in Council to give effect to New Zealand’s DTAs. Section BH 1 generally provides that DTAs have overriding effect despite anything in the Income Tax Act 2007. It has been suggested that, because the current legislation does not explicitly address the relationship between New Zealand’s DTAs and its anti-avoidance rules, taxpayers are able to argue that section BH 1 prevents the anti-avoidance rules from applying to a DTA. It has also been argued that the GAAR may be prevented from applying when the DTA provisions prescribe a specific outcome (such as a defined term in the DTA that mandates the treatment that is sought to be counteracted under the GAAR). Inland Revenue considers that the better view of the existing law is that the provision which empowers New Zealand’s double tax agreements does not prevent the anti-avoidance rules contained in income tax legislation from applying to counteract a tax advantage arising under a DTA. The proposed amendment will clarify the posit ion. Process for DTAs coming into force A further remedial amendment to section BH 1 is proposed to ensure that the provision operates as intended in relation to the process for bringing DTAs into force. The amendment will ensure that the legislation better reflects the process by which a DTA enters into force. That is, section BH 1 currently refers to a DTA entering into force as a result of a declaration by Order in Council, and on a date specified in the Order in Council. The updated references will refer to the current specific steps for entry into force. 134 CHARITIES WITH OVERSEAS PURPOSES (Clauses 2(19), (25), (26) and 272) Summary of proposed amendments The bill proposes to amend the Income Tax Act 2007 by adding 14 charities to the list of donee organisations in schedule 32 and renaming an existing charity on the list. The bill further proposes to remove Bicycles for Humanity, Auckland, from the list as this charity has ceased activities and has wound up. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2016, unless otherwise specified. Key features It is proposed to add 14 charitable organisations to schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Donors to the following charities will be eligible for tax benefits on their donations. • Astha Childrens Home (Nepal/New Zealand) • Cambodia Trust (Aotearoa-New Zealand) • Destiny Rescue Charitable Aid Trust • First Steps Himalaya • Fountain of Peace Children’s Foundation New Zealand • GC Aid • Hornsby Pacific Education Trust • Mercy Mission of New Zealand Trust Board • Microdreams Foundation New Zealand Humanitarian Trust • NPH New Zealand Charitable Trust • Orphans Refugees and Aid (ORA International) of New Zealand Charitable Trust • Siphala Foundation • Solomon Outreach Society • Toraja Rural Development Charitable Trust. It is also proposed that The Destitute Children’s Home, Pokhara Charitable Trust, which has donee status, be renamed Youth Education and Training Initiatives (YETI) Nepal Trust, with effect from 1 April 2013. 135 The bill also removes Bicycles for Humanity, Auckland, with effect from 3 December 2015 as the charity has ceased activities and wound up. Background Donors to organisations listed in schedule 32 are entitled, as individual taxpayers, to a tax credit of 33 1 / 3 % of the monetary amount donated, up to the value of their taxable income. Companies and Māori Authorities may claim a deduction for donations up to the level of their net income. Charities that apply funds towards purposes that are mostly outside New Zealand must be listed in schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007 before donors become eligible for these tax benefits. The 14 charitable organisations being added to schedule 32 are engaged in the following activities: Astha Childrens Home (Nepal/New Zealand) Established in 2014, this trust formalises a funding arrangement that started in New Zealand in 2005 to support a girls’ home in Kathmandu, Nepal. The girls’ home is managed and operated by a Nepalese charity Astha Childrens Home for Girls. The New Zealand charity, Astha Childrens Home (Nepal/New Zealand) Trust raises funds to support the capital development of the home and provides financial support for schooling and vocational training. Cambodia Trust (Aotearoa-New Zealand) Established in 1994, the trust assists the victims of landmines and other people with physical disabilities in Cambodia. Working in conjunction with Cambodia Trust (Cambodia), the New Zealand trust’s core work is in the development and provision of prosthetic and orthotic services (artificial limbs and orthopaedic braces). The New Zealand trust is also involved in building the capacity of the Cambodia Trust to train local prosthetic and orthotic specialists. Destiny Rescue Charitable Aid Trust Destiny Rescue’s activities are directed at providing care and rehabilitation for victims of sexual abuse and exploitation, and rescuing children from sexually abusive situations. Created in 2013, the New Zealand charity’s efforts are aimed at relieving the wider effects of poverty by ensuring at-risk children have access to education and are generally supported by their local communities. Destiny Rescue acts in partnership with sister charities in the United States and Australia. First Steps Himalaya Established in 2008, the objective of the trust is to render assistance to disadvantaged communities in Nepal by providing early childhood development, community health and awareness programmes. The Trust’s work focuses primarily on education, working closely with state schools to upgrade existing classrooms, train teachers and provide support through regular supervision and management. 136 Fountain of Peace Children’s Foundation New Zealand Established in 2012, Fountain of Peace Children’s Foundation New Zealand was set up to support a community project in Uganda initiated by Ms Peace Ruharuza (Fountain of Peace Children’s Foundation Uganda). Her work is motivated to assist orphaned and abandoned children and babies. The New Zealand trust’s activities at this time are directed at supporting Peace’s project in Kyenjojo, Uganda, providing educational opportunities for disadvantaged children, and developing the infrastructure of local communities. The New Zealand trust has been instrumental in the construction of a seven-classroom school and creating a facility to receive unwanted babies. GC Aid GC Aid was set up in 2008 to be the humanitarian aid arm of Global Connections in Mission (a charity that has been in existence under various guises for over 115 years). GC Aid’s objectives are to develop and transform communities by funding projects that relieve poverty, respond to the effects of natural disasters, improve health and education outcomes in developing countries, and encourage entrepreneurship in developing countries in the form of direct microfinance lending. Hornsby Pacific Education Trust Established in 2014, the trust formalises an earlier four-year funding relationship directed at supporting St Andrew’s High School in Tonga. The purposes of the trust are to continue to support St Andrew’s High School and raise the educational standards of students at that school and other schools in Tonga, and other developing island nation states throughout the Pacific. Mercy Mission of New Zealand Trust Board Mercy Mission of New Zealand Trust Board was established in 2010 to formalise a longstanding financial support arrangement between a number of New Zealand individuals and the Mercy Mission Welfare Society in Vizianagaram, India. Mercy Mission of New Zealand Trust Board supports projects that are directed at relieving the effects of extreme poverty in Vizianagaram. Microdreams Foundation New Zealand Humanitarian Trust Microdreams Foundation New Zealand Humanitarian Trust (Microdreams New Zealand) is involved in microfinance. Its objectives are directed at relieving poverty in the Pacific Islands. Microdreams New Zealand was set up in 2014 13 to work in partnership with Microdreams Foundation (a United States charity) to raise funds to support for-profit private sector microfinance lenders in Pacific and Micronesian developing countries. 13 The New Zealand charity has existed since 2007 in other forms. 137 NPH New Zealand Charitable Trust NPH New Zealand Charitable Trust was established in 2012 to assist the work of NPH International. The objective of the New Zealand trust is to provide financial and other support for orphaned, abandoned and at-risk children who live in conditions of extreme poverty. This support is implemented by providing homes, programmes and facilities to care for affected children. The main focus of the charity’s efforts is in Central America, Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Orphans Refugees and Aid (ORA International) of New Zealand Charitable Trust Orphans Refugees and Aid (ORA International) of New Zealand Charitable Trust has had a presence in New Zealand since 1999 and a charitable trust was created in 2003. The charity’s purposes are: • child development and relief, with particular emphasis towards education; • community development and capacity-building projects, including business development, in developing countries; • preventing children and women from becoming victims of human and sex trafficking; and • rehabilitating and educating former child soldiers who have been conscripted or levied in civil or ethnic conflicts. Siphala Foundation Siphala Foundation was created in 2007 to assist underprivileged and economically disadvantaged children to enhance their educational activities in New Zealand and Sri Lanka. Siphala Foundation provides scholarships to further studies in chemistry at Auckland University. In Sri Lanka, the Foundation’s activities are directed at sponsoring students to further their secondary school and tertiary education, and developing capacity in neglected schools in remote parts of Sri Lanka. Solomon Outreach Society Registered as a charitable entity in 2012, the trust’s objective is to provide educational resources and medical goods directed at the alleviation of poverty in the Solomon Islands. Toraja Rural Development Charitable Trust Formed in 2005, the Toraja Rural Development Charitable Trust funds and manages projects in Indonesia to relieve poverty amongst farming communities in the Toraja region. The principal focus is to improve the financial viability of farm families involved in growing coffee, and improve the quality and quantity of production. 138 Revisions to the list of recipients of charitable and other public benefits gifts The following revisions are to be made to the list of organisations on schedule 32: • Reference to The Destitute Children’s Home (Pokhara) Charitable Trust is replaced with Youth Education and Training Initiatives (YETI) Nepal Trust with effect fro m 1 April 2013. • Bicycles for Humanity, Auckland, is removed with effect from 3 December 2015 as the charity has ceased operations and wound up. 139 LAND TAINTING AND COUNCIL CONTROLLED ORGANISATIONS (Clauses 9, 10, 11 and 12) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment is being made to the Income Tax Act 2007 to exempt entities controlled by local authorities from the land tainting rules. This exemption does not apply when an entity controlled by the local authority is associated wit h a property development entity that is outside the council group. Application date This amendment will apply from 1 September 2015, the date on which Auckland Council established a land development entity. The amendment will prevent land held by council-controlled organisations of Auckland Council from being tainted by the land development entity. Key features Proposed new section CB 15C of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides an exemption from the land tainting rules contained in sections CB 9(2), CB 10(2) and CB 11(2), and applies to entities controlled by or associated with a local authority. The exemption does not apply to: • entities associated with a local authority under the tripartite relationship test in section YB 14; and • entities associated to a property developer when that developer is outside the council group, unless that association occurs under section YB 14. Background The land tainting rules were introduced to prevent tax avoidance, but are overreaching in the context of council groups by taxing capital account land in situations when there is no tax avoidance concern. There is not considered to be any tax avoidance concern in this context for the following reasons: • Council-controlled organisations are holding land necessary for their operations to ensure they are individually accountable for the use of the land and able to more easily make commercial decisions in relation to the land, not to avoid tax for a developer in the group. • Many of the affected council-controlled organisations have held land prior to any entity in the group being considered a property developer. 140 • If a council group were intending to avoid tax, it would not develop land in a taxable entity, nor would it hold land in its taxable council-controlled organisations. Instead, the council would undertake the development itself and lease all necessary land to its council-controlled organisations. This would have no tax effect, as councils are exempt from tax whereas their council-controlled organisat ions may not be. • Council-controlled organisations operate independently of each other, with distinct business objectives. They are so independent that each organisation has its own separate board and makes decisions without reference to the council or the other council-controlled organisations. Therefore, any land held by a council-controlled organisation is likely to be unrelated to the development activities of another entity within the group. The policy intent behind the proposed amendment is to exempt entities within the council group from the land tainting rules to prevent the overreach described above. Examples Example 1 illustrates the situation when entities associated with a local authority under section YB 14 are excluded from the exemption as this has the potential to exempt entities outside the council group. Example 1 Entities associated to an external property developer are not exempt as it is considered that there is some tax avoidance concern when an external entity has some form of control over an entity within the council group. For example, the development entity may seek to avoid tax by holding properties in the name of the entity it jointly controls with the council. Local Authority Third Party YB2 YB11 Developer Trust Local Authority YB11 YB14 YB3(4) 141 Examples 2 and 3 illustrate situations when the exemption is not intended to apply. Example 2 Example 3 Both the C Co in example 2 and the company in example 3 with the “tainted” labels beneath them are not exempt under proposed section CB 15C because of their association to development entities that operate outside the council group. Local Authority Private Development Company YB2 50% C Co YB2 tainted C Co YB2 50% Local Authority Private Company YB3(4) 50% C Co YB2 tainted Company YB2 50% Development Trust YB 11 142 Example 4 shows what happens when the property development occurs within the council group but an external entity still exerts control over a council entity. The council entity will still be exempt as it is considered that there is no tax avoidance concern when the development occurs within the group. Example 4 Example 5 illustrates what happens when an entity associated to the local authority is also associated to the property developer under section YB 14. The entity will still be exempt as the developer does not exert control over that entity in that situation and so there is no tax avoidance concern. Example 5 Local Authority Private Company YB3(4) 50% C Co YB2 not tainted as CB15C applies Partnership YB12 50% YB12 Development Company Local Authority Developer YB2 YB11 Trust C Co YB11 YB14 YB3(4) not tainted as CB15C applies 143 LOSS OFFSETS TO MINERAL MINERS (Clause 125) Summary of proposed amendment A proposed amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007 will allow a company to make its tax loss available to a mineral miner that is part of the same group. This will achieve a similar outcome to that available to mining holding companies before the repeal of those provisions in 2014. Application date The proposed amendment will apply for the 2014–15 and later income years. This date aligns with the application date of the 2014 mineral mining amendments. Background Section IS 1(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 restricts a mineral miner from being included in a group of companies that can use a tax loss from, or provide a tax loss to, another member of the group. This restriction was introduced to reflect the unique income tax treatment of mineral miners. Before its repeal in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014, section IS 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007 overrode section IS 1(1) and allowed a mineral miner to use the tax loss of a mining holding company. Mining holding companies also previously had other purposes but were removed as part of the review of mineral mining tax rules completed in 2014. Under the current rules, a mineral miner that is carrying forward tax losses and that breaches loss continuity due to an ownership change can continue to carry those tax losses forward to offset against future income from the same permit area. The trade- off for this concession is that a mineral miner cannot make their tax losses available to other members within their group. The current rules also restrict a mineral miner from accessing the tax losses from other members within their group. There is no policy reason why this restriction is necessary. The proposed amendment removes the restriction on a mineral miner using the tax loss of another member from the same group. The restriction on another member of the group using the tax loss of a mineral miner will be retained. 144 ATTRIBUTION OF MINERAL MINING LOSSES TO SHAREHOLDERS OF LOSS ATTRIBUTING QUALIFYING COMPANIES (Clauses 102, 122(1), (2), (5) and (6)) Summary of proposed amendment A proposed amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007 will clarify that a mineral miner that was a loss attributing qualifying company (LAQC) could attribute a net mining loss to its shareholders. Application date The proposed amendment will apply for the 2008–09 and later income years beginning before 1 April 2011. This period aligns with the start of the Income Tax Act 2007 and ends with the repeal of the LAQC rules. Key features Following the removal of the lower tax rate applying to mining income, there remains little policy justification for preventing the attribution of mining losses to shareholders in a LAQC. The proposed retrospective amendment validates past tax positions taken that attributed mining losses of a LAQC to its shareholders. A “savings” provision will ensure an LAQC that did not attribute a mining loss to its shareholders and does not request to amend their tax position will not be required to do so. Background For some time there has been considerable uncertainty over the relationship between the mineral mining rules, the loss rules and the LAQC rules. The LAQC rules were repealed for income years beginning on or after 1 April 2011. Due to the ring-fencing of mineral mining losses, it was not clear whether an LAQC could attribute a mining loss to its shareholders, consistent with the broad policy objective of attributing losses to shareholders of a LAQC. Amendments to the mining rules from 1996 onward did not clearly deal with how taxpayers should treat a mining loss. This has led to different views on how to apply mining loss provisio ns to a LAQC. The Income Tax Act 2007 clarified the law to reflect the original policy intention that all ring-fenced losses (including mineral mining losses) could only be used as set out in the specific loss rules. 145 SHARING NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION UNDER AN APPROVED INFORMATION SHARING AGREEMENT (Clause 292) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment proposes to enable Inland Revenue to share both personal and non- personal information under an Approved Information Sharing Agreement (AISA). The current tax secrecy rules under the Tax Administration Act allow Inland Revenue to disclose personal information about an identifiable individual under an AISA but not non-personal information. The change will allow for the more efficient use of information, in approved circumstances, across government agencies. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features The tax secrecy provision, section 81A of the Tax Administration Act 1994, enables Inland Revenue to share personal information when the sharing is authorised under an AISA under Part 9A of the Privacy Act. However, personal information is often mixed in with non-personal information. In these instances the current wording of the tax secrecy provision does not allow Inland Revenue to fully realise the potential to share taxpayer information under an AISA (which can accommodate the sharing of both personal and non-personal information). The proposed change will allow non-personal information to be shared under an AISA. This amendment would fulfil the intention of the AISA framework to enable all information (personal and non-personal) to be shared for an approved purpose. Background Inland Revenue has extensive information-collection powers to make sure all taxpayers are compliant with their tax obligations. As a counterbalance, these powers come with requirements on Inland Revenue to maintain tax secrecy. Tax secrecy has traditionally been considered necessary for promoting taxpayer compliance. Inland Revenue’s tax secrecy laws are broad, covering all matters relating to legislation administered by Inland Revenue. 14 Communication of these matters is not normally permitted other than for the purpose of carrying into effect that legislation. 14 Section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 146 Over time a number of exceptions to this strict rule have developed, the majorit y o f which involve cross-government information sharing. These exceptions reflect the weighing of principles of tax secrecy against the need to support economic efficiency and growth, and wider government outcomes such as public safet y. One of these specific exceptions relates to the sharing of information under an AISA under Part 9A of the Privacy Act. 147 TIME BAR AND ANCILLARY TAXES (Clause 295) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment clarifies the time bar applies to ancillary taxes and the approved issuer levy (AIL). Application date The proposed amendment will apply from the date of introduction of the bill. This will mean that the Commissioner cannot increase an amount in an ancillary tax or AIL return if four years have passed from the end of the tax year in which the taxpayer provides the relevant return and the introduction of the bill (unless one of the existing exemptions applies). Key features The amendment treats the filing of the relevant return for each of the different ancillary taxes as an income tax return for the purposes of the time bar provision. The amendment also treats an AIL return as an income tax return for the purposes of the time bar. The filing of the relevant return for the ancillary tax is treated as a self-assessment for the purposes of the time-bar section only. The returns will only be self-assessments for the time-bar provision to avoid the wider consequences of being assessments under the Tax Administration Act 1994. In addition, the filing of an AIL return will trigger the time bar for NRWT and AIL purposes, to give taxpayers certainty for amounts paid to non-residents. The effect of the proposed amendment will be to ensure the time bar applies to ancillary taxes and AIL (including the exceptions to the time bar). This means that the Commissioner will only be able to increase a self-assessment of an ancillary tax or AIL: • within four years from the end of the tax year in which the taxpayer provides the relevant return; or • at any time, if the return is fraudulent or wilfully misleading, or fails to mention income of a particular nature or from a particular source (consistent with the existing exceptions in the income tax time bar). 148 Background The time bar prevents the Commissioner from increasing an income tax assessment four years from the end of the tax year in which a return has been filed and an assessment has been made (subject to certain exceptions). There is some uncertainty about whether the time bar ordinarily applies to ancillary taxes or the AIL. Ancillary taxes include some important elements of the New Zealand tax system, including PAYE, fringe benefit tax, resident withholding tax (RWT), non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) and several other ancillary taxes. The approved issuer levy, while not within the definition of an ancillary tax, is similar in many respects to the other ancillary taxes. The application of the time bar is uncertain because, for it to apply, three requirements must be satisfied: • the taxpayer must have furnished an income tax return; • an assessment must have been made; and • four years must have passed from the end of the tax year in which the taxpayer provides the tax return. In some cases, it is unclear whether an income tax return has been filed in the circumstances. For example, an AIL return is filed under the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 and is not treated as an income tax return. More significantly, in most cases no assessments are made for ancillary taxes. It is only if the Commissioner decides to issue an assessment under one of the discretionary assessment provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994 that an assessment is made. This means that, although the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that the time bar should apply to ancillary taxes, in practice the time bar does not apply in the majority of cases. 149 ANNUAL SETTING OF INCOME TAX RATES (Clause 3) Summary of proposed amendment The bill sets the annual income tax rates that will apply for the 2016–17 tax year. The annual rates to be confirmed are the same that applied for the 2015–16 tax year. Application date The provision will apply for the 2016–17 tax year. Key features The annual income tax rates for the 2016–17 tax year will be the rates specified in schedule 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 150 Working for Families tax credits 151 152 OVERVIEW A number of Working for Families tax credits (WFFTC) remedial amendments are proposed. A review of the parental tax credit legislation has indicated areas where the legislation could be clarified to ensure the policy intent for entitlement to and abatement of payments of parental tax credit (PTC) is clear. In particular, problems were identified when the parental ent it lement period spans mult iple ent it lement periods and crosses tax years. Several proposals apply on 1 April 2008, when a rule for PTC recipients who have a parental entitlement period that crosses two tax years and receive their PTC as a lump sum was introduced. Other proposed amendments clarify the legislation that relates to the policy change to the parental tax credit abatement formula as part of Budget 2014. The remaining amendments enable employees, when determining their income for social policy purposes, to apply the maximum fringe benefit tax (FBT) rate (currently 49.25%) on their short-term charge facilities (such as vouchers) provided by their employer. Alternatively, they can apply their correct FBT rate if this has been provided by their employer. All section references relate to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. 153 PARENTAL TAX CREDIT ABATEMENT FORMULA (Clause 142) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments to section MD 2(3) and (4) will ensure parental tax credit (PTC) recipients who have a parental entitlement period that starts at the end of one tax year and extends into the beginning of the next tax year have the correct amount of abatement applied to their credit. The change also applies to PTC recipients whose WFFTC entitlement changes during their parental entitlement period. Application date The proposed amendments to section MD 2(3) and (4) apply for dependent children born on or after 1 April 2015; this ensures the amendments apply to all children affected by the Budget 2014 PTC abatement changes. Key features The proposed amendment to the PTC abatement formula in section MD 2(3) changes “entitlement days” to “70”. This change to the formula ensures that PTC recipients who have a parental entitlement period that starts at the end of one tax year and extends into the beginning of the next tax year, or whose WFFTC entitlement changes during their parental entitlement period, do not have a greater amount of abatement applied to their credit than the Government intended. The number of days a recipient is entitled to the PTC within the full 70-day parental entitlement period does not need to be explicitly included in the PTC abatement formula. The adjustment for these days is already accounted for in the calculation of “period abatement amount” (proposed to be renamed “entitlement period abatement amount”) and “amount used”. The proposed related amendment to section MD 2(4) deletes the definition of “entitlement days” as this term is longer used in the parental tax credit abatement formula. Background As part of Budget 2014, the Taxation (Parental Tax Credit) Act 2014 introduced a new PTC abatement formula in section MD 2(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007. As enacted, the resulting PTC abatement formula was intended to ensure the PTC is abated against each dollar of family scheme income earned above the annual WFFTC income threshold (currently $36,350) for the entire tax year. Previously, the PTC was only abated against the income earned by a family during their parental entitlement period. This shorter period resulted in an effective abatement rate of around 4% over the year. In contrast, the other Working for Families tax credits are subject to an 154 abatement rate of 22% on family scheme income earned above the income threshold for the tax year. The lower effective abatement rate on PTC meant most parents continued to receive PTC on family incomes over $100,000 a year while the new formula better targeted assistance to families on lower incomes. The PTC abatement formula applies to families who receive the PTC either as instalment amounts during a tax year or as a lump sum amount at the end of a tax year (sections MD 11, MD 13 and MD 16). Detailed analysis Officials are concerned that the drafting of the PTC abatement formula in section MD 2 and its related provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 could inadvertently result in a person’s PTC entitlement being subject to a greater amount of abatement than intended in specific circumstances. Hence, the amount of PTC some people receive could be reduced below what the Government intended when the PTC Budget 2014 changes were made. The PTC abatement formula is as follows: (period abatement amount − amount used) × 365 ÷ entitlement days The concern surrounds the use of “entitlement days” in the formula. “Entitlement days” is defined as being “the number of days in a parental entitlement period that are in the abatement period”. If a person is entitled to the full 10 weeks of PTC, this would equate to 70-entitlement days. In this situation the formula works. It grosses the PTC abatement amount for the 70-day period up to a full year equivalent. However, if a person is entitled to the PTC for less than 10 weeks, the formula could subject PTC recipients’ credit to a larger amount of abatement than the Government intended. A person may only be entitled to the PTC for say five weeks if they receive a welfare benefit for the other five weeks, and their “entitlement days” would be 35. The number of “entitlement days” would also be lower for parental tax credit recipients who have a parental entitlement period that spans two tax years (their child was born near the end of the tax year). They could, for instance, have 35 entitlement days in the first tax year and 35 entitlement days in the second tax year. In this situation the formula in section MD 2 could gross up both 35-day abatement periods to a full year equivalent. Conversely, the PTC calculation formula in section MD 12 reduces a recipient’s entitlement to take into account of the number of days they were eligible to receive the payment out of the maximum number of days (70). Therefore, the recipient would only be eligible to receive half the PTC for each tax year but abated against a full year’s income. The net result being that PTC recipient’s credit is subject to a larger amount of abatement than the Government intended. 155 PTC abatement formula examples 15 Nikki and Danny have one child aged 4, and a new baby. Danny works as an electrician earning $95,000. Their family tax credit entitlement is $8,173, their in-work tax credit entitlement is $3,120. They also claim the PTC as a lump sum and are eligible for a parental tax credit of $2,200, before abatement, for the year to 31 March 2016. Family scheme income $95,000 Less abatement threshold ($36,350) Abatement rate \*21.25% Full year abatement $12,463.13 Example 1: Parental entitlement period and entitlement period = 1 April 2015 to 9 June 2015 (70 days/10 weeks) Family credit abatement for entitlement period = $12,463.13 x 70/365 = $2,390.19 Family tax credit ($8,173 x 70/365) $1,567.42 Less abatement ($2,390.19) -$822.77 In-work tax credit ($3,120 x 10/52) $600.00 Less remaining abatement ($822.77) -$222.77 Before the PTC amount is abated, the remaining credit abatement is scaled up, using the new formula in section MD 2(3): Scaled up credit abatement = (period abatement amount – amount used) x 365 for PTC entitlement days = ($2,390.19 – $1,567.42 – $600.00) x 365 70 = $1,161.59 Abated PTC = $2,200 - $1,161.59 = $1,038 (correct abatement applied) Example 2: First entitlement period = 26 Feb 2016 to 31 March 2016 (35 days/5 weeks) Family credit abatement for entitlement period = $12,463.13 x 35/365 = $1,195.09 Family tax credit ($8,173 x 35/365) $783.71 Less abatement ($1,195.09) -$411.38 In-work tax credit ($3,120 x 5/52) $300.00 Less remaining abatement ($411.38) -$111.38 15 These examples are based on the example outlined in the TIB 2014 No 28: http://www.ird.govt.nz/technical-tax/legislation/2014/2014-28/2014-28-index.html and use the former abatement rate of 21.25% and in-work tax credit rate of $3,120. The abatement rate increased to 22.5% and payment to $3,770 from 1 April 2016. 156 Before the PTC amount is abated, the remaining credit abatement is scaled up, using the PTC abatement formula in section MD 2(3): Scaled up credit abatement = (period abatement amount – amount used) x 365 for PTC entitlement days = ($1,195.09 – $783.71 – $300.00) x 365 35 = $1,161.53 There is a similar calculation for the period 1 April 2016 to 5 May 2016 (35 days) under section MD 16, resulting in a scaled up abatement of $1,161.53. Abated PTC = $1,100 – $1,161.53 (1 st entitlement period) + $1,100 – $1,161.53 (2 nd entitlement period) = $0 (incorrect abatement applied) The proposals will change “entitlement days” in the formula to “70” which will result in the correct level of abatement. Abated PTC = $1,100 – $580.77 (1 st entitlement period) + $1,100 – $580.77 (2 nd entitlement period) = $1 ,038 (correct abatement applied) 157 ENTITLEMENT PERIODS (Clauses 142 and 144) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments to sections MD 2(3), MD 2(4), MD 12(1) and MD 12(3)(b) make it clear that a separate amount of PTC and a corresponding amount of abatement apply to each entitlement period within a parental entitlement period. Application dates The proposed amendments to section MD 2(3) and (4) apply for dependent children born on or after 1 April 2015. This ensures the amendments apply to all children affected by the Budget 2014 PTC abatement changes. The proposed amendments to sections MD 12(1) and MD 12(3)(b) apply on and after 1 April 2008, the date the PTC rule for recipients who have a parental entitlement period that spans two tax years and receive their credit as a lump sum was introduced, as they merely clarify the rule’s original policy intent. Key features Proposed amendments to the definition of items in the PTC formula in section MD 2(4) and the insertion of these terms into the formula in section MD 2(3) ensures separate PTC amounts are calculated for each entitlement period within the parental ent it lement period. A proposed amendment to the PTC entitlement provision in section MD 12(1) makes it clear that a separate PTC entitlement is calculated for each entitlement period. Proposed amendment to section MD 12(3)(b) changes the definition of “days” in the PTC entitlement formula to make it clear that it refers to the number of days in an ent it lement period within a parental ent it lement period. The amendments make it clear that a separate amount of PTC and a corresponding amount of abatement apply to each entitlement period within a parental entitlement period. Background Determination of a PTC entitlement involves calculating a separate amount of PTC and a corresponding amount of abatement to apply to each ent it lement period within a parental ent it lement period. The separate abated PTC amounts for a tax year are added together to create the total parental tax credit for a tax year. All the separate Working for Families tax credits abated amounts for each entitlement period are 158 added together in this way to ensure a WFFTC recipient’s end-of-year entitlement reflects changes to their family’s circumstances during the year. However, in some of the PTC abatement and entitlement provisions it was not clear that a separate amount of PTC and a corresponding amount of abatement apply to each ent it lement period within a parental ent it lement period. In particular, there is concern that the wording in the current PTC abatement formula in section MD 2 could produce unintended results. “Period abatement amount” in the PTC abatement formula in section MD 2(3) could be interpreted as being the abatement amount for the whole tax year. But the way the general WFFTC provisions are worded indicates that a new PTC abatement amount is calculated each time a person’s WFFTC entitlement changes. Therefore, it could be argued that section MD 2 calculates a full year PTC abatement amount to apply against the PTC each time a person’s WFFTC entitlement changes. This would result in a PTC recipient’s credit being subject to a larger amount of abatement than the Government intended. A similar problem with ambiguity in the PTC legislation regarding the relationship of the parental entitlement period and the entitlement period has been identified in the definition of “days” in section MD 12(3)(b). 159 PARENTAL TAX CREDIT “CROSS-YEAR” SITUATIONS (Clauses 141, 144, 145 and 146) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendment to section MD 1(3)(c) will clarify that PTC recipients who have a parental entitlement period that starts at the end of one tax year and extends into the beginning of the next tax year may receive their credit as a lump sum in an end-of-year assessment for the first tax year (cross-year situation). The proposed changes to section MD 1(3)(d), and addition of subsection (5) to section MD 12, and (4B) to section MD 13 make it clear when a PTC recipient has a “cross- year situation”, an extra amount of PTC abatement is added to the first tax year that relates to one or more entitlement periods in the second tax year that are within the parental entit lement period. Proposed new section MD 12B matches new sections MD 12(5) and MD 13(4B). Section MD 12B makes it clear that a corresponding extra amount of PTC is added to the first tax year that relates to the entitlement period that starts in the second tax year. Application dates The amendment to section MD 1(3)(c) applies on and from 1 April 2008, the date the “cross-year situation” rule for recipients that have a parental entitlement period that spans two years and receive their credit as a lump sum was introduced. The proposed amendment to section MD 1(3)(d) applies for dependent children born on or after 1 April 2015, to ensure that the amendments apply to all children affected by the Budget 2014 PTC abatement changes. New subsection (5) in section MD 12, and new section MD 12B apply on and after 1 April 2008, the date the PTC rule for people in “cross-year situations” was introduced, as they merely clarify the rule’s original policy intent. The parts of the provisions that refer to “56 days” are changed to “70 days”; this applies for dependent children born on or after 1 April 2015. The subsequent change reflects the Budget 2014 extension of the maximum parental entit lement period. The amendment to new section MD 13(4B) applies on and after 1 April 2014 as this provision refers to the formula used in section MD 16. This formula was changed on this date to clarify that an extra amount of PTC abatement calculated which relates to the recipient’s entitlement days in the second tax year is added on to the PTC abatement calculated for the first tax year in “cross-year situat ions”. Due to the Budget 2014 changes, the part of the provision that says “56 days” is changed to “70 days”; this applies for dependent children born on or after 1 April 2015. 160 Key features The proposed amendment to section MD 1(3)(c) amends the definition of PTC to make it explicitly clear that if a PTC recipient receives their credit as a lump sum in the first tax year, an extra amount of credit will be added to the last entitlement period in the first tax year to account for the days in the second tax year. The proposed amendment to section MD 1(3)(d) amends the definition of credit abatement to make it clear when a PTC recipient has a “cross-year situation”, an extra amount of abatement is added to the last entitlement period in the first tax year that relates to one or more entitlement periods that starts in the second tax year. Proposed new sections MD 12(5) and MD 13(4B) clarify that the extra amount of credit or abatement, as applicable, to apply to the first tax year when a PTC recipient has a “cross-year situation” relates to the number of days in their parental entitlement period are in the second tax year. It also outlines that this is calculated under section MD 12B or MD 16, not section MD 12 or MD 13. As a result, sections MD 12(5) and MD 13(4B) ensure that there is no “double counting” of credit or abatement amounts that relate to parental entitlement days in the second tax year in cross-year situations. Proposed new section MD 12B operates the same way as section MD 16, but it calculates an additional amount of PTC, rather than an additional amount of PTC abatement. Background A PTC “cross-year situation” rule was introduced on 1 April 2008 that was intended to ensure recipients who have a parental entitlement period that starts at the end of one tax year and extends into the beginning of the next tax year can receive their PTC entitlement as a lump sum in the end-of-year assessment for the first tax year. However, this extra amount has not been explicitly provided for in the WFFTC ent it lement provisio ns. A “cross-year situation” rule is required because when a PTC recipient’s parental entitlement period spans two tax years, the family credit abatement provision in section MD 13 could produce unintended results (for example, because the parent will generally take unpaid leave once the child is born and have reduced income in the second tax year). It could also be of more use to the recipient to receive the PTC closer to the time o f the birth of the child. The PTC abatement formula in section MD 16 was introduced as an alternative way to calculate total abatement for these “cross-year situat ions”. This formula was amended on 1 April 2014 to clarify that the PTC abatement is calculated using the general formula for the first tax year, then this section calculates an extra amount of abatement relating to the recipient’s entitlement periods in their parental entitlement period in the second tax year. The Budget 2014 legislative changes to the PTC abatement provisions did not update the provision in section MD, 16 which calculates the additional amount of PTC abatement that is applied in the first tax year if recipients receive the PTC as a lump sum in the end-of-year assessment for the first tax year. It is not clear whether the PTC abatement formula in section MD 2 applies the full-year abatement to each tax year for people in this “cross-year situation”. If this were the case, these recipients’ 161 PTC could be subject to a greater amount of abatement than the Government intended. The proposed amendment should make it clear from the relationship between sectio n MD 16 and the other abatement provisions (in sections MD 1(3)(d) and MD 13) that an extra amount of abatement will apply to the first tax year when a PTC recipient has a “cross-year situat ion”. The extra amount relates to the number of days in their parental entitlement period that are in one or more entitlement periods in the second tax year. It should also be clear that as section MD 16 calculates the additional amount of PTC abatement in the second tax year, the other provisions (that is, section MD 13) should not also calculate an amount of PTC abatement for the second tax year. 162 MINOR PTC CLARIFICATIONS (Clauses 142, 143 146 and 147) Proposed amendments A proposed amendment to section MD 2(3) to replace “sections MD 1 and MD 16” with “sections MD 1(3)(d)(i) and MD 16(3)(a)” makes it explicitly clear when the PTC abatement formula should be used. A proposed amendment to section MD 11(6)(a) and (b) makes it clear when the PTC is paid out as a lump sum in an end-of-year assessment, and when the PTC is paid out as instalment payments during the year. A proposed amendment to section MD 13(4) changes the section heading so that it more clearly states that it outlines what happens when the parental entitlement period crosses two tax years. A proposed amendment to section MD 16 changes the section heading so that it more clearly states that the additional PTC abatement is to apply in the tax year of birth if the parental entitlement period crosses two tax years and the credit is paid as a lump sum. Application dates The proposed amendment to section MD 2(3) applies for dependent children born on or after 1 April 2015. This ensures the amendment applies to all children affected by Budget 2014 changes to the PTC abatement formula in section MD 2. The proposed amendments to section MD 11(6)(a) and (b) come into force on the date of enactment, as they are minor clarifications. The amendments to sections MD 13(4), and MD 16 apply on and after 1 April 2014, as this is the date that relevant changes were made to the formula in section MD 16, which is referred to in section MD 13. The parts of the provisions that say “56 days” are changed to “70 days” applies for dependent children born on or after 1 April 2015. The subsequent change reflects the Budget 2014 extension of the maximum parental ent it lement period. 163 FBT VOUCHERS AND SOCIAL POLICY INCOME (Clauses 138 and 334) Summary of proposed amendments Proposed amendments to section MB 7B of the Income Tax Act 2007 and schedule 3, 12A of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 will enable employees, for social policy purposes, to apply the maximum fringe benefit tax (FBT) rate on their short-term charge facilities provided by their employer, if the employer does not provide the correct rate. Application date The amendments will apply on and after 1 April 2014, the date from which employees have been required to include short-term charge facilities in their income for social policy purposes. Key features A proposed amendment to section MB 7B (the rules for including fringe benefits in family scheme income) inserts new subsection (3) which enables employees to use either the rate of FBT used by their employer or the maximum rate of FBT to calculate the FBT payable on their short-term charge facilities. This will enable employees, when calculating their income for WFFTC, community services card and student allowance purposes, to apply the maximum FBT rate (currently 49.25%) on their short-term charge facilities (such as vouchers) provided by their employer, if the employer does not provide the correct rate. A proposed amendment to schedule 3 (adjustments to net income), 12A (income from emplo yment benefits) in the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 inserts new subsection (4), which enables a person to use the FBT rate used by their employer or the maximum FBT rate to calculate the amount of FBT on a short-term charge facility. This enables employees, when calculating their income for student loan repayment purposes, to apply the maximum FBT rate on their short-term charge facilities provided by their employer, if the employer does not provide the correct rate. Background Under the current rules, from 1 April 2014, employees have been required to include short-term charge facilities (such as vouchers) from their employer in their family scheme income (used to determine WFFTC, community services card and student allowance entitlements) and in their adjusted net income (used to determine student loan repayments). This requirement was intended to improve the fairness and integrity of the schemes as short-term charge facilities are equivalent to cash wages. Included in the calculation of the value of an employee’s short-term charge facility is the amount (if any) of FBT paid by their employer. However, social policy recipients 164 and student loan borrowers are unable to include the correct amount of FBT in their family scheme income or net adjusted income if the employer refuses or is unable to provide them with this information. This makes completing the application forms difficult. 165 166 Other remedial amendments 167 168 TAX POOLING PROVISIONS (Clauses 163, 169, 204 and 209) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments aim to ensure that the tax pooling rules work as intended. It is proposed to allow an imputation credit date when purchased tax pooling funds are used to meet an increased amount of tax that is not income tax. The proposed amendments also prevent the double counting of an imputation debit when new shareholders of the company or group sell the company’s or group’s own deposited tax pooling funds to another pool user. Application date It is proposed that the application date for the amendments relating to an imputation credit date where purchased tax pooling funds are used, is 6 October 2009. For amendments that provide for the elimination of an imputation debit when new shareholders of the company or group sell the company’s or group’s own deposited tax pooling funds to another pool user the proposed application date is 1 April 2008. Key features The amendments propose to provide for a credit date where purchased tax pooling funds are used to meet an increased amount of tax that is not income tax, with the credit date being the date of the transfer, by amending sections OB 6(3) and OP 9(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007. Due to a drafting error, there is no current legislative provision which gives a credit date in this situation. The amendments also propose to provide for the elimination of the second debit when new shareholders of the company or group sell the tax pooling funds to another pool user by amending sections OB 26(2), (4) and OP 23(4)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007. This debit in turn follows the previous debit in the imputation credit account (ICA) when there was a breach of the shareholder continuity and subsequent cancellation of imputation credits from pooling funds. Currently, if the shareholders of the company or group sell the tax pooling funds to another pool user, it results in a second ICA debit in relation to the same deposit amount. The proposed amendments are relevant for standard ICA companies and for consolidated groups. Background ICAs record the amounts of tax paid by the company on its income and the allocation of this tax to shareholders. Tax payments and their allocation to shareholders by the companies must have credit and debit dates. 169 ICA companies commonly purchase funds from tax pools. With effect from 6 October 2009, changes to tax pooling rules were made to allow tax pooling to be used for some payments of tax other than income tax. Two drafting errors have been identified following these changes: • the omission of a credit date when an ICA company uses purchased pooling funds to meet a non-income tax obligation that resulted from an increased amount of tax; and • double counting of debits in the ICA relating to the sale of tax pooling funds after a breach of shareholder continuity. Detailed analysis No credit date when pooling funds purchased to meet a non-income tax obligation Because the imputation rules require all funds that go through a tax pooling account to flow a corresponding credit (and where necessary a debit) through the company’s ICA (subpart OA), this means all use of tax pooling funds for non-income tax obligations also flow through the ICA by way of reciprocal credits and debits with appropriate dates. However, when the 2009 changes to tax pooling were made, a drafting omission resulted in no credit date being able to be determined in relation to the funds that go through a tax pooling account in the situation where an ICA company uses purchased pooling funds to meet a non-income tax obligation that resulted from an increased amount of tax (section OB 6(3) and section OP 9(3) for consolidated groups of companies). There are no issues with debit dates. When the money has been purchased from a tax pool in accordance with section OB 6(3) or section OP 9(3), as applicable, the purchaser of the funds may then want to: a) use the purchased funds to satisfy an income tax liability; b) request for the purchased funds to be refunded; c) on-sell the purchased funds to another person; d) use the purchased funds to satisfy a non-income tax liability. Although section OB 6(3) and section OP 9(3), as applicable, provide credit dates for situations “a” to “c”, no legislative provision gives a credit date for situation “d”. This is illustrated by the example below. 170 Example Company A (Co A) deposits its own funds ($100) into the tax pool, on 28 August 2014. Co A automatically receives an ICA credit which equals the amount of the deposit (section OB 5 or OP 8, as applicable), with the credit date being 28 August 2014. So when Co A deposited $100 in the tax pool, its ICA account is credited with $100, with a credit date of 28 August 2014. Company B (Co B) bought funds on 30 November 2014 from the same tax pool to meet a tax liability that it believes will arise on 15 January 2015. Co B bought $80 of Co A’s $100 deposit (the $80 retains an effective date of 28 August 2014). Co A immediately gets an ICA debit of $80 (section OB 35 or OP 33, as applicable), with the debit date(s) being determined by an ordering rule set out in section OB 35(4) or OP 33(4). Co B, however, gets no ICA credit date for the $80 at the time of purchase, though it has an imputation credit entitlement of $80 upon acquiring this amount; this credit is not allocated a credit date until one of the three events set out in section OB 6(3) or OP 9(3) occurs. This is because until the credit date is established it is not possible to determine when to credit the ICA. Co A then uses its remaining deposit of $20 to pay income tax. It produces no ICA impact as Co A’s ICA has already been credited with $20 ($100 credit on deposit into the tax pool less $80 debited for the funds sold to Co B). Co B can use its $80 of purchased tax pooling funds in any one of the following ways: a) Co B can pay its second instalment of 2015 provisional tax on 15 January 2015 (say, $80) – Co B’s ICA account is then able to be credited by $80, with the date of the credit for both income tax and ICA purposes being 28 August 2014 (or any later date chosen) (section OB 6(3)(a) or OP 9(3)(a) as applicable). b) Co B can request a refund from the tax pool of the purchased funds (say on 28 January 2015 Co B wants the $80 refunded). This then causes Co B’s ICA to be credited with $80, with the credit date being 28 January 2015 (section OB 6(3)(b) or OP 9(3)(b) as applicable), and its ICA being debited by $80, with the debit date(s) being determined by an ordering rule set out in section OB 34(4) or OP 32(4) as applicable. c) Co B can on-sell some of the $80 of purchased funds (say $20) to Co C on 28 January 2015 – Co B’s ICA is credited by $20, with the credit date being 28 January 2015 (section OB 6(3)(c) or OP 9(3)(c), as applicable, and debited by $20 with the debit date(s) being determined by an ordering rule set out in section OB 35(4) or OP 33(4), as applicable). Co C has an entitlement to a $20 ICA credit but a credit date cannot be determined under section OB 6(3) or OP 9(3), as applicable, until Co C has decided how the funds will be used. d) Co B wants to pay an increased amount of GST of $5. Co B’s ICA is debited by $5 (section OB 33 or OP 31, as applicable), but there is no credit date able to be determined due to the absence of a legislative provision giving such a date. The effect of this is that while an imputation credit arises in scenario “d”, this credit is not able to be allocated on any credit date in the ICA to eliminate the corresponding imputation debit that has arisen. The proposed solution is to amend section OB 6(3) and for consolidated groups section OP 9(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 to provide for a credit date where purchased tax pooling funds are used to meet an increased amount of tax that is not income tax with the credit date being the date of the transfer. Double counting of debits in the ICA If there is a breach of shareholder continuity, pre-breach imputation credits from the taxpayer’s own deposited pooling funds in the company’s ICA get cancelled. This results in a debit arising in the ICA (section OB 41 and for consolidated groups section OP 42). 171 If the new shareholders of the company or group, as applicable, sell the tax pooling funds to another pool user it results in the second ICA debit in relation to the same deposit amount (section OB 35 or section OP 33, as applicable). Previously, in the Income Tax Act 2004, this was relieved by the provision of an imputation credit arising, which eliminated the second debit. However, following the rewrite this relief was inadvertently omitted. The proposed solution is to amend several sections of the Income Tax Act 2007 – OB 26(2)(a) and (4)(a) and OP 23(2)(a) and (4)(a) – to ensure that such relief is provided. 172 CROSS-REFERENCE ERRORS IN PROVISIONS RELATING TO DEPRECIATION RECOVERY INCOME (Clauses 49, 50, 51, 262(11) and 341) Summary of proposed amendments The amendments propose to correct a number of cross-reference errors in the depreciation rules of the Income Tax Act 2007, along with relevant corresponding provisions in the Income Tax Act 2004. Application dates The proposed amendment to section EE 49(8) of the Income Tax Act 2007 will apply from the start of the 2007–08 tax year, and the proposed correction of the cross- reference error in section EE 42(8) of the Income Tax Act 2004 will apply from the start of the 2005–06 tax year. It is proposed that there is a “savings” provision for both amendments for taxpayers who have taken a tax position on the law as it existed before introduction of the bill. It is proposed that the correction of the cross-reference errors in sections EE 44, EE 47 and in the paragraph (a) of the definition of “consideration” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply from the date of enactment. Key features There are two different types of proposed remedial amendments, which correct cross- reference errors in the following rules: • The rules relating to partial business use of an asset. It is proposed to change the cross-reference in section EE 49(8) of the Income Tax Act 2007 from section EE 48(1) to section EE 48(1)(a), and the cross-reference in section EE 42(8) of Income Tax Act 2004 from section EE 41(1) to section EE 41(1)(a). • The rules relating to calculation of depreciation recovery income and in the definition of “consideration”. It is proposed to correct cross-reference errors in sections EE 44, EE 47 and in the paragraph (a) of the definition of “consideration” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, from sections EE 48 to EE 52 to sections EE 48 to EE 51. 173 Background Cross-reference error in sections EE 49(8) (Income Tax Act 2007) and EE 42(8) (Income Tax Act 2004): Partial business use of an asset There is a cross-reference error in the apportionment rule in section EE 49(8) of the Inco me Tax Act 2007 (and section EE 42(8) of the Income Tax Act 2004), which results in an incorrect apportionment of depreciation recovery income between the business and private elements. Section EE 49(8) of the Income Tax Act 2007 should refer to section EE 48(1)(a). Section EE 42(8) of Income Tax Act 2004 should refer to section EE 41(1)(a). The policy intent is that if a person derives consideration on disposal of a depreciable asset (other than a building) in excess of the tax depreciated value (adjusted tax value), the person derives depreciation recovery income calculated as the lesser of: • the person’s total allowable deductions for depreciation loss for that asset; or • the difference between the consideration and the adjusted tax value. The cross-reference error results in an outcome that is inconsistent with the policy intention, as illustrated in the following example: Example A self-employed person purchases a motor vehicle for $40,000 and has business use of it for 65 percent of the time. In the first month of the third year of ownership the vehicle is sold for $40,000. For the first two years of ownership the deductions for depreciation loss (not including private usage) total $13,693 under a 31.2% diminishing value (DV) rate of depreciation (including 20% loading). The adjusted tax value (ATV) at disposal is determined by taking into account the deprecation on the asset, irrespective of private use as follows: Year 1: Depreciation = $12,480; deductible proportion = $8,112; ATV = $27,520 Year 2: Depreciation = $ 8,586; deductible proportion = $5,581; ATV= $18,934 Total tax deductions allowed for depreciation in years 1 and 2 = $13,693 Consideration less ATV at disposal = $21,066 The depreciation recovery income that the person has to account for in the year of sale is calculated using the formula in section EE 49: 푎푙푙 푑푒푑푢푐푡푖표푛푠 (푏푎푠푒 푣푎푙푢푒 −푎푑푗푢푠푡푒푑 푡푎푥 푣푎푙푢푒) ×푎푚표푢푛푡 표푓 푑푒푝푟푒푐푖푎푡푖표푛 푟푒푐표푣푒푟푦 푖푛푐표푚푒 The amount of depreciation recovery income is currently calculated in accordance with section EE 48(1), which says that it is the lesser of the amounts determined under section EE 48(1)(a) ($21,066) and section EE48(1)(b) ($13,963). The depreciation recovery income is therefore $8,900: 13,693 ( 40,000 −18,934 ) ×13,693=8,900 This outcome is not consistent with the policy intent: as consideration ($40,000) exceeds the ATV ($18,934) by $21,066, all depreciation deductions ($13,693) for the asset should be recovered, whereas in fact only $8,900 is recovered under current law. 174 The amendment corrects the cross-reference from section EE 49(8) to EE 48(1)(a) and results in the law working as intended, as shown below: 13,693 ( 40,000 −18,934 ) ×21,066=13,693 Cross-reference errors in sections EE 44, EE 47 and in the definition of “consideration” in section YA 1: Calculation of depreciation recovery income There are identical errors in the rules which provide for the calculation of gain or loss on disposal of a depreciable asset, in sections EE 44 and EE 47, and in the definition of “consideration” in section YA 1: these sections and the definition refer to sections EE 48 to EE 52 when they should refer to sections EE 48 to EE 51. It is proposed that the references to sections EE 48 to EE 52 be changed in the fo llo wing sect ions: Section EE 44 The references to “sections EE 48 to EE 52” in section EE 44 will be changed to “sections EE 48 to EE 51”. This is because section EE 52 will usually apply only when there has not been a disposal of the relevant item or an “event” (as defined in section EE 47) affecting it. Accordingly, section EE 44(1) should not require there to be a disposal or other “event” before section EE 52 applies. Section EE 47 The reference to “sections EE 48 to EE 52” in section EE 47 will be changed to “sections EE 48 to EE 51”. This is because section EE 52 should not apply if there is an “event” in relation to depreciable property, as the tax consequences arising from an “event” are set out in section EE 48. If section EE 52 applied as well as section EE 48, double taxation would arise. In addition, section EE 52 already specifies the situations to which it applies in sect ion EE 52(1), and these do not include the kind of “events” (as defined in section EE 47) against which property would usually be insured (loss, theft or irreparable damage). Accordingly, section EE 52 would be deprived of its practical effect if it only applied when there was an “event”. Definition of “consideration” in section YA 1 The reference to “sections EE 48 to EE 52” in the definition of “consideration” arises because paragraph (a) of the definition quotes the heading of section EE 44, and the phrase “sections EE 48 to EE 52” is included in that heading. Following on fro m the proposed amendments in section EE 44, the reference in paragraph (a) in the definition of “consideration” will be changed to “sections EE 48 to EE 51” to ensure it correctly reflects the new heading of section EE 44. 175 TAXABLE BONUS ISSUES AND AVAILABLE SUBSCRIBED CAPITAL (Clause 22) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment clarifies that imputation credits attached to a taxable bonus issue are not included in the available subscribed capital (ASC). Application date The amendment will come into force on the date of the enactment. Key features An amendment is proposed to section CD 43(7) of the Income Tax Act 2007 to clarify that imputation credits attached to a taxable bonus issue are not included in a company’s ASC. This will also allow for equal treatment between taxable bonus issues and ordinary cash dividends, which are reinvested. Background A company can allocate additional shares to its shareholders as bonus issues. These may be taxed as if they were dividends and imputation credits can be attached. Imputation credits are a tax credit against the shareholder’s tax liability for the dividend and are not equivalent to capital invested into the company. When a company makes a taxable bonus issue, the amount of the issue is included in the company’s ASC amount, which may be returned tax-free to shareholders upon liquidation of the company. In the ASC rules, section CD 43(6)(b) states that the subscriptions amount includes, in the case of a taxable bonus issue that is not a bonus issue in lieu or a share issued under a profit distribution plan, the amount of the dividend arising from a taxable bonus issue. Section CD 15(1)(a) states that the amount of a dividend is increased by an imputation credit attached to the dividend. The result is that the word “dividend” in the ASC rules can be read to include imputation credits. This is not intended. Imputation credits are a tax credit against the shareholder’s tax liability for the dividend and are not equivalent to capital invested into the company. The result is that the ASC can be overstated. This also results in an unequal treatment between taxable bonus issues and ordinary cash dividends, which are reinvested, although in economic terms there is no difference between the two methods of increasing the share investment. The proposed amendment to section CD 43(7) clarifies that imputation credits attached to a taxable bonus issue are not included in a company’s ASC. 176 EXCEPTIONS TO THE REQUIREMENT TO USE THE SAME CALCULATION METHOD FOR THE SAME FIF (Clause 60) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment proposes to remove the potential for conflict over which calculation method should be applied when a person holds more than one interest in the same foreign investment fund (FIF), due to the requirement to use the same method for multiple interests, and the separate requirement to use a specific method for one of the interests. Application date The amendment will come into force on the date of the enactment. Key features The proposed amendment will clarify the intended policy on exceptions to the requirement to use the same calculation method for multiple interests in the same FIF. The proposed amendment to section EX 46 will clarify that a different calculation method is allowed for interests in the same FIF when a particular provision requires a specific method to be used. Background Currently the Income Tax Act 2007 provides several methods for calculating a person’s FIF inco me. There is currently some uncertainty about which method should be applied when a person holds more than one interest in the same FIF. The uncertainty is a result of a conflict between section EX 46 and sections EX 47, EX 48 and EX 62. Section EX 46 requires the use of the same calculation method for mult iple interests in the same FIF (when the interests are of the same class), while sections EX 47, EX 48 and EX 62 require the use of a specific method for one of the interests. Under section EX 44, a taxpayer has a choice between various methods when calculating FIF income or losses from their FIF interests, subject to certain limitations. If a taxpayer has two or more attributing interests in the same FIF for the same period, they are required to use the same calculation method for each interest (section EX 46(1)). A taxpayer can also use a different calculation method for each interest if the interests are of different classes (for example, fixed-rate shares and ordinary shares), and if section EX 46 prevents the same method being used. 177 However, there are other sections that limit the choice of calculation methods, which are not contained within section EX 46 (namely, requirements imposed by sections EX 47, EX 48 and EX 62). This results in a potential conflict between the requirement to use the same method for multiple interests in section EX 46(1) and a requirement to use a specific method for one of the interests (due to any of the sections EX 47, EX 48 and EX 62). For example, when a taxpayer has two interests in one FIF that are of different classes – one being ordinary shares and the other fixed rate shares – the taxpayer is prima facie required to use the same calculation method for each interest. Section EX 47 limits the calculation methods available for fixed-rate shares and generally requires the comparative value method to be used. Therefore in this case it is arguable that the taxpayer must apply the same method to the ordinary shares as well. The taxpayer should, however, be allowed to choose a different method for the ordinary shares. 178 RATIONALISATION OF FOREIGN TAX CREDIT PROVISIONS (Clauses 132, 133 and 262(44)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed remedial changes amend or repeal a number of provisions in subpart LJ, and amend section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, to rationalise the foreign tax credit provisio ns. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features The proposed changes amend or repeal a number of provisions in subpart LJ relating to foreign tax credits, including: • repealing the now obsolete section LJ 1(5); • removing the reference to “foreign tax” in section LJ 1(4) and the corresponding definit ion in sect ion YA 1; • amending the scope of section LJ 1(4) so that it applies to dividends paid by companies resident in countries with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement (DTA) and countries with which New Zealand has no DTA; • amending section LJ 3 to clarify that the definition of “foreign income tax” applies to both foreign tax credits arising under New Zealand’s domestic provisio ns and foreign tax credits arising under DTAs. Background Foreign tax credits prevent the double taxation of foreign-sourced income derived by a New Zealand-resident taxpayer by providing a credit for foreign tax paid on that income. Foreign tax credits can be credited against the relevant New Zealand income tax. Foreign tax credits can be bilateral (arising under a double tax agreement), or unilateral (arising under New Zealand’s domestic provisions). The rules for bilateral foreign tax credits were enacted in 1960, and the rules for unilateral foreign tax credits were enacted in 1962. In legislation preceding the Income Tax Act 2007, the provisions governing foreign tax credits primarily referred to credits allowed under DTAs. As part of the re-write of the foreign tax credit provisions and other amendments, the references to DTAs have been largely removed. The proposed changes seek to further rationalise the foreign tax credit provisions in light of the 179 general removal of DTA references. The proposed changes will not affect current ent it lements to foreign tax credits. The following provisions are proposed to be repealed or amended: Section LJ 1(5) Section LJ 1(5) is proposed to be repealed. This provision provides that subpart LJ, for the purposes of section LJ 2 – the provision under which foreign tax credits are allowed – applies as if section LJ 1(5) were a DTA. Section LJ 1(5) and its forerunners were a mechanism for making the original unilateral foreign tax credit provision subject to the rules in the foreign tax credit provisions that referred to DTAs. Because provisions regulating tax credits no longer refer to DTAs only, the original purpose of section LJ 1(5) no longer exists and it now serves no practical purpose and is potentially confusing. It should therefore be repealed. The definition of “foreign tax” in section YA 1 The definition of “foreign tax” in section YA 1 is proposed to be repealed. The definition applies for subpart LJ purposes but it is only used in section LJ 1(4). The rest of subpart LJ refers to the definition of “foreign income tax” in section LJ 3. The definition of “foreign tax” used to be widely used in earlier versions of the foreign tax credits provisions. As part of the rewriting of the foreign tax credit provisions, all references to “foreign tax” in subpart LJ have been removed (except in section LJ 1(4)). Removing the “foreign tax” definition would rationalise the definitions applying for foreign tax credit purposes. As part of rationalising the foreign tax credit rules, the reference to “foreign tax” is also proposed to be removed in section LJ 1(4). Section LJ 1(4) The scope of section LJ 1(4) is proposed to be amended to apply to dividends paid by all non-resident companies. Section LJ 1(4) attributes a foreign source to dividends paid by non-resident companies for foreign tax credit purposes. Section LJ 1(4) is currently restricted to dividends paid by a company resident in a country with which New Zealand has a DTA. This provision ensures that a credit for foreign withholding tax paid on a dividend derived by a New Zealand resident from a non-resident company that is listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange is still available. Without this specific provision there is a risk that the dividend could be regarded as being sourced in New Zealand. A New Zealand resident is only allowed a credit under section LJ 1(2)(a) for foreign tax paid on income sourced from outside New Zealand. It is proposed that section LJ 1(4) is amended to remove its DTA references so that it applies to dividends paid by all non-resident companies. Section LJ 3 The definition of “foreign income tax” in section LJ 3 is being clarified. “Foreign income tax” is defined in section LJ 3 as meaning “an amount of income tax of a foreign country or territory”. There is no clear link between the definition of “foreign 180 income tax” and either a tax that gives rise to a foreign tax credit under a DTA or the definition in section YA 2(5) of income tax imposed by other countries. The definit ion of “foreign income tax” in section LJ 3 is proposed to be amended so that it refers to both foreign taxes under a DTA as well as the definition of “income tax” in section YA 2(5). This means that the definition of “foreign income tax” in section LJ 3 will clearly apply to both unilateral and bilateral foreign tax credits. 181 REPEAL OF REDUNDANT FOREIGN DIVIDEND PAYMENT PROVISIONS (Clauses 14, 17 to 19, 21, 22, 24, 36, 84 to 88, 90, 94 to 96, 99, 100, 101, 103, 107, 115, 117, 118, 120, 126 to 131, 134, 137, 149 to 155, 158, 159, 161, 162, 165, 166, 168, 170 to 174, 176, 177, 183 to 185, 187 to 190, 192, 194, 197 to 203, 206 to 208, 210 to,219, 221, 222, 224 to 229, 232, 239 to 241, 243 to 245, 249 to 251, 254, 256, 262 (3), (4), (10), (12 to 15), (22), (24), (25), (27 to 29), (31 to 41), (47), (50), (61), (62), (87), (88), (92), (99), (101), (103), 263, 266 to 268, 271, 274 to 278, 282, 283, 285 to 290, 293, 296 to 299, 301, 302) Summary of proposed amendments It is proposed to remove a large number of redundant provisions from the the Income Tax Act 2007 and Tax Administration Act 1994 that still refer, or relate, to foreign dividend payments (FDP). Application date It is proposed that the amendments will apply to the tax year beginning 1 April 2017 and later years. Key features The proposals amend or repeal a large number of the redundant FDP payment provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. Background There are a large number of provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 and Tax Administration Act 1994 that still refer, or relate, to foreign dividend payments (FDP), which are no longer charged for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2009. The FDP charging provision was abolished as part of the overall changes to the international tax rules in the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009. On 1 July 2009, the Government announced that companies’ existing FDP credit balances could be carried forward and used for five years. As this period ended on 1 July 2014, the remaining FDP references are proposed to be removed. 182 CHANGES TO THE TAXATION OF LIFE INSURANCE BUSINESS (Clauses 2(12) and (23), 38, 61 to 71, 89, 149(2), 150(5), 151(3), 152(3), 154(2) and (5), 156, 157, 158(2), (3) and (5), 160, 168(2), (4) and (6), 191, 217, 221, 262(6), (82) and (113)) Summary of proposed amendments A number of remedial changes are proposed, to clarify the taxation rules for life insurance business conducted in New Zealand. Application date Various dates apply to the proposed amendments and are described under “Detailed analysis”. Key features The main proposed changes involve: • codifying the tax treatment of fees charged by the life insurer for managing policyholder investments; and • clarifying the deductibility of interest expenses connected with certain life insurance treaties with a non-resident life reinsurer. Other technical changes are proposed to the treatment of policyholder excess deductions, the definition of “profit participation policy”, the rules relating to amounts under the premium smoothing reserve and the description of amounts that are discounted. The purpose of these changes is to remove ambiguities with the current law and ensure that the rules continue to work as intended. The remaining amendments are technical or consequential in nature. Background The Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009 made significant changes to the way the Income Tax Act 2007 applied to life insurance business in New Zealand. The changes proposed in this bill are part of a continuing programme of work to ensure that the changes to the taxation of life insurance and general insurance work as intended. The changes therefore largely confirm or clarify existing policy settings. 183 Detailed analysis Shareholder base and policyholder base treatment of fees for managing policyholder investments – sections EY 2, 3, 16B, 19 and 19B The bill proposes to codify the treatment of transfers of value from the policyholder base to the shareholder base by the life insurer when the transfer relates to the management of policyholder funds (investments) by the life insurer. New section EY 16B will provide a deduction in an income year for the policyholder base equal to the amount transferred by the life insurer to the shareholder base. The amount transferred must be connected to services (not including life risk) provided by the life insurer in respect of managing policyholder funds (investments) under a non- participation savings life insurance policy. New section EY 19B will create income for the shareholder base equal to the amount transferred by the life insurer from the policyholder base under section EY 16B as consideration for investment management services. A consequential change is also proposed, to section EY 19. The changes inserting new section EY 16B and EY 19B will apply to income years beginning on or after 1 April 2015. Tax positions taken by life insurers in earlier income years that are consistent with new sections EY 16B and EY 19B will be validated. Consequential changes to sections EY 2 and EY 3 cement the relationship the new sections have with the scheme of the life insurance tax rules, with specific reference to policyholder base deductions and shareholder base income. The changes to sections EY 2 and EY 3 will apply for income years beginning on or after 1 April 2015. Interest deductibility when life insurer receives exempt income – section DB 7 A change is proposed to section DB 7 to confirm that groups of companies that include a life insurer, including the life insurer itself, are able to deduct interest expenses notwithstanding that the life insurer may have received tax-exempt income from a life reinsurance treaty with a non-resident under section CW 59C. The change will apply for the income year that includes 1 July 2010 and later income years. Policyholder base excess deductions – section EY 2 A change is proposed to section EY 2(5) to ensure that excess deductions that cannot be subtracted from policyholder income for an income year are carried forward as policyholder base deductions for the next year. The change creates a timing rule regarding when excess deductions should be used, and will apply from the start of the income year following the enactment of the bill. Definitions of “asset base” and “profit participation policy” – section YA 1 A change is proposed to the definition of “profit participation policy” to make it clear that the rules relating to such life insurance policies apply only when both policyholders and shareholders participate in the life insurer’s profits from such business. The aim of the amendment is to clarify that life insurance policies that 184 allow policyholders to earn an investment return (as opposed to participating in the life insurer’s profit) are not subject to sections EY 17 and EY 18, and EY 28 and EY 29. A consequential change will be made to the definition of “asset base” to ensure consistency with the revision to the term “profit participation policy”. The proposed changes will apply for the income year that includes 1 July 2010 and later income years. Premium smoothing reserve – sections EY 23 and EY 25 A number of clarifications are proposed to the drafting of section EY 25, which allows life insurers to smooth the recognition of premium income against life risk when a life insurance policy is sold on the basis of a single or level-term premium. The proposed changes will clarify the following: • The meaning of “PSR period” in section EY 23(6), to make it clear that the reserve has application when there is a material mismatch in the timing of life risk and the timing of life risk components of premiums. • The principles used to calculate the reserving amount for the premium smoothing reserve in section EY 25(3) to make it clear that the reserve does not include amounts for policies for which the life insurer’s obligations to the policyholder have ceased. The drafting of the section is also revised to be consistent with the definit io n of “PSR period”. • A retrospective grammatical change is proposed to section EY 25(3) by replacing the “:” \[co lon\] with an “and” to clarify that the principles used to calculate a reserving amount for the PSR are conjunctive. The change has effect for periods starting from the income year that includes 1 July 2010 and later income years to the first income year beginning after the day this bill receives Royal assent. • The definition of “expected life risk proportion” in section EY 25(6) will be consequentially amended as a result of the redrafted definition of “PSR period” in section EY 23(6). • Further changes will be made to section EY 23(1) to (4) to ensure that the reserving rules generally apply to a class of policies that are not profit participation policies. Apart from the retrospective grammatical change in section EY 25(3), the proposed changes to the rules for the premium smoothing reserve apply from the first income year beginning after the day the bill receives Royal assent. Description of future amounts – sections EY 17, EY 21, EY 28 and EY 29 The life insurance rules require future amounts to be discounted and, when appropriate, net of tax. The bill proposes to update these references in sections EY 17(2), EY 21(2), EY 28(6) and EY 29(8) so that “future value” is consistent with values the life insurer used in its financial reports. The change means that future values will not be calculated by reference to a risk-free rate. References to discounting in connection with reinsurance premiums and claims are also removed by the bill in sections EY 28(5) and EY 29(6). The changes apply from the first income year beginning after the day the bill receives Royal assent. 185 Shareholder base income “Other profit” drafting revisions to the definition of “closing liabilities” – sections EY 28 and EY 29 The bill redrafts the definitions of “closing policy liabilities” and “estimated closing policy liabilities” to improve readability and remove incorrect concepts. The proposed changes apply from the first income year beginning after the day the bill receives Royal assent. Removal of redundant terms “Policyholder Credit Account” and “PCA” – sections FM 30, OA 5 to OA 7, OA 10, OA 13 to OA 15, OA 17, OB 24 and OP 75 The new taxation rules for life insurance do not use the terms “Policyholder Credit Account” and “PCA”. The bill proposes to remove these terms from the Income Tax Act from the date it receives Royal assent. 186 RECHARACTERISATION OF SHAREHOLDER’S BASE: REPURCHASING SHARES (Clauses 2(6) and 73) Summary of proposed amendments The bill replaces the reference to “amount” in section FA 4(2)(b) with “the cost to the shareholder of the cancelled share”. The effect of the change means that taxpayers add the initial cost of the repurchased shares to the remaining shares of the same class. Currently, the amount the taxpayer receives as consideration for the cancellation is added to the remaining shares. Application date The proposed change applies from the 2008–09 and later income years. Earlier tax positions that relied on the current law for income years and transactions in a return of income filed before the date the bill is introduced are preserved. Background A share repurchase is when a company purchases (repurchase) its own shares fro m current shareholders. Monies paid to a shareholder under a share repurchase may be taxed as a dividend. The rewrite of the Income Tax Act changed the amount of the adjustment to the cost price of remaining shares for revenue account taxpayers. Before the rewrite, revenue account taxpayers added the initial cost of the repurchased shares to the remaining shares of the same class. The rewrite changed this rule with the effect that consideration received for the repurchase is added to the value of the remaining shares. The amendment is intended to restore the original law as it was before the rewrite. 187 TAXABLE BONUS ISSUES – COST BASE (Clause 45) Summary of proposed amendments The bill proposes amendments that will allow taxpayers to recognise, under certain conditions, a cost base for shares in a company received from taxable bonus issues. Application date The amendments will apply for shares received under taxable bonus issues made on or after the date of enactment. Key features Section ED 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 will be amended by inserting a new rule (section ED 1(4B)) that recognises on disposal of shares received from taxable bonus issues, a cost for those shares. The recognised cost is equal to the amount of the dividend (taxable bonus issue), not including the amount of any imputation credits or withholding tax that applies to the taxable bonus issue. Background The proposed amendments address an interpretation risk that taxpayers could be subject to a double layer of income tax if the shares received from taxable bonus issues are disposed of as revenue account property. 188 FURTHER INCOME TAX AND CARRIED FORWARD DEBIT BALANCE IN IMPUTATION CREDIT ACCOUNT (Clause 179) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment corrects a drafting error to ensure that a debit balance of an imputation credit company’s account which is carried forward from one year to the next is not subject to a double imposition of income tax. Application date The amendment applies from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. Key features The amendment proposes a wording change in section OB 67(2) to make clear that further income tax is not imposed on the net increase in a debit balance in a company’s imputation credit account for an income year. The proposed amendment ensures that double counting of a prior tax year’s debit balance is not subject to double imposit ion o f inco me tax. Background The imposition of further income tax applies if a company’s imputation credit account has fallen into deficit (a debit balance) during a tax year, and that deficit is not corrected by 31 March of that tax year. Further income tax is imposed to clear that debit balance. It is possible that in the next tax year, the amount of credits attached to dividends result in the company having a debit balance in its imputation credit account at the end of that following tax year. In this circumstance further income tax is intended to be imposed on the net increase in the debit balance of the imputation credit account. 189 BASIC TAX RATE WHEN CHANGING BALANCE DATE (Clause 280) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment corrects a drafting error to ensure that a taxpayer is taxed at the correct basic rate for the tax year that corresponds to the income year in which the taxpayer changes their balance date for income tax purposes. Application date The amendment comes into force on the date of enactment. Key features The proposed amendments are to: • clarify which income the formula is to be applied to; • clarify how the formula applies in a leap year; • align the law with existing practice; • correct and clarify terminology; and • correct an error in the formula. Background In an income year in which a person has approval to change their balance date, the person is required to calculate an average tax rate, based on an annualised amount of business taxable income plus other income, such as wages. That average tax rate is then used, as the basic tax rate, to calculate the income tax liability for the taxpayer's actual income earned in the transitional year. This annualisation is necessary because the marginal tax rates in schedule 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 are set on the basis that the income bands apply to a 12-month period and the person could be over- or under-taxed in the year in which the balance date is changed. These rates are set or confirmed by Parliament each year. The existing law does not clearly identify which income should be included in the determination of annualised income on which the basic rate of tax is calculated. 190 Detailed analysis Proposed amendments to section 39(5), (6) When a person changes their balance date for income tax purposes, the period between balance dates (the transition year) will be either shorter or longer than a standard 12-month income year. If tax were imposed in the transition year on the basis of the basic tax rates in schedule 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, the person would potentially be: • undertaxed if the transition year is shorter than 12 months; or • overtaxed if the transition year is longer than 12 months. The proposed amendments in section 39(5), (6), and (7) clarify the type of income to which the formula in proposed section 39(6) applies and ensure that a person is taxed appropriately in a transition year. In particular, these proposed amendments require a person to determine: • the amount of income from activities (net of allowable deductions, if any) that are unrelated to the changed balance date (for example, wages and salaries); • the annualised amount of income (net of allowable deductions) from those activities for which the Commissioner has agreed the new balance date; and • the basic tax rate on the aggregate of those two amounts. Example 1: Transition year greater than 12 months Change in balance date for partnership from 31 March to 31 May. Approval was given on 14 Dec 2011 for the 2012 tax year. Return of income filed for period 1 April 2011 to 31 May 2012 (426 days). Partnership income share for 14 months to 31 May 2012– $100K (2012 tax year). Interest & dividends for 12 months to 31 March 2012 – $200K (2012 tax year). In the absence of section 39, the income tax liability for 2012 on $300,000 would be $89,920 (overtaxed). Annualised taxable income under section 39(5)(a) and (b) = $200,000 + ( $100,000 ×366÷426 ) =$285,915 Income tax that would be payable on this annualised amount of taxable income for the 2012 tax year is $85,271.95. The basic tax rate under section 39(5) is calculated as follows: $85,271.95 ÷$285,915 = 29.8242% The income tax liability for the 2011–12 tax year is therefore: ( $200,000 +$100,000 ) × 29.8242% = $89,472.69 191 Example 2: Transition year shorter than 12 months Change in balance date for partnership activity from 30 June to 31 May. Approval was given on 14 Dec 2011 for the 2012 tax year. Return of income filed for period 1 July 2011 to 31 May 2012 (336 days). Partnership income for 11 months to 31 May 2012– $100K (2012 tax year). Interest & dividends for 12 months to 31 March 2012 - $200K (2012 tax year). In the absence of section 39, the income tax liability for 2012 on $300,000 would be $89,920. Annualised taxable income under section 39(5)(a) and (b) = $200,000 + ( $100,000 × 366 ÷ 336 ) = $308,928 Income tax that would be payable on this annualised amount of taxable income for the 2012 tax year is $92,866.24 The basic tax rate under section 39(5) is calculated as follows: $92,866.24 ÷$308,928 = 30.0608% The income tax liability for the 2011–12 tax year is therefore: ( $200,000 +$100,000 ) × 30.0608% =$90,182.41 Proposed amendments to section 39(1), (2) The proposed amendments to section 39(1) and (2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ensure that the term “year” is read as a calendar year and not as a 12-mo nth period. 192 TRANSPORT IN VEHICLE OTHER THAN A MOTOR VEHICLE (Clauses 33 and 340) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment corrects an unintended legislative change arising in the rewrite of income tax legislation to ensure that transport of an employee in a heavy goods vehicle is not a fringe benefit. Application date The proposed amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007 applies from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. The proposed amendment to the Income Tax Act 2004 applies from the beginning of the 2005–06 income year. Key features Section CX 19B restores to the Income Tax Act the effect of section CI 1(o)(vi) of the Income Tax Act 1994 by providing the exemption from fringe benefits on transport provided to an employee in a heavy goods vehicle. These vehicles are not designed for the carriage of passengers and typically the transport provided to the passenger employee is in relation to the business of the employer. Some business activities require a person, in addition to the driver, to carry out those activities (for example, the business of furniture removal). Background Under the Income Tax Act 1994, the fringe benefit tax rules (FBT rules) exempted the provision of transport in a heavy goods vehicle from fringe benefit tax (for example, an employee of a removal company is picked up from home on the way to the first removal task of the day). The reason for the exclusion from FBT is that heavy goods vehicles were generally outside the FBT net because they were designed for carrying goods rather than passengers, and the type of transport provided was likely to be work-related. An unintended legislative change has been identified in rewriting the 1994 Act’s FBT exemption into the Income Tax Act 2004. The proposed amendment corrects this oversight. 193 AVAILABLE CAPITAL DISTRIBUTION AMOUNT (Clauses 23(1) and 338) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment corrects a drafting error to clarify that a depreciation loss arising on disposal of a depreciable asset is not taken into account in determining the available capital distribution amount. Application date The proposed amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007 applies from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. The proposed amendment to the Income Tax Act 2004 applies from the beginning of the 2005–06 income year Background The available capital distribution amount is the amount that is able to be distributed tax-free (as a capital distribution) on the liquidation of a company. It represents capital gains less capital losses made by the company prior to the liquidation. The calculation of the available capital distribution amount is made under section CD 44(9). The calculation of capital losses is not intended to include a depreciation loss that is allowed as a deduction. 194 LIVESTOCK AND THE DEFINITION OF “TRADING STOCK” (Clauses 262(107), (108), (116), 343(7) and (9)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment: • corrects an unintended legislative change arising in the rewrite of income tax legislation; • results in consideration derived on disposing of livestock being taxable in the same manner as would have occurred for the same circumstances under corresponding provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994; and • a savings provision is proposed to protect a tax position taken on the basis of the existing law prior to 5 December 2014. Application date The amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 apply generally from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. However, the amendment repealing the cross-reference to section CD 48 applies for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2009 (due to the repeal of section CD 48 from that date). The amendments to the Income Tax Act 2004 apply from the beginning of the 2005– 06 income year. Background The definit io n o f “trading stock” in the Income Tax Act 2004 differs from the corresponding definition in the Income Tax Act 1994. That difference has also been re-enacted into the Income Tax Act 2007. Due to the unintended legislative change in the defined term “trading stock”, there are some circumstances in which livestock would not necessarily be treated as trading stock in the same way as it was under the provisions of the 1994 Act. An example of the effect of this unintended legislative change occurs in section CB 2 of the 2007 Act. This rule is intended to ensure that, if a business is sold, and trading stock is included in the business assets being sold, part of the sale price (normally a capital transaction) is treated as a sale of trading stock (on revenue account). Under the 1994 Act, livestock would have been included in the meaning of trading stock when applying this rule. 195 PRE-AMALGAMATION LOSSES (Clause 124) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment in section IE 3 corrects a drafting error to ensure that an amalgamated company may only carry forward its tax losses from an earlier income year if both of the following requirements are satisfied: • the loss is able to be carried forward to the year under the continuity rules; and • the loss could have been grouped against the net income of each of the other amalgamated companies. Application date The amendment applies from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. Key features Proposed section IE 3(1) sets out that the section applies to an amalgamated company in relation to: • the part of a net loss for the income year in which the amalgamation occurs the company has for the part-year before the date of amalgamation; and • tax losses carried forward by the company satisfy the continuity requirements. Proposed section IE 3(2) is an ordering rule that ensures a carried forward tax loss of an amalgamated company must first be used to subtract from the company’s part-year net income (if any) up to the date of amalgamation (in the year of amalgamation). Any balance remaining may then be made available to the amalgamating companies under the grouping rules. To the extent an amalgamated company’s tax loss for the year of amalgamation comprises pre-amalgamation losses, proposed section IE 3(3) provides that the pre- amalgamation loss may only be used under section IA 3 or section IA 4 after the date of amalgamation if: • the amalgamated company satisfies the continuity requirements for the income year of amalgamation; • the amalgamated company satisfies the commonality requirements with each of the amalgamating companies up to the date of amalgamation; and • to the extent the tax loss is an attributed CFC net loss or a FIF net loss, the amalgamated company and the amalgamating companies must be a wholly owned group in order to satisfy the commonality requirements for these two types of losses. 196 Proposed section IE 3(4) clarifies that the part-years in the amalgamation are treated as separate tax years for applying section IE 3, for example in determining the amount of net income or net loss for a part-year period in the year of amalgamation. Proposed section IE 3(5) clarifies that the general tax rules do not apply in determining whether a loss of an amalgamated company carried forward into the year of amalgamation will be able to continue to be carried forward from the amalgamation. Background The amendment corrects an unintended legislative change in rewriting the amalgamation provisions to ensure the legislation works as intended. 197 LATE ELECTION TO MAKE TAX LOSS AVAILABLE UNDER LOSS GROUPING RULES (Clause 123) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment: • corrects an unintended change in legislation arising fro m the rewriting the Income Tax Act; and • ensures that, after the due date for filing a loss company’s return of income, the Commissioner may allow the company to elect to make its tax loss available to another company in the same group of companies. Application date The proposed amendment applies from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. Background The policy intention is that a company may elect to make its tax loss available to another company in the same group of companies either by: • the last day for filing a return of income; or • a later date allowed by the Commissioner. The rewritten loss rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 do not clearly provide for a company to elect to use the loss grouping rules after the last day for filing the company’s return of income. 198 LIMIT ON TAX REFUND FOR AN IMPUTATION CREDIT COMPANY (Clause 257) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment clarifies the provisions of section RM 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007 for an imputation credit account company that files its income tax and imputation account returns under an extension-of-time arrangement. The proposed amendment ensures that if the current tax year’s return is not yet due, the refund of tax to the imputation credit company is limited to the credit balance of the imputation credit account as at the end of the preceding tax year. Application date The proposed amendment comes into force on the date of enactment. Background In general, imputation credit account companies may receive a refund of tax only if the refund does not result in the company's ICA going into deficit. This policy also extends to transfers of overpaid and non-refundable tax to another company in the same wholly owned group of companies. This general rule empowers the Commissioner to require part-year ICA tax returns to be filed, to determine the balance of the company’s ICA before releasing the refund. However, the general rule is modified for companies that file their tax and ICA returns under an extension-of-time arrangement. The purpose of this modification is for consistency with self-assessment, so that refunds can be processed quickly, with reduced compliance and administration costs. 199 CARRYING BACK FOREIGN INVESTOR TAX CREDITS (Clause 136) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment: • corrects an unintended legislative change arising in rewriting the Income Tax Act; and • clarifies that a company may carry back unused foreign investor tax credits (FITC) from one year to any one or more of four immediately preceding years, to satisfy the company's income tax liability in the earlier year. Application date The proposed amendment applies from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. Background The FITC rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 are designed to ensure that the total New Zealand tax on income derived by a non-resident investor through a corporate structure does not exceed the company tax rate (currently 28%). As part of that design, the FITC rules are also intended to permit a New Zealand company to either: • carry forward unused FITC; or • carry back unused FITC from one year to any one or more of four immediately preceding years, to satisfy the company’s income tax liability in the earlier year. The rewritten provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007 allowing the carry back of FITC have been interpreted as permitting the carry back of these tax credits to be made to only one of those four immediately preceding years, instead of to any one or more of the four preceding years. That outcome is inconsistent with the policy intent. 200 DUPLICATION OF LAND PROVISIONS (Clause 7) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment removes a duplication of a provision relating to the land provisions by repealing section CB 6(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007. The effect of the law remains unchanged. Application date The amendment applies from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. Background Sections CB 6(3) and CB 23B both provide that if part of the land is disposed o f together with other land, the disposal will be taxable under the land sale rules. The Rewrite Advisory Panel determined that only one of the provisions is necessary. 201 NON-RESIDENT WITHHOLDING TAX AND A NON-FILING TAXPAYER (Clauses 233, 247(3) and 262(66)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment improves the clarity of the relationship between sections RB 2, RF 2 and the definition of “non-filing taxpayer” in the Income Tax Act 2007. The proposed amendment ensures the provisions work as intended. The amendment proposes: • correcting the cross-reference in the definition of “non-filing taxpayer” to refer to section RF 2(3) instead of section RB 2; • consequentially repealing section RB 2 as it overlaps with section RF 2; and • eliminating overlap between section RF 2(4) and section RF 2(3). Application date The proposed amendment will come into force on the date of enactment. Background The policy intent is that that: • if a non-resident’s only income derived from New Zealand is non-resident passive income subject to final withholding, the non-resident is a non-filing taxpayer; and • if a non-resident derives other types of income in addition to non-resident passive income subject to final withholding, the non-resident must file a return of income. 202 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX AND SPECIFIED INSURANCE PREMIUMS (Clauses 25, 31 and 32) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment rationalises the fringe benefit tax (FBT) treatment of life insurance premiums to ensure that all life insurance premiums for life insurance policies taken out by an employer on employees’ lives (or a spouse, civil union partner or de facto partner or a joint policy, or on the life of their child) are treated as specified insurance premiums. This simplifies compliance with these rules. Application date The proposed amendment comes into force on the date of enactment. Key features The proposed amendments in section CE 5 and CX 5 are consistent with the proposed treatment for life insurance premiums as specified insurance premiums under the FBT rules. The proposed amendments to section CX 16 clarify that all life insurance premiums for life insurance policies, including group life insurance premiums, taken out by an employer on employees’ lives (or a spouse, civil union partner or de facto partner or a joint policy, or on the life of their child) are treated as specified insurance premiums. Background All life, accident and sickness insurance policies, including group life insurance, taken out by an emplo yer on employees’ lives (or certain family members) in connection wit h their employment (and tax deductible to the emplo yer) are subject to FBT. Under current law, the FBT rules require these insurance premiums to be categorised as either a “specified insurance premium” or as an “unclassified benefit”. For compliance cost reasons, many taxpayers and their advisors have generally been treating as these premiums as specified insurance premiums. This approach to compliance has been adopted because the legislation for these premiums has proved to be confusing due to: • tautologies or redundancies in the wording; and • overlapping rules, which have different thresholds. 203 FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS – BAD DEBT RULES (Clauses 2(20), 41(2) and (3)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment to section DB 31(4C)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2007 corrects a timing mismatch in the bad debt deduction rules by allowing a bad debt deduction in an income year to match income on limited recourse arrangements in the same income year when using section EW 15D (IFRS financial reporting method). Application date The amendment will apply beginning on 20 May 2013, the date the changes made in 2014 came into force. Background As part of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014, changes were made to the bad debt deduction rules to prevent deductions when no economic loss has been suffered. One of the changes deferred bad debt deductions for debts funded by and matched to limited recourse arrangements, to the maturity, disposal or remittance of the limited recourse arrangements. However the deferral of the bad debt deduction in the above circumstances can, depending on how the debt and the associated limited recourse arrangements are accounted for under the financial arrangement rules, create an unintended effect when income arises on the related limited recourse arrangements in a year prior to the base price adjustment on the limited recourse arrangements. This creates a mismatch in that income year, as the income on the limited recourse arrangements is taxable while the related bad debt deduction is deferred. The situation should reverse when the base price adjustments are made on both arrangements but a timing mismatch can arise in the meantime, which has the potential to become permanent in some circumstances. 204 R&D LOSS TAX CREDIT REMEDIALS (Clause 148) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed changes create ordering rules for when multiple loss reinstatement events occur in a single income year. The intention is to simplify the payment of R&D repayment tax and protect the tax base. The proposed changes also clarify that, when a loss of continuity has resulted from equity disposals and transfers, all equit y disposals and transfers from the year a credit was first taken to the current year should be included in calculating R&D repayment tax. Application date The amendments will apply from the 2016–17 income year. Key features An ordering rule is proposed to modify the application of section MX 7(4) by prescribing that if there is a loss of continuity in the business and a liquidator is appointed and/or the company suffers a loss of eligibility, the loss of continuit y does not give rise to R&D repayment tax. This is because the latter events require the balance of the R&D loss tax credit to be repaid in full as R&D repayment tax. Proposed section MX 7(2) ensures that the company will be liable for R&D repayment tax if the sale of intellectual property and a loss of business continuit y occur in the same income year, as neither of these events may create a liability to repay the balance of the R&D loss tax credit in full. Section MX 7(4)(b) will be modified to clarify that, in the event of a loss of business continuity, all equity disposals and transfers from the year a credit was first taken to the current year should be included in calculating R&D repayment tax. Background It is possible that a loss of business continuity and the appointment of a liquidator and/or a loss of eligibility can take place in a single income year, creating multiple R&D repayment tax liabilities. The current legislation does not adequately address how R&D repayment tax should be paid in this sit uation. The current legislation does not require R&D repayment tax arising from the sale, transfer or disposal of intellectual property when a loss of continuity (an effective sale of the company) also occurs. This is a risk to the tax base, as the value of the shares in the company are likely to be very low if the company’s intellectual property has been sold. 205 Currently, section MX 7(4) does not make it sufficiently clear that equity disposals and transfers that occurred in an earlier year than the year the loss of business continuity took place are included in the calculation of R&D repayment tax. 206 EXEMPT INCOME FROM PERSONAL SERVICES – 92-DAY RULE (Clause 30) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment: • aligns the count test in section CW 17 with other count tests in requiring the days of personal presence to be determined within any 12-month period; and • ensures that a non-resident derive exempt income from providing personal services in New Zealand if the presence in New Zealand exceeds 92 days in any 12-month period. Application date The proposed amendment will come into force on the date of enactment. Background A non-resident person may derive exempt income from providing personal services in New Zealand if they meet the requirements of section CW 19. One of those requirements is that the person’s visit must not exceed 92 days in a tax year. As this is a tax year-based rule, taxpayers can arrange for their visit to straddle the 31 March and remain in NZ for up to 182 days. Basing the count test on a period of time in a tax year is inconsistent with the count test used in the definition of “New Zealand resident”. The count test in that definition is based on personal presence in New Zealand of 183 days during any 12-month period. The proposed amendment is to ensure that a visit to New Zealand cannot straddle the 31 st March to permit the non-resident to provide personal services in New Zealand for more than 92 days. 207 TAX STATUS OF EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS AUTHORITY MEMBERS (Clause 237) Summary of proposed amendments Amendments are being made to the Income Tax Act 2007 to ensure that the salaries and allowances of Emplo yment Relat ions Authorit y (ERA) members are subject to PAYE. Currently, section RD 5(5) provides for the salaries of “judicial officers” to be subject to PAYE, but there is uncertainty around the scope of that term due to the lack of a legislative definition. Application date The amendments will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features Amendments are being made to section RD 5(5) of the Income Tax Act to ensure that: • Emplo yment Relations Authorit y members will have their salary and allowances subject to PAYE. • The term “judicial officer” will be defined to mean those officers listed in section 12B of the Remuneration Authority Act, namely judges of courts, and coroners. Background PAYE generally applies to individuals who meet the common law definition of “employee” and receive salary and wages. Section RD 5(5) of the Income Tax Act 2007 expands the meaning of “salary and wages” to include “salary and principal allowances made to a judicial officer” that are “made under a determination of the Remuneration Authority”. Section RD 5(5) was originally enacted to codify existing practice at the time, which was that judges’ salaries were subject to PAYE. The Income Tax Act does not provide a legislative definition for “judicial officer”, which has resulted in some uncertainty about whether ERA members come under the definition and are subject to PAYE. The Commissioner’s view is that “judicial officer” does not include ERA members. As a result, the law does not allow ERA members to have tax on their salaries deducted through PAYE. An amendment is therefore necessary to ensure that ERA member salaries are subject to PAYE. 208 Withholding tax at source is desirable for the efficient administration of tax, and PAYE is the appropriate method for taxing the salaries of ERA members. The members are paid regular salaries and work full-time. Applying the M code under the PAYE rules deducts the correct amount of tax under New Zealand’s progressive tax rate scale. 209 MISCELLANEOUS TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS Summary of proposed amendments The following amendments are intended to clarify or correct minor errors in the legislation, to ensure the rules work as intended. Income statements for IR 56 taxpayers (Clause 291) The Taxation (Annual Rates, GST, Trans-Tasman Imputation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003 removed the requirement for most IR 56 taxpayers to file end- of-year income tax returns. Instead, the Commissioner was required to issue an income statement to IR 56 taxpayers. The drafting of section 80D(1)(c)(iii) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 did not, however, make it clear that it was only intended to apply to IR 56 taxpayers, leaving open the possibility that income statements could be required to be issued to many other taxpayers, including those who would not otherwise have to file an income tax return. An amendment in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Act 2016 clarified the application of the relevant provision. However, an amendment in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Returns Filing, and Remedial Matters) Act 2012, which applied from 1 April 2016, replaced section 80D(1)(c)(iii) with a revised provision that did not include the clarification. The proposed amendment in this bill reintroduces the clarification, and comes into force on 1 April 2016. New start grants (Clause 122(3) and (4)) The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Act 2016 repealed five references to “new start grants” as they are no longer part of the suite of responses the Government uses for primary sector adverse events. The proposed amendment repeals the one remaining reference, and comes into force on the date of enactment. 210 Rewrite remedials 211 212 SUMMARY OF PROPOSED AMENDMENTS The following amendments reflect minor technical maintenance items arising from both the rewrite of Income Tax legislation and subsequent changes. Unless otherwise stated in the following table, all the amendments are to the Income Tax Act 2007 (2007 Act).

Background There are currently three methods for calculating provisional tax: the standard uplift, estimate and GST ratio methods. The proposed AIM is not replacing these methods; it introduces a fourth method. Most businesses meet their income tax liability by paying provisional tax in three instalments throughout the year. Use-of-money interest (UOMI) is charged as if income was earned evenly over an income year, which is not realistic for many taxpayers. Feedback to Inland Revenue has focused on the inflexibility of provisional tax and its lack of integration with the natural rhythms of running a business. The current dates for payment are independent of when income is earned, which does not work well for businesses with fluctuating incomes and tight budgets. New businesses benefit from not having to pay provisional tax in their first year of business but often struggle with making payments in their second year. This proposed new measure was announced by the Government in Budget 2016 as part of a package focused on tax reform for small businesses. The package is designed to provide certainty and reduce compliance costs. A growing number of small businesses are using accounting software. The introduction of AIM will offer software providers an incentive to extend the capability of their products to include the consideration of tax-related issues during the year rather than waiting for a year-end review. Using upgraded software that includes income tax information would enable businesses to consider their tax adjustments throughout the year and seek input from their tax advisor at any time, rather than just at year-end. This would provide businesses with better visibility of their tax liability during the year. New businesses would be able to start paying tax when they start making a profit, educating them about, and supporting them to meet, their tax obligations in their first two years in business. There would be no tax surprise for them in their second year of business. 3 Proposed approach Inland Revenue has previously worked with software providers to enable GST returns to be filed from accounting software. This has simplified meeting tax obligations and reduced the amount of time that businesses spend on compliance. AIM is another step in integrating tax into business processes. Inland Revenue would continue to work with tax agents to ensure that their involvement in the reform of provisional tax, and in particular, the proposed AIM approach, continues. Their involvement in developing any proposed changes would ensure a practical perspective on the design of AIM and its use in business. It is expected that it will take time for taxpayers to feel confident in using a new proposed provisional tax method. It is expected that the accuracy of payments made will gradually improve as corrections made at year-end are captured in software and flow through to future years, reducing the error rate. What using AIM will mean for businesses Under the proposed changes, provisional tax would be integrated into business processes and payment amounts would be based on current year tax-adjusted income. Businesses using AIM would have more certainty they are paying the right amount of tax as it will be paid as income is earned. This would increase businesses’ confidence in their financial position at any particular time. For those who keep their accounting packages up to date, calculating a business’s provisional tax liability during the year would not require any significant additional work for businesses and their advisors. For those who currently leave most of their tax calculation until year-end, AIM would require more consideration of adjustments during the year; this should, however, be offset by a reduced year-end workload. The calculat ion o f inco me tax would become integrated into the general operation of business accounts. An AIM-capable software system must have a way of flagging entries or sending communication to a third party (usually the tax agent). This is not a compulsory review point but rather ensures there is always a way for the tax agent to stay involved in the process. The extent of the relationship between the taxpayer and their tax agent is at their discretion. 4 The following graphic shows how the AIM proposal would work for a business. 5 The following examples illustrate how the proposed AIM would apply. Example 1 Murphy Cliffe has recently finished a painting apprenticeship and intends to set up his own house painting business. He has no previous business knowledge and his parents suggest he meet with their accountant to get some advice. The accountant suggests Murphy sets up a company, starts using a basic accounting software package and elects into paying provisional tax using the AIM approach to help him budget in his first year of business. Murphy’s company has a March balance date and will pay GST and provisional tax using the AIM approach on a two-monthly basis. Murphy does not make any profit in the first few months due to his set-up costs, but starts to make a profit towards the end of the year. He will pay provisional tax as follows: GST & provisional tax payment dates 28-Jun 2018 28-Aug 2018 28-Oct 2018 15-Jan 2019 28-Feb 2019 7-May 2019 Total prov tax Terminal tax due Income earned during current year Nil Nil Nil 20,000 30,000 50,000 28,000 Implied tax on taxable income Nil Nil Nil 5,600 8,400 14,000 328,000 Nil AIM will help Murphy budget for tax correctly in his first year of operation as he pays tax as he earns income. He decides to wait before he buys a new vehicle for his business. If Murphy had decided against using AIM, he would have paid no provisional tax in his first year of operation and had his business continued into its second year, his tax payment schedule for his first and second year 1 would be as follows: GST & provisional tax payment dates 28-Aug 2018 15-Jan 2019 7-May 2019 Total prov tax Prov tax 1 28-Aug 2019 Prov tax 2 15-Jan 2020 Prior year terminal tax due April 2020 Prov tax 3 7-May 2020 First year of business no provisional tax due in first year of business Tax due in second year of business Nil Nil Nil Nil 9,800 9,800 28,000 9,800 Unless Murphy had budgeted carefully he may not have set the right amount aside for his terminal tax due in the second year in one lump sum. He instead bought a new vehicle for his business. In his second year of operation his terminal tax from his first year of $28,000 falls due and he also has to pay his provisional tax payments for his second year of $9,800 each. If Murphy had not set the appropriate amount aside in his first year of business he may struggle to meet this payment schedule and his business could fail. . 1 Using the standard uplift method of 105% of his prior year residual income tax, which assumes his tax liability grows from $33,000 to $34,650. 6 Example 2 Benson Electrical Ltd is considering the use of AIM in their existing business. They currently use accounting software, pay GST every two months, and have a March balance date. Their accountant talks to them about using AIM due to the unpredictable nature of the contracts they are being awarded. The inability to plan in the past has resulted in exposure to use-of-money interest. They generally have a slow start to the financial year but business picks up in the latter half. Their business is steadily growing and their residual income tax is $180,000 in 2017 and $220,000 in 2018. They ask their accountant to show them what their provisional tax liability would look like under different methods for the 2019 year and how exposure to use-of-money interest would differ. In this scenario, their possible use-of-money interest 2 costs range between nil and $6,594. Provisional tax payment dates 28-Jun 28-Aug 28-Oct 15-Jan 28-Feb 7-May Total prov tax Income earned during current year 108,000 Nil 178,000 250,000 178,000 143,000 Implied tax on taxable income 30,240 Nil 49,840 70,000 49,840 40,040 239,960 Provisional tax methods and due dates for payment 28-Jun 28-Aug 28-Oct 15-Jan 28-Feb 7-May Total prov tax Terminal tax due UOMI incurred AIM 30,240 0 49,840 70,000 49,840 40,040 239,960 0 0 Uplift 105% 77,000 77,000 77,000 231,000 8,960 682 Uplift 110% 66,000 66,000 66,000 198,000 41,960 3,194 Estimate 40,000 60,000 90,000 190,000 49,960 6,594 Uplift/Estimate switch 63,000 63,000 130,000 256,000 -16,040 224 2 Calculation is based on UOMI rates of 8.27% and 1.62%. It also takes into account the new provisional tax rules of no use-of-money interest for residual income tax less than $60,000 (extension of safe harbour rules), first two provisional tax instalments if using uplift and a taxpayer choosing to switch between methods will be subject to use-of-money interest from the first instalment date. 7 Proposed approach To date, Inland Revenue has worked with representatives of the software and accounting industry in developing AIM to test concepts and identify opportunities. Their role was to help officials understand software capabilities and use by small businesses and identify opportunities for reducing businesses’ compliance costs. Statistical and market data was provided by software providers to help Inland Revenue prepare its advice to Government. (Inland Revenue was not provided with access to the data or business systems of individual businesses only summarised and anonymous information was used in the development of this policy.) Since April 2016, there has been extensive consultation on the technical details of the AIM proposals through written submissions, an online forum and workshops with small business owners, accountants and interested software providers. In the upcoming year, it is proposed Inland Revenue would continue to work with interested software providers on incorporating AIM into their products. Inland Revenue will continue to work with members of the accounting profession to provide a practical perspective on the design of AIM and its proposed use in business. It is proposed that Inland Revenue drafts a technical Determination in relation to the changes proposed in the bill. This reflects the fact that AIM is first and foremost a tax collection method. Its provisional tax natures implies it is not a year-to-date method requiring exact tax liabilities to be calculated on a regular basis, but it does need to ensure reasonably accurate amounts of tax are collected during the year. For this reason, it is proposed that AIM requires a series of adjustments to calculate the amounts of provisional tax due. The proposed Determination would also outline what technical adjustments must be made within the software. Having these technical matters contained in a Determination that all software providers must adhere to, would ensure commonality of treatment across different software products. A working group comprising representatives from the accounting and software professions, small business representatives and officials would develop these proposed Determinations. This will ensure the adjustments and information requirements are practical, relevant and as simple as possible, and that the software remains intuitive and effective to use. The proposed technical Determination is discussed in more detail later. 8 AIM PROVIDERS APPROVAL AND REVOCATION (Clauses 40 and 44) Summary of proposed amendments The bill proposes a process of self-certification through statutory declaration before a software provider can offer a product that is deemed AIM-capable. Application date The proposed amendments will apply for the 2018–19 and later income years. Key features Proposed new section 15U of the Tax Administration Act 1994 states that AIM providers should apply to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue for approval for their AIM-capable accounting systems. The term approved “AIM provider” is proposed as a new defined term in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The Commissioner will approve the AIM provider, taking into consideration the integrity of the tax system, and the AIM provider will supply the Commissioner with a statutory declaration outlining the product, a commitment to regular updating and any other information the Commissioner has set out as required. Providers can apply with a product that would either deliver AIM to businesses with gross income below $5 million a year or for a defined class of taxpayers who have gross income over $5 million a year. New sections 15V and 15W of the Tax Administration Act 1994 state the Commissioner may revoke the above approval, after consultation with the AIM provider. It is proposed this would happen when the statutory declaration is held to be untrue and revoking the approval would positively affect the integrity of the tax system. The revocation would not take effect until the following tax year. An AIM provider may also notify the Commissioner of its choice to revoke. This would take effect in the following tax year and must be immediately communicated to all end- users of the AIM provider’s products. New section 15X of the Tax Administration Act 1994 states the Commissioner may publish a notice regarding approvals or revocation if she chooses. Detailed analysis Self-certification is considered to be the most effective method of approving AIM providers. There are likely to be a large number of parties interested in providing AIM capacity, and consideration has been given to whether Inland Revenue would audit each software provider that applied. Possible issues with resourcing constraints and the negative business implications of delays in receiving Inland Revenue approval have resulted in self-certification being a more effective choice. It also reflects a long-term view of how Inland Revenue will engage and work with third parties in the future. 9 New section 15U of the Tax Administration Act 1994 states that AIM providers would need to apply to the Commissioner for approval for their AIM-capable accounting systems. The Commissioner would approve the AIM provider with consideration to the integrity of the tax system, and the AIM provider themselves. Once the Commissioner was satisfied on these grounds, the AIM provider must supply the Commissioner with a written statutory declaration. The statutory declaration would include an outline of the product itself, a commitment to keeping it updated, and any other information the Commissioner sets out as required. This information would be likely to relate to the technical aspects of AIM both in terms of tax policy and software requirements. The details of the declaration would be clearly outlined in the Technical Determination proposed in clause 46 (discussed later) and proposed to be released by Inland Revenue in early 2017. A statutory declaration is a legal document which allows a person to declare something to be true for the purposes of satisfying a legal requirement. In this way statutory declarations are similar to affidavits. It is a crime under the Crimes Act 1961 (punishable by a term of imprisonment not exceeding three years) for a person to make a statutory declaration that is misleading or false. The specific procedure for making statutory declarations, coupled with the fact that false declarations can lead to imprisonment, give statutory declarations a special status. New sections 15V and 15W of the Tax Administration Act 1994 state that the Commissioner may revoke an approval. It is proposed this would happen when the statutory declaration is held to be untrue and revocation would protect the integrity of the tax system. The Commissioner would consult with a software provider before a revocation took effect, to give both parties a chance to work through any concerns and, where possible, remedy them. A revocation could be reversed by the Commissioner before it takes effect if the circumstances that gave rise to the revocation were remedied. This might occur when a provider accidently fails in one of its obligations (if, for example, it missed a minor tax update). The revocation would not take effect until the following tax year, to allow taxpayers using the software to finish the income year, and not disadvantage them in any way. If an AIM provider no longer wished to provide AIM capability through their software, they must notify the Commissioner. Revocation would take effect in the following tax year and must be immediately communicated to all users of the AIM provider’s products. If a software provider had to cease business suddenly, the Commissioner would work with the affected taxpayers to ensure the integrity of the tax system was maintained. The bill proposes that the Commissioner may publish a notice regarding approvals or revocation. 10 AIM-CAPABLE ACCOUNTING SYSTEM (Clauses 32, 34 and 46) Summary of proposed amendments A software system that is designed to offer AIM to taxpayers must meet the proposed definit ion of an AIM-capable accounting system introduced in this bill in order to gain approval from the Commissioner to be used to calculate provisional tax payments using the AIM method. Application date The proposed amendments will apply for the 2018–19 and later income years. Key features Proposed new section RC 7B of the Income Tax Act 2007 explains the AIM method and defines what an AIM-capable accounting system must be in order to gain the Commissioner’s approval. To meet the definition and be approved as an AIM- capable accounting system, the core software accounting package must have the ability to: • generate and keep comprehensive financial accounts, including accounting income and expenditure, ledger accounts, trial balances, bank account reconciliations, and journals, on an on-demand basis, in accordance with good accounting and tax practices; • calculate tax liabilities using tax adjustments in accordance with the Technical Determination as proposed in clause 46; • for tax adjustments not included in the Determinations, ensure they work towards reasonably accurate assessments of tax liabilities; • recalculate all financial accounts and liabilities retrospectively and produce reports as required by the Commissioner; and • communicate electronically with Inland Revenue and provide the right level of help assistance to its users. The amount calculated by the AIM-capable accounting system is the amount due to Inland Revenue on each instalment date as proposed in clause 34 in section RC 10B of the Income Tax Act 2007. 11 Detailed analysis Only comprehensive software accounting packages would be able to offer AIM to ensure that taxpayers can use a package that is fit for purpose. Packages must work in accordance with good accounting and tax practice to ensure that reliable financial statements are produced. This implies routine examination of processes and calculations to ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of practices are improved over time. This definition is not limited to cloud software and does include software packages that are generally desktop-based but can access the internet or prepare reports that can be sent to a third party for review (hybrid products). A desktop must also be kept up to date and the version of the software will be provided to Inland Revenue at the time of payment to ensure this is the case. The only software that is considered to be excluded fro m this definit io n is a ho me-prepared Excel spreadsheet. This is due to there being no controls or commonality over its preparation and treatment of tax adjustments. The Determinations proposed in section 91 AAX of the Tax Administration Act 1994 set out the requirements for which expense and income items need to be adjusted for tax purposes. Therefore any accounting software system must be able to make these adjustments as required by the Co mmissioner. This will ensure that material adjustments are consistently treated by all software packages. For any tax adjustments not defined in the proposed Determinations, the accounting software must provide reasonably accurate assessments of tax liabilities. The software must be able to recalculate all financial accounts and liabilities retrospectively and produce reports as required by the Commissioner. This is to ensure that when an error is discovered – for example, a late invoice, the invoice can be entered into the system and the cumulative impact of that correction will flow through. Past periods will not need to be re-filed following the discovery of an error. The software must also be able to communicate electronically with Inland Revenue and provide the right level of assistance to its users. It is expected that taxpayers will elect to use AIM through the software itself and that the Statement of Activity will be provided to Inland Revenue electronically. Inland Revenue understands that accounting software packages do not require a high level of internet capability to function, so those in remote areas with limited bandwidth can still use it successfully. As an exception, in the event of a software failure or internet failure, the Commissioner will accept a paper copy of the return. Section RC 10B provides that the amount calculated by the AIM-capable accounting system is the amount due to Inland Revenue on each instalment date. This is the amount the provisional taxpayer must pay to Inland Revenue. 12 AIM APPROACH ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA (Clauses 31, 32, 40 and 45) Summary of proposed amendments The bill proposes the criteria that must be met before a taxpayer can use the AIM approach to calculate their provisional tax, and proposes that a taxpayer can be removed from AIM in particular circumstances. Application date The proposed amendments will apply for the 2018–19 and later income years. Key features New subsection RC 5(5B) of the Income Tax Act 2007 introduces the AIM provisio nal tax method. It states that when a taxpayer has elected to use AIM, and is currently using an AIM-capable accounting system as defined in new section 7B (2) in the Income Tax Act 2007, they may use AIM, provided they meet the right annual gross income levels, which are in three income groups. Section RC 5(5B)(c) proposes that those with a gross income of $5 million and below can use AIM. Proposed section 45D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 proposes that if a business has grown past this threshold and has been using AIM successfully, it can apply to the Commissioner to continue using AIM as a provisional tax method, assuming there is minimal fiscal risk to allowing this approval. Proposed new section 45C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that a business with earnings over $5 million can use the AIM approach, provided it is a member of a class of taxpayers using software that has been approved for large AIM businesses. These businesses are defined as those using an approved Large Business AIM-Capable system. This is a proposed new defined term in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. In certain circumstances taxpayers will be excluded from using AIM. Section RC 5(5B)(d) of the Income Tax Act 2007 proposes that if a taxpayer has been liable in one of the last four years for a shortfall penalty, penalties in relation to its use of AIM, or members of a class of taxpayers mentioned in the Determination issued by the Commissioner under proposed section 91AAY of the Tax Administration Act 1994, they will be excluded from using AIM. 13 This section also proposes that taxpayers will be removed from AIM if their use of AIM has meant they have consistently and systematically inaccurately assessed their tax liabilities. An addition to this, if a taxpayer fails to provide Inland Revenue with the required information on two instalment dates they will be remo ved fro m AIM during the year as well. When a taxpayer is removed from AIM under section RC 5 (5B)(d) of the Income Tax Act 2007, proposed section RC 5(5C) states upon removal from AIM, the taxpayer will be required to use the estimate method and be treated as having used that method all year. Detailed analysis Eligibility Section RC 5(5B) of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that before a taxpayer can use the AIM approach to calculate their provisional tax they must: • elect to use it before their first payment date; • use an AIM-capable accounting package that is up to date; • have gross income below $5 million or have approval from the Commissioner as a previous user of AIM if their income is over $5 million; or • be a member of the class of taxpayers with income over $5 million using a software package the Commissioner has approved for AIM. The majority of likely AIM users will be small-medium businesses as the tax adjustments required to accounting profit to calculate their taxable income are relatively small and simple. These smaller businesses also use standard accounting software packages purchased from software providers and are not using bespoke systems. A provisional taxpayer does not have to be GST-registered to use AIM. Individuals, sole traders and companies are all eligible to use AIM, and if they chose to do so, must pay on a two-monthly basis. While the initial focus is on small-medium businesses, there is also scope for larger classes of taxpayers to use AIM should a provider develop software that meets AIM requirements. Proposed new section 45C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will enable AIM to be a provisional tax method available to larger businesses in the event that a software provider developed a package for a specific class of taxpayers who would not ordinarily use off-the-shelf software. They can apply under this proposed section to the Commissioner for approval of their systems to be used for a defined group of taxpayers. The Commissioner would have regard to the fiscal risks of allowing this class of taxpayers to use AIM. 14 Example Winetrack Ltd creates accounting software specifically designed for large vineyards. It assists wineries with their management and reporting, dealing with specific issues like calculating an accurate real-time cost of goods sold using software that is designed specifically for wine-making processes. As vineyards often have both seasonal income streams and unpredictability caused by weather and overseas exporting issues, many would benefit from using the AIM provisional tax method. Winetrack approaches Inland Revenue to discuss and engage with Inland Revenue regarding their software and processes around major tax adjustments. Inland Revenue would consider the rigour of the software and whether or not taxpayers using Winetrack and AIM can make provisional tax payments that result in reasonably accurate assessments. Winetrack and Inland Revenue would work together to identify whether Winetrack would need to develop its software to deliver AIM capability. These requirements would be clearly stated in a Determination issued by Inland Revenue. Following approval from Inland Revenue, Winetrack would offer AIM services to its subscribers and be subject to the same obligations as other AIM providers. Exclusions In certain circumstances taxpayers would be excluded from using AIM. Section RC 5(5B) of the Income Tax Act 2007 proposes this would happen if the taxpayer: • has been liable in one of the last four years for shortfall penalties in relation to its use of AIM; • is a member of a class of taxpayers excluded in the Determination issued by the Commissioner under section 91AAX of the Tax Administration Act 1994; • has consistently and systematically used AIM to inaccurately assess its tax liabilities; and • has failed to provide Inland Revenue with the required information on two instalment dates (Statement of Activity). If a taxpayer is removed from AIM, it is proposed in section RC 5C that they be placed into the estimate method and be treated as having used that method all year and will have use-of-money interest applied. The Statement of Activity is important because it demonstrates the robustness of the accounting system behind the amount paid as provisional tax. If this information is not provided to Inland Revenue, there would be no evidence that a comprehensive accounting system is being used by the business to calculate its accounting income results. As the Statement of Act ivit y reports would be cumulative, if one is missed it could be supplied in the following period. If a payment is missed, a taxpayer would not be immediately removed from AIM. The existing interest and penalties rules would apply to the underpaid amount. 15 DETERMINATIONS (Clause 46) Summary of proposed amendments The bill proposes that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has the power to issue Determinations with reference to AIM. Application date The proposed amendments will apply for the 2018–19 and later income years. Key features It is proposed to issue Determinations in two circumstances. A proposed amendment to section 91AAX of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that the Commissioner will issue a technical Determination that details the tax adjustments required for accounting income and expenditure under the AIM approach, and Inland Revenue’s information requirements regarding AIM. In making these Determinations the Commissioner would take into account the accuracy resulting from these adjustments, the compliance costs incurred by taxpayers and the resources available to AIM providers. The Determination must also set out the tax years for which the Determination will apply, and the requirement for the Commissioner to give at least 120 days notice for implementation to AIM providers and publish the Determination within 30 days of making it. Section 91AAY of the Tax Administration Act 1994 proposes that the Commissioner also has power to issue an exclusion Determination to exclude a class of taxpayers from using AIM in circumstances when an accurate assessment of tax liabilities could not be made. Detailed analysis Technical Determination AIM is a tax collection method. While it is not a year-to-date method that requires exact tax liabilities calculated on a regular basis, it does need to ensure that reasonably accurate amounts of tax are collected during the year. For this reason, AIM will require a series of adjustments to calculate the amounts of provisional tax due. Software providers delivering AIM will build these adjustments into their systems. To ensure commonality across taxpayers and systems, it is proposed this Determination contains the agreed treatment for the core adjustments required to reach the desired level of accuracy within AIM. Adjustments not defined by the Determination will be designed by software providers themselves, with the requirement they always calculate tax liabilities using tax adjustments that result in 16 reasonably accurate assessments of tax liabilities for taxpayers. These may include accruals or estimates for other matters that would typically be adjusted for in year-end review processes. Proposed approach The process of developing the Determination should be open and transparent. Therefore this Determination would be developed during 2016 by an Inland Revenue-led working group comprising interested public and private sector parties, including representatives from the software and accounting professions. This working group would identify the core tax adjustments that would be compulsory in the Determination and identify ways of accounting for these on an interim year basis. It would ensure that the core adjustments are kept to a minimum and their calculation is simple and practical for use, avoiding increasing compliance costs while working towards a goal of increased accuracy during the year. The adjustments are to work towards the calculation of reasonably accurate assessments of tax liabilities for the taxpayer. It would consider what current good accounting practice for these adjustments is and, where possible, keep close to this treatment. This working group would report, on a regular basis, to a governance group of representatives from the business and accounting sectors. The group would provide oversight and a practical perspective on the design of AIM and its use in business. It is proposed that this information be contained in a Determination rather than in this bill as it will be easier to update and account for future technology advancements, tax changes and allow further time for wider consultation and development. It is expected that there will be an early indication of what the core adjustments will be and the proposed Determination would be completed in time for AIM providers to use for the design of their systems in 2017. The Determination would not be complex in nature and would be designed for use by software providers to use when developing their software. Consultation to date has outlined some adjustments that may be suitable for the Determination. Current thinking on possible treatment is outlined below. Tax depreciation It has been suggested that current software models would be enhanced to enable depreciation schedules to be calculated throughout the year in the taxpayers version of software (previously depreciation calculations were only included in tax agent version). A taxpayer could then claim depreciation to date. Most small businesses use Inland Revenue depreciation rates and as such no separate adjustment would be required. Trading stock Where a company has material movements in trading stock values, it is likely that it currently uses a perpetual inventory system to keep up to date figures for its accounting records, and these would suffice for AIM. Current thinking is that AIM would not require additional stocktakes for those using periodic inventory systems as they may be able to use their closing figure from the prior year. 17 Temporary timing differences The intent of AIM is proposed to be on “reasonable accurateness” during the year. There will be, however, situations when timing differences are not captured by the accounting software system. Where this occurs, it has been suggested that Inland Revenue be tolerant where an amount is likely to balance out in the next period, and it may not need to be accrued. However, if it relates to longer than two provisional tax periods it may be accrued in the normal manner. Provisions Provisions have the ability to decrease accounting income during the year and then be reversed at year end, increasing the accounting income just prior to the tax return is filed. Current thinking is that while provisions are not overly common in the small business market, where they have been accounted for, they might be reversed out for AIM purposes. Financial arrangements/foreign exchange For taxpayers with an emphasis on exporting, foreign exchanges gains or losses and financial arrangements may be material for review for tax purposes. Good accounting practice and principles will be considered for these adjustments. Current Inland Revenue thinking is that keeping as close to accounting treatment and cashflow impacts as possible is important for taxpayers. Shareholder salary accruals These may be included in the Determination as an anti-avoidance measure. All shareholder salaries will be treated as non-deductible unless they have been paid out in the period the instalment relates to. Any overpaid provisional tax that relates to shareholder salary accruals can be transferred to the shareholder to meet their corresponding provisional tax liability. User defined entry There may be times when the accounting software does not give a fair reflection of likely taxable income. Initial thinking is that in this instance, a taxpayer may need to override the system and manually insert a new figure that will bring the system closer to a reasonably accurate figure. Current thinking is that these events will be identified on the Statement of Activity, and consultation will consider what circumstances these might occur in and what appropriate checks and balances will be needed. In making these Determinations section 91AAX of the Tax Administration Act 1994 proposes the Commissioner must have regard to three areas: the accuracy resulting from these adjustments, the compliance costs incurred by taxpayers in making these adjustments and the resources available to the AIM software providers. It is important these factors are kept in balance to ensure a reduction in compliance costs for taxpayers. It is important that AIM itself is based on a “click, review, send” methodology. It is not intended to result in a series of mini tax returns throughout the year which would increase compliance costs for taxpayers. 18 Any tax adjustments the Commissioner considers necessary would be required to be built into software, which places costs upon the AIM software providers. When developing this, the Commissioner would consider the resources available to AIM providers to ensure that the drive for increased accuracy does push them past the point of financial viability. Exclusion Determination Proposed section 91AAY of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides the Commissioner with power to issue a Determination to exclude a class of taxpayers from using AIM in circumstances when an accurate assessment of tax liabilities could not be made. This would occur when analysis shows that using the AIM approach is resulting in systematically inaccurate results for the particular class of taxpayers due to their use of accounting software – that is, specific income and expenses that cannot be calculated correctly by general software and more bespoke software is required. 19 PAYMENT DATES (Clauses 29, 30, 33, 35, 41 and 49) Summary of proposed amendments The bill proposes new payment dates be created that support the AIM method. Application date The proposed amendments will apply for the 2018–19 and later income years. Key features Proposed section RC 9 (4B) of the Income Tax Act 2007 will require a taxpayer using AIM to make provisional tax payments more often, in line with GST filing dates. These payments will be 12 times a year for those registered for monthly GST and 6 times a year for those who have 6- or 2-monthly GST periods or those who are not registered for GST. Background AIM works with usual business processes. Research into the use of accounting software shows that peak usage for mid-year updating of accounts is in line with GST payment dates. These act as a driver to encourage businesses to keep their records up to date. For this reason, it is proposed to link AIM payment dates with GST dates. This will reduce compliance and assist with matching tax payments to cashflow. It is expected that paying smaller amounts more often will assist with matching tax payments to the cashflow of taxpayers. If a taxpayer has no accounting profit for a period, then no AIM provisional tax payment is required. Inland Revenue would still require the Statement of Activity to be provided, via the software, however, to show the current accounting income status of the company. This would show it had no profit and therefore required no payment to be made. 20 REFUNDS (Clauses 36 and 52) Summary of proposed amendments The bill proposes that the Commissioner must refund overpaid amounts of provisional tax paid through AIM to the taxpayer upon their request before year-end. Application date The proposed amendments will apply for the 2018–19 and later income years. Key features Section RM 6B of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that upon receiving the required information from the taxpayer, the Commissioner can refund amounts of overpaid AIM provisional tax throughout the income year where the AIM payments to date are greater than the AIM calculation of tax liability year-to-date. An AIM taxpayer can only request a refund of actual provisional tax paid in the current year. Proposed section 120VB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that no use-of- money interest is payable by the Commissioner on overpaid AIM provisional tax. Background As overpaid provisional tax represents working capital of a business held by Inland Revenue, it is important this is returned to the taxpayer in a timely manner. This is one of the major benefits to taxpayers using AIM. An imputation credit account return will not be required to access a refund mid-year. A taxpayer would need to contact Inland Revenue in the prescribed manner to demonstrate overpaid provisional tax – likely to be through the software itself. It is proposed that an overpayment of AIM provisional tax can be refunded directly to the taxpayer, be transferred across to another tax type or remain as overpaid provisional tax to be offset against a future liability. The Commissioner cannot refuse to refund amounts owing under AIM due to an outstanding tax liability in another area such as PAYE or GST. 21 PROVIDING DATA TO INLAND REVENUE – THE STATEMENT OF ACTIVITY (Clause 45) Summary of proposed amendments The bill proposes that AIM taxpayers provide Inland Revenue with an agreed set of information on or before each instalment date (the Statement of Activity), and that AIM providers provide Inland Revenue with an agreed set of aggregated data within six months of the end of the tax year. This information will not include taxpayer- specific information. Application date The proposed amendments will apply for the 2018–19 and later income years. Key features Proposed new section 45 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will require taxpayers using the AIM approach to provide information to the Commissioner on or before each AIM instalment date. Section 45B requires approved AIM providers to also provide information to Inland Revenue when and if requested in relation to their AIM capable software system products. This does not include any taxpayer-specific information. Detailed analysis It is proposed data be provided to Inland Revenue in two types: from the AIM taxpayer and the AIM providers. Taxpayer-specific information Proposed section 45 sets out the information it is proposed Inland Revenue receives on each instalment date from the taxpayer. An AIM-capable accounting system will have the ability to map the ledger accounts of the company into an agreed Statement of Act ivit y form. Some accounting software already maps business accounts into the current IR10 Summary of Financial Statements so this process is familiar to AIM providers. The Statement of Activity would be automatically mapped into an agreed form and be submitted to Inland Revenue by the software itself. Inland Revenue would not have access to the software system at all and would only receive the agreed aggregated data sent by the system. 22 The Statement of Activity is important as it demonstrates the robustness of the accounting system behind the amount paid as provisional tax. If this is not provided, Inland Revenue would have no evidence that a comprehensive accounting system is being used by the business to calculate its accounting income results. The Statement of Activity data is a summary of what is in the accounting software at that date. It is not intended to be seen as a mini tax return; rather it is a simple snapshot of the data held within the accounting software at the time the payment was calculated. It would not need to be re-fil ed should an error be retrospectively discovered. What informat ion is proposed to be sent to Inland Revenue will be confirmed by the working group made up of representatives from public and private (accounting and software) sectors. The information received will enable the Commissioner to discharge her duties through reviewing the information for key ratio data, industry outliers, targeted services, further policy design, statistical purposes and determining audit selection criteria. Regular provision of this information to Inland Revenue on a cumulative basis throughout the year is intended to simplify year-end processes. Aggregated provider information Proposed section 45B provides that approved AIM providers must also provide information to Inland Revenue when and if requested in relation to their AIM-capable software products. This does not include any taxpayer-specific information. It is only for aggregated statistical data to assist Inland Revenue with further policy development and improvement of the AIM approach itself. It is likely this would include information on the use of the software itself, the timing of interactions in the software and any “pain” points the software is encountering to assist with further policy development and improvements in accuracy. 23 INTEREST AND PENALTIES (Clauses 31, 43, 45, 47, 48, 50, 52 and 54) Summary of proposed amendments The amendments outline the circumstances when a taxpayer using AIM would be liable for use-of-money (UOMI) interest and shortfall penalties. Application date The proposed amendments will apply for the 2018–19 and later income years. Key features Proposed new section 120 KBC of the Tax Administration Act provides that when a taxpayer makes the payments as calculated by their AIM-capable software, they will not have any UOMI exposure should the year-end residual income tax result in a different tax liability. If a taxpayer pays less than what the AIM-capable software calculates, then UOMI will be imposed between the time of underpayment and terminal tax date. This also requires that the taxpayer has not engaged in a provisional tax interest avoidance arrangement. The definit io n o f “tax posit ion” in section 3(1) (kb) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is being amended to include the use of the AIM approach and the software product of an approved AIM provider. The “reasonable care” provisions still apply to AIM taxpayers but proposed amendments to section 141B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will mean that a taxpayer does not take an unacceptable tax position by merely using the AIM approach and an approved AIM-capable accounting system. They may still be subject to an unacceptable tax position penalty in other areas of their tax affairs. Those who are paying AIM provisional tax using a large business AIM-capable system or who have been approved to continue using AIM as their income has grown over $5 million, will continue to be subject to the unacceptable tax position. Proposed section RC 5C provides that where an AIM provisional taxpayer has been removed from AIM they will be required to use the estimate method and will be subject to UOMI charges. Section 119 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is being amended to insert paragraph (cb) to allow the Commissioner to determine the amount of provisional tax due if the tax liabilities calculated were not “reasonably accurate” assessments of the tax liabilities for the taxpayer’s relevant income and expenditure. 24 No UOMI will be payable by the Commissioner on overpaid provisional tax under section 120VB of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Detailed analysis Exposure to UOMI can be seen by businesses as unfair. Even if a business ends up paying the right amount of provisional tax during the year they can still incur UOMI. AIM will remove this possibility. If a business using AIM to calculate and pay provisional tax does not pay the total tax liability for the year in full during the year, UOMI will not be applied unless the business has failed to pay the instalments as calculated under AIM. It is expected that businesses who use AIM will either no longer have terminal tax liabilities (on the basis that their tax payments will be made in near real-time, and based on actual results), or there will be a small difference between their provisional tax payments and their final liability. As the last provisional tax payment date is after balance date, this may allow any shortfall to be identified and paid by the final instalment. However under AIM, if the taxpayer pays less than the amount calculated by the software for any instalment, UOMI will apply on the shortfall between what the software calculated and what they paid. Late payments of tax may also attract late payment penalties as applied under the current rules. If there is a large variation between provisional tax paid under AIM and a taxpayer’s year-end terminal tax liability, Inland Revenue will consider whether or not reasonable care has been taken in the preparation of the provisional tax payments throughout the year. Amendments to section 141B provide that AIM taxpayers are not liable for unacceptable position penalties unless they are a larger taxpayer using a large business AIM-capable system. This reflects the greater fiscal risks associated with this larger taxpayer group. It is not intended that Inland Revenue will penalise taxpayers as they come to understand a new provisional tax calculation method but rather that the accuracy of the method and its users will grow over time. Example 1 Tussock Ltd has been paying its provisional tax using AIM. On its third AIM provisional tax payment date, the software calculated that Tussock Ltd owed $500 in provisional tax to Inland Revenue and submitted the Statement of Activity showing this amount to be due. Instead of paying $500 to Inland Revenue, Tussock Ltd only paid $100. Tussock Ltd will be liable for UOMI and shortfall penalties on the $400 underpayment until it is paid or the business’s terminal tax date, whichever falls first. 25 Example 2 Cameo Ltd is a small jewellery company using AIM to pay its provisional tax. It calculates its provisional tax payments using software, and makes the payments accordingly. At year-end the company meets with its accountant who discovers their depreciation was calculated incorrectly and a bad debt had not been written off, resulting in additional income tax due of $300. Cameo Ltd pays this amount of terminal tax and has no UOMI or shortfall penalty applied. As these errors are simple oversights it is likely Cameo has taken reasonable care in the calculation of its tax liability. Example 3 Tiger Corporation is a large fishing company that uses specialised Inland Revenue-approved fishing industry software. It has discovered that if it categorises its catch in different fish quantities and qualities it can lower its income tax liability. Upon receipt of the company’s Statement of Activity and audit queries, this misuse of the company’s software is bought to Inland Revenue’s attention. Tiger Corporation (as a large AIM-capable taxpayer) would be removed from AIM, placed in the estimate method, be subject to UOMI and late payment penalties on what the company’s income was determined to be by the Commissioner. It is also likely the company would be considered to have taken an unacceptable tax position in the calculation of its tax liability. 26 TAX POOLING (Clauses 37, 38 and 39) Summary of proposed amendments The bill proposes that AIM provisional tax payments be excluded from tax pooling provisio ns. Application date The proposed amendments will apply for the 2018–19 and later income years. Key features Section RP 17 of the Income Tax Act 2007 is being amended to exclude AIM from the tax pooling provisions. This is based on the premise that tax pooling is intended in circumstances where a taxpayer faces uncertainty and AIM is based on known amounts. 27 TRANSFERS OF OVERPAID PROVISIONAL TAX (Clauses 28 and 51) Summary of proposed amendments The bill proposes that overpaid provisional tax in the AIM taxpaying company may be transferred to the AIM company shareholders to meet their provisional tax liabilities on the dates that their provisional tax is due (regardless of when it is paid in the AIM company). Application date The proposed amendments will apply for the 2018–19 and later income years. Key features New section LA 6(2)(db) of the Income Tax Act 2007 enables a company using AIM to transfer a tax credit to its shareholders. Section 120 LB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that this amount does not give rise to a tax credit for the shareholder but is treated as transferred tax paid for the year that the provisional tax credit relates to. The transfer is treated as a refund for the purposes of the AIM company’s imputation credit account. New section LA 6 (2C) of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that the amount transferred is capped at the lessor of the amount the company chooses, the net amount of the shareholder’s tax credit or the company’s net amount of their tax credit. Detailed analysis There is a risk that accounting income for AIM purposes could be manipulated through the accrual of shareholder employee payments. To ensure this does not occur, it is proposed that the calculation of AIM payments be based on accounting income before shareholder salaries are accrued and deductions for such payments can only be taken for the salary paid within the two-month period that the tax payment relates to. This treatment of shareholder salaries will be confirmed as a required adjustment in the Determination proposed in section 91AAX of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Proposed section LA 6 of the Income Tax Act 2007 will allow overpayments of provisional tax that relate to shareholder employee salary accruals to be transferred to meet the shareholders tax liability on that salary at the end of the income year. The proposal provisional tax attribution will not apply to AIM provisional taxpayers, as the mechanism within AIM will assist with achieving the same outcome. 28 The transfer of overpaid provisio nal tax fro m the AIM co mpany to its shareho lders is simpler when the two parties have aligned balance dates, as the tax paid at the company level will be paid in time to meet the shareholders’ provisional tax liability. When an AIM shareholder has an early or late balance date, an amendment enables the AIM company’s provisional tax to be pro rated against all instalment dates for the year regardless of the mismatch in provisional tax payment dates to the AIM company. Example 1 Bogart Ltd is a retailer that sells musical instruments, owned equally by John and Lynn Bogart. They elect to use AIM for their businesses and in the income year ending 31 March 2019 make the following overpayments in AIM. All parties have a March balance date. Provisional tax payment dates 28-Jun 2018 28-Aug 2018 28-Oct 2018 15-Jan 2019 28-Feb 2019 7-May 2019 Bogart Ltd AIM overpayments $100 $100 $100 $100 $100 $100 Shareholder provisional tax liability due dates $200 $200 $200 In this instance, Bogart Ltd can easily transfer its overpaid provisional tax at year-end to John and Lynn to meet their provisional tax liabilities. As the dates align there will be no UOMI charges on John and Lynn. Example 2 Murray Ltd is a dog breeding operation owned by Sarah and Gareth Murray. Murray Ltd has an agreed July balance date, as is common in the dog breeding industry. Sarah and Gareth have standard March balance dates. The payment schedule for the 2019 income year would look as follows: Provisional tax payment dates 28 Aug 2018 28 Oct 2018 15 Jan 2019 28 Feb 2019 7 May 2019 28 June 2019 28 Aug 2019 Murray Ltd AIM overpayments $100 $100 $100 $100 $100 $100 Shareholder provisional tax liability due dates $150 $150 $150 In this instance, Murray Ltd would be able to transfer its excess provisional tax payments to Sarah and Gareth despite there being a mismatch in their provisional tax dates. These transfers would be calculated and transferred at Murray Ltd’s year-end. Murray Ltd’s transfer is limited to the amount of overpaid tax in Murray Ltd – that is, the company cannot transfer more than $450 as the transfer cannot be more than Sarah and Gareth’s provisional tax underpayment for the year. Payments can be transferred to Sarah and Gareth at their 2019 provisional tax dates, negating any UOMI exposure. 29 30 Other business tax 31 32 SAFE HARBOUR FOR ALL PROVISIONAL TAXPAYERS USING STANDARD UPLIFT METHOD (Clauses 80, 109 and 114) Summary of proposed amendment The amendments modify the calculation of use-of-money interest (UOMI) for taxpayers who use the standard uplift method to calculate their provisional tax. The effect of the proposed changes will be to remove UOMI for the first two provisio nal tax instalments for these taxpayers, allowing them to pay their entire provisional tax liability for the year by the third instalment, with no UOMI charge. Application date The amendments will apply from the beginning of the 2017–18 income year. Key features New section 120KBB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides a new method of calculating UOMI for taxpayers who use the standard uplift method of calculating their provisional tax. When a taxpayer makes the instalments required by the standard uplift method for the first two provisional tax payments, no UOMI will apply to those instalments. Instead, UOMI will apply from the date of the third instalment. Given the third provisional tax instalment is almost one month after a taxpayer’s balance date, it will be possible for a taxpayer to square up their tax liability for the year at the third instalment date and have no UOMI charge. When a taxpayer does not make the required instalments under the standard uplift method for the first two instalments, UOMI will apply on the lowest amount of the difference between the: • the standard instalment amount due and the actual payment; or • one-third of a taxpayer’s residual income tax for the year and the actual payment. There are also two base protection measures included in section 120KBB. To be able to use the new calculation rule in section 120KBB, all associated persons must use the standard uplift method (or the GST ratio method) to calculate provisional tax and there must be no provisional tax interest avoidance arrangement. (A provisional tax interest avoidance arrangement is where one or more amounts of residual income tax have been manipulated with the purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the UOMI rules.) 33 A further base maintenance measure is proposed to section RC 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007, to prevent taxpayers fro m switching to the estimate method after a taxpayer has paid the first two instalments based on the standard uplift method. Background The standard uplift method of calculating provisional tax is the easiest method for taxpayers to calculate and pay. It assumes a standard “uplift” based on the taxpayer’s prior year’s residual income tax (or the year before the prior year if a taxpayer has not filed their prior year return). The standard uplift method is the most commonly used method to calculate provisional tax and is used by 92 percent of provisional taxpayers. However, using the standard uplift method can leave taxpayers in a position of having to pay UOMI when their current year income exceeds the 5% growth rate from the prior year (10% for the year before the prior year). This can seem unfair to taxpayers who have used the best information available to them to calculate provisional tax. The amendments seek to reduce the impact of UOMI to taxpayers who have committed to, and paid, provisional tax based on the standard uplift method calculation. When UOMI is removed from provisional tax payments the ability to manipulate incomes between associated persons can increase. At the extreme this could lead to taxpayers not being exposed to UOMI and no provisional tax payments being made by using different provisional tax methods. The amendments contain some base maintenance mechanisms to reduce the ability to enter into such arrangements. Detailed analysis Clause 109 introduces a new section 120KBB to the Tax Administration Act 1994. Subsection (1) defines which taxpayers may use the new standard uplift calculation method as those who: • are not new provisional taxpayers; • do not fall within the safe harbour rule in section 120KE (that is, the taxpayer’s residual income tax is over the proposed new $60,000 threshold or they have not made the instalments required to use the safe harbour); and • use the standard uplift method to calculate provisional tax instalments. All standard method associates must also use either the GST ratio method or the standard method and there must be no provisional tax interest avoidance arrangement in relation to the taxpayer. Subsection 120KBB(4) defines a standard uplift method associate as “a person who is associated with the taxpayer” (person A), using the general association tests in section YB 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007, with some modifications. 34 Under the proposed new rules, a standard uplift method associate is: • a company which is in the same wholly owned group of companies as person A (if person A is a company); or • another person that is associated with person A treating section YB 3 as requiring 50% voting interest rather than 25% (if person A is a company or not). Example Charger Limited is owned equally and run by its two shareholders Macintyre and Alistair Craig. Both draw shareholder-employee salaries from the company from which no PAYE is deducted. Charger chooses to use the standard uplift method to calculate provisional tax. Macintyre and Alistair will be required to use the same provisional tax calculation method as Charger for that income year. Subsection 120KBB(4) also defines a “provisional tax interest avoidance arrangement” as an arrangement that involves the manipulation of one or more amounts of residual income tax, including a zero amount of residual income tax, with the purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the interest rules in Part 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This is an overriding anti-avoidance section, which has the aim of ensuring that any remaining opportunities to manipulate income to avoid UOMI or the payment of provisional tax can be nullified. The consequence of not being able to use the proposed new calculation method in section 120KBB is to leave the taxpayer exposed to UOMI as they currently are from the first instalment of provisional tax. Taxpayers who meet the criteria to use section 120KBB will apply the proposed modified UOMI calculation rules in subsection 120KBB(2) and (3). Which subsection applies will depend on whether the taxpayer has made the first two instalments required under the standard uplift method in full or not. For taxpayers who make the first two required instalments on the instalment dates, subsection 120 KBB(2) will apply. This subsection moves the due date for the person’s residual tax less the two instalment payments made to the date of the third instalment for the purposes of calculating UOMI. This means the person will only be exposed to a UOMI charge from the third instalment date. 35 Example Thunderbolt Limited, a manufacturer of clapping devices for sports fans, has residual income tax of $250,000 in the 2017 year. Thunderbolt has trouble estimating its provisional tax due to volatility in its income. Sales volumes are highly dependent on the success of local sports teams – the more successful the teams, the more clapping devices are sold. Therefore Thunderbolt decides to use the standard uplift method to calculate its provisional tax payments, reducing the risk of UOMI applying if its estimate is incorrect. For the 2018 year Thunderbolt makes two provisional tax payments of $87,500 per payment. At the third instalment date Thunderbolt has calculated that its actual annual liability is $300,000, due to the success of the local football team, the Fords. Because Thunderbolt has made the two required instalments under the standard uplift method on time, section 120KBB(2) will apply and Thunderbolt’s residual income tax for the year, $300,000 less the two instalments made ($175,000), is due and payable on the date of the third instalment. This means that if Thunderbolt pays $125,000 as a third instalment it will have satisfied all its residual income tax and Thunderbolt will incur no UOMI. Thunderbolt could just pay the required third instalment amount of $87,500, but will incur UOMI on the shortfall of $37,500 from the third instalment date until the outstanding tax and interest is paid. For taxpayers who do not make the required instalments in full or on time, the timing rule in section 120KBB(3) will apply. These instalments are referred to as “failed instalments”. If a taxpayer has a failed instalment, interest will apply to that instalment. The amount on which interest will apply is the lowest amount of: • one-third of their residual inco me tax less the amount paid in relat ion to the failed instalment; or • the amount they are liable to pay as an instalment amount under the standard uplift method less the amount paid in relation to the failed instalment. This provision means that a person who does not pay the standard uplift amount in full or on time will incur UOMI on the lowest amount of the difference between one- third of their residual income tax and the payment in relation to that instalment, or the amount due as the instalment and the amount paid. 36 Example Challenger Limited uses the standard method for calculating provisional tax for its June year-end. Its residual income tax for the 2017 year is $20,500,000. This means its standard uplift method instalments will be 105 percent of that amount, being $21,525,000, and each instalment required to be $7,175,000. Instead of making those first two instalments, Challenger makes a first instalment of $5,700,000 on 28 November 2017 and a second instalment of $6,800,000 on 28 March 2018. At the end of the income year Challenger calculates its residual income tax as $24,000,000, and makes a final instalment of $11,500,000 and an amount of $91,242 in UOMI. The total instalments made equal Challengers residual income tax payable. Because Challenger has not made the required instalments under the standard uplift method they will fall within section 120KBB(3). Challenger will be charged interest on the lesser of one-third of its residual income tax for the year, less the instalment payment made or the instalment amount less the instalment payment made. As one-third of Challenger’s residual income tax of $8,000,000 is greater than the standard method instalment of $7,175,000 the “lesser” amount in section 120KBB(3) will be the standard instalment amount. Using this as the basis of the UOMI calculation, Challenger will be subject to UOMI on: • $1,475,000 of the first instalment ($7,175,000 less payment of $5,700,000) from the due date for the first instalment to the date the amount was paid (the date of the third instalment). This UOMI amount is $80,876; • $375,000 of the second instalment ($7,175,000 less payment of $6,800,000) from the due date of the second instalment until the date the amount was paid (the date of the third instalment). This UOMI amount is $10,366. Challenger will not incur any UOMI from the date of the third instalment as all its residual income tax and the associated UOMI charge has been paid on that date. For taxpayers who use the standard uplift method and make the first two instalments in full and on time, no UOMI will apply. This also means that if a taxpayer is overpaid no UOMI will be payable by the Commissioner until the third instalment. Currently, taxpayers who use the standard uplift method can switch to the estimate method at any time before the third instalment of provisional tax. By removing UOMI from the standard uplift method, taxpayers who are overpaid prior to the third instalment could switch to the estimation method and have credit UOMI paid to them earlier. This would be contrary to the intention of the amendments, which is to reduce the impact of UOMI on taxpayers. Consequently, an amendment to section RC 5(1) (clause 80) is proposed, to prevent a person who uses the standard uplift method and pays provisional tax equal to the amounts specified in section RC 10 for the first two instalments, from choosing the estimate method for the year. 37 This will only allow taxpayers who start using the standard uplift method to switch to the estimate method if they have not paid the second instalment under the standard uplift method. Example Viper Limited has calculated their provisional tax liability for the 2017–18 income year using the standard method which requires instalments of $350,000 at each instalment date. Viper has made the first instalment but due to an unexpected downturn in sales realises that its total tax liability for the year will only be $100,000. Before payment of its second instalment Viper decides to switch to the estimate method so it doesn’t have to tie up working capital in tax payments. Also, it will be able to earn credit UOMI on its overpaid tax. If Viper had made the second instalment based on the standard uplift amount it would not be permitted to switch to the estimate method. 38 CHANGES TO UOMI SAFE HARBOUR THRESHOLD (Clauses 80, 109 and 110) Summary of proposed amendment As part of proposed changes to the provisional tax rules, the bill increases the current “safe harbour” threshold at which use-of-money interest applies, from $50,000 to $60,000, and extends the safe harbour to non-individuals (for example, companies). Currently the safe harbour only applies to individual taxpayers. Application date The amendments will apply from the beginning of the 2017–18 income year. Key features Section 120KE of the Tax Administration Act 1994 currently allows individual taxpayers a safe harbour from the imposition of use-of-money interest when the taxpayer has residual income tax of less than $50,000. The proposed amendment increases this threshold to $60,000 and also removes the requirement that a taxpayer be a natural person (an individual) to apply the safe harbour. The amendments also add three additional requirements to tighten application of the safe harbour rules. These amendments will: • require a taxpayer to actually make the three instalments required under the standard method to enable them to use the safe harbour; • prohibit a taxpayer who has a provisional tax interest avoidance arrangement from using the safe harbour; and • prohibit a taxpayer who has paid the first two instalments under the standard method from changing to the estimation method. The first two amendments are found in section 120KE and the third in section RC 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007. For taxpayers who do not pay the required instalment amounts, the general standard method rules will apply. 39 Background Provisional tax is an area that businesses find difficult to get right. This is particularly so for smaller businesses. The current rules require a taxpayer to either base their provisio nal tax amount on a GST ratio method, an uplift from the prior year’s residual income tax (or two years prior when a tax return for the prior year has not been filed) or an estimate of income for the year. Under the latter two options use-of-mo ney interest (UOMI) will apply if a taxpayer’s actual residual income tax differs fro m payments made. This result can seem unfair when a taxpayer is basing their provisional tax on an uplift from the prior year. The current safe harbour was introduced to reduce the impact of UOMI to a subset of taxpayers. In particular, individuals other than those on very high incomes were removed from the application of UOMI to reduce the impact of those rules. The proposed amendments will bring more taxpayers into the safe harbour by increasing the threshold to those taxpayers with a residual tax liability of $60,000 or less, and extend application of the safe harbour to non-individual taxpayers. The amendments also seek to tighten some deficiencies in the current safe harbour rules. First, an amendment seeks to ensure that taxpayers must make required payments under the standard uplift method to use the safe harbour. Secondly, the ability to switch from the standard to the estimation method has been limited so a taxpayer can only switch methods up to the payment of the second instalment. Finally, a base maintenance provision will also apply to the safe harbour when a taxpayer has entered an arrangement to manipulate income to defeat the intention o f the provisional tax rules. 40 PROVISIONAL TAX ATTRIBUTION (Clauses 72, 73, 77, 78, 79, 82, 92(8)-(10), 96, 102 and 111) Summary of proposed amendment The bill proposes a new way of simplifying provisional tax liabilities on untaxed salaries received by shareholder-emplo yees of clo se companies. Under this proposal, the shareholder-employee and the company can agree that the shareholder-employee’s provisional tax payment obligations on their shareholder salary are transferred to the company. At the end of the year, the company can transfer a tax credit, out of its provisio nal tax payments, to the shareholder-employee. A shareholder-employee whose only income not subject to tax at source is their salary will be able to use these rules to completely remove themselves from provisional tax. Application date The amendments will apply from the beginning of the 2018–19 income year. Key features The proposed new rules will create a mechanism by which a shareholder-emplo yee’s provisional tax payment obligations in relation to their salary can be transferred to a company which uses either the uplift or estimate method for provisional tax. (A different method is provided within the proposed AIM rules for AIM companies.) The company’s obligations to pay provisional tax on various instalment dates will be increased by the amount transferred from the employee. At the end of the year, the company can choose to transfer some of the provisional tax it has paid to the shareholder-emplo yee. The shareholder-employee will receive it as a tax credit. If insufficient tax has been paid by either the company or the shareholder-emplo yee, use-of-money interest may be payable, depending on the size of the shortfall and the provisional tax method used. The proposals will be the most useful in situations where there is a close relationship between the company and its shareholder-employees, and where one accountant prepares the tax returns for both at the end of the year. Background In a typical small company scenario, the company exists as a vehicle for the controlling shareholders to carry on their business activity with the protection of limited liability. The income the company derives will be split between being retained by the company and being distributed to the shareholders, with the final decision typically being made at the end of the year once the final results are known. 41 While the shareholders and the company are legally separate, from an economic perspective the split is much less clear. Current tax law fo llows the legal form. Salary amounts paid to shareholder- employees of close companies are typically not subject to PAYE. If the income tax on these salary amounts exceeds $2,500, the shareholder-employee will be required to pay provisional tax in the subsequent year. So, while there is one true stream of income (that which the company receives from external sources), and the decision about the allocation is made at the end of the year, during the course of the year, often two separate provisional taxpayers have calculated their provisional tax liabilities and are making payments to Inland Revenue. Detailed analysis The following diagram illustrates how the proposed new rules would apply. 42 Beginning of the income year Electing-in When a company and a shareholder-employee want to use the provisional tax attribution (PTA) rules for the first time, they must elect to do so in accordance with proposed section 15Y of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The election must be made before the company’s first provisional tax instalment date. The PTA rules can only be used if both the company and the shareholder-employee agree. A company can choose to use the PTA rules for some, but not all, o f its shareholder-employees, and a person who is a shareholder-employee of more than one company can choose to elect in for some, but not all, of those companies. Once a shareholder-employee and a company have elected into the PTA rules, they will remain in the rules in subsequent years, until they elect out in accordance with proposed section 15Y(2), again prior to the company’s first provisional tax instalment date. Inland Revenue will prescribe the methods for electing in and electing out closer to the beginning of the 2018–19 income year when the new rules are proposed to come into effect. Adjustments to provisional tax liabilities The key initial effect of electing into PTA is the adjustments made to both the shareholder-employee’s and the company’s provisional tax payment obligations in proposed section RC 10. Under proposed subsection (2), the shareholder-employee’s provisional tax obligation will be reduced by the amount “shareholder attributed”, which is their “shareho lder attributed tax” from earlier years uplifted by 5% or 10% as appropriate, or their estimate of their shareholder attributed tax. Shareholder attributed tax is defined in section RC 10(6) and (7) as either 28%, or the amount of tax paid, on their shareholder salary. Under proposed section RC 3(4), where a shareholder-emplo yee elects into the rules and their residual income tax for the previous year less the tax on the shareholder salary in the previous year is less than $2,500, the shareholder-employee has no obligation to pay provisional tax in the current year. Under proposed section RC 10(2), the company’s payment obligations are increased by the amount “company attributed”. This is defined in proposed section RC 10(3)(c) as the total of the shareholder attributed tax amounts transferred by employees. 43 Example 1: Transfer of entire provisional tax payment obligation Joe is the sole shareholder of J Contracts Ltd. In 2017–18, Joe received $100,000 in untaxed salary from the company, which is his sole income. The tax on this income is $23,920. In that same year J Contracts Ltd had net income of $200,000, and the tax on that income was $56,000. In the absence of using PTA, Joe would have a provisional tax liability for 2018–19 of 105% of $23,920, which is $25,116, and J Contracts Ltd would have a provisional tax liability of 105% of $56,000, which is $58,800, assuming both use the uplift method. Joe and J Contracts Ltd agree to use the PTA method for 2018–19. Joe’s shareholder attributed is $23,920 x 105%, which is $25,116. This is deducted from the payment liability he would otherwise have had, of $25,116, leaving a payment liability of nil. The residual income tax for the previous year of $23,920, less the tax on his salary for that year of $23,920, is nil. This means that Joe has no obligation to pay provisional tax in the 2018–19 income year. The company’s liability to pay provisional tax in 2018–19 of $58,800 is increased by the amount transferred from Joe of $25,116, giving it a total liability to pay provisional tax of $83,916. This is illustrated as: 44 Example 2: Transfer of part of provisional tax payment obligation The facts are the same as for Example 1, except that Joe also has other income in 2017–18 of $80,000. Total tax on his income of $180,000 is therefore $50,320. The definition of “shareholder attributed” treats Joe’s salary of $100,000 as the first part of his income, so tax on it is $23,920, and is uplifted in the following year to $25,116. This is deducted from the payment liability he otherwise would have had, of 105% of $50,320, which is $52,836. $52,836 less $25,116 is $27,720. This is Joe’s provisional tax liability for the 2018–19 year. (He will not be a provisional taxpayer at all if his liability to make payments is less than $2,500, but here it clearly is.) This is illustrated as: During course of income year The company will be required to pay provisional tax payments, under its chosen method, of the combined total of its own liability and the liability it has assumed on behalf of shareholder-emplo yees. It will not be required to notify Inland Revenue of the make-up of each payment; the total payment amount constitutes provisional tax paid by the company. 45 End of income year Allocation of tax credit to shareholder-employees At the end of the income year, in the ordinary course of business, the company’s accountant will calculate the following amounts: • the amount the company will pay to the shareholder-emplo yee by way of salary; • the shareholder-emplo yee’s tax liability for the year; and • the company’s tax liability for the year. At that point, the company’s accountant can determine how the amount paid as provisional tax by the company will be allocated between the company and the shareholder-employees who elected into the provisional tax attribution rules. The amount of tax credit the company can transfer to its shareholder-emplo yees is not related to the amount the company paid on their behalf during the income year. The company can allocate to its elected-in shareholder-emplo yees: • all o f the provisio nal tax it paid; • some of the provisional tax it paid; or • none of the provisional tax it paid, except that a company cannot claim a refund unless it has first transferred to shareholder-employees an amount equal to their tax liability on their shareholder salaries (proposed section LA 6(2)(cb)). The amount transferred by the company to its shareholder-emplo yees will be treated as a tax credit by them under proposed amendments to section LB 2. This type of tax credit is applied after residual income tax is determined, in accordance with the existing definition in section YA 1. This is the same approach as that taken for provisio nal tax credits, and differs from the approach to other kinds of tax credits such as PAYE, RWT and tax paid by trustees on behalf of beneficiaries. The amount transferred by the company will be deducted from the tax credits available to it, also under proposed amendments to section LB 2. Proposed section 45E of the Tax Administration Act sets out a process for the company providing information to Inland Revenue and to the shareholder-employee of the amount transferred by way of tax credit. Example 3: Tax payments match total liability In Example 1, at the beginning of the 2018–19 year Joe transferred his provisional tax payment liability of $25,116 to J Contracts Ltd. J Contracts Ltd paid the new combined liability during the year of $83,916. Both Joe and J Contracts Ltd had net income of exactly their uplift amounts – $105,000 for Joe and $210,000 for J Contracts Ltd, with a tax liability of $25,116 for Joe and $58,800 for J Contracts Ltd. J Contracts Ltd has a tax liability of $58,800, but has paid provisional tax of $83,916. It therefore has excess tax credits of $25,116. It must transfer these excess tax credits to Joe. J Contracts Ltd could transfer more than $25,116 to Joe if it wished; it would then need to make up any shortfall as terminal tax. 46 UOMI adjustments When a company and a shareholder-employee use the provisional tax attribution rules, use-of-money interest adjustments must be made at the end of the year. These adjustments reflect that, as a result of entering into the provisional tax attribution rules, the company accepted an obligation to meet the shareholder-emplo yee’s provisio nal tax payment obligations. For taxpayers outside the provisional tax attribution rules, use-of-money interest is payable on the difference between the amount of provisional tax paid and the taxpayer’s residual income tax. When provisional tax exceeds residual income tax, the excess is an overpayment (on which the taxpayer may be paid interest); when provisional tax is less than residual income tax, the shortfall is an underpayment (on which the taxpayer may be required to pay interest). When shareholder-employees and companies have entered into the provisional tax attribution rules the payment liability transferred from the shareholder-emplo yee to the company is added to the amount on which the company is potentially liable to pay UOMI, and deducted from the amount on which the shareholder-employee is potentially liable to pay UOMI. This is done by proposed section 120L(1B), which variously adds and subtracts the amount of liability transferred at the beginning of the year to the year-end underpaid and overpaid amounts. The following diagram sets out these adjustments in the context of the examples used above: If the amount to be subtracted from underpaid tax is greater than the amount of underpaid tax, the difference is overpaid tax, and if the amount to be subtracted from overpaid tax is greater than the amount of overpaid tax, the difference is underpaid tax. UOMI is calculated after the additions and subtractions described above have been made. 47 Example 4: UOMI calculations In this example, both Joe and J Contracts Ltd are using the uplift method. As in Example 2, at the beginning of the 2018–19 year Joe transferred his provisional tax payment liability in relation to his company salary of $25,116 to J Contracts Ltd, while remaining responsible for the provisional tax on his income from other sources (previously $80,000). J Contracts Ltd paid the new combined liability during the year of $83,916. At the end of the year, both Joe and J Contracts Ltd had net income significantly greater than their uplift amounts. Joe earns $84,000 from other sources, on which the tax is $27,720. During the year, Joe made his own provisional tax payments of $27,720, so he met the liability on his $84,000 of other income. But Joe’s income from the company has increased to $250,000, so Joe’s tax liability in relation to this amount is $73,420 giving him a total tax liability of $101, 140. J Contracts Ltd’s income was $500,000, so its liability is $140,000. One option is for J Contracts Ltd and Joe to make an additional payment at P3 which meets their shortfalls. If this happens, then under the proposed changes to the uplift method made elsewhere in this bill, no use-of-money interest will be payable by either J Contracts Ltd or Joe. The remainder of this example proceeds on the basis that any shortfalls are not paid until terminal tax date, which means that use-of-money interest calculation adjustments must be made. J Contracts Ltd decides to transfer $10,000 of the provisional tax payments it made of $83,916 to Joe. This reduces Joe’s shortfall to $63,420, which Joe will need to pay. J Contracts Ltd will need to pay its tax shortfall which is now $140,000 – $73,916 = $66,084. Use-of-money interest adjustments must be made. Joe calculates his underpayment amount, which is his total tax liability less provisional tax payments made by him, so $101,140 – $27,720 = $73,420. (The amount transferred as credit to him is not relevant here.) But because he and J Contracts Ltd had agreed that the company would pay $25,116 on his behalf, this is deducted from his underpayment amount, reducing it to $48,304. This is the amount on which Joe must pay UOMI from P3. J Contracts Ltd makes a similar underpayment calculation. Its total liability was $140,000, and it paid $83,916 during the year, so its underpayment amount is $140,000 – $83,916 = $56,084. But of the $83,916 it paid, it had agreed to pay $25,116 on behalf of Joe, so this is added to its underpayment amount. This makes its total underpayment amount $56,084 + $25,116 = $81,200. This is the amount on which J Contracts Ltd must pay UOMI, from P3. The calculations can be checked as follows: UOMI adjusted underpayment amounts above: Joe $48,304 + J Contracts Ltd $81,200 = $129,504 Total tax liabilities: Joe $101,140 + J Contracts Ltd $140,000 = $241,140 Total provisional tax paid to IR (before transfers): Joe $27,720, J Contracts Ltd $83,916 = $111,636. Difference between total liabilities and total provisional tax paid to IR: $241,140 – $111,636 = $129,504. Total shortfall amounts to pay: Joe $63,420, J Contracts Ltd $66,084 = $129,504. 48 These transactions can be summarised as follows: Tax calculations: Joe J Contracts Ltd 2017-18 tax return 2017-18 income $100,000 company $80,000 other $180,000 total $200,000 2017-18 tax liability $50,320 $56,000 2018-19 provisional tax 2018-19 uplift amount $52,836 $58,800 Transfer of prov tax on company income from Joe to J Contracts Ltd -$25,116 $25,116 2018-19 prov tax liability after transfer $27,720 $83,916 2018-19 prov tax paid $27,720 $83,916 2018-19 tax return 2018-19 income $250,000 company $84,000 other $500,000 Tax on 2018-19 income $101,140 $140,000 Tax shortfall $73,420 $56,084 Transfer of prov tax previously paid by J Contracts Ltd to Joe $10,000 $10,000 Terminal tax liability $63,420 $66,084 2018-19 UOMI calculations Initial calculation of underpayment amounts $73,420 $56,084 Deduct initial prov tax liability transfer from Joe -$25,116 Add initial prov tax liability transfer to J Contracts Ltd $25,116 Amount on which UOMI payable $48,304 $81,200 Additional rules in proposed sections 120L(1C) and (1D) apply when either the company or the shareholder-employee is using the uplift method, and is potentially only liable to UOMI from their third instalment date. As noted above, where a shareholder-employee has elected into PTA and has no other income, the shareholder-employee will no longer be subject to provisional tax under proposed section RC 3(4). That person will also no longer be subject to use-of-money interest. Where the company was liable to use-of-money interest and its tax liabilit y exceeded its tax payments, the non-application of use-of-money interest to the shareholder-employee might encourage the company to reduce its income and so its use-of-money interest liability by paying a larger salary to the shareholder-emplo yee. Proposed section 120L(1E) and (1F) addresses this situation by adding the shareholder-employee’s residual income tax to the company’s residual income tax for use-of-money interest purposes, where the shareholder-emplo yee’s residual income tax exceeds $60,000. 49 ALLOWING CONTRACTORS TO ELECT THEIR OWN WITHHOLDING RATE (Clauses 87, 88, 92(2)–(6), 93(1)–(18), 98, 99 and 114) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment will allow contractors who are subject to the schedular payment rules to elect their own withholding rate without having to apply to Inland Revenue for a special tax code. Application date The proposed amendment will come into force on 1 April 2017. Key features The proposed amendment will allow contractors who are subject to the schedular payment rules to elect their own withholding rate without having to apply to Inland Revenue for a special tax code. Under the proposed amendments there will be some situations when a contractor will not be able to elect their own rate. These include: • when a contractor has not provided their name and IRD number, a 45% rate of withholding applies; • when a contractor has not met a liability under an Inland Revenue Act, the Commissioner can prescribe a rate of withholding; • a minimum rate of withholding applies to contractors. For non-resident contractors and contractors with temporary work visas this minimum rate is 15%, for all other contractors this is 10%; • if a contractor has changed their rate twice in a 12-month period, they require the consent of the payer to any further changes. If a contractor has not selected a rate, a “standard rate” applies. This standard rate is the relevant rate listed in schedule 4 of the Income Tax Act. Background Currently, when a contractor is subject to the schedular payment rules, a flat rate of withholding applies. This rate will often not accurately match the contractor’s actual income tax liability. Contractors can obtain a special tax code to alter their rate, but the process can be cumbersome, requiring them to apply to Inland Revenue and supply supporting information. 50 Detailed analysis Proposed new section RD 10B of the Income Tax Act 2007 sets new rules for what rates would apply for contractors subject to the schedular payment rules. The flowchart below summarises these rules: No No No No No Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Schedular payment rules apply Has the contractor provided their name and IRD number? Has the Commissioner provided a prescribed rate? Has the contractor selected a rate? Is the selected rate greater than the minimum rate? Does the contractor have a special tax code? Withhold 45% of payment Withhold at standard rate Withhold at selected rate Withhold at prescribed rate Withhold at minimum rate 51 Overview of different rate types Description Rate Elected rate Chosen by the payee. 10% – 100% (15% – 100% for non-residents and holders of temporary visas) Special rate Payee can request from Commissioner. Only necessary if the payee wants a rate lower than 10% (or 15% as above) No notification rate Where payee does not provide name or IRD number to the payer. 45% Prescribed rate Set by Commissioner where the payee has not met a liability under the Inland Revenue Acts. Cannot exceed 60% Non-resident entertainer rate This rate must be used by non-resident entertainers. 20% Standard rate The rate for the activity or arrangement set out in Schedule 4, which will apply if none of the rates set out above apply. Vary between 10.5% and 33% depending on the type of activity or arrangement Elected rate Proposed sections RD 10B(3)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and 24LB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provide that contractors subject to the schedular payment rules may elect the withholding rate that is to apply to payments to them. To elect a rate of withholding, the contractor must notify the person making the payment of the rate to apply and this notification must be made in a form approved by the Commissioner. Minimum rate To address the risk that contractors may attempt to defer or avoid paying their tax by choosing an artificially low withholding rate, proposed section 24LB(2) provides that contractors must elect a rate of withholding that is greater than the minimum rate. For non-resident contractors and contractors who are holders of temporary entry class visas, the minimum rate is 15%. For all other contractors, the minimum rate is 10%. Special tax rate A contractor may have a rate lower than the 10% minimum if they obtain a special tax rate certificate under section 24N of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Repeatedly changing withholding rates If a contractor has previously elected a withholding rate twice in a 12-month period to the same payer, they require the consent of the schedular payer to make any further changes in their withholding rate. 52 Example On 3 March 2018 Caroline starts work as a building contractor for Small Builders Ltd. Payments from Small Builders to Caroline are subject to the schedular payment rules and Caroline initially selects a withholding rate of 15%. On 4 April 2018, Caroline wishes to change her withholding rate and notifies Small Builders that she wishes to have a withholding rate of 20% apply to her. Caroline does not require the consent of Small Builders to this change as she has only elected a withholding rate once within the last 12 months. However, if Caroline wishes to make any further changes to her withholding rate for payments made by Small Builders up till 3 April 2018, she will require the consent of Small Builders. On 5 August 2018, Caroline starts work for Large Builders Ltd. Caroline can elect a new withholding rate without the consent of Large Builders Ltd. as she has not previously elected a withholding rate with Large Builders. No notification rate Proposed section RD 10B(2) provides that when a contractor does not give their name and IRD number to their payer, then payments to them must have tax deducted at a 45% rate. This replaces the current “no notification” rate for schedular payments in section RD 18 of the Income Tax Act. This is intended to provide a simpler “no notification” rate for schedular payments that is aligned with the rate that applies to employees. Prescribed rate Proposed sections RD 10B(4) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and 24LC of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provide that when a contractor has not met a liability under the Inland Revenue Acts the Commissioner has the ability to prescribe a withholding rate. The proposed process for the prescribed rate is similar to the one for deduction notices under section 157 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, and requires a notice to be provided to the payer or the contractor that a different rate should be applied. If a notice is provided to the payer, the payee must also be provided a notice, unless after making reasonable enquiries the Commissioner does not have a valid address for the contractor. Elects rate of 15% 3 March 2018 4 April 2018 3 March 2019 Elects rate of 20% Need agreement to elect another rate with the same payer before 3 March 2019 53 Under the proposed amendments the Commissioner can require two different types of prescribed rate deductions. These are: • standard schedular payment deductions under the ordinary PAYE rules (which provide PAYE tax credits for the contractor); • additional deductions, which are used to meet the contractor’s tax debts or other liabilities. The additional deductions would generally be required to be recorded on a separate line in the employer monthly schedule and under a different tax code. This is similar to how additional deductions are currently done for student loans. Where addit ional deductions are paid in this way, the initial late payment penalties charged on the original debt are not applied. The Commissioner does not intend to use this prescribed rate notice to require additional deductions to meet a contractor’s other tax debts until schedular payments are administered in Inland Revenue’s new computer system. Example Ben is a building contractor. He earns $120,000 each year from his building contracts with several major building companies. Ben elects a withholding rate of 10% and $12,000 is withheld from him for the year. Ben predominantly provides labour services and has minimal deductions. His end of year tax liability is $30,000 and so Ben has a terminal tax bill of $18,000. Ben does not pay his terminal tax bill and so ends up with a tax debt. The Commissioner prescribes a new rate of withholding to Ben and his payers. This new rate is: • 25% under the standard schedular payment code (WT). Ben receives PAYE credits for these amounts and these amounts are intended to ensure that Ben does not have an end of year income tax liability and further tax bills; and • an additional 15% under a new tax code and recorded on a new line in the employer monthly schedule. Amounts withheld under this code are used to pay Ben’s tax debt for the previous year. Standard rates If a contractor does not elect a rate of withholding under section 24LB, proposed section RD 10B(3)(b) provides that the standard rate of withholding applies to them. The standard rate is the relevant rate set out in schedule 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007. For contractors working for labour-hire firms and those under voluntary withholding agreements the proposed standard rate is 20%. 54 For other contractors the proposed standard rate in schedule 4 is the same as the rate that currently applies to those payments. This means that if a contractor that was previously subject to the schedular payment rules does not elect a different withholding rate when the proposed amendments come into force, their withholding rate remains unchanged. Non-resident entertainers The proposed amendments do not apply to non-resident entertainers. Non-resident entertainers will continue to have a flat withholding rate of 20% apply to them. These entertainers can continue to have withholding treated as a final tax and will not have to file returns. 55 EXTENDING WITHHOLDING TO LABOUR-HIRE FIRM CONTRACTORS (Clauses 93 (19) and 100(2)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment extends the schedular payment rules to contractors that work for labour-hire firms. Application date The proposed amendment will come into force on 1 April 2017. Key features The proposed amendment adds payments by labour-hire firms to their contractors to the list of payments that are subject to the schedular payment rules. As a result, labour-hire firms will be required to withhold from all payments made to their contractors. They will be required to withhold at the relevant rate as described under the proposed amendments outlined in “Allowing contractors to elect their own withholding rate”. Labour-hire firms will have an obligation to deduct withholding tax when they make payments to companies used by contractors. Labour-hire firm contractors will not be eligible to receive certificates of exemption from withholding. A labour-hire firm is defined as “an entity which has as one of its main activities the business of arranging for a person to perform work or services directly for clients of the entity.” Background The current withholding rules are out of date and do not cover changing employment practices and modern industries. Over the last two decades there has been a large growth in the labour-hire firm industry. However, the withholding rules do not adequately address contractors working for this industry. Labour-hire firms provide workers to perform services to clients. The labour-hire firm can engage these workers either as employees or contractors. The current withholding rules do not generally apply to contractors engaged by labour-hire firms. This means these contractors are required to manage their own tax obligations and have to deal with provisional tax. It also means that these contractors have opportunities for non-compliance (whether deliberate or accidental). 56 In addition, using a company structure has become increasingly popular with contractors. Payments to companies are generally not subject to withholding tax under the schedular payment rules. Detailed analysis The amendments propose to insert Part J to Schedule 4 of the Income Tax Act, which adds payments made by labour-hire firms to contractors under a “labour-hire arrangement” to the schedular payment rules. Under proposed Part J, payments are covered by the schedular payment rules when: 1. The payment is made under a labour-hire arrangement (as defined). 2. One of the main activities of the entity making the payment is providing labour- hire arrangements (that is, the labour-hire arrangement is not incidental to the main business of the entity). 1. The payment is made under a labour-hire arrangement A labour-hire arrangement is an arrangement which in whole or part involves the performance of work or services by a person directly for the client of the entity, or directly for a client of another entity. The entity receives payment from the client and pays the worker themselves. Directly for a client of another entity A labour-hire arrangement also includes situations when there are chains of labour- hire firms involved. This can happen if a labour-hire firm arranges for another labour- hire firm to provide workers for their client. 2. One of the main activities of the entity making the payment is providing labour- hire arrangements (that is, the labour-hire arrangement is not incidental to the main business of the entity) The proposed amendment only applies when one of the main activities of the entity making the payment is providing labour-hire services. This means that withholding under the amendment only applies if the entity is carrying on a labour-hire business. It is not necessary for the labour-hire activities to be the sole business, or even the main business of the payer. However, a merely incidental business is not sufficient to require withholding. Payment Work Payment (withholding applies here) Labour-hire firm Client Contractor 57 The proposed amendment is similar to Australia’s Pay As You Go withholding rules. Example 1: Labour-hire IT Universe Ltd provides contractors to other businesses to help with their IT projects. X Co. asks IT Universe Ltd for IT contractors to help with an upgrade of their systems. IT Universe Ltd provides one of their contractors (Steve, a New Zealand resident) to assist X Co. IT Universe Ltd is arranging for a worker (Steve) to provide work directly for their client (X Co.). As a result, they are in a labour-hire arrangement with Steve and X Co. and this arrangement is part of their labour-hire business. IT Universe Ltd is required to withhold tax from any payments to Steve. The rate will be the applicable rate as set out in the earlier section Allowing contractors to elect their own withholding rate. If he does not specify a rate then the standard rate for labour-hire firm contractors of 20% will apply. Example 2: Solicitor and barrister Ben is Jane’s solicitor. Jane is engaged in litigation and requires a barrister to represent her in court. For this purpose, Ben instructs Tara and pays Tara on Jane’s behalf. Ben is arranging for a contractor (Tara) to provide work directly for their client (Jane). However, Ben is not required to withhold from these payments because arranging for people to work for his clients is not one of his main activities. The payment is incidental to his business of providing legal services. Payment Work Payment (less withholding) IT Universe Ltd X Co. Steve Payment Work Payment Ben (solicitor) Jane Tara (barrister) 58 Example 3: Chain of labour-hire firms Y Co. asks IT Universe Ltd for web designers to help them build a new website. IT Universe agrees to provide a number of web designers to Y Co. but is unable to find enough suitable people. IT Universe Ltd goes to Web Pro Ltd (another labour-hire firm) and arranges for some of Web Pro’s contractors (Uri and Velma) to perform work for Y Co. Web Pro Ltd. is arranging for contractors (Uri and Velma) to perform work directly for the client (Y Co.) of another entity (IT Universe Ltd.). As a result, they are in a labour-hire arrangement and this arrangement is part of their labour-hire business. Web Pro is therefore required to withhold from any payments it makes to Uri or Velma. Example 4: Subcontractors Paul is a builder and contracts to build a house for Susan. He subcontracts another contractor, Bruce to do the plumbing work for the house. Paul is not required to withhold from payments to Bruce because he is not arranging for workers to perform work directly for clients, nor is providing labour-hire arrangements one of his main activities. Company exception The amendments provide that the general exception to the schedular payment rules for companies will not apply to payments under labour-hire arrangements. That means labour-hire firms will be required to withhold from payments in the circumstances outlined above regardless of the type of legal entity the payments are made to. A company that finds it is being over-withheld as a result of this, can apply for a special tax code to reduce their withholding rate below the minimum rate. This can include applying for a withholding rate of 0%. Payment Work Payment IT Universe Ltd Y Co. Uri and Velma Web Pro Ltd 59 Example 5: Chain of labour-hire firms continued As in the earlier example, IT Universe Ltd. has agreed to provide web designers for Y Co. IT Universe arranges for Web Pro Ltd to provide workers for Y Co. IT Universe is arranging workers to provide work directly to clients. As a result, they are in a labour- hire arrangement and this labour-hire arrangement is part of their labour-hire business. As a result IT Universe Ltd is required to withhold from any payment made to Web Pro. Web Pro may apply for a special tax code to reduce their rate of withholding (including applying for a rate of 0%). Certificates of exemption Under the proposed amendments, contractors working for labour-hire firms cannot obtain certificates of exemption to exempt themselves from the schedular payment rules. These contractors may still apply for a special tax rate if withholding is inappropriate, which includes being able to apply for a 0% rate. This means that all contractors working for labour-hire firms must have payments to them recorded on the Employer Monthly Schedule even if a 0% rate of withholding applies to them. 60 VOLUNTARY WITHHOLDING AGREEMENTS (Clause 93(19)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment will allow contractors not covered by the schedular payment rules to opt in to the rules with the consent of their payer. Application date The proposed amendment comes into force on 1 April 2017. Key features Contractors that are not subject to the schedular payment rules will be able to enter into voluntary withholding agreement with their payers. If an agreement is entered into, the contractor becomes subject to the schedular payment rules and the payer will be required to withhold from payments made to them. The proposed amendments insert Part W into Schedule 4 of the Income Tax Act. Part W sets out that a payment to a person is a schedular payment when: • There is no obligation to withhold from the payment under the Income Tax Act 2007 or the Tax Administration Act 1994. • The contractor and their payer have agreed to treat the payment as a voluntary schedular payment, and have recorded their agreement in a document. If the above two criteria apply, then the schedular payment rules apply and the payer is required to withhold from the contractor at the rate selected by the contractor (as per the proposed amendments outlined in “Allowing contractors to elect their own withholding rate)”. Payments covered by voluntary withholding agreements are excluded from the definition of employer and employee for the purpose of the FBT rules. This means that fringe benefit tax does not apply when fringe benefits are provided to contractors under voluntary withholding agreements. Background Currently contractors not covered by the schedular payment rules are not able to have tax withheld on a payday basis. Many of these contractors may prefer to pay their tax through the schedular payment rules. 61 LATE PAYMENT PENALTY (Clause 114) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment specifies that Inland Revenue will no longer impose a 1% monthly incremental late payment penalty on unpaid tax from Goods and Services Tax (GST), income tax and Working for Families tax credits overpayment. This amendment states that this will only apply to future tax periods. Application date The amendment will come into force on 1 April 2017. Key features Proposed section 139B(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that a taxpayer that does not pay by the due date an amount of tax, would no longer incur the 1% incremental late payment penalty, if the unpaid tax resides in one of the described tax periods. If the unpaid tax liability does not reside in one of the described tax periods, there would be no change and the taxpayer would continue to incur the incremental late payment penalty as imposed by the current rules. This amendment identifies the relevant tax types and tax periods as follows: • GST tax periods ending after the 24 March 2017; • provisional tax and income tax for the 2017–18 or later income years; and • Working for Families tax credit overpayments for the 2017–18 or later income years. Most taxpayers have a GST taxable period that ends on the last day of a month. However, under section 15E(2) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, some taxpayers may be approved by the Commissioner to have a GST taxable period that may end up to seven days before or after the last day of the month. The proposed amendment looks to include taxpayers that have a GST taxable period that may end up to seven days before 31 March 2017. This is to ensure that these taxpayers benefit from this amendment. 62 The proposed amendment includes overpayments of Working for Families tax credits when the instalments have been determined to be overpaid and recoverable under sections MF 5 and MF 6 of the Income Tax Act 2007, or when the overpayment was by way of the taxpayer having their Working for Families tax credit entitlement later reviewed and reassessed. Background Currently, when a taxpayer has failed to pay their tax liability by the tax period’s due date, the taxpayer will incur late payment penalties, from the first day after the due date. The unpaid tax is imposed with an initial late payment penalty consisting of a 1% penalty one day after the due date, and another one-off 4% penalty seven days later. One month after, a 1% incremental late payment penalty will be imposed. This incremental late payment penalty will be imposed repeatedly each additional month the tax remains unpaid. As a result, the late payment penalties accrue incrementally and indefinitely thereafter. Use-of-money interest (UOMI) is also imposed from the day after the original due date. The longer the tax is outstanding, the more late payment penalties and UOMI are imposed. After two years, the combined penalties and UOMI can aggregate to more than 50 percent of the original tax owed. While late payment penalties encourage timely payment, there is a point at which the accumulated penalties and UOMI can overwhelm taxpayers. The proposed amendment to section 139B(2) means taxpayers who fail to pay their GST, Working for Families tax credit overpayment or income tax liability by the due date, for the described tax periods will continue to incur an initial late payment penalty and continue to incur UOMI. Many Working for Families tax credit recipients receive their entitlement in instalments throughout the year, based on an estimate. Sometimes that estimate is found to be inaccurate, resulting in the recipient receiving more than they are entitled to. These overpayments are treated as tax payable. Therefore, at the end of each tax year, after the due date, they incur late payment penalties and UOMI. Many recipients are on low incomes, and would struggle to repay debt that accumulates quickly due to the recurring imposition of the incremental late payment penalty. 63 DISCLOSING REPORTABLE UNPAID TAX TO CREDIT REPORTING AGENCIES (Clauses 103 and 104) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment to the tax secrecy rules will allow the Commissioner to disclose a taxpayer’s information and their significant tax debt to approved credit reporting agencies. Before the Commissioner of Inland Revenue can disclose the information, the Commissioner must determine that the taxpayer’s circumstances meet a prescribed criteria and threshold. Once the Commissioner has begun to disclose the taxpayer’s information, the Commissioner (in most circumstances) may continue to do so until the tax debt has been resolved. While the proposed amendment includes all taxpayers, currently the practical effect of this amendment is that it would be limited to non-individuals (that is, non-natural persons such as registered New Zealand companies). This is because personal information about individuals is regulated by the Credit Reporting Privacy Code of Practice (enabled by the Privacy Act). This code currently prevents credit reporters from receiving tax information about individuals. The Government’s intention is to apply this amendment to all taxpayers and officials will work with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner on the interaction of the proposed amendment and the Credit Reporting Privacy Code of Practice. Application date The amendment will come into force on 1 April 2017. Key features It is proposed that section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 be amended to introduce an exception to tax secrecy for the purpose of communicating certain taxpayer information to approved credit reporting agencies. In addition, it is proposed that new section 85N is inserted into the Tax Administration Act 1994 to describe items including the type of unpaid tax that would be considered for disclosure, the criteria that establishes whether a taxpayer would be selected for disclosure, the level of information the Commissioner would exchange and how the Commissioner would authorise an entity to receive this information. 64 For the purposes of the proposed section, the taxpayer must owe an amount of reportable unpaid tax. This is defined as an unpaid amount that is a liability or excess refund of income tax (excluding Working for Families tax credit overpayments), Goods and Services Tax and amounts required to be deducted under the Pay-As-You- Earn rules (including KiwiSaver, student loan and child support deductions, ESCT 3 and RSCT 4 ). These amounts would include any civil penalties and use-of-money interest already imposed. This definition would exclude amounts that are under dispute or challenge under the Tax Administration Act 1994. Before the Commissioner can consider initially disclosing the taxpayer’s information to an approved credit reporting agency, a set of requirements must be met. This criteria includes: • the reportable unpaid tax is not being considered for relief or remission, or included in an instalment arrangement; • that the taxpayer has been served a formal notice and at least 30 days have passed; and • the Commissioner has previously made reasonable efforts to collect the reportable unpaid tax. In addition, the taxpayer must owe the required quantum of reportable unpaid tax. This threshold is defined as owing a reportable unpaid tax amount of either $150,000 or the amount is more than a year old and the amount is more than 30 percent of the taxpayer’s gross income. The Commissioner would be required to serve the taxpayer personally, with a formal notice advising them of the amounts of reportable unpaid tax, and provide a 30-day notice period before deciding whether to disclose the taxpayer’s information. This notice would also include information about how the taxpayer can seek relief or remission of the debt. The Commissioner would not issue this notice unless she was confident the taxpayer would continue to meet the criteria and thresholds after the 30- day notice period. The purpose of this notice is to ensure that the taxpayer is made aware that the Commissioner is considering disclosing their information to an approved credit reporting agency. If the taxpayer is a company, the Commissioner would serve the notice on all directors listed with the Registrar of Companies. Under proposed subsection 85N(3), the Commissioner would also have the option to disclose the taxpayer’s information when the taxpayer has received three notices in a year, and the first two notices were ineffective due to the taxpayer subsequent to receiving the notice making sufficient payments to the reportable unpaid tax to remove themselves from the significant reportable unpaid tax threshold. This section is intended to address the potential issue of a taxpayer avoiding their reportable unpaid tax being disclosed, despite over time the amount of reportable unpaid tax debt continually exceeding the threshold. 3 Employer Superannuation Contribution Tax. 4 Retirement Scheme Contribution Tax. 65 Once the taxpayer’s circumstances have met or exceeded the criteria and threshold, the Commissioner may disclose taxpayer information to an approved credit reporting agency. Under subsection 85N(4), the Commissioner may communicate taxpayer information for the purposes of enabling the approved credit reporting agency to include the tax information on the credit report, and maintain the accuracy of the data held on the credit report. The Commissioner would disclose key elements about the taxpayer’s reportable unpaid tax. This includes the total amount outstanding for each tax type (expressed within a narrow band) and the age of each tax debt by tax type. Also, the status of the reportable unpaid tax as being under instalment arrangement, if the taxpayer enters into an arrangement subsequent to the initial disclosure. As part of including the debt information on the taxpayer’s credit report, the Commissioner would need to initially disclose certain taxpayer identification information to enable the approved credit reporting agency to match the taxpayer to their particular credit report. This information would be disclosed for identification and matching purposes only and would not be retained by the approved credit reporting agency after its use. After the initial disclosure, to maintain the accuracy of the debt information on the credit report, the Commissioner would continue to routinely disclose the current tax debt informat ion. This includes when the amount outstanding falls below the significant reportable unpaid tax threshold, when the taxpayer has submitted an application for relief or remission, or has entered into an instalment arrangement. This subsection is to address the issue that if the Commissioner was to abruptly stop disclosing this information, the last transaction held would quickly become inaccurate. In addition, the Commissioner may need to disclose taxpayer information for the purpose of evidencing the information held on the credit report. This is because if the taxpayer were to lay a formal complaint with the approved credit reporting agency about the information held about them, the agency may need to approach Inland Revenue and request the taxpayer’s information to support the investigation of the complaint. This may include information that substantiates the reportable unpaid tax debt or that shows the taxpayer was made aware that their debt could be disclosed. Under subsection 85N(8) and (9), the Commissioner would have authority to approve an appropriate organisation to become an approved credit reporting agency. The Commissioner would either grant or revoke the approval when it would positively affect the integrity of the tax system. An approval would be given after the Commissioner is satisfied that the organisation has the capable systems, processes and safeguards to appropriately handle any taxpayer information furnished by the Commissioner to the organisation. Likewise, an approved credit reporting agency could choose to no longer receive this information and duly notify the Commissioner and request that their approval be revoked. Any approval or revocation would be publicly notified. 66 Under section 85N(7), the Commissioner is required to annually publish the number of taxpayers who have been subject to action under this provision in the previous year, including the number of taxpayers served and the number of taxpayers who have had their information disclosed, as well as any other items relating to this section the Commissioner considers should be published. Background Currently, information about a taxpayer’s tax debt is subject to the rule in section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 that requires Inland Revenue officers to keep secret all matters relating to the Inland Revenue Acts. The Commissioner is therefore unable to disclose this information to third parties unless an exception to the secrecy rule exists. The proposed amendment inserts an exception to these secrecy rules. The proposed amendment will likely have a positive revenue benefit to the Crown, as potentially affected taxpayers will likely to be reluctant to have their tax debt information disclosed to their creditors. Consequently, the potential action of disclosure may motivate some taxpayers to promptly resolve their tax debt and voluntarily comply with their tax obligations. Through this disclosure, other businesses will become aware of some taxpayers owing a significant amount of tax debt, and consequently these businesses will receive a more comprehensive view of the taxpayer’s financial position when they are making important commercial decisions. Whether the debt is enforced by the Commissioner or another trade creditor, the consequences for the indebted business’s other creditors are the same. If Inland Revenue recovers its tax debt, there are fewer funds to repay other creditors. If Inland Revenue enforces its tax debt, the possible wind up of the indebted business affects all creditors. For creditors of a tax-indebted business, unpaid tax debt can represent a similar risk as if the debt was owed to another trade creditor. In order for businesses to operate, they must regularly enter into commercial arrangements with other businesses. These relationships can bring a certain level of risk. To help mitigate this risk, prudent businesses undertake risk assessments of potential or existing commercial partners, including determining how much debt their potential commercial partner may owe to others. Businesses use this information to help determine whether they are comfortable with the level of risk attached to the commercial partner. The impact of tax secrecy is that these other businesses that regularly assess the creditworthiness of potential commercial partners are currently unaware of the existence of any tax debt, with some only becoming aware later on when Inland Revenue is enforcing the debt. When the amount of tax debt is significant compared with the size of the business, the impact can be severe. 67 The proposed amendment represents a trade-off between taxpayer secrecy and reducing the opportunity for compliant businesses to be unexpectedly trading with significantly tax-indebted taxpayers. Certain credit reporters (approved credit reporting agencies) would be provided with limited taxpayer information, so the approved credit reporting agencies could provide this information to potentially affected third parties. This exchange is so only requesting third parties that are undertaking related commercial activities will be aware of the tax debt, and consequently these third parties can use this information to help make better commercial decisions. This approach is considered a less intrusive method of achieving the desired outcome than general publication of the tax debtor information. Credit reporters are the best vehicle to deliver this information to potentially affected third parties, given that the credit reporters already have established processes, safeguards and mechanisms to ensure that any confidential information and data is carefully managed. Memoranda of Understanding would be entered into with the approved credit reporting agencies. These agreements would outline the mechanism for securely exchanging taxpayer information, secure information storage, appropriate access by agency staff, and a requirement that approved credit reporting agencies can only hold disclosed tax debt information for five years after the last update placed onto the credit report. This last detail is important as it represents a trade-off between a business’s needs to understand a taxpayer’s credit worthiness, with the taxpayer resolving their reportable unpaid tax and remaining compliant. These items would be further discussed with the approved credit reporting agencies and confirmed in the contractual agreements. Following enactment, Inland Revenue would implement this policy in a phased approach. In the next few years, the Commissioner would disclose approximately 500 taxpayers a year. This will allow Inland Revenue to firmly establish robust processes and mechanisms while working with modest volumes. In the future, once the Commissioner has a better understanding of the effect of the policy, and having regard for future technology, the Commissioner’s resources and the anticipated behavioural change as a consequence of this policy, the Commissioner may then consider whether, in the long run, these volumes should be revised. The proposed amendment provides the Commissioner with a proportionate response to the risk that significant reportable unpaid tax has on the wider business community. Where the debt is in the process of being reasonably resolved or is a proportionally small amount, the risk to other businesses is also reduced, so disclosing this information to others would not be considered to outweigh the importance of keeping taxpayer information confidential. In addition to contributing to economic efficiency, the proposed section will potentially incentivise taxpayers to comply with their tax obligations. In exercising the proposed discretion the Commissioner will, as is the usual course, have regard to her obligation to protect the integrity of the tax system. 68 Detailed analysis Proposed section 85N outlines the required quantum of outstanding reportable unpaid tax, in order for the taxpayer to be considered for disclosure, and when the Commissioner would consider initially disclosing the taxpayer’s information to an approved credit reporting agency. Significant reportable unpaid tax threshold Before the taxpayer’s information can be considered for disclosure, the taxpayer must first owe the required quantum of reportable unpaid tax. The required quantum is the greater of either: • $150,000 and there is a significant risk that the taxpayer is unable to pay this amount; or • the unpaid amount has been outstanding for more than a year, and the proportion of the unpaid amount exceeds the taxpayer’s annual gross income for the previous year by 30 percent or more. The first threshold would allow the Commissioner to disclose reportable unpaid tax that is significant in size. To provide some proportionalit y, the Commissioner would only consider cases where the taxpayer does not have the financial ability to resolve the debt in the foreseeable future. The proposed provision allows for a different amount to be prescribed by an Order in Council. This flexibility is required to ensure this part of the threshold can be quickly amended if there is a sudden change in the market, and that change would need to be reflected in a revised threshold. The usual Order in Council safeguards would apply, including the 28-day rule and publication. The second threshold would allow the Commissioner to consider taxpayers when the debt is significant in relation to the size of the taxpayer and has been unpaid for some time. To determine the taxpayer’s annual gross income, the Commissioner will exercise judgement and use available information (including previously filed tax returns and other financial information) to reasonably determine the taxpayer’s gross income for the previous year. A natural consequence of using the second threshold is that others may be able to indicatively determine the taxpayer’s gross income. The benefit of using this type of threshold is that it can be reasonably targeted towards taxpayers that owe an amount of reportable unpaid tax that is sufficiently significant, compared with the size of their business. This benefit is considered to outweigh the risk. The inclusion of percentage and fixed dollar thresholds would allow disclosure only in the most significant of circumstances, given the particular taxpayer’s debt and the risk the debt represents to other businesses. 69 Criteria for initial disclosure The proposed section requires the taxpayer to owe the required quantum of reportable unpaid tax as well as meet other criteria before the Commissioner can consider initially disclosing the taxpayer’s information. Under section 85N(2)(c), the Commissioner would only disclose the taxpayer’s information when the Commissioner has already made reasonable efforts to recover the reportable unpaid tax. These reasonable efforts include when the Commissioner has been in recent, meaningful and sustained communication with the taxpayer. These actions would also include when both Inland Revenue and the taxpayer have explored various options to resolve the reportable unpaid tax, without success. These options could include Inland Revenue reviewing the taxpayer’s financial position to determine whether the taxpayer is eligible for relief or when the taxpayer has explored financing options with third-party lenders, without success. The formal notice would only be issued when the Commissioner is confident that the taxpayer’s circumstances meet the criteria and threshold, and when the Commissioner is confident that the taxpayer would continue to meet the criteria and threshold at the end of the 30-day period. In addition, immediately before the Commissioner initially discloses the taxpayer’s information, the Commissioner will review the taxpayer’s circumstances to ensure that the taxpayer continues to meet the criteria and threshold. When the taxpayer is in the process of securing finance, or is conducting an ordinary windup of their business, and the Commissioner is confident that it will be successful, these actions would be considered ongoing reasonable efforts. The Co mmissio ner would be responsible for ensuring the criteria and thresholds are applied consistently. Example Bary’s Bricks Limited has over-expanded in recent years and is experiencing significant cashflow problems. With late payment penalties and use-of-money interest, the tax debt of GST and PAYE has grown to over $65,000. Over the last 15 months, Inland Revenue has worked with the directors to try and resolve the debt; this has included repeatedly talking to the directors to arrange an instalment arrangement or borrow funds to settle the debt. The company’s other creditors are likely to be unaware of the tax debt and may be considering extending their lending or trade credit to the company, to fund further expansion of the company believing that it can be sustainably repaid. The Commissioner is considering disclosing the taxpayer’s tax debt to the approved credit reporting agencies so other creditors are made aware of the debt and will be able to make more informed commercial decisions. The debt is reportable unpaid tax as it consists of GST and PAYE that is not being disputed, not under arrangement and the Commissioner is not considering an application for relief or remission. Inland Revenue has made reasonable efforts to resolve the tax debt. The tax debt meets the significant reportable unpaid tax threshold as the company’s annual gross income is only $150,000, giving a percentage of 43 percent. The directors are personally served the formal notice, giving the company 30 days to attempt to resolve the debt. After 30 days, the company’s circumstances remain unchanged. Inland Revenue subsequently discloses the taxpayer’s information to approved credit reporting agencies. The Commissioner continues to periodically disclose the taxpayer’s tax debt information in order to maintain the accuracy of the information contained in the credit report. 70 INFORMATION SHARING WITH THE REGISTRAR OF COMPANIES (Clauses 103 and 104) Summary of proposed amendment Amendments to the tax secrecy rules are proposed to enable Inland Revenue to share information with the Registrar of Companies, for the purpose of enforcing certain serious offences against the Companies Act 1993. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2017. Key features The amendments will allow Inland Revenue to share information with the Registrar of Companies in relation to several serious offences against the Companies Act, including: • a serious breach of a director’s duty to act in good faith and in the best interests of company (section 183A(1)); • false statements (section 377); • breaches of various orders and prohibitions from directing, promoting and/or managing companies (section 382(4), section 383(6), section 385(9), and section 385AA(9)); • breach of restrictions on involvement with phoenix companies (section 386A(2). These offences are punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to five years, or a fine of up to $200,000. These particular offences were considered to be the most appropriate (in terms of both seriousness and potential benefits of obtaining Inland Revenue information) by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, the Companies Office and Inland Revenue. The amendments will provide the Commissioner of Inland Revenue with the discretion to share information relating to these offences when: • either agency reasonably suspects the offence has been, is being, or will be committed; and • the Commissioner considers the information is relevant to the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of the offence; and 71 • the Commissioner is satisfied the information is readily available, is reasonable and practicable to communicate, and that communication is in the public interest. Background The Companies Office oversees important regulatory requirements which ensure business accountability and responsibility. It aims to promote confidence in the New Zealand business environment and hold to account those who abuse the privileges of the corporate structure. The Registrar of Companies is responsible for administering the Companies Act, and has the power to collect information to verify compliance and detect breaches of the Act. In the course of its regular activities Inland Revenue will, on occasion, hold information that would assist in the detection and enforcement of serious offences against the Companies Act. Tax secrecy obligations contained in the Tax Administration Act 1994 are broad, covering all matters relating to legislation administered by Inland Revenue. Communication of these matters is not normally permitted other than for the purpose of carrying into effect that legislation. While a number of exceptions have developed for cross-agency information sharing to support wider government objectives, there are no exceptions that would allow Inland Revenue to share the information described above with the Registrar of Companies. Information sharing under the new amendments will allo w more efficient enforcement of the Companies Act, and help prevent harm to the business community and wider public that stems from seriously non-compliant directors and other persons breaching their corporate responsibilities. 72 MOTOR VEHICLE EXPENDITURE OF CLOSE COMPANIES (Clauses 56, 58, 59, 60, 61, 63 and 64) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment will extend the motor vehicle expenditure rules in subpart DE of the Income Tax Act 2007. Currently sole traders and partnerships can use these rules to measure the business use of a motor vehicle. The proportion of business use of a motor vehicle is used to calculate the amount of the deduction for motor vehicle expenditure. These rules are being extended to allow certain close companies to use these rules as an alternative to paying FBT on a motor vehicle benefit provided to shareholder-emplo yees. Currently close companies who provide a motor vehicle for the private use of shareholder-employees are required to register and pay FBT on the value of the benefit provided. The value is based on the availability of the motor vehicle rather than the actual private use by the shareholder-employee. This approach can result in compliance costs being higher then they need be for these close companies as they are required to register and pay FBT. The proposed amendment allows certain close companies to elect to use the motor vehicle expenditure rules instead of paying FBT on the value of the benefit provided to shareholder-emplo yees. Application date The amendment will apply for the 2017–18 and later income years. Key features The proposed amendment provides an alternative to FBT for certain close companies by inserting a new exclusion into section CX 17. Section CX 17 is the section in the FBT rules that deals with benefits provided to shareholder-employees. Under the proposed new exclusion, section CX 17 will not apply when the close company makes a motor vehicle available to a shareholder-employee for their private use and elects to apply subpart DE for the motor vehicle and the shareholder-employee. The election will apply only to new motor vehicle arrangements between close companies and shareholder-emplo yees, and will continue to apply until the close company stops using the motor vehicle for business use or until the close company disposes of the motor vehicle. The proposed amendment applies to close companies where the only fringe benefit provided is the provision of one or two motor vehicles to shareholder-emplo yees for their private use. These close companies qualify for the close company FBT option in section RD 60 and consequently may be filing and paying FBT annually. If they elect to apply the proposed motor vehicle expenditure rules, the close company will not be required to account for FBT on the benefit provided to their shareholder-emplo yees. 73 Under the proposed amendment, when a close company has made the appropriate elect ion, it will apply the motor vehicle expenditure rules in subpart DE. Subpart DE provides methods for calculating the proportion of business use of a motor vehicle. This proportion forms the basis for the amount of motor vehicle expenditure that can be deducted. Section DE 1 is being amended to enable a close company who makes an election under section CX 17 to use the methods in subpart DE to measure the business use of the motor vehicle by its shareholder-employee. The close company will use the proportion of business use by the shareholder-employee to calculate the amount of their deduction for motor vehicle expenditure. Section DE 2 is being amended to include interest on amounts used to fund, directly or indirectly, the business of a motor vehicle as part of the motor vehicle expenditure subject to the rules in subpart DE. This amendment applies only to close companies that have elected to use the motor vehicle rules in subpart DE and is needed because of the automatic interest deduction rules for companies in sections DB 7 and DB 8. These sections are also being amended consequentially. When a close company uses this proposed new option and transfers the value of the private non-deductible portion of the motor vehicle expenditure to the shareholder- emplo yee – for example, by debiting their shareholder current account, the value of the private use of the motor vehicle by the shareholder-emplo yee will not be a dividend. Proposed changes to section CD 32 account for this. In some circumstances a GST adjustment may be required to reflect any difference between the actual proportions of business and private use of the motor vehicle and the intended proportions of business and private use of the motor vehicle. Example Mary is the controlling shareholder of Mary’s Home Interiors Ltd which has a 31 March balance date. Mary’s Home Interiors Ltd is a close company. Mary is the only employee of her company. On 1 April 2016, the company provides Mary with a new vehicle for both business and unlimited private use. During the 2017 income year, it is expected that Mary’s business use of the vehicle will be 60 percent and the total motor vehicle expenditure for the year is estimated to be $4,250. This includes an amount of interest on the loan that the company used to finance the cost of acquiring the new vehicle. The cost price of the vehicle was $20,000. The company will have the choice of paying FBT on the availability for private use of the vehicle using the cost price of the vehicle as a basis and multiplying by 20% to get the value of the fringe benefit ($4,000) and pay FBT of $1,970. Alternatively, the company could make an election under amended section CX 17(4B) to use the motor vehicle expenditure rules in subpart DE. The company could use the proportion of business use of the vehicle by Mary to apportion the motor vehicle expenditure. Mary maintains a logbook where she records details of her business use of the vehicle. This would result in the business not claiming 40 percent of the total motor vehicle expenditure of $4,250 ($1,700). At end of the income year, a debit entry is made to Mary’s current account for the value of the motor vehicle expenditure that relates to Mary’s private use of the motor vehicle. If the company uses the logbook records to estimate the percentage of intended use and actual use of the motor vehicle for GST purposes, no GST change of use adjustments should be required. 74 Background Close companies that provide their shareholder-employees with a motor vehicle for private use are required to register and pay FBT for that benefit, subject to certain exemptions. Sole traders and partners in a partnership who use a motor vehicle in a similar way are not required to register and pay FBT. Instead these taxpayers apportion their motor vehicle expenditure between business and private use under the motor vehicle expenditure rules in subpart DE. These differences in treatment for what is essentially the same benefit (the private use of a motor vehicle) arise because of the different entities involved. The proposed amendment provides an option for certain close companies to elect to have the same treatment as sole traders and partnerships. Conceptually, denying deductions for private expenditure should have a comparable overall tax outcome for the shareholder-employees to allowing deductions and applying FBT to the value of the benefit, once attribution of profits is taken into account. This is why the proposed change will not apply to motor vehicle benefits provided to those who are just employees of close companies. 75 INCREASED THRESHOLD FOR TAXPAYER SELF-CORRECTIONS OF MINOR ERRORS (Clause 105) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment increases the self-correction threshold for minor errors from $500 to $1,000. This will allow taxpayers to correct simple errors of up to $1,000 in their next tax return. Application date The proposed amendment will come into force on 1 April 2017. Key features Section 113A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows a taxpayer to self-correct a minor error in a tax return if the tax difference is below the specified threshold. The error is corrected by the taxpayer making the appropriate adjustment in their next tax return. The proposed amendment increases the threshold for self-correction from $500 to $1,000 and is intended to reduce compliance and administrative costs. Background Currently if a taxpayer makes a minor error in their tax return with a tax effect of less than $500, they can self-correct the error in their next tax return. However, if the error results in more than a $500 tax difference, the taxpayer must request the Commissioner to correct the error. Interest and penalties will usually be payable on the shortfall corrected by the Commissioner. The proposed amendment will remove the compliance costs of having to apply to the Commissioner for an adjustment for minor errors resulting in less than a $1,000 tax difference. It will also reduce the administration costs, as Inland Revenue will not have to manage these low-value items. 76 SIMPLIFIED CALCULATION OF DEDUCTIONS FOR DUAL USE VEHICLES AND PREMISES (Clauses 62, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68 and 71) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment allows taxpayers to use a simplified method for the calculation of deductions for premises and vehicles that are used for both business and personal purposes. This will reduce compliance costs for taxpayers. Application date The proposed amendment will apply for the 2017–18 and later income years. Key features Vehicles Subpart DE of the Income Tax Act 2007 is being amended to modify and extend the current per kilometre rate method for determining a taxpayer’s deductions for a vehicle used for both business and private purposes (the current rules only allow the method to be used if the business use is less than 5,000 km). Under the modified per kilometre method in section DE 12, taxpayers will deduct a fixed amount per kilometre travelled for business purposes based on rates published by Inland Revenue. This is instead of deducting any actual costs. The rates will be: • set by reference to industry figures, and based on the average per kilometre cost for the average vehicle; • divided into 2 tiers. The first tier will provide for the recovery of both the vehicle’s fixed costs and its per kilometre costs. The second tier will provide for the recovery of the per kilometre costs only (as the fixed costs of vehicle ownership would be over-deducted with increasing usage if a single fixed rate were used); and • published by Inland Revenue and updated each year to ensure the rates are accurate. The first tier of rates will apply to the total distance travelled (including for both business and personal purposes) up to a specified limit. To calculate the deduction for this tier, taxpayers will multiply the total kilometres travelled (to which the first tier applies) by the proportion of business use for the vehicle and the income year. The product of that calculation will then be multiplied by the rate for the first tier to produce the deductible amount. 77 The calculation will be repeated for the second tier of rates. That is, the total kilometres travelled (to which the second tier of rates applies) will be multiplied by the proportion of business use for the vehicle and the income year. The product of this calculation is then multiplied by the rate for the second tier to give the deductible amount. The deductible amounts for the first and second tiers of rates are then added together to determine the taxpayer’s total deduction for their business use of the vehicle. Under the existing legislation, taxpayers may keep a logbook for a three-mont h representative test period to determine a vehicle’s proportion of business use for the next three years. The new method is optional, and taxpayers may elect to use it on a per-vehicle basis. However any election must be made when the tax return is filed for the year in which the vehicle is acquired. The election is non-revocable, so taxpayers cannot switch between methods for the same vehicle (although they may apply different methods to different vehicles). This is because it would be too complex to account for depreciation if a taxpayer switched methods, given that separate depreciation deductions are not claimed under the new method and no depreciation recovery income arises on sale. Taxpayers who own a vehicle which they use partly for business purposes may switch to the new method for the 2017–18 income year, when the new method is introduced. This is provided they do not dispose of the vehicle in that income year. Amendments to subpart DE and section EE 49 are also proposed, to clarify some aspects of how the per kilometre method is intended to operate. Example 1 Mr Smith is a real estate agent who uses his personal car for business purposes. Mr Smith buys a new car and elects to use the per kilometre method to calculate his deductions when he files his tax return. Mr Smith has kept a log book for the first three months of the year, which shows a proportion of business to total kilometres of 0.55. Over the entire year Mr Smith has driven 30,000km. The rates that Inland Revenue has published are 75 cents per km for the first 10,000km and 25 cents for every km thereafter (these rates are indicative only). Mr Smith needs to calculate his deductions for each tier of rates, and then add them together. The formula to calculate his deductions for each tier is: Total kilometres travelled (to which the tier applies) x business proportion x tier rate Applying this formula, Mr Smith makes the following calculations: First tier: 10,000 km x 0.55 business use x $0.75/km = $4,125 Second tier: (30,000 total km – 10,000km) x 0.55 business use x $0.25/km = $2,750 Adding the results for each tier together gives $4,125 + 2750 = $6,875. Therefore Mr Smith can claim deductions of $6,875. 78 Premises The proposed amendment inserts a new section DB 18AA into the Income Tax Act 2007. The proposed new section provides an optional alternative method for calculating the deduction for premises that are used for both business and personal purposes. The “premises” for this purpose includes only the relevant building and not any curtilage. The new method first requires the taxpayer to determine the area of their building (in square metres) that is both separately identifiable and used primarily for business purposes. This area is then multiplied by a single rate to give the first amount of the deduction. The rate will be: • set by Inland Revenue, based on the average cost of utilities per square metre of housing, but excluding mortgage interest and rates or rent; • updated each year; and • reasonably accurate for most taxpayers. Taxpayers using this proposed new method will be able to claim a second deduction for their actual mortgage interest and rates or rental costs. This second deduction is calculated by multiplying the amount of these actual costs by the fraction of the premises that is both separately identifiable and used primarily for business purposes. The reason this deduction is calculated separately is because mortgage interest, rates and rental costs are too variable to be included in a single representative rate. No other deduction in relation to the premises is permitted for taxpayers who use this method. Taxpayers may elect to use the proposed new method for an income year by using it to calculate their deductions in their income tax return. There are no restrictions on the ability of a taxpayer to choose the method. Example 2 Mr Smith has a room in his house which is set aside as an office. Mr Smith uses the office primarily for business purposes. Mr Smith decides to calculate his deductions for this office using the new method. The office has an area of 10m 2 , while Mr Smith’s house has an area of 100m 2 . Inland Revenue has set the fixed rate for premises at $100/m 2 (this amount is indicative only). Mr Smith calculates his first deduction using the fixed rate. To do this he simply multiplies the area of his office (in square metres) by the fixed rate. Accordingly, Mr Smith’s first deduction is: 10m 2 x $100/m 2 = $1,000. Mr Smith next calculates his second deduction for his mortgage interest and rates (as Mr Smith owns his house). To do this, he calculates the fraction of his house occupied by his office. He then multiplies his actual mortgage and interest costs by that fraction. The fraction of Mr Smith’s house that is occupied by his office is: 10m 2 office ÷ 100m 2 house = 0.10 (or 10%). Mr Smith’s mortgage interest for the year is $20,000 and his rates are $3,000. Therefore Mr Smith’s second deduction is: ($20,000 + $3,000) x 0.10 office fraction = $2,300. Adding the two deductions together, Mr Smith has a total deduction for his office of $1,000 + $2,300 = $3,300. Accordingly he can claim a deduction for his home office of $3,300. 79 Background Small business owners often use their vehicles and premises for both business and private purposes. This can create a large compliance obligation compared with the amount of tax at stake, as there are numerous expenses for these items, all of which must be recorded and apportioned between business and personal use. The proposed amendment will simplify taxpayers’ compliance obligations for these items. 80 REMOVE THE REQUIREMENT TO RENEW RWT EXEMPTION CERTIFICATES ANNUALLY (Clause 101) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment to section 32H of the Taxation Administration Act 1994 will legislatively require most resident withho lding tax (RWT) exemption certificates to be issued for an unlimited period. This will remove the compliance costs of having to reapply for RWT exemption certificates. Application date The proposed amendment will come into force on 1 April 2017. Key features RWT exemption certificates will be required to be issued for an unlimited period. This will apply for all the available grounds of exemption, except for the taxpayer income estimation option (in section 32E(2)(j) of the Tax Administration Act 1994). Inland Revenue will still have the discretion to issue exemption certificates for a limited period in exceptional circumstances. Background Currently some taxpayers who hold a certificate of exemption from RWT must renew the certificate annually. 5 This was an operational decision made by Inland Revenue. Taxpayers have argued that this is creating relatively large compliance costs for those required to renew for relatively little value. It is also creating an administrative burden for Inland Revenue, as all the annual exemption certificates must be renewed at the same time each year. The proposed amendment will reduce these compliance and administrative costs. Taxpayers will still be required to surrender their exemption certificates when they fail to meet the basis for eligibility on which they were granted. Inland Revenue will also retain its ability to cancel an exemption certificate. Taxpayers will also be required to indicate in their income tax returns for the 2017–18 and later tax years whether they are still eligible to hold their exemption certificates on the basis on which they were granted. 5 Annual renewal is currently required by Inland Revenue if the applicant is applying for a RWT exemption certificate on the grounds that it has tax losses, a refund of over $500 RWT or estimated annual gross income of over $2 million. Applications on other grounds (such as annual gross income over $2 million in the prior year) do not require annual renewal. 81 INCREASED THRESHOLD FOR ANNUAL FBT RETURNS FROM $500,000 TO $1 MILLION OF PAYE/ESCT (Clauses 90 and 91) Summary of proposed amendment The bill proposes that the threshold for calculating and returning FBT on an annual basis be increased from $500,000 to $1 million of PAYE/ESCT. This will reduce compliance costs for taxpayers. Application date The proposed amendment will apply for the 2017–18 and later income years. Key features Proposed amendments to sections RD 60 and RD 61 of the Income Tax Act 2007 will increase the threshold for calculating and returning FBT on an annual basis. The new threshold will be $1 million of gross tax for PAYE income payments and employers’ superannuation cash contributions withheld under sections RA 5(1)(a) and (c). Background Most businesses are required to calculate and return FBT on a quarterly basis. However businesses that have combined PAYE and ESCT obligations of no more than $500,000 per year are currently allowed to calculate and return FBT on an annual basis. As a smaller business becomes larger and employs more staff, it may exceed the $500,000 threshold. Consequently the business will be required to calculate and pay FBT on a quarterly basis. This can impose compliance costs that are still significant compared with the size of the business. Allowing a business with combined PAYE and ESCT of between $500,000 and $1 million to continue accounting for FBT annually will simplify its compliance obligations and lower compliance costs. It will also simplify administration, as there will be fewer FBT returns for Inland Revenue to process. 82 MODIFYING THE 63-DAY RULE ON EMPLOYEE REMUNERATION (Clause 70) Summary of proposed amendment The proposal will allow taxpayers to choose whether to apply the existing rule in section EA 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007 for the timing of the deduction for an amount of expenditure on employment income paid within 63 days after the end of the income year. If a taxpayer chooses not to apply the existing rule, they can deduct expenditure on employment income that is paid in that income year. Application date The proposed amendment will apply for the 2017–18 and later income years. Key features Section EA 4 is being amended to provide taxpayers who incur expenditure on employment income a choice over what basis they calculate the amount of the deduction claimed in an income year. Taxpayers who wish to continue using the existing 63-day rule can still claim a deduction for amounts of expenditure on employment income paid within 63 days of the end of the income year. Taxpayers who do not wish to incur the compliance cost involved with tracking payments paid within 63 days of the end of the income year can claim a deduction for expenditure on employment income paid within the income year. Background Under the existing rule in section EA 4, all taxpayers need to track payments of expenditure on employment income paid within 63 days of the end of the income year. This requirement results in increased compliance costs for taxpayers because they need to track and determine these amounts. The proposed amendment removes the compliance costs for taxpayers who do not wish to track payments of expenditure of employment income paid within 63 days of the end of the income year. These taxpayers will be allowed a deduction for amounts of expenditure on employment income paid in that income year. 83 84 Automatic exchange of information 85 86 OVERVIEW (Clauses 4, 6, 8, 9 and 12 to 26) The bill proposes the legislative amendments needed to implement the G20/OECD standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters (the Automatic Exchange of Information or “AEOI”) in New Zealand. The AEOI standard was developed as part of a global initiative to address offshore tax evasion. That is, evading tax by hiding wealth in offshore accounts. The AEOI standard Broadly, jurisdictions implementing the AEOI standard must impose obligations on their financial inst itutions: • to conduct specified due diligence procedures in relation to their financial accounts to identify those held or (in certain circumstances) 6 controlled by non- residents; and • to report specified identity (including tax residence) and financial information (such as account balances and interest earned) on those accounts to their local tax administration. The tax administrations must then transmit the reported information to applicable jurisdictions under tax treaty exchange of information provisions. The exchanged information will be used by the receiving jurisdiction to verify that its residents have correctly reported their offshore activities and income for tax purposes. International context The exchanged information will be used to detect offshore tax evasion. Worldwide implementation of the AEOI standard is also expected to have a strong deterrent effect on offshore evasion. However, the success of the global AEOI initiative depends on jurisdictions implementing consistent rules, on a similar implementation timeline. Otherwise there is a high risk of the offshore tax evasion problem relocating to jurisdictions that lag behind or implement to a lesser standard. 6 As explained below, a “look-through” rule applies in the case of entity accounts that meet the criteria of a “Passive NFE”. 87 To ensure consistency, the OECD’s global tax body, the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes (Global Forum), will lead peer reviews and other forms of monitoring to ensure that jurisdictions correctly implement the AEOI standard. The Global Forum reports directly to the G20, which is positioned to apply sanctions against non-complying jurisdictions, if necessary. All G20 and OECD member countries are required to implement the AEOI standard with a view to completing first exchanges by 30 September 2018 at the latest. Any other jurisdiction that has or that operates as an international finance centre is required to implement the AEOI standard to the same timeline. In total, 101 jurisdictions are currently subject to the 30 September 2018 deadline. Jurisdictions other than those identified above can implement the AEOI standard, but will not be subject to implementation deadlines (unless identified by the Global Forum as an emerging tax risk). Of the 101 jurisdictions, 55 have committed to complete their first exchanges by 30 September 2017 (a year ahead of the general deadline). These are generally referred to as “early adopters”. The 46 other jurisdictions are generally referred to as “second wave adopters”. As an OECD member country, the New Zealand Government has committed to meeting the 30 September 2018 deadline. New Zealand is a second wave adopter. The start date to which the New Zealand Government has committed, and from which obligations under the AEOI standard will apply in New Zealand, is 1 July 2017. Key elements of the AEOI standard The rules for due diligence and reporting that are to be imposed on financial institutions are set out in an element of the AEOI standard known as the Common Standard on Reporting and Due Diligence for Financial Account Information (Common Reporting Standard). The Common Reporting Standard is supplemented with an official commentary, developed by the OECD (the OECD Commentary) to ensure consistent interpretation and application of the rules. The other elements of the AEOI standard relate to the exchange of AEOI informat io n between jurisdictions, and include model competent authority agreements and the data schema to be used for exchanges. A common IT solution for encrypting and transmitting data between jurisdictions, referred to as the “Common Transmission Standard”, is also being developed by the OECD. All exchanges of information with other jurisdictions will be made under New Zealand’s tax treaties. 88 The prinicpal tax treaty to be used for this purpose will be the jo int OECD/Council of Europe Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (the Multilateral Convent ion), 7 which New Zealand signed in 2012. As the legislation primarily concerns the implementation of the Common Reporting Standard, references in this document will be to the Common Reporting Standard (and OECD Commentary) rather than the AEOI standard. The Multilateral Convention authorises automatic exchanges of information, subject to detailed terms to be agreed between competent authorities. (Broadly, “competent authorities” are persons nominated to administer treaty provisions. The competent authority under New Zealand’s tax treaties is the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or an authorised representative.) To facilitate automatic exchanges of financial account information under the Mult ilateral Convent ion, the OECD developed a Mult ilateral Co mpetent Authorit y Agreement (MCAA) 8 . New Zealand signed the MCAA in 2015. Summary of proposed amendments The legislation proposed will enable New Zealand to give effect to the New Zealand Government’s international commitment to implement the Common Reporting Standard, and has been framed to reflect the following policy decisions: • The New Zealand reporting period for Common Reporting Standard purposes will align with the New Zealand tax year (that is, the period ending 31 March). • The annual reporting deadline for financial institutions for each reporting period will be the following 30 June. The information that must be reported in relation to each account in relation to each reporting period is: – identity information (including tax residence) of the account holders and (where applicable) controlling persons; and – financial information, including the account balance or value as at the end of the reporting period, and defined income earned and distributions made during the reporting period. – If a financial institution is unable to determine the status of a pre-existing account 9 it will be required to report the account as an “undocumented account” in certain circumstances. 7 Referred to as “MCMAA convention” in the bill. 8 Referred to as “MCA agreement” in the bill. 9 In broad terms, a pre-existing account will be an account in existence as of 30 June 2017. 89 • From 1 July 2017, financial institutions will be required to apply the specified due diligence procedures for all new accounts. 10 – This will generally involve determining the identity and tax residence o f account holders and (where applicable) controlling persons, on the basis of self-certifications obtained on account opening. • From 1 July 2017, financial institutions will be expected to begin due diligence reviews of all pre-existing accounts. – The due diligence procedures specified in the Common Reporting Standard for pre-existing accounts differ, depending on the status of the account. In general, however, financial institutions will often be able to rely on documentation/information that they have already obtained for regulatory or customer relationship purposes. 11 • The due diligence for pre-existing individual accounts that are high value accounts (generally, accounts with an account balance exceeding US$1 million) is to be completed by 30 June 2018, taking into account the following: – The period between 1 April 2018 and 30 June 2018 is effectively a three- month grace period. – Given the 1 July 2017 start date, the grace period will effectively allow financial institutions 12 months to complete their due diligence reviews of high value accounts. – Importantly, any high value accounts identified as reportable during the grace period must be reported with respect to the reporting period of 1 July 2017 to 31 March 2018. – The due diligence and reporting must also both be completed by the 30 June 2018 deadline. • The due diligence for all other pre-existing accounts (that is, pre-existing individual accounts that are lower value accounts, and pre-existing entit y accounts) is to be completed by 30 June 2019, taking into account the following: – The period between 1 April 2019 and 30 June 2019 is effectively a three- month grace period. – Given the 1 July 2017 start date, the grace period will effectively allow financial institutions 24 months to complete their due diligence reviews of accounts other than high value accounts. – Importantly any entity or lower value accounts identified as reportable during the grace period must be reported with respect to the reporting period of 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019. 10 In broad terms, a new account will be an account opened on or after 1 July 2017. 11 In particular, this includes information obtained from compliance with Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism “know-your-customer” laws. 90 – The due diligence and reporting must also both be completed by the 30 June 2019 deadline. • Some optionality is contemplated under the Common Reporting Standard and OECD Commentary. Financial institutions will generally be allowed at their discretion to adopt the option that best suits their circumstances. • However, the option of a reporting period ending 31 March will be mandated for all financial institutions. In addition, the use of the “wider approach” to due diligence will be mandated for all financial institutions. These matters, including an explanation of the wider approach, are addressed further below. • There are also some options that will be withheld. These excluded options are also addressed further below. • The Common Reporting Standard requires implementing jurisdictions to introduce rules for ensuring compliance. These include a requirement for anti- avoidance rules and effective sanctions. Therefore, the proposed legislation includes a compliance framework with penalties and an anti-avoidance rule. • This compliance framework will cover financial institutions and also extend to cover other persons and entities that hold or control accounts with such institutions or that otherwise act as intermediaries in relation to accounts. This reflects the fact that effective implementation of the Common Reporting Standard in New Zealand requires a chain of information effectively flowing from account holders, controlling persons, and intermediaries to financial institutions and then to Inland Revenue. These information flows, if effective, will ensure that Inland Revenue obtains the information about foreign tax residents that New Zealand is required to exchange for AEOI purposes. Application dates The legislation proposed in this bill to section BH 1, clarifying that the section applies in the case of multilateral treaties, will have retrospective application beginning on 21 October 2013. As explained below, this is to put beyond doubt that section BH 1 can apply to multilateral treaties (despite wording that, on the face of it, suggests it only applies to bilateral treaties). Otherwise, the legislative amendments proposed in this bill will come into force on 1 July 2017. Key features The due diligence and reporting rules in the Common Reporting Standard are broadly similar to those imposed on financial institutions under the United States’ (US) Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) rules. However, they have been adapted for a non-US, multilateral context, and they have also been supplemented with a comprehensive OECD Commentary. 91 To ensure that errors do not arise in translating these rules into New Zealand law, the legislation proposed in this bill will largely incorporate the Common Reporting Standard and OECD Commentary into New Zealand domestic law by reference. The Common Reporting Standard and OECD Commentary will also have ambulatory effect. That is, the reference in the legislation is to the Common Reporting Standard and OECD Commentary “as amended from time to time”, which effectively means that any future changes to the Common Reporting Standard and OECD Commentary will automat ically flow through into New Zealand law. The Common Reporting Standard rules include criteria for identifying the financial institutions that will be subject to due diligence and reporting obligations in a particular jurisdiction. The term “financial institution” is defined broadly, and covers depository institutions, custodial institutions, specified insurance companies, and investment entities. This definition extends beyond typical financial institutions such as banks to cover a number of types of entities that would not normally be considered to be financial institutions (such as many professionally managed trusts). Importantly, the financial institutions that will be subject to Common Reporting Standard obligations in New Zealand will be those that are resident in New Zealand (excluding branches located overseas) or that have branches in New Zealand. Residence will generally be determined by where the institution is resident for tax purposes. However, the Common Reporting Standard has special residence rules for trusts and transparent entities. Some financial institutions that pose a low risk of facilitating tax evasion and satisfy other criteria, are excluded from the Common Reporting Standard requirements (non- reporting financial institutions). An entity that meets the Common Reporting Standard financial institution criteria, that has the required residence or branch nexus to New Zealand, and that is not a non- reporting financial institution, will be a New Zealand reporting financial institution. References in this document to “financial institution” should be read as meaning reporting financial institution unless the context otherwise requires. The Common Reporting Standard also has criteria for identifying the accounts that will be subject to due diligence (financial accounts). For this purpose, the term “financial account” is defined to apply in the context of entities that would not normally be considered to be financial institutions. It extends beyond typical accounts such as depository accounts to include custodial accounts, cash value insurance contracts, annuity contracts, equity and debt interests. For example, for an investment entity (such as a trust) that is a financial institution under the Common Reporting Standard, its financial accounts will be its debt and equity interests. The term “equity interest” is further defined as including any settlor or beneficiary of all or a portion of the trust, or any other natural person exercising ultimate effective control over the trust. 92 The Common Reporting Standard also provides scope for implementing jurisdictions to define accounts as “excluded accounts” if these entities and accounts pose a low risk of facilitat ing tax evasion and otherwise satisfy other defined criteria. The due diligence procedures set out in the Common Reporting Standard differ depending on when the account is opened. More stringent obligations will apply to new accounts (accounts opened on or after 1 July 2017), with self-certifications generally being required to be obtained by the financial institution on account opening. For pre-existing accounts (accounts in existence on 30 June 2017), the due diligence procedures typically involve the review of documentation/information already held for regulatory or customer relationship purposes. This includes information obtained under Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism “know your customer” requirements. However, more stringent record search procedures will apply to, for example, high value pre-existing individual accounts (with a balance exceeding US $1 million) than for lower value pre-existing individual accounts. Importantly, financial institutions that maintain accounts held by passive non- financial entities (passive NFEs) will, as part of these procedures, need to “look through” those entities to determine the natural persons that are the ultimate controlling persons. In some cases, particularly for trusts, certain persons are considered to be controlling persons irrespective of whether or not they actually have or exercise control over the entity. The aim of the due diligence procedures is for financial institutions to identify accounts that are held or (for passive NFEs) controlled by foreign tax residents. 12 Financial institutions will be required to report an account that is held or controlled by one or more reportable persons (reportable accounts). 13 A reportable person as defined is generally a tax resident 14 of a jurisdiction that New Zealand has agreed to provide AEOI information to (reportable jurisdictions). Certain exclusions apply, such as for certain listed companies and their related entities, governmental entities, international organisations and persons that are themselves financial institutions. For each reportable person, the financial institution must report specified identity (including tax residence) and financial information. This includes tax residence, account balances, and defined income and distributio ns. 12 As explained below, this is based on the proposed approach of financial institutions applying the “wider approach” for to due diligence. 13 As explained below, this is subject to the application of the “wider approach” to reporting, whereby the financial institution may choose to report all foreign tax residents rather than only reportable persons. 14 For this purpose, an entity such as a partnership or similar legal arrangement that has no residence for tax purposes is treated as resident in the jurisdiction in which its place of effective management is situated. 93 Background AEOI is a stand-alone initiative, but is related to other international developments aimed at improving transparency frameworks and tax compliance. In particular, the Common Reporting Standard reflects (and is largely based on) the US FATCA initiative, which New Zealand implemented in 2014. The Common Reporting Standard builds off FATCA in a number of ways. For example, both regimes have broadly similar types of financial institutions and other entities, financial accounts, due diligence procedures (including sometimes allowing financial institutions to rely on Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism “know your customer” procedures and other account information that they already hold), and reporting requirements. However, there are some differences between the regimes. Some of the most significant differences are: • FATCA contains a number of de minimis exclusions from due diligence. The Common Reporting Standard generally does not have any such exclusions. The one exception to this is for pre-existing entity accounts, where the threshold exemption is US$250,000, unless the financial institution chooses to elect out of the threshold. • FATCA due diligence is focused on identifying “US persons”. The Common Reporting Standard due diligence is much broader and focuses on identifying foreign tax residents. 15 • FATCA compliance is buttressed by a 30% withholding tax to apply to US- sourced income for non-compliance. This does not apply to the Common Reporting Standard. However, the Common Reporting Standard does require implementing jurisdictions to have a legal and operational compliance framework in place to verify compliance and to penalise non-compliance. FATCA implementation involved the due diligence and reporting rules (which are set out in a treaty-level instrument) 16 being incorporated into New Zealand law using regulat ions. Some primary legislation was also necessary to establish a framework for FATCA obligations, and this is located at Part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Because of the similarities between the Common Reporting Standard and FATCA, the proposed amendments incorporating the Common Reporting Standard into New Zealand law will also primarily be located in Part 11B. However, as explained below, the proposal is that some provisions will apply solely to FATCA, some will apply solely for AEOI purposes, and some will apply for both FATCA and AEOI purposes. 15 As explained below, this is based on the proposed approach of financial institutions applying the “wider approach” to due diligence. 16 An Intergovernmental Agreement between New Zealand and the United States. See details on the tax policy website at: http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2014-other-iga.pdf. 94 The proposed update to Part 11B will result in provisions that will apply solely to FATCA, in existing sections 185F to 185M. Proposed provisions that apply solely to AEOI will be located in new sections 185N and 185O. Provisions that apply to both FATCA and AEOI will be located in new sections 185P to 185R. Section 185E, which sets out the purpose of Part 11B, will be updated to include references to AEOI and to set out the new structure. Proposed penalty provisions that relate to these obligations will also be set out in sections 142H and 142I. Detailed analysis The legal instruments for exchange MCMAA convention Although any form of tax treaty can potentially be used to make AEOI exchanges, the G20 and OECD have promoted the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (the MCMAA convention) as the principal treaty to be used for this purpose. New Zealand signed the MCMAA convention in 2012. It was given legal effect in New Zealand on 21 October 2013 by an Order in Council made under section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 17 Section BH 1 authorises the making of an Order in Council to give legal effect to a “double tax agreement”. As that term is defined, and under statutory legal principles, the reference to “double tax agreement” in section BH 1 is considered sufficiently broad to apply to other types of tax treaty, including multilateral treaties. However, this is not immediately obvious on the face of wording. This, in turn, has led to some claims that the MCMAA convention has not been correctly given legal effect in New Zealand. Although a legal challenge to the validity of the Order in Council giving effect to the MCMAA convention is unlikely to be successful, any uncertainty is undesirable. Moreover, additional multilateral treaties may need to be given effect under section BH 1 in the future. Accordingly, the bill contains proposals to put the matter beyond doubt. This includes a retrospective amendment to section BH 1, to clarify that it applies in the case of multilateral treaties. A definition relating to the MCMAA convention (under the term “MCMAA convention”) will also be inserted into section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which includes a specific reference to the 21 October 2013 Order in Council giving it legal effect in New Zealand. 17 Details relating to the MCMAA Convention are available on Inland Revenue’s tax policy website at http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/tax-treaties/convention-mutual-administrative-assistance-tax-matters. 95 The definition of “foreign account information sharing agreement”, in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, will also be amended to specifically include the “MCMAA convention”. The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that AEOI exchanges made under the MCMAA convention will be subject to the AEOI legislation to be inserted in Part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The MCA agreement Article 6 of the MCMAA convention authorises exchange of information on an automatic basis (as opposed to other forms of exchange, such as on request), and provides that any automatic exchanges must be subject to detailed terms as agreed between “competent authorities”. Competent authorities are specific persons or authorities nominated by each treaty partner to administer the treaty. The competent authority under New Zealand’s tax treaties is the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or an authorised representative. To give effect to the Article 6 requirement for competent authorities to agree the detailed terms of automatic exchanges, for AEOI the OECD developed an administrative instrument referred to as the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCA agreement). New Zealand signed the MCA agreement in 2015. 18 In addition to other important details, such as the manner of exchanges and rules and procedures around maintaining confidentiality of exchanged data, the MCA agreement specifies the actual information to be exchanged between the parties. As this is relevant to the operation of proposed Part 11B, a definition relating to the MCA agreement will be inserted into section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The MCA agreement also has a notification mechanism, which enables each party to confirm the actual jurisdictions that it will exchange with (see explanation of “reportable jurisdictions” below), and the timing of exchanges with each of those jurisdictions. Although New Zealand has signed the MCA agreement, it will not provide its notifications on reportable jurisdictions until the legislation is enacted and New Zealand’s list of reportable jurisdict ions is confirmed. Incorporating the Common Reporting Standard and OECD Commentary into New Zealand law The due diligence procedures and reporting requirements set out in the Common Reporting Standard must be interpreted and applied consistently with the OECD Commentary. 18 Details relating to the MCA agreement are available on Inland Revenue’s tax policy website at http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/topical-issues/implementing-aeoi. 96 Rewriting the details of all of the rules into domestic law would risk inadvertent differences and gaps between the Common Reporting Standard and the implementing legislation. Moreover, the Common Reporting Standard and OECD Commentary will almost certainly be subject to future change, as deficiencies and improvements are identified, and in response to changes in taxpayer behaviour. To address such issues, a number of implementing jurisdictions have adopted the approach of incorporating the Standard into law by direct reference to the Common Reporting Standard and its Commentary. The legislation proposed in this bill follows this approach. It will help ensure that the Common Reporting Standard is correctly incorporated into law, and will reduce the risk of deficiencies being identified during peer review. The legislation generally only introduces special rules when the Common Reporting Standard or Commentary either provides flexibility or requires implementing jurisdictions to make decisions (including decisions on dates that are to apply for due diligence and reporting purposes). To facilitate the incorporation of the Common Reporting Standard by reference, three key definitions are proposed to be inserted into section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994: • The term “CRS publication”, referring to the official OECD publication that includes the full AEOI standard (the standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters). 19 • The term “CRS standard”, referring to the Common Reporting Standard, which comprises Part IIB of the CRS publication. • The term “CRS applied standard”, referring to the CRS standard as modified by section 185O of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Importantly, the definit io n of “CRS standard” includes the words “as amended from time to time”. These words give the definition ambulatory effect, meaning that future changes to the Common Reporting Standard will generally flow through into New Zealand legislation automatically. As noted, the Common Reporting Standard must be interpreted and applied consistently with the official OECD Commentary, which comprises Part IIIB of the CRS publication. New section 185O(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will incorporate that requirement into New Zealand law. Section 185O(3) also includes the ambulatory language “as amended from time to time”. 19 This publication is available on the OECD website, at http://www.oecd.org/ctp/exchange-of-tax- information/standard-for-automatic-exchange-of-financial-account-information-for-tax-matters- 9789264216525-en.htm. 97 Other definitions The approach of incorporating the AEOI legislation into existing Part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 necessarily involves merging the AEOI instrument into the concept of a foreign account information-sharing agreement, on which Part 11B is based. To achieve this, the definition of “foreign account information-sharing agreement” (in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007) will be amended to include the MCMAA convention (which, as noted above, will be the tax treaty predominantly used for AEOI exchanges). The Common Reporting Standard itself contains a large number of specific definitions. Generally, incorporating the Common Reporting Standard into New Zealand law will ensure that these definitions will apply in the application of the Common Reporting Standard in New Zealand. However, in the case of a conflict between a Common Reporting Standard definit io n and a defined term in the Inland Revenue Acts, a rule will be inserted as new section 185O(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to ensure that when applying the Common Reporting Standard the Common Reporting Standard definit io n will take precedence. The Co mmon Reporting Standard Commentary specifies that two terms (“passive income” and “maintain”) are to take the domestic law meaning, but they must also include certain things. To ensure that the full meaning of these terms, as set out in the OECD Commentary, will apply in New Zealand, specific definitions of these terms are proposed to be included in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. A new term “FATCA agreement” is also proposed in section 3, as a means of differentiating between FATCA and AEOI in Part 11B. Framework for Common Reporting Standard obligations Because the legislation proposed in this bill incorporates the Common Reporting Standard due diligence and reporting obligations by reference, it generally does not need to detail the specific obligations. Rather, the proposed legislative amendments are primarily concerned with establishing the framework under which the obligations will apply in New Zealand. The application of obligations to financial institutions is facilitated by section 185N of the Tax Administration Act 1994. As noted above, section 185O sets out the specific proposed modifications to be made to the CRS standard, for application in New Zealand. It is proposed that these obligations will be supplemented by specific record-keeping requirements in respect of Common Reporting Standard compliance to be inserted into section 22 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This will include a specific requirement for financial institutions to keep a record of any failure to obtain a self- certification. 98 The application of obligations to persons other than financial institutions (such as account holders, controlling persons or intermediaries) is facilitated by the proposed insertion of section 185P of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Some complexity arises from the fact that the Common Reporting Standard treats certain legal arrangements (particularly trusts) as entities. As this concept does not fit well with the categorisation of such arrangements under New Zealand law, a supplementary rule is proposed in section 185Q to ensure that any obligations expressed in the Common Reporting Standard as applying to an entity are to apply to the relevant person in the New Zealand context. (For example, for trusts, the obligations will apply to the trustees.) Modifications to the Common Reporting Standard Modifications made to the Common Reporting Standard by section 185O include rules that require the Common Reporting Standard to be applied consistently with the OECD Commentary. Section 185O(2) provides that a number of other specific modifications will be detailed in new schedule 2 to the Tax Administration Act 1994. Section 185O also provides that a Common Reporting Standard definition is to prevail in the case of any conflict with a do mest ic law definit io n, and generally permit s financial institutions to make elections contemplated in the Common Reporting Standard and OECD Commentary. Dates Much of proposed schedule 2 is concerned with inserting the commencement dates and due diligence timeframes that are to apply in New Zealand. These include the date on which Common Reporting Standard obligations are to commence, dates for determining whether a financial account is to be considered a new account or a pre- existing account, and the deadlines for financial institutions to complete due diligence and reporting. In the Common Reporting Standard and OECD Commentary, these dates have generally been left open for each implementing jurisdiction to insert (subject to these meeting international expectations). In addition, because New Zealand has adopted a reporting period other than the default calendar year reporting period contemplated by the Common Reporting Standard, a rule is included such that all references to reporting period and calendar year are to be read in the context of the New Zealand reporting period (unless the context requires otherwise). 99 Schedule 2 Schedule 2 makes the following specific modifications to the Common Reporting Standard: • Item 1 clarifies that references in the Common Reporting Standard to reporting period and calendar year should be read as applying to a reporting period ending 31 March. • Items 2 and 3 mandate the use of the “wider approach” for due diligence. This is an important compliance minimisation option offered to implementing jurisdictions in the Common Reporting Standard. It is explained in detail further below, under the section “Wider approach”. • Item 4 withdraws a choice available in the Common Reporting Standard (to allow a transitional period for the introduction of a requirement to report gross proceeds from the sale or redemption of financial assets). The reasons for this are articulated below under “Excluded choices”. • Items 5 to 10 set out various due diligence timeframes that apply for different types of pre-existing accounts. • Item 11 allows for the adoption of an option relating to certain employer- sponsored group insurance contracts or annuity contracts. • Item 12 provides that dollar amounts referred to in the Common Reporting Standard (which, by default are in United States currency), can be treated as being in New Zealand dollars. • Items 13 and 22 to 24 are mechanical provisions that ensure New Zealand’s published lists of its Participating Jurisdictions, Reportable Jurisdictions, Non- Reporting Financial Institutions and Excluded Accounts are included within the meaning of the relevant definitions of those terms. • Item 14 sets out the date at which a credit card issuer is required to implement various defined policies and procedures in order to come within the definition of “Qualified Credit Card Issuer” in the Common Reporting Standard. • Items 15 and 16 set out various dates from which collective investment vehicles are required to no longer issue physical shares in bearer form and by which they must have policies in place to ensure that such shares are redeemed or immobilised in order to come within the term “Exempt Collective Investment Vehicle” defined in the Common Reporting Standard. • Items 17 and 18 define “pre-existing accounts” and “new accounts”. The definit ion o f “pre-existing accounts” incorporates the option in the Commo n Reporting Standard to apply the due diligence procedures for pre-existing accounts to new accounts opened by pre-existing customers in circumstances permitted in the Standard. • Items 19 and 20 set out dates that are relevant to determine whether a pre- existing account is a “Lower Value Account” or a “High Value Account”. 100 • Item 21 sets out a deadline date by which a financial institution is required to implement defined policies and procedures in order for a type of depository account to be an excluded account. • Item 25 clarifies which of two possible definitions of the term “Related Entity” the Common Reporting Standard will apply. Obligations of financial institutions The Common Reporting Standard provides that a financial institution that is resident (as that concept applies for Common Reporting Standard purposes) in a jurisdiction will be subject to Common Reporting Standard obligations in that jurisdiction. However, a branch of a New Zealand-resident financial institution located outside of New Zealand is excluded from the rules. Conversely, a branch of a non-resident financial institution located in New Zealand is subject to the New Zealand rules. These fundamental rules are set out in section 185N(1) and (2). The Common Reporting Standard also includes a complex series of definitions that set out the actual criteria for identifying financial institutions. For Common Reporting Standard purposes, the term “financial institution” is broadly defined. It extends beyond traditional financial institutions (such as banks) to a wide range of entities that would not normally be considered as financial institutions (for example, it will include some professionally managed trusts). However, the Common Reporting Standard CRS also specifies a number of categories of financial institution that pose a low risk of being used to facilitate offshore tax evasion, and which therefore are excluded from the due diligence and reporting obligations. These are defined as “non-reporting financial institutions”. Proposed section 185N(3) provides that a financial institution must comply with the due diligence and reporting obligations set out in the Common Reporting Standard applied standard. Proposed section 185N(4) imposes an annual reporting deadline for financial institutions of 30 June. Consistent with the timeframes contemplated in the Common Reporting Standard and OECD Commentary for completing due diligence of pre-existing accounts, proposed section 185N(5) sets a deadline of 30 June 2018 for due diligence and reporting on pre-existing individual accounts that are high value accounts, and 30 June 2019 for due diligence and reporting for all other pre-existing accounts. Otherwise, proposed section 185N(5) includes a general rule for the timing of reports in respect of an account identified as reportable during a particular reporting period. Proposed section 185N also includes other supplementary rules. 101 Obligations of persons other than financial institutions Proposed section 185P also extends Common Reporting Standard obligations to persons other than financial institutions. This reflects the fact that financial institutions will often be required to collect documentation and information directly or indirectly from account holders (and sometimes the controlling persons of the account) in order to comply with their Common Reporting Standard obligations. This includes circumstances when the inst itution has a customer relationship with an intermediary that holds an account for the benefit of an account holder and, potentially, other controlling persons. This requires an efficient transfer of information from those account holders and other persons directly or indirectly to the institution. Financial institutions should generally face few problems in obtaining documentation and information from customers on account opening. However, they may face challenges in obtaining documentation and information from customers in other circumstances. For example, a customer may not respond to a written request for information. There may also sometimes be difficulties obtaining documentation and information from persons connected with particular types of accounts, such as trust accounts. To assist compliance, an amendment proposes to impose an obligation on such customers and other entities or persons, to obtain and provide any documentation and information that the institution requests from them directly or indirectly in the course of undertaking their Common Reporting Standard due diligence obligations. Such customers/persons will also have an obligation to provide updates on any material change in circumstances that they are aware of that may affect their status as a reportable person. These obligations are set out in proposed section 185P. Record-keeping obligations The Common Reporting Standard specifically requires implementing jurisdictions to have rules in place requiring that financial institutions keep records of the steps undertaken, and any evidence relied upon, for the performance of their Common Reporting Standard obligations. This requirement will be met by the proposed introduction of specific rules in section 22 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This will include a requirement for a financial institution to keep a record of any failure to obtain a required self- certification. These record keeping requirements will assist Inland Revenue in verifying compliance with the Common Reporting Standard and addressing any non- compliance (including considering the application of any relevant penalties). 102 Optionality Although the success of the AEOI global initiative depends on jurisdictions implementing similar rules, the Common Reporting Standard provides implementing jurisdictions with a number of options. These options have been developed with a view to minimising compliance costs for financial institutions, in areas that are not considered likely to compromise the effectiveness of the Standard. The circumstances of each financial institution can differ markedly, meaning that financial institutions may have different preferences as to whether these options should be adopted. Accordingly, the legislation proposed has been framed to generally permit each financial institution to make its own decision on whether to adopt any particular option offered in the Common Reporting Standard. Some of the specific choices available to financial institutions are set out in section 185N. Otherwise, section 185O(5) generally provides that a financial institution may make an election that is expressed as being available to them. Excluded choices In a small number of cases, a particular choice will be mandated for all financial inst itutions. Two “excluded” choices are set out in section 185N(11), which provides that the optionality provided in the Common Reporting Standard to adopt alternative reporting periods, and in the OECD Commentary in respect of the alternative use of average balances rather than period end balances, will not be available to financial institutions. • The reporting period to be used in New Zealand will be the 12-month period ending 31 March. 20 This is consistent with the New Zealand tax year and the reporting period adopted by New Zealand for FATCA purposes. The period ending 31 March must be adopted by all financial institutions. • The OECD Commentary provides that jurisdictions that already require financial institutions to report average account balances can permit their financial institutions to maintain this approach for AEOI, rather than reporting period end-balances. This does not apply in New Zealand. However, for clarity, the legislation expressly provides that this option is not available to New Zealand financial institutions. As noted, an additional excluded choice is set out at item 4 of schedule 2. This relates to an option available in the Common Reporting Standard to allow a transit io nal period for the introduction of a requirement to report gross proceeds from the sale or redemption of financial assets. On this point there is a mismatch between the Commo n Reporting Standard and the exchange commitments set out in the MCA agreement, where this is not allowed as an option. Therefore this is specifically set out as an excluded choice. 20 The first period will be a transitional period from 1 July 2017 to 31 March 2018. 103 The “wider approach” The “wider approach” to due diligence An important option offered in the Common Reporting Standard is the “wider approach” to due diligence. This option addresses the practical issue that the Common Reporting Standard only requires the identification by financial institutions of persons that are tax-resident in reportable jurisdictions (that is, jurisdictions that New Zealand will exchange AEOI information with). Over time, additional jurisdictions will join the initiative and become reportable jurisdictions. Without specific rules, each new jurisdiction joining would trigger a new round of due diligence reviews of accounts by financial institutions. To avoid this problem, and to minimise compliance costs, the Common Reporting Standard includes an option for implementing jurisdictions to adopt a “wider approach” to due diligence. Under this approach, a jurisdiction’s financial institutions would be permitted to collect and retain Common Reporting Standard information for all non-residents identified rather than just that pertaining to residents of reportable jurisdictions. The legislation proposed adopts the wider approach to due diligence. To ensure consistency, and prevent any financial institution from being put at a competitive disadvantage, this approach will be mandatory for all financial institutions. This modification to the CRS standard is made at item 2 of the new schedule 2. The “wider approach” to reporting Adopting the wider approach to due diligence will require financial institutions to sort and filter the collected data to determine the accounts that need to be reported to Inland Revenue (so that they can identify the reportable accounts that are held and/or controlled by reportable persons, which they are required to report). The Common Reporting Standard therefore provides a further option, to allow financial institutions to report all of the information to the tax authority (Inland Revenue in this context). Under this option, financial institutions may choose that the reporting requirements under the Common Reporting Standard in relation to financial accounts held or controlled by a resident of a reportable jurisdiction apply to all financial accounts maintained by that institution and held or controlled by a resident of a foreign tax jurisdiction. The proposed approach is, therefore, for financial institutions to effectively be permitted to pass the responsibility for sorting and filtering the data on to the tax authority (Inland Revenue), thereby potentially saving costs. Inland Revenue would then be responsible for determining the information to be exchanged with reportable jurisdictions. The legislation proposed in this bill allows this as an option for financial institutions. This option will be set out in sections 185N(7) and (8). 104 Determinations and regulatory powers The Common Reporting Standard defined terms “participating jurisdiction” and “reportable jurisdiction” are key concepts in the application of the Common Reporting Standard. The Common Reporting Standard requires New Zealand to publish lists of its participating jurisdictions and reportable jurisdictions. The Common Reporting Standard also includes important carve-outs from AEOI obligations, for “non-reporting financial institutions” and “excluded accounts” that pose a low risk of being used for tax evasion purposes. Some generic categories of these are set out in the Common Reporting Standard, but New Zealand will also be required to publish lists of specific institutions and accounts that it approves as meeting other general low-risk criteria. These lists will be published by a mix of Commissioner’s Determinations and by regulat ion. Participating jurisdictions New Zealand must publish a list of its participating jurisdictions. A participating jurisdiction is generally one that has implemented AEOI and indicated that it will provide AEOI information to other jurisdictions. More specifically, New Zealand’s participating jurisdictions will be those with which an agreement is in place for that jurisdiction to provide AEOI information to New Zealand. New Zealand’s list of participating jurisdictions will be important for New Zealand’s financial institutions, because the Common Reporting Standard due diligence procedures require financial institutions to “look through” passive NFEs to determine the natural persons that are its ultimate controlling persons. This look-through rule extends to cover certain investment entities that are not from participating jurisdictions. This means that New Zealand’s list of participating jurisdictions will impact on the circumstances when New Zealand financial institutions will need to “look through” their account holders to identify the ultimate controlling persons. The proposed amendments in this bill provide for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to make a Determination about whether a particular jurisdiction is a participating jurisdiction. This Determination-making power will be inserted into the Tax Administration Act 1994 as proposed new section 91AAU. The provision will allow the Commissioner to impose limitations on, amend, suspend or withdraw a Determination. It will take time to confirm whether all jurisdictions that have committed to implementing AEOI have correctly carried through with their commitments. As a transitional measure, the OECD has permitted jurisdictions to tentatively treat all committed jurisdictions as participating jurisdictions. New Zealand intends adopting this approach. 105 However, the transitional measure is only to apply for a limited time, and jurisdictions are required to publish final lists by 30 June 2017. Given that New Zealand’s start date is 1 July 2017, the intended approach is to publish a transitional list that would apply for the first period (1 July 2017 to 31 March 2018) and then a final list by 30 June 2017 that would apply from the beginning of the second period (that is, from 1 April 2018). Reportable jurisdictions In addition to publishing its list of participating jurisdictions, New Zealand must also publish a list of its reportable jurisdictions. A participating jurisdiction is one that provides AEOI information. However, not all participating jurisdictions will be reportable jurisdictions. For example, some participating jurisdictions may be smaller economies that do not have a tax system, and which therefore would have no need to receive information. In general, international expectations are that AEOI information will be provided to all participating jurisdictions that have indicated in the MCA agreement that they wish to receive such information. However, the OECD acknowledges that this raises potential concerns about confidentiality and data security. AEOI exchanges will comprise sensitive personal and financial information. Under the express terms of the legal instruments under which the information will be exchanged, this information may only be disclosed to specified persons and may only be used for specified (tax) purposes. Many jurisdictions have been exchanging such sensitive information for many years, have robust laws, processes and systems in place for ensuring exchanged data is kept secure and is only used for legitimate purposes, and have a track record of maintaining confidentiality. However, some jurisdictions that are implementing the AEOI Standard have had little, or no, prior experience in exchange of information for tax purposes. Implementing jurisdictions may make decisions not to provide information to particular jurisdictions if they hold genuine concerns about confidentiality and/or data security. However, such decisions cannot be used to frustrate the purposes of the Common Reporting Standard. This is a difficult balancing act. To assist, the Global Forum is conducting specific reviews of implementing jurisdictions’ confidentiality and data safeguards, and will be making its conclusions available to competent authorities of participating jurisdictions. The amendments proposed in this bill include specific procedures for ensuring that the New Zealand Government retains oversight and control of New Zealand’s determination of its reportable jurisdictions. 106 A regulation-making power will be inserted into the Tax Administration Act as proposed new section 226D. The decision to provide AEOI information to any jurisdiction will require confirmation by Order in Council. To ensure that, in the case of any serious breach, exchange of information with a particular jurisdiction can be swiftly suspended, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will be authorised to make a Determination to temporarily suspend that jurisdiction as a reportable jurisdiction. This Determination-making power will be inserted into the Tax Administration Act 1994 as proposed new section 91AAV. Any such Determination would need to be subsequently confirmed by Order in Council. This power will only exist as a contingency to ensure that the time taken to make an Order in Council to suspend a jurisdiction does not result in a legal obligation to provide information being switched off too late due to an exchange deadline. Non-reporting financial institutions As noted above, the Common Reporting Standard provides that some categories of financial institution that pose a low risk of being used for offshore tax evasion can be treated as a “non-reporting financial institution”. A number of generic categories of non-reporting financial institution are set out in the Common Reporting Standard. There is also an additional category of low risk financial institutions that an implementing jurisdiction can itself determine. However, these must meet certain specified criteria, must be confirmed by the implementing jurisdiction in a published list, and must meet a final test of not frustrating the purposes of the Common Reporting Standard. The amendments proposed provide for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to make a Determination as to whether a particular financial institution, or type of financial inst itution, is a non-reporting financial institution. This Determination-making power will be inserted into the Tax Administration Act 1994 as proposed new section 91AAW. The provision will include the ability for the Commissioner to impose limitations on, amend, suspend or withdraw a Determination. All Determinations made under this provision must be published. Excluded accounts Similarly, the Common Reporting Standard provides that some categories of financial account that pose a low risk of being used for offshore tax evasion can be treated as “excluded accounts”. Excluded accounts will not be subject to due diligence or reporting. A number of generic categories of excluded account are set out in the Commo n Reporting Standard. There is also an additional category of “low risk” accounts an implementing jurisdiction can itself determine. However, these must meet certain specified criteria, must be confirmed by the implementing jurisdiction in a published list, and must meet a final test of not frustrating the purposes of the Common Reporting Standard. 107 The legislation proposed in this bill provides for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to make a Determination on whether a particular financial account, or type of financial account, is an excluded account. This Determination-making power will be inserted into the Tax Administration Act 1994 as proposed new section 91AAW. The provision will include the ability for the Commissioner to impose limitations on, amend, suspend or withdraw a Determination. All Determinations made under this provision must be published. Enforcement The Common Reporting Standard requires implementing jurisdictions to have rules and procedures in place to ensure compliance and address non-compliance. This includes having appropriate anti-avoidance rules, record-keeping requirements, compliance programmes, and effective sanctions to address identified non- compliance. Accordingly, this bill proposes a comprehensive suite of enforcement rules and penalties. Strong sanctions will apply to financial institutions for intentional failure to comply or for failure to comply through lack of reasonable care. The penalties to be imposed on financial institutions will be backed with specific obligations and penalties to be imposed directly on account holders, controlling persons or intermediaries that (i) provide false information or a false self-certification, (ii) fail to comply with a request for information or a self-certification, or (iii) fail to inform of any material change in circumstances that they are aware of relating to information or a self-certification that they have provided. However, as explained below, these penalties will be subject to the application of “no fault” and “reasonable efforts” defences. Specific record-keeping obligations are also proposed, together with an anti- avoidance provision that will apply to arrangements and practices entered into or by financial institutions, persons, or intermediaries with “a main purpose” of avoiding an obligation under Part 11B. The bill proposes that the following penalties will apply to financial institutions: • a general (civil) penalty of $300, to be imposed on a financial institution for any failure to comply with its Common Reporting Standard due diligence and reporting requirements; • a specific (civil) penalty of $300, to be imposed on a financial institution for each new account when there is a failure to obtain a self-certification when opening such accounts when obtaining such a self-certification is required by the Common Reporting Standard; • the above provisions will be subject to a transitional period (until 31 March 2019) in which penalties will not be imposed if the financial institution is able to demonstrate it has made reasonable efforts to comply with its Common Reporting Standard due diligence and reporting obligations; and 108 • a specific (civil) penalty of $20,000 for a first offence and $40,000 for any subsequent offence, to be imposed in circumstances when a financial institution fails to take reasonable care in complying with its Common Reporting Standard due diligence and reporting requirements. Knowledge-based offences by financial institutions will be subject to the application of existing legislative provisions. The bill also proposes that the penalties to be imposed on financial institutions will be backed with specific obligations and penalties to be imposed directly on account holders, controlling persons or persons that otherwise hold accounts for the benefit of others (including trusts and intermediaries): • a specific (civil) penalty of $1,000, if a person or entity provides a false self- certification or related information, fails to provide a self-certification or related information within a reasonable time after receiving a request, or fails to provide information about a material change of circumstances that they are aware of relating to a self-certification or related information within a reasonable period of time; • however, this penalty is subject to a “no fault” defence (for a failure to provide information or a self-certification within the control of the information provider) and a “reasonable efforts” defence (for a failure to provide information or a self- certification relating to another person or entity and not within the control of the information provider). Knowledge-based offences by such persons or entities will be subject to the application of existing legislative provisions. The mix of transitional measures and available defences is included in the proposed legislation in recognition of the fact that the rules are complex, that financial institutions face short implementation timelines, and that there is a risk of inadvertent error. The intended approach is that for the first two years, reasonable efforts by financial institutions to comply will be recognised. Sanctions will generally only be imposed in cases of intentional non-compliance or lack of reasonable care. However, the proposed legislation is also structured to recognise the fact that New Zealand’s rules will be subject to international peer review, and that any perceived leniency could be criticised. Accordingly, as an effective deterrence, strong sanctions are proposed for identified cases of serious failure or non-compliance. FATCA For consistency, the bill proposes amendments to the FATCA implementation legislation to first, align the FATCA anti-avoidance rule with the AEOI anti- avoidance rule (with application to any person with an obligation under Part 11B), and secondly, to provide for the imposition of the same obligations and penalties on persons other than financial institutions under FATCA as for AEOI. 109 110 Foreign trust disclosure rules 111 112 FOREIGN TRUST DISCLOSURE RULES (Clauses 5, 8(8), 8(9), 9(4), 10 and 11) Summary of proposed amendments New information disclosure rules are proposed for foreign trusts with a New Zealand- resident trustee. These include requirements for the trust to register with Inland Revenue, file annual returns and pay registration and filing fees. In addition, the register of foreign trusts would be shared with certain New Zealand government agencies. The resident trustee of the foreign trust would need to comply with the registration and filing obligations in order to qualify for the exemption from tax on foreign- sourced amounts. The proposed changes follow the Government’s April 2016 Inquiry into Foreign Trust Disclosure Rules which was set up to examine and make recommendations regarding disclosure rules and other related matters to ensure that New Zealand’s reputation is maintained. The Inquiry concluded that, given the current environment of greater transparency and sharing of information, the current information disclosure rules are inadequate. The Inquiry recommended a number of amendments to the disclosure requirements for foreign trusts. On 13 July 2016 the Government announced it would adopt the Inquiry’s recommendations. Application date The amendments will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features Resident trustees required to register foreign trust Resident trustees of a foreign trust will be required to apply for registration of the trust. As part of the registration, the resident trustee must provide certain information relating to the foreign trust to the Commissioner, including information relating to settlors and beneficiaries and the trust deed. Foreign trusts formed after the date of enactment will need to register with Inland Revenue within 30 days. Existing foreign trusts will have to register by 30 June 2017. 113 Annual returns Resident trustees of a foreign trust will be required to file annual returns, including the trust’s financial statements and details of settlements and distributions, made over the year. The annual return would also include any changes made to the information that is provided as part of the initial disclosure on registration. The resident trustee will be required to file annual returns for every year that the trust is registered. The due date for annual returns corresponds to the foreign trust’s balance date, with the annual returns due three months after the trust’s balance date. If the trust does not have a balance date because it does not prepare financial statements, the return is due 30 June following the end of the tax year. Existing foreign trusts will generally need to provide their first return under the proposed new rules by 30 June 2018. Grace period for new migrants There would be a “grace period” for New Zealand trustees who are new migrants and who are not in the business of providing trustee services. Under this grace period the registration and filing requirements would be delayed for two years. This would mirror the existing grace period for new migrants in respect of providing initial foreign trust disclosures. Registration and annual filing fee The proposed amendments include a registration fee of $270 and an annual filing fee of $50. The bill also proposes a regulation-making power which will allow the registration and annual filing fees to be amended by Order in Council. Information sharing with other agencies The information collected by Inland Revenue as part of the proposed new registration and annual filing processes would be shared with the New Zealand Police and the Department of Internal Affairs. Sanctions for non-compliance To qualify for the exemption for tax on foreign-sourced income, resident trustees of a foreign trust will have to be compliant with the disclosure requirements for registration, and will also need to fulfil their annual filing obligation. In addition, it is proposed that the current “safe harbour” for qualifying resident trustees of a foreign trust be removed. Background A foreign trust is a trust with a foreign settlor. Foreign trusts with New Zealand- resident trustees are exempt from tax on foreign-sourced income. 114 There is currently no formal registration process for foreign trusts. However, the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires foreign trusts with a New Zealand-resident trustee to disclose certain information to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue upon establishment. The information required to be disclosed upon establishment is the name or identifying particulars of the foreign trust, the name of a New Zealand trustee, and whether there is an Australian settlor. The Tax Administration Act also requires New Zealand-resident trustees of foreign trusts to keep certain records in relation to the foreign trust, including the trust deed, and (if they are known) the names and addresses of settlors who make a settlement on the trust and beneficiaries who receive a distribution. These records must be provided to Inland Revenue on request. If the information provided upon initial disclosure has changed, the New Zealand-resident trustee of a foreign trust must update the information, but annual filing with Inland Revenue is not otherwise required. There are two forms of sanctions for non-compliance under the current rules. First, an intentional breach of a requirement to supply information to Inland Revenue can result in a fine of up to $50,000 and imprisonment for up to five years. Secondly, the foreign trust loses its tax exemption on foreign-sourced income if: • a trustee is convicted of an offence for not providing information requested by Inland Revenue; and • the trust does not have a “qualifying resident foreign trustee” for an income year. (A qualifying resident foreign trustee is a member of a specified professional body – for example, a member of the New Zealand Law Society or Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand.) Inland Revenue shares information about foreign trusts with overseas tax authorities in countries with whom New Zealand has an agreement which includes information sharing provisions. This information is shared when requested by the overseas tax authority or proactively in instances where Inland Revenue considers that the information may be of interest to that tax authority. Detailed analysis Registration Proposed section 59B requires resident trustees to apply for registration of the foreign trust. This section also sets out the information that must be provided to Inland Revenue for registration, namely: a) the name and other identifying particulars of the trust; b) the date and detail of each settlement on the trust; 115 c) the name, email address, residential address, country of tax residence, and Taxpayer Identification Number for the following persons: i. each settlor ii. each person with a power under the trust deed to control the dismissal of appointment of a trustee, to amend the trust deed, or to add or remove a beneficiary iii. each person with a power under the trust deed to control a trustee in the administration of the trust iv. each trustee v. for a fixed trust, each beneficiary and nominee for an underlying beneficiary; d) for a discretionary trust, details of each class of beneficiary sufficient for the Commissioner to determine, when a distribution is made under the trust or when rights apparently vested under the trust are exercised, whether a person is a member of the class; and e) a copy of the trust deed. A new definition of “Taxpayer Identification Number” (TIN) is proposed in section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act. A TIN is the equivalent of a person’s IRD number in the jurisdiction in which they are tax-resident. Some foreign trusts have a trust “protector”. This is a person who is able to exercise some control over the trustee(s) under the trust deed – for example, the protector may have the ability to appoint or remove a trustee, or to veto the appointment or removal of a trustee. The Inquiry recommended that identity details of protectors be provided to Inland Revenue. Protectors are intended to be captured by (c)(ii) and (iii) in the above list. The Inquiry also recommended that identity information of any other natural person who has effective control of the trust (including through a chain of control or ownership) should be provided. There are existing rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 that prescribe when a person will be treated as a settlor for the purpose of the trust rules. It is expected that the existing definition of settlor, in conjunction with the nominee look-through rule in section YB 21 will include situations where a natural person has effective control of the trust through a chain of control or ownership. As part of the registration, the resident trustee must provide a signed declaration that the settlors, trustees and persons referred to under (c)(ii) and (iii) have been informed of, and have agreed to provide the information necessary for compliance with, the requirements relating to the provision of information imposed by: a) the Tax Administration Act 1994; b) the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act 2009; and c) the regulations made under the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act 2009. 116 The time limits for registration and the associated disclosure are provided in proposed section 59C. Foreign trusts formed after the date of enactment will need to register with Inland Revenue within 30 days of establishing. Existing foreign trusts will have to register by 30 June 2017. Annual returns Proposed new section 59D sets out the information that must be provided annually, and the time limits for providing this information and paying the associated fee. Specifically, resident trustees must provide: a) any changes to the information provided as part of registration; b) the trust’s financial statements; c) the date and nature of each settlement; d) the name, email address, residential address, country of tax residence, and Taxpayer Identification Number of each settlor making the settlement; e) the date and amount of each distribution made by the trustee of the trust in the year; and f) the name, email address, residential address, country of tax residence and Taxpayer Identification Number of each beneficiary to which the distribution is made. The resident trustee is required to file annual returns for every year that the trust is registered. The specific time limits for filing an annual return are set out in proposed section 59D(3). The due date for annual returns corresponds to the foreign trust’s balance date, with the annual returns due three months after the trust’s balance date. If the trust does not have a balance date because it does not prepare financial statements, the return is due 30 June following the end of the tax year. Existing foreign trusts will generally need to provide their first return by 30 June 2018. Grace period for new migrants to comply with obligations While most foreign trusts that are currently disclosed to Inland Revenue are professionally managed, a trust will also be a foreign trust if an individual who is the trustee of a family trust with a foreign settlor migrates to New Zealand (temporarily or permanently). For example, take the situation of a person living in the United Kingdom (UK) who is the trustee of a family trust that was settled by the person’s UK-resident parents. If that individual migrates to New Zealand (either temporarily or permanently), they would become a New Zealand-resident trustee of a foreign trust. 117 In this situation, the New Zealand resident trustee must comply with the foreign trust disclosure and record-keeping requirements. However, the current law provides a “grace period” for New Zealand trustees who are new migrants and who are not in the business of providing trustee services. Under this grace period the disclosure requirements are delayed for two years. Proposed sections 59C(3) and 59D(1)(d) provide an equivalent grace period of two years, in respect of the new registration and annual filing obligations, for New Zealand trustees who are new migrants and who are not in the business of providing trustee services. This is intended to ensure that temporary migrants (such as workers on a short-term contract) are not caught by the new rules, and that new migrants have time to adjust to their obligations. Registration and annual filing fee Proposed section 59E of the Tax Administration Act prescribes the fees for registration and annual filing. The registration fee is proposed to be set at $270. The annual filing fee will be set at $50. This provision includes a regulation-making power to change the fee by regulation. No tax exemption if trustee is non-compliant Under the proposed amendment to section HC 26, a foreign trust with a resident trustee will lose its tax exemption unless the trustee has registered the trust and fulfilled the associated disclosure obligations at that time. However the exemption would still be available if the non-registration or disclosure was unintentional and was remedied immediately. It is also proposed to repeal the current qualifying resident trustee safe harbour in section HC 26(3). As noted above, under current rules this safe harbour allows a trust to keep its tax exemption as long as one of its trustees is a “qualifying resident foreign trustee” (a member of a specified professional body). The definition of a “qualifying resident foreign trustee” in section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act would consequentially be repealed. Information sharing with other agencies A proposed amendment to section 81(4) will allow Inland Revenue to share the register of foreign trusts with the Department of Internal Affairs and the New Zealand Police. This will give these agencies access to information about foreign trusts that they need for regulatory or law enforcement purposes. Consequential amendment to record-keeping requirements Currently, New Zealand resident trustees of foreign trusts are specifically required to keep records relating to the trust deed, and certain information about settlements and distributions under section 22(7)(d)(i) and (ii) of the Tax Administration Act. The trust deed and information about settlements and distributions would have to be provided to Inland Revenue under the proposed registration and annual disclosure requirements. As a consequence, it is proposed to repeal section 22(7)(d)(i) and (ii) because it is no longer necessary. 118 Design of START 119 120 ADMINISTRATION OF THE LATE PAYMENT PENALTY RULES (Clauses 112 and 113) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments will enable Inland Revenue to continue to administer the late payment penalty grace period during the period in which tax types are operated out of two Inland Revenue software platforms. As part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme, Inland Revenue’s current computer platform, FIRST, will be replaced with a new software system known as “START”. This will occur in four stages. The amendments will enable the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to ignore defaults in payment if: • doing so is necessary due to tax types being administered from different systems as a result of the coexistence of FIRST and START; and • doing so would not result in the imposition of a penalty that is greater than would otherwise have been imposed (had she not ignored these defaults in payment). Application date The proposed amendments will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features Amendments to sections 139B(1)(b) and 139B(1)(c), and proposed new section 139B(1B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, introduce a discretion into the provisions setting out whether a taxpayer is entitled to a grace period from late payment penalties. Proposed new section 139B(1B) provides that this discretion may only be exercised when the following two conditions are satisfied: • ignoring the failure to pay tax on time is necessary as a result of resource constraints imposed on the Commissioner during the period of coexistence of two Inland Revenue software platforms; and • this would not result in a greater penalty being imposed than the taxpayer would otherwise be liable for if the Commissioner were not to ignore this failure to pay tax on time. An amendment to section 138E will mean that certain rights of challenge do not apply to section 139B. 121 Background The current tax rules impose a late payment penalty if a taxpayer does not pay on time. If, however, the taxpayer has punctually paid all relevant taxes due in the two years before the default in quest ion, the Co mmissioner must first issue a notice to the taxpayer specifying a further date for payment of the unpaid tax, before a late payment penalty can be imposed. This gives the taxpayer a grace period in which to pay the amount owing before late payment penalties are imposed. 21 Application of the late payment penalty grace period is determined on the basis of the taxpayer’s previous compliance in terms of the payment of tax across all relevant tax types (such as GST, income tax and PAYE deductions). 22 The transit io n fro m Inland Revenue’s FIRST to START system will be done on a tax- type basis, in four stages, with GST being transferred in early 2017 and income tax, FBT and PAYE scheduled to be transferred in 2018. This raises an issue in relation to the late payment penalty grace period, as the current legislative framework for the application of the penalty requires the Commissioner to consider the taxpayer’s compliance history across all applicable tax types. As information relating to the taxpayer’s tax compliance history and payment activity will reside in two software systems, it will be difficult for the Commissioner to look across all applicable tax types to determine whether the taxpayer is entitled to a grace period without significant manual intervention. Detailed analysis The discretion in new section 139B(1B) will enable the Commissioner to look only at tax information about a taxpayer’s compliance history held in the system from which the tax type in payment default is being administered. As tax types are transit io ned to the new START system, a “compliance history indicator” will also be brought across to show when the taxpayer is next entitled to a grace period, based on the date they last paid late. The “compliance history indicators” will ho ld the taxpayer’s payment history from two years prior to the tax type being brought across to START to the date of transition for tax types that have been administered from FIRST up to the date of transition. For example, the indicator that is transferred to START at the same time as GST would ho ld the taxpayer’s payment history from two years before the date on which GST is transferred to START to the date of transfer in relation to income tax, GST, FBT and PAYE. During Stage 1 of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme, this indicator would be used to determine whether the taxpayer is entitled to a grace period when they default on a GST payment (when the GST period in question is a period after the date on which GST was transferred to START). If the taxpayer defaults on a payment for a tax type that is still being administered through FIRST, the compliance 21 If the taxpayer does not make payment within that notified further period, the late payment penalty is imposed from the day after the due date, as would have been usual. 22 The late payment penalty grace period applies to all tax types except the following: child support, student loan scheme, tax credits (formerly known as rebates), certain types of provisional tax, KiwiSaver voluntary employer contributions and complying fund debt referred to Inland Revenue from the Financial Markets Authority. 122 history held in FIRST at that time will be used to determine whether the taxpayer is entitled to a grace period. This means that at a given point in time, the information held in START will be information contained within the compliance history indicator and information relating to the taxpayer’s payment compliance with tax types being administered out of START from the date they were transitioned to START. The information held in FIRST will be information relating to the taxpayer’s payment compliance in relat io n to all tax types up to the date they were transitioned to START. Examples The following examples assume that the taxpayer’s only payment defaults are those specifically stated. 1. The date is 31 August 2017. Judy is a small business owner who fails to pay her GST liability by the 28 August 2017 due date. She was two weeks late in paying her PAYE liability by the 20 June 2017 due date. As the PAYE period in which she defaulted occurred after GST and the compliance history indicator were transferred to START, this PAYE information will not be visible in START. In accordance with proposed section 139B(1B), the Commissioner will be able to ignore Judy’s PAYE default in determining whether she should be entitled to a grace period in relation to the late payment of her GST liability due by 28 August 2017. This means that the Commissioner will grant Judy a grace period, giving her a further 30 days to pay her GST liability. 2. The date is 31 August 2017. Kiri is a small business owner who fails to pay her PAYE liability by the 20 August 2017 due date. She was also two weeks late in paying her GST liability by the 28 June 2017 due date. As the GST period in which she defaulted occurred after GST was transferred to START, this information will not be visible in FIRST. In accordance with proposed section 139B(1B), the Commissioner will be able to ignore Kiri’s GST payment default in determining whether she should be entitled to a grace period in relation to the late payment of her PAYE liability due on 20 August 2017. This means that the Commissioner will grant Kiri a grace period, giving her a further 30 days to pay her PAYE liability. 3. The date is 30 June 2017. Amir is a small business owner who fails to pay his PAYE liability (of one period) by the 20 June 2017 due date. He was two weeks late in paying last year’s income tax liability, due 7 April 2016. As PAYE will still be being administered within the FIRST system, information on Amir’s income tax payment default will be able to be considered by the Commissioner in determining whether he should be entitled to a grace period in relation to his PAYE payment default. This means he will not be entitled to a grace period, and a late payment penalty will automatically be imposed. 123 AMENDING THE RULES FOR NEW AND INCREASED ASSESSMENTS BY THE COMMISSIONER (Clauses 113(1) and (5), 115, 117 and 118) Summary of proposed amendment A proposed amendment to section 142A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will remove the requirement to set a new due date for the payment of tax resulting from a new or amended assessment made by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. The timing and application of use-of-money interest (UOMI) and late payment penalties will remain unchanged. The change will allow the Commissioner to apply credits or refunds that become available in payment of the taxpayer’s tax liability from the moment the Commissioner has made a new or increased assessment. The proposed new rules will be built into Inland Revenue’s new software platform (START) and will apply to a tax type as and when the administration of that tax type is transitioned to START. This will happen in four stages. Application date The amendment will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features The bill proposes an amendment to section 142A so that the requirement to set a new due date for the payment of tax resulting from a new or increased assessment by the Commissioner made less than 30 days before, on or after the original due date is removed. Consequential amendments to sections 139B and 139BA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 are proposed to ensure that taxpayers will be given the same amount of time as they are currently given for the payment of tax before late payment penalties are imposed and collection actions other than the application of credits and refunds occur. Consequential changes to section 142B are also proposed to ensure that taxpayers will have the same amount of time for payment of any shortfall penalties. Use-of-money interest will continue to apply from the day after the original due date for payment of the tax. The only difference to the current rules will be that the Commissioner can apply credits or refunds the taxpayer has in payment of the taxpayer’s tax liabilit y fro m the moment the tax has been assessed in the situations addressed by section 142A. This reduces taxpayers’ interactions with the tax system and their risk of exposure to penalties and UOMI. The amendment would also avoid customisation of Inland Revenue’s new software platform, which will minimise its long-term cost. 124 Inland Revenue is moving the administration of the tax system to a new software platform on a tax-type by tax-type basis, in stages over a period of several years (four stages). To facilitate this, an amendment is proposed to section 142A to provide the Commissioner with a discretion to set a new due date for payment of the tax for tax types that are still administered in the old software platform. During stage 1 the administration of Goods and Services Tax (GST) is administered in START whereas the other tax types are administered in Inland Revenue’s old software platform (FIRST). This means, for example, that a taxpayer whose GST assessment is amended and increased will not receive a new due date for the payment of the increased amount of GST. The taxpayer will, however, have time for payment before late payment penalties apply. A taxpayer whose income tax assessment is amended and increased after the original due date will receive a new due date for payment of any increased income tax liability under the current rules during stage 1. Background At present, when the Commissioner makes a new assessment, or increases an assessment less than 30 days before, on or after the original due date for payment of the tax, a new due date is set for the payment of the tax resulting from the new or increased assessment (unless an exception applies). This is to allow the taxpayer time for payment before late payment penalties apply. The new due date is 30 or more days after the date of the notice of assessment (two calendar months in practice). A late payment penalty applies for amounts unpaid from the day after the new due date. Use-of-money interest, however, is calculated from the day after the original due date for payment of the tax for the assessed tax period. When a new due date is set for payment, credits or refunds becoming available before the new due date are generally refunded to the taxpayer. The taxpayer then needs to make a payment to Inland Revenue by the new due date shortly after receiving the refund. To give time before the imposition of late payment penalties on an assessment or re- assessment made close to, on or after the original due date, Inland Revenue’s FIRST software platform required a new due date to be set. Inland Revenue’s new START software platform has the ability to use the original due date for the payment of tax but allow time for payment before the imposition of late payment penalties. The effect of this is that the tax is due from the original due date and credits or refundable amounts are used to offset the tax liability. Incorporating a new due date rule would add to the complexity of the design of START. Taxpayers will have the ability to seek refunds operationally for amounts applied in payment of a new or increased tax liability that would previously have been refunded. 125 USE-OF-MONEY INTEREST AND TRANSFERS OF TAX (Clauses 106, 119 and 120) Summary of proposed amendment Amendments are being made to the Tax Administration Act 1994 to prevent taxpayers from transferring tax to an earlier period that exceeds the amount in debt or in dispute in that period, and to clarify when use-of-money interest (UOMI) starts and when a transfer takes effect for GST refunds and GST overpayments. Application date The amendments will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features The proposed amendments to sections 173L and 173M will limit transfers of excess tax within the taxpayer’s accounts or to another taxpayer to the total of the amount in debt and/or in dispute in the requested period. This limit will only apply to transfers to earlier periods, not to future periods. Amendments to section 173L also clarify the effective transfer date of GST refunds and overpayments. Changes to section 120C distinguish the rules that determine when UOMI starts for GST overpayments from the rules that determine when UOMI starts for GST refunds. This will ensure that the date UOMI begins for overpaid GST is consistent with when UOMI begins for other tax types that have been overpaid. Background Taxpayers are able to transfer tax credits to tax periods, tax types or other taxpayers. Currently, taxpayers are able to transfer amounts that exceed the amounts owing in previous periods. When this happens they are paid UOMI from an earlier date than if they had not moved the money. The Tax Administration Act does not distinguish between a GST refund, which occurs when GST inputs/expenses exceed GST outputs/sales, and a GST overpayment, which occurs when a taxpayer overpays their GST liability. As both scenarios result in a refund, it can be argued that a GST overpayment constitutes a refund, and is therefore eligible for the transfer date applicable to GST refunds, which is earlier than the transfer date applicable to overpayments. The date of transfer affects when UOMI on a previous overpayment stops being charged. Therefore a taxpayer transferring an overpayment of GST to settle a debt in a previous period will pay less UOMI to Inland Revenue than was intended because the payment will be transferred at the earlier refund date. The policy intent behind the proposed amendments is to ensure taxpayers are paid the correct amount of UOMI on overpayments or refunds of tax, and that taxpayers pay the correct amount of UOMI to Inland Revenue on underpayments of tax. 126 Other policy matters 127 128 COLLECTING TAX ON EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEMES USING THE PAYE SYSTEM – TECHNICAL CLARIFICATIONS (Clauses 57, 84, 85 and 92(7)) Summary of proposed amendments Two technical changes are proposed to the rules for employers to report and withhold tax on benefits received under an employee share scheme. The changes are intended to ensure the new rules operate effectively. Application date The proposed changes will come into force on 1 April 2017 and will apply to employment income received after that date. Key features The term “pay period” is replaced with “PAYE payment period” to avoid confusion between an employer’s payroll system and the timing of PAYE payments set out in section RD 22(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007. To assist employers calculating tax on extra pays in section RD 17 for a benefit under an employee share scheme, the proposed amendment to section RD 6(3) will provide certainty about the date when the benefit is treated as paid. Background The Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Act 2016 simplified the collection of tax on employment income in the form of benefits under an employee share purchase agreement. From 1 April 2017, the general PAYE collection rules in the Income Tax Act and disclosure rules in the Tax Administration Act have been changed to: • allow employers to choose to use the PAYE system and withhold tax on any employment income an employee receives under a share purchase agreement; and • require employers to report the value of any benefits an employee receives under a share purchase agreement via the employer monthly schedule (EMS). The changes should remove the obligation for most employees to include this form of employment income in a tax return. The changes in this bill provide additional clarity on how tax is withheld under the new rules. 129 STUDENT LOAN DRAFTING AMENDMENT (Clause 121) Summary of proposed amendment Section 27E(3)(b) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 refers to “applicant” when it should refer to “entity”. The bill proposes an amendment to rectify this. Application date The proposed amendment will come into force on 14 May 2016. 130

As such, the OECD has developed recommendations for anti- hybrid measures in its 15 point Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plan. Hybrid mismatch arrangements exploit the different ways that jurisdictions treat financial instruments and entities to create tax advantages. Because countries have different tax systems, misalignment of domestic rules is inevitable. The OECD recommendations attempt to prevent this misalignment from giving rise to unintended tax advantages. This is primarily done through the use of “linking rules” which change the usual tax treatment of cross-border transactions to ensure that there is no hybrid mismatch in such cases. Since hybrid mismatch arrangements are not necessarily artificial or contrived, the OECD recommendations are targeted at deliberate exploitation of hybrid mismatches. To achieve this, the proposed rules generally only apply to cross-border transactions involving related parties, as well as unrelated parties if the arrangement has been deliberately structured to produce a hybrid mismatch advantage. I f New Zealand were to adopt the OECD anti-hybrids recommendations, the rules would apply to foreign companies doing business in New Zealand as well as New Zealand-owned companies doing business offshore. It is expected that most hybrid arrangements would be replaced by more straightforward (non-BEPS) cross-border financing instruments and arrangements following the implementation of the OECD recommendations in New Zealand. R ules to counteract hybrid mismatch arrangements have been introduced in a number of countries. Notably, Australia and the UK are in the process of implementing the OECD recommendations into their domestic law. In addit io n, the European Council has issued a directive requiring EU member states to introduce anti-hybrid rules (currently on an intra-EU basis but expected to include arrangements involving non- EU countries in the future). T he purpose of this document is to seek comments on how the OECD recommendations could be implemented in New Zealand. Final policy decisions will only be made after the consultation phase. Part I of the document describes the problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements, the case for responding to the problem, and a summary of the OECD recommendations. Part II of the document explains the OECD recommendations in greater depth and discusses how they could be incorporated into New Zealand law. 1 Submissions The Government seeks submissions on how the OECD recommendations should best be incorporated into New Zealand law. Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations and should refer to the document’s labelled submission points where applicable. They should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for Inland Revenue and Treasury officials to contact those making the submission to discuss the points raised, if required. Submissions should be made by 17 October 2016 and can be emailed to policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements” in the subject line. Alternatively, submissions may be addressed to: Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their release. The withholding of particular submissions, or parts thereof, on the grounds of privacy, or commercial sensitivity, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. Those making a submission who consider that there is any part of it that should properly be withheld under the Act should clearly indicate this. In addition to seeking written submissions, Inland Revenue and Treasury officials intend to discuss the issues raised in this discussion document with key interested parties. 2 PART I Policy and principles 3 4 CHAPTER 1 Background Historic focus on the problem of double taxation 1.1 The global international tax framework reflected in international tax treaties and countries’ domestic tax rules recognises that income earned from cross- border activities is at risk of double taxation – once in the country where it is earned (the source state) and once in the country where the entity deriving the income is resident (the residence state). 1.2 Co-operation amo ng countries regarding income taxation has been mostly concerned with this risk of double taxation – when an item o f inco me is taxed under the domestic law of both the source and residence states and its harmful effects on cross-border trade and investment. The principal focus o f international tax treaties has been on eliminating double taxation through allocating taxing rights over cross-border income between the residence and source states. The problem of double non-taxation 1.3 Since late 2012, there has been growing awareness that the combination of different domestic tax rules and tax planning allows multinationals to pay little or no tax on their income anywhere in the world, if they choose to do so. This so-called double non-taxation (or less than single taxation) raises a number of tax policy issues. Many of the issues raised, such as distortionary effects and competitive concerns, are similar to those raised by double taxation. 1.4 The wide range of international tax planning techniques that are used to achieve double non-taxation are collectively referred to as “base erosion and profit shifting” or “BEPS”. As BEPS strategies take advantage of weaknesses in the current international tax framework and/or gaps or mismatches that result from the interaction of the tax systems of different countries, 1 it is impossible for any single country, acting alone, to fully address the issue. Recognising this, the OECD and G20 have taken the lead on work in this area, with the aim of developing a co-ordinated global approach to addressing BEPS concerns. 1 The issues coalesce such that rules developed to allocate income among countries can be manipulated to shift income away from its “true” source to low tax countries. 5 G20/OECD Action Plan 1.5 The OECD approach has been to develop specific recommendations for countries to implement, either through changes to their domestic laws, through treaty provisions, or multilaterally. The aim has been to give countries the tools necessary to ensure that profits are taxable, and taxable where the economic activities generating the profits are performed and where value is created. The OECD released an Action Plan on BEPS on 20 July 2013, containing a comprehensive package of measures to address BEPS concerns. 2 New Zealand has participated in the Action Plan work and supported it, particularly the intention that a co-ordinated global approach be taken to addressing BEPS concerns. The final BEPS package of recommendations was released on 5 October 2015, approved by G20 finance ministers on 9 October 2015, and by G20 leaders during their annual summit on 15–16 November 2015. Hybrid mismatch arrangements 1.6 Hybrid mismatch arrangements are identified in the Action Plan as an important source of BEPS concerns. Action 2 of the Action Plan aims to neutralise their effects by developing model treaty provisions and recommendations regarding the design of domestic tax rules. 1.7 Hybrid mismatch arrangements exploit differences in the tax treatment of an entity or instrument under the laws of two or more countries to achieve double non-taxation (including long-term tax deferral) by, for example, creating two deductions for one borrowing or creating a deduction without a corresponding income inclusion. Mostly, the tax result comes from a mismatch of domestic laws, but double tax agreements can be used to enhance the tax benefit by, for example, eliminating or reducing source state withholding taxes. It is often difficult to determine which of the countries involved has lost tax revenue, but there is a reduction of total tax paid. 1.8 Wit h many hybrid mismatch arrangements involving New Zealand taxpayers, the exploited mismatch is between New Zealand and Australia’s domestic rules. For example, a number of New Zealand taxpayers have been involved in recent tax avoidance litigation with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner), which concern funding arrangements that exploit the different tax treatment between Australia and New Zealand of optional convertible notes (a hybrid financial instrument) issued by the New Zealand taxpayer to their Australian parent. Similarly, tax disputes have arisen between New Zealand taxpayers and the Commissioner over the tax effects of arrangements that exploit the different ways in which Australia and New Zealand treat Australian limited partnerships. 2 OECD (2013), Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, OECD Publishing. http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264202719-en (OECD BEPS Action Plan). 6 OECD recommendations 1.9 As part of a first set of deliverables under the Action Plan, the OECD released a paper containing recommendations regarding hybrid mismatch arrangements in September 2014. 3 A final report was released in October 2015, 4 as part of the final BEPS package, containing further work on various remaining technical issues, and additional guidance and practical examples explaining the operation of the recommendations in further detail. The recommendations are for specific improvements to domestic rules to prevent mismatches arising and neutralise their effect, and for changes to the OECD Model Tax Convention 5 to deal with hybrid entities, and the interaction between domestic rules and the OECD Model. The recommended hybrid mismatch rules are primarily linking rules that seek to align the tax treatment of a hybrid entity or instrument with the tax treatment in the counterparty country, but do not otherwise disturb the commercial outcomes. 1.10 New Zealand already has some rules that deter and prevent hybrid mismatch arrangements from arising. However, the OECD recommendations on hybrid mismatch arrangements are comprehensive by comparison. Implementation of OECD recommendations 1.11 With the release of the Final Report, along with the Action Plan as a package of recommendations, governments will now look to implement the results into their domestic rules. Although it remains to be seen where different countries will land in terms of implementation, there is an expectation that countries that are part of the consensus will act. 1.12 The United Kingdom and Australia have both already committed to implementing the OECD recommendations into their domestic law. In addition, EU member states have been issued a directive to implement anti- hybrid measures for transactions between EU members, with further action on rules applying to non-EU countries expected later this year. 3 OECD (2014), Neutralising the Effects of Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements, OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, OECD Publishing. http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264218819-en (OECD 2014 Interim Report). 4 OECD (2015), Neutralising the Effects of Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements, Action 2 – 2015 Final Report, OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, OECD Publishing, Paris. http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264241138-en (OECD 2015 Final Report). 5 OECD (2014), Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version 2014, OECD Publishing. http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/mtc\_cond-2014-en (OECD Model). 7 CHAPTER 2 Hybrid mismatch arrangements 2.1 A “hybrid mismatch arrangement”, as defined by the OECD: 6 ... exploits a difference in the tax treatment of an entity or instrument under the laws of two or more tax countries to produce a mismatch in tax outcomes where the mismatch has the effect of lowering the aggregate tax burden of the parties to the arrangement. 2.2 Thus, a taxpayer with activities in more than one country may have opportunities to escape taxation through the use of hybrid mismatch arrangements. 2.3 In the vast majority of cases, the tax outcome comes from a mismatch of domestic laws. However, double tax agreements can be used to enhance a tax benefit (for example, via the elimination or reduction of withholding taxes at source). The use of hybrid mismatch arrangements puts the collective tax base of countries at risk, although it is often difficult to determine which individual country has lost tax revenue under an arrangement. 2.4 Action 2 of the OECD Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) calls for domestic rules targeting mismatches that rely on a hybrid element to produce the following three tax advantage outcomes: 7 • Deduction no inclusion (D/NI): Payments that give rise to a deduction under the rules of one country but are not included as taxable income for the recipient in another. • Double deduction (DD): Payments that give rise to two deductions for the same payment. • Indirect deduction no inclusion (indirect D/NI): Payments that are deductible under the rules of the payer country and where the income is taxable to the payee, but offset against a deduction under a hybrid mismatch arrangement. 2.5 The mismatches targeted are those arising in the context of payments as opposed to, for example, a mismatch arising from rules that allow a taxpayer “deemed” interest deductions for equity capital. 2.6 In broad terms, hybrid mismatch arrangements can be divided into the following categories based on the particular hybrid technique that produces the tax outcome: 6 OECD 2014 Interim Report at para 41. 7 OECD 2015 Final Report at para 6. 8 • Hybrid instruments exploit a conflict in the tax treatment of an instrument in two or more countries. These arrangements can use: – Hybrid financial instruments, under which taxpayers take mutually incompatible positions regarding the treatment of the same payment under the instrument; – Hybrid transfers, under which taxpayers take mutually incompatible positions regarding who has the ownership rights in an asset; or – Substitute payments, under which a taxable payment in effect becomes non-taxable by virtue of a transfer of the instrument giving rise to it. • Hybrid entities exploit a difference in the tax treatment of an entity in two or more countries (generally a conflict between transparency and opacity). 2.7 Hybrid entities and instruments can be embedded in a wider arrangement or structure to produce indirect D/NI outcomes. Hybrid instruments Hybrid financial instruments 2.8 A simple arrangement involving the use of a hybrid financial instrument is set out below. Figure 2.1: Hybrid financial instrument 8 A Co. B Co. + - H yb rid Financial Instrument Deductible Country B Country A N on-assessable 2.9 Under the arrangement, B Co (resident in Country B) issues a hybrid financial instrument to its parent A Co (resident in Country A). Country B treats the instrument as debt, so that payments under the instrument are treated as deductible interest to B Co. Country A treats the instrument as equity, so that payments under the instrument are treated as exempt dividends (or otherwise tax relieved) to A Co. The tax outcome is D/NI. 8 OECD 2014 Interim Report at p33. 9 2.10 A number of New Zealand taxpayers have had recent involvement in tax avoidance litigation with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue regarding their use of hybrid financial instruments in funding arrangements with their offshore parents. 2.11 In Alesco New Zealand Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue, 9 the New Zealand Court of Appeal considered one such arrangement as a test case. The New Zealand taxpayer had issued optional convertible notes to its Australian parent; treated as part debt and part equity in New Zealand, but exclusively equity in Australia. Outside of tax avoidance, the tax outcome was D/NI: a New Zealand deduction for the interest notionally paid by the New Zealand taxpayer on the debt component of the notes, 10 but no interest income to the Australian parent for which it would otherwise have been liable for Australian taxation. The Court of Appeal’s holding that the arrangement was tax avoidance was not based on the Australian tax treatment. 2.12 Apart from taxpayers formally bound by the Alesco ruling, a number of New Zealand taxpayers have, in recent times, entered into arrangements under which they have issued mandatory convertible notes (MCNs) to their offshore parents. Commonly, interest is accrued over the term of the arrangement, and at maturity, the issuer’s interest obligation is satisfied by issuing shares. As New Zealand treats the MCN as debt, the arrangement gives rise to deductible interest to the New Zealand issuer, 11 but the issue o f shares to satisfy the New Zealand issuer’s interest obligation does not result in income to the offshore parent (that is, D/NI). 2.13 The Commissioner has challenged a number of the arrangements using MCNs as tax avoidance arrangements. Under recent Australian domestic rule changes, a D/NI outcome can potentially now be achieved using an MCN with cash interest payments. Previously, Australia’s non-portfolio foreign dividend exemption would not have applied had cash interest (rather than the issue of shares) been paid under the MCN, because an MCN is not legal form equit y. 12 Now, such payments would likely be exempt in Australia; 13 the amendments ensure that Australia’s non-portfolio foreign dividend exemption applies to returns on instruments that are legal form debt but that Australia characterises as equity, as a matter of substance, under its debt-equit y rules. 14 9 Alesco New Zealand Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2013\] NZCA 40, \[2013\] 2 NZLR 175. 10 With no New Zealand non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) liability. 11 And no New Zealand NRWT obligation. 12 Section 23AJ of the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 – repealed under item 1 of Part 1, Schedule 2 to the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2014 Measures No. 4) Act 2014. 13 Although prima facie subject to New Zealand non-resident withholding tax. 14 The Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2014 Measures No. 4) Act 2014 received Royal assent on 16 October 2014. The relevant provisions apply the day after Royal assent: section 2 and Part 4 of Schedule 2. 10 2.14 A third common form of trans-Tasman hybrid financial instrument is frankable/deductible instruments issued by the New Zealand branch of some Australian banks to the Australian public. 15 Typically, these instruments qualify as bank capital for Australian regulatory purposes. As with the MCNs, the bank issuer claims a New Zealand tax deduction for the coupon on these instruments. The Australian tax treatment is different. The instruments are treated as equity for Australian tax purposes, but because they are held by portfolio investors, the return is taxable. However, the bank attaches franking credits to the coupon. The credits work in the same way as New Zealand imputation credits. The credits are not generated by the investment of the funds raised by issue of the instruments – because that income is earned by the New Zealand branch of the Australian bank it is not subject to Australian income tax. So the Australian bank obtains a New Zealand income tax deduction for a payment which for Australian tax purposes is treated in the hands of the payee as made out of fully (Australian) taxed income. 2.15 This type of instrument is considered in Example 2.1 of the Final Report, which concludes that it gives rise to a hybrid mismatch. Hybrid transfers 2.16 A simplified arrangement involving a hybrid transfer is set out in Figure 2.2. 2.17 Typically, a hybrid transfer is a collateralised loan arrangement or share lending transaction where the counterparties in different countries are each treated for tax purposes as the owner of the loan collateral or subject matter of the share loan. In the arrangement set out in the figure below, the mismatch arises because Country A taxes the arrangement in accordance with its economic substance (a loan with the shares as collateral), while Country B (like New Zealand) taxes in accordance with the arrangement’s legal form (a sale and repurchase or “repo” of the shares). Figure 2.2: Hybrid transfer – share repo 16 B Co. B Sub +- O bligation to p ay p ur chase pr ice Dividend Country BCountry A Right to acquire B Sub -+ A Co. 15 See Mills v Commissioner of Taxation \[2012\] HCA 51. 16 OECD 2014 Interim Report at p35. 11 2.18 A Co (resident in Country A) owns B Sub (resident in Country B). A Co sells its B Sub shares to B Co under an arrangement that A Co will reacquire those shares at a future date for an agreed price reflecting an interest charge reduced by any dividends B Co receives on the B Sub shares. Between sale and repurchase, B Sub pays dividends on the shares to B Co. In Country A, A Co is treated as receiving these dividends and paying them to B Co as a deductible financing cost. In Country B, B Co is treated as receiving the dividends, which are tax exempt. The tax effect is D/NI. Hybrid entities Disregarded payments made by a hybrid payer 2.19 A simplified arrangement involving the use of a hybrid entity to achieve a D/NI outcome is set out in Figure 2.3. Figure 2.3: Disregarded payments made by a hybrid entity 17 A Co. + - InterestLoan Country B Country A B Sub 1 B Co. 2.20 A Co (resident in Country A) indirectly holds B Sub 1 (resident in Country B) through B Co, a hybrid entity treated as transparent in Country A, but opaque in Country B. B Co borrows from A Co, and pays interest on the loan, which is treated as deductible in Country B. The deduction can be used to offset income in B Sub 1’s group of companies in Country B. As Country A treats B Co as transparent (and as A Co is the only shareholder in B Co), the loan, and interest on the loan, between A Co and B Co, is disregarded in Country A (that is, a D/NI result). 18 17 OECD 2014 Interim Report at p42. The tax outcomes of the arrangement are described at paras 73–74. This structure is also at the core of Example 3.1 of the OECD 2015 Final Report at p288. 18 The treaty implications relate to whether, and to what extent, Countries A and B are limited by the relevant treaty in taxing the income of A Co. Under the OECD Model, an amount arising in Country B is paid to a resident of Country A, so, prima facie, the benefits of Article 11 (Interest) would be granted. 12 2.21 New Zealand unlimited liability companies are used to play the role of B Co in the figure above to achieve a D/NI (inbound) outcome. The United States’ domestic “check the box” rules allow a New Zealand unlimited liability company, treated as opaque by New Zealand, to be treated as transparent for United States income tax. 2.22 The creation of a permanent establishment in the payer country can be used to achieve a similar D/NI outcome. For example, a subsidiary company resident in an overseas jurisdiction could borrow from its parent company resident in the same jurisdiction. If the subsidiary allocates the loan to a New Zealand branch, the interest paid on the loan would be treated as deductible in New Zealand (but subject to New Zealand non-resident withholding tax). However, a tax consolidation of the subsidiary with its parent would mean that the interest payment is disregarded in the overseas jurisdiction. Deductible payments made by a hybrid payer 2.23 A simplified arrangement using a hybrid entity to achieve a DD outcome is set out in Figure 2.4. Figure 2.4: DD arrangement using hybrid entity 19 A Co. +- Interest Loan Country B Country A B Sub 1 B Co. Bank 2.24 Under the arrangement, A Co (resident in Country A) owns all the shares of B Co (resident in Country B). B Co borrows from the bank and pays interest on the loan, deriving no other income. As Country A treats B Co as transparent, A Co is treated as the borrower by Country A. However, as Country B treats B Co as opaque, B Co is treated as the borrower by Country B. The result is a deduction for the interest expenditure in Country A and B (that is, a DD outcome). If B Co is consolidated for tax purposes with its operating subsidiary B Sub 1, B Co can surrender its tax deduction to B Sub 1, allowing two deductions for the same interest expense to be offset against separate income arising in Country A and Country B. 19 OECD 2014 Interim Report at p51. 13 2.25 Australian limited partnerships (treated as transparent in New Zealand, but opaque in Australia) are used to achieve an outbound DD result in essentially the manner described in the example above. 20 2.26 As with D/NI, the creation of a permanent establishment in the payer country can be used to achieve a similar DD outcome, if the income and expense o f the permanent establishment is eligible to be consolidated or grouped for tax purposes in that country. Reverse hybrids 2.27 A simplified arrangement using a reverse hybrid is set out in Figure 2.5. A reverse hybrid is a hybrid entity that is treated as opaque by its foreign investor, but transparent in the country of its establishment (in the reverse of the examples described above). Figure 2.5: Payment to a reverse hybrid 21 A Co. - Interest Loan Country B Country A B Co. C Co. Country C + 2.28 A Co (resident in Country A, the investor country) owns all the shares in B Co, (the reverse hybrid established in Country B, the establishment country). Country B treats B Co as transparent, but Country A treats B Co as opaque. C Co (resident in Country C, the payer country) borrows money from B Co and makes interest payments under the loan. The outcome is D/NI if the interest paid by C Co is deductible in the payer country (Country C), but not included as income under the domestic rules of either the investor or establishment country (Country A or B), because each country treats the income as having been derived by a resident of the other country, and Country B does not treat the income as sourced in Country B. 20 The Australian limited partnership (ALP) would have an Australian-resident partner and a New Zealand-resident partner, but the New Zealand-resident partner could hold up to 99.99 percent of the ALP in order to maximise the tax advantage (the DD outcome). 21 OECD 2014 Interim Report at p45. 14 2.29 Controlled foreign company (CFC) rules in the investor country that tax the income of residents earned through CFCs on an accrual basis would eliminate such mismatches. However, New Zealand’s CFC rules contain an active income exemption as well as a safe harbour, under which passive income is not subject to accrual taxation if it is less than 5 percent of total income. Indirect outcomes 2.30 The effect of a hybrid mismatch that arises between two countries can be imported into another country to create an indirect D/NI outcome, if the first two countries do not have hybrid mismatch rules. An example of this is set out in Figure 2.6. Figure 2.6: Imported mismatch from hybrid financial instrument 22 Loan A Co. + - H yb rid Financial Instrument Country B Country A Borrower Co. B Co. Country C - + 2.31 A Co lends money to B Co, a wholly owned subsidiary of A Co, using a hybrid financial instrument, so that payments under the instrument are exempt in Country A, but deductible in Country B. Neither Country A nor Country B has hybrid mismatch rules. Borrower Co then borrows from B Co. Interest payable under the loan is deductible in Country C (Borrower Co’s country of residence) and taxable income in Country B. The result is an indirect D/NI outcome between Countries A and C (Country B’s tax revenue is unaffected as the income and deductions of B Co are offset). 2.32 It is difficult for tax investigators to detect imported hybrid mismatches, as detection requires a broad understanding of a taxpayer group’s international financing structure. This information is often not publicly available, and can be difficult to obtain from the New Zealand taxpayer. However, if a country were to introduce hybrid mismatch rules without a rule against imported hybrid mismatches that could allow so me taxpayers to seek to exploit that gap. This would be against the intended outcome of the rules which is that the tax advantages of hybrid mismatches are neutralised, leading taxpayers to, in most cases, adopt more straightforward cross-border financing instruments and structures. 22 OECD 2014 Interim Report at p59. 15 CHAPTER 3 Policy issues 3.1 Addressing hybrid mismatches is a key part of the G20/OECD Action Plan (Action Plan) to address base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). The nature of BEPS means that countries must take a global perspective in tackling BEPS issues, and attempt to reach consensus on a co-ordinated response. In terms o f hybrid mismatch arrangements, the double non-taxation result can only arise because of the lack of consistency in the tax treatment of an entity or instrument among countries. 3.2 In considering how best to respond to the problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements, the Government is aware that a non-OECD approach could be taken. For instance, some countries are of the view that not implementing the OECD recommendations is in their best interests. Another option is for New Zealand to introduce specific rules targeting the hybrid mismatch arrangements that are known to affect New Zealand. 3.3 This chapter discusses the merits for New Zealand of: • adopting the OECD recommendations • introducing a set of targeted anti-hybrid rules and • doing nothing in respect of hybrid mismatch arrangements. Global impact of hybrid mismatch arrangements 3.4 The ability of multinational enterprises with access to sophisticated tax advice to take advantage of hybrid mismatch opportunities may provide an unintended competitive advantage over businesses that cannot. 23 The OECD has found some evidence that mult inat ional enterprises with tax planning opportunities tend to have greater market dominance and higher price mark- ups compared with other firms. 24 3.5 This may lead to welfare losses. For example, the OECD has identified that reduced competition can reduce the need to innovate in order to stay ahead of compet itors. Further, differences in the effective tax rate facing multinational enterprises able to exploit mismatches and other firms may also result in a sub-optimal allocation of capital if it means the multinational enterprise crowds out potentially more productive investment by other firms. 25 23 For example, the mismatch may allow the multinational to reduce its prices in the short term with a view to gaining a dominate market share (and then increase prices to increase profits). 24 OECD (2015), Measuring and Monitoring BEPS, Action 11 – 2015 Final Report, OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, OECD Publishing, Paris. http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264241343-en (Action 11 Final Report) at p169. 25 Action 11 Final Report at p170. The OECD also notes, however, that if tax planning multinational enterprises are more productive than the firms they crowd out, the overall effect on efficiency is unclear. 16 3.6 A related issue is that global resource allocation may be distorted by the availability of hybrid mismatch opportunities. International investment decisions may be made based on whether a mismatch is available rather than fundamental economics. 3.7 From a global perspective, hybrid mismatch arrangements typically lead to a reduction of the overall tax paid by the parties involved as a whole. The use of these arrangements has caused a significant drop in worldwide corporate tax revenue, although precisely estimating this loss is a difficult task. Perhaps the best estimate comes from the OECD, which has put the reduction in worldwide corporate tax revenue due to mismatches and preferential tax regimes at between 1.3 and 3 percent (between US$33 and US$79 billion in 2014). 26 3.8 The drop in tax revenues from the use of hybrid mismatch arrangements has real distributional consequences. It means governments must impose higher taxes elsewhere in their economies in order to deliver the desired level of public services. This reduces worldwide welfare. The costs associated with imposing tax generally increase more than proportionately as tax rates increase. Imposing higher taxes elsewhere in order to make up lost tax revenue due to the use of hybrids is likely to be less efficient than imposing more moderate taxes across all economic actors. 3.9 Hybrid mismatch opportunities may also contribute to financial instability through increases in tax-leveraged borrowing, or as a result of businesses entering into investments which are uneconomic before tax, but marginally viable after tax as a result of taking advantage of such an opportunity. 3.10 Allowing the use of hybrids is also inequitable as it results in uneven tax burdens across different businesses. This is an issue in itself, but may also weaken taxpayer morale. The perception of unfairness that comes from the reported low corporate taxes paid by taxpayers who can take advantage of hybrid mismatch opportunities (and/or employ other BEPS strategies) is an issue. This perception of unfairness undermines public confidence in the tax system and therefore the willingness of taxpayers to voluntarily co mply wit h their own tax obligations. 3.11 The OECD’s recommendations represent an agreement by participating countries that hybrid mismatch arrangements should be neutralised and also how they should be neutralised. While tolerating mismatches in some cases may have benefits to one country (at the expense of another), that behaviour carries a range of negative consequences. It harms competition, reduces worldwide revenue collection in an arbitrary and unintended way, results in inefficient investment decisions and damages the public’s perception of the “fairness” of the tax system. 26 Action 11 Final Report at p168. The method adopted by the OECD means that losses due to hybrids and preferential regimes cannot be disentangled. 17 Uptake in other countries 3.12 The Australian Government asked the Australian Board of Taxation to consult on implementation of the OECD recommendations in 2015. 27 The Board released a discussion paper regarding implementation, inviting written submissions, on 20 November 2015, 28 and reported to the Australian Government in March 2016. 29 The Australian Government then committed to implementing the OECD’s recommendations on hybrid mismatch arrangements anti-hybrid rules as part of its Budget 2016–17. 30 The Board has further been tasked with examining how best to implement the OECD recommendations in respect of hybrid regulatory capital and is due to report back by the end of July 2016. 3.13 The Government of the United Kingdom has already consulted on adopting the OECD’s approach to addressing hybrid mismatches, 31 and has now introduced legislation to Parliament (see Schedule 10 of the Finance (No.2) Bill). The intention is that the legislation will have effect fro m 1 January 2017. 32 3.14 The Council of the European Union adopted the Anti Tax Avoidance Directive in June 2016, which sets out six anti-avoidance measures that all EU member states must implement into their own tax systems by 31 December 2018. One of the six anti-avoidance measures is to implement rules to counteract intra-EU hybrid mismatch arrangements. 33 The European Council, with reference to the OECD recommendations, has also asked the European Commission to propose rules by October 2016 that apply to hybrid mismatch arrangements involving non-EU countries. 3.15 Some countries have introduced domestic rules to combat the effects of hybrid mismatch arrangements prior to the OECD BEPS project or without explicitly following the OECD recommendations. These countries include Denmark, France, Spain, Mexico and Austria, while Germany and Hungary have proposed to introduce rules in the future. Impact of hybrid mismatch arrangements on New Zealand 3.16 New Zealand has a general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR) that can, in some instances, neutralise the tax effects of a hybrid mismatch arrangement (such as the arrangement in Alesco). However, the target of the GAAR is arrangements that avoid New Zealand tax. The arrangement must also do so in a manner that is outside Parliament’s contemplation; a classic indicator 27 The terms of reference for this project can be found at http://taxboard.gov.au/consultation/implementation-of-anti-hybrid-rules/ 28 Board of Taxation, Implementation of the OECD anti-hybrid rules (2015). http://taxboard.gov.au/files/2015/08/BoT-Anti-h ybrid-Discussion-Paper.pdf 29 This report was subsequently released to the public on 3 May 2016. http://taxboard.gov.au/files/2016/05/Implementation-of-the-OECD-hybrid-mismatch-rules.pdf 30 2016–17 Budget Paper No 2 – Revenue Measures p34. 31 HM Treasury and HM Revenue & Customs, Tackling aggressive tax planning: implementing the agreed G20- OECD approach for addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements (December 2014). 32 Refer to s 22 of the Schedule to Clause 33 (Hybrid and Other Mismatches) of the Finance Bill 2016 (United Kingdom). 33 Article 9 of Council Directive FISC 104 ECOFIN 628, 17 June 2016. 18 being that the arrangement gains the advantage in an artificial or contrived way. 34 Although the use of a hybrid mismatch arrangement reduces the overall tax paid by the parties to the arrangement, it is often difficult to determine which country involved has lost tax revenue. Further, the use of a hybrid is not necessarily artificial or contrived in and of itself. Accordingly, the GAAR does not provide a comprehensive solution to counter the use of hybrid mismatch arrangements. This is also seen in Australia where the “black letter” tax treatment of the hybrid instruments in the Mills case referred to above was not reversed by the equivalent Australian anti- avoidance provision, on the basis that the tax benefit was incidental to the commercial benefit. 3.17 The New Zealand tax revenue loss caused by the use of hybrids is difficult to estimate because the full extent of hybrid mismatch arrangements involving New Zealand is unknown. However, the tax revenue at stake is significant in the cases that the Government is aware of, which shows a clear advantage to counteracting hybrid mismatch arrangements. For example, the amount at issue under all funding arrangements comparable to the Alesco arrangement referred to in Chapter 2 was approximately $300 million (across mult iple years). In relat ion to hybrid entities, deductions claimed in New Zealand that are attributable to some prominent hybrid entity structures result in approximately $80 million less tax revenue for New Zealand per year. 3.18 However, it is possible that a particular hybrid mismatch will be to New Zealand’s benefit (and to another country’s detriment). If an arrangement results in the elimination of residence-country taxation, the return to the investor will increase while New Zealand will continue to earn the same level of tax revenue. The investor will have incentives to increase their investment in New Zealand. 3.19 On the other hand, a hybrid mismatch may also result in the elimination o f tax in New Zealand. If the availability of the hybrid means the investor invests using the hybrid instead of equity – or crowds out investment by another investor who would have invested through equity – the result is a clear welfare loss for New Zealand. Tax revenues would fall and actual investment in New Zealand would remain unchanged. 3.20 Importantly, it is generally impossible to tell which of these situations will arise: whether a hybrid mismatch will result in the elimination of residence- country tax or the elimination of New Zealand tax. More broadly, even if it could be shown that New Zealand would be the beneficiary of a hybrid mismatch, it is an open question whether allowing the mismatch to be exploited would be appropriate. The double non-taxation benefits that arise fro m explo it ing hybrid mismatches are (except in very unusual cases) not intended by either country. New Zealand would obviously welcome an intentional foreign policy that makes it more attractive for non-residents to invest here. Allowing the exploitation of unintended mismatches in tax rules to achieve non-taxation of income is another matter. 34 Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2008\] NZSSC 115, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289 (SC). 19 3.21 The use of hybrid mismatches can result in losses to New Zealand in other ways as well. For example, hybrids have been an important feature of tax avoidance arrangements in recent history. A simple example using a hybrid financial instrument is illustrated in Figure 3.1 below. Figure 3.1: Pure economic loss A Co. New Zealand Australia Third Country Co. NZ Co. Third Country Income ($1 00) Deduction (-$1 00) = 0 Deductible (-$1 00) N on-assessable ($1 00) = -$1 00 H yb rid Financial Instrument Investment$1 00 Loan Assessable ($1 00) 3.22 Prior to the arrangement, A Co (resident in Australia) invests into a subsidiary, Third Country Co (resident in a third country) by way of a loan. Interest payable under the loan is deductible to Third Country Co under the third country’s domestic rules, and taxable to A Co under Australia’s domestic rules. However, A Co also has a subsidiary resident in New Zealand, NZ Co, paying New Zealand tax. Under the arrangement, A Co instead lends to Third Country Co through NZ Co, using a hybrid financial instrument on the New Zealand/third country leg. As a result, the group can obtain an additional deduction for its financing cost. The outcome is a pure economic loss to New Zealand – a reduction in New Zealand tax with no change in economic activity. 3.23 As other countries adopt the OECD recommendations, the case for New Zealand to also adopt the recommendations is strengthened. This is because, depending on how taxpayers react to the rules, a hybrid mismatch arrangement involving a New Zealand counterparty may still be countered (thus eliminating the benefit of the use of the hybrid to New Zealand, if there is one), but the tax collected would be by the counterparty country, rather than New Zealand due to the primary/defensive rule structure of the OECD recommendat ions. In particular, there would likely be scenarios where Australia and the United Kingdom (who are both key sources of inbound and outbound investment for New Zealand) would counteract a hybrid mismatch arrangement involving New Zealand and collect all of the result ing revenue. These scenarios provide an incentive for New Zealand to follow Australia and the United Kingdom in adopting the OECD recommendations. 20 3.24 Further, hybrid mismatch arrangements involving New Zealand and other countries that do not adopt the OECD recommendations will be left unresolved unless New Zealand adopts the OECD recommendations. 3.25 However, instead of adopting the OECD recommendations in their entirety, New Zealand also has the option of introducing rules that specifically target the known hybrid mismatch arrangements affecting New Zealand, such as ALPs and MCNs. This approach may reduce complexity, as fewer rules would be needed (at least initially) in comparison to a full adoption of the OECD recommendations. However, it would be difficult to precisely identify the rules that would be needed and the rules that would not. Also, it is likely that taxpayers would respond to targeted rules by exploiting other tax planning opportunities left open by this approach. The Government is therefore of the view that adopting the comprehensive set of OECD recommendations at the onset is a proactive, and likely cleaner option. Adopting the recommendations in full also has the advantage of being consistent with the intended approach of Australia and the United Kingdom. 3.26 The Government’s desire is that any new rules addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements should be effective from a policy perspective, but be as simple as possible to comply with and administer. In considering the need for simplicity, the Government will take into account the fact that in most cases, the impact of hybrid mismatch rules will be to encourage businesses to use simpler structures which do not require the rules to be applied. 3.27 Taking the discussed factors and arguments into account, the best approach for New Zealand is likely to be to co-operate with other countries to eliminate hybrid mismatches by adopting the OECD recommendations. As noted above, when companies exploit hybrid mismatches, the result is that no tax is paid anywhere on a portion of income. This leads to an inefficient allocation of investment as cross-border investments where mismatches are available are subsidised relative to other investments. Eliminating this misallocation would increase worldwide efficiency, leading to higher worldwide inco mes – which New Zealand will likely share in. 21 CHAPTER 4 OECD recommendations 4.1 The OECD’s recommended domestic rules under Action 2 aim to eliminate the tax benefit of using a hybrid mismatch arrangement. 4.2 The most effective way to do this would be to harmonise the tax rules of the countries concerned. If, for example, all countries had the same rules for distinguishing debt from equity, the opportunity to arbitrage the debt/equit y distinction would no longer arise. However, as harmonisation does not seem possible even for the most commonly exploited differences in tax treatment of instruments and entities, this approach is only theoretical. 4.3 Instead, the OECD has recommended domestic rules that consist of: • specific improvements to domestic rules designed to achieve a better alignment between those rules and their intended tax policy outcomes (specific recommendations); and • rules that neutralise the tax outcomes of a hybrid mismatch by linking the tax outcomes of a payment made by an entity or under an instrument to the tax outcomes in the counterparty country (hybrid mismatch rules). 4.4 There is an expectation that the OECD’s recommended rules be used as a template for reform. By doing so, a consistent approach to addressing hybrid mismatches will be applied across countries. Consistent rules that are consistently applied across countries will best ensure that the rules are effective at eliminating double non-taxation, while minimising the risk of double taxation and compliance and administrative costs for both taxpayers and administrators. However, the proposed hybrid mismatch rules are designed so that the effects of a hybrid mismatch will be neutralised, even if the counterparty country has not adopted such rules. 4.5 This document proposes that New Zealand introduces domestic rules that are largely in line with the OECD recommendations, with only minor adjustments of those recommendations to ensure that they make sense in terms of New Zealand’s other domestic rules and international tax framework. Final policy decisions will only be made on the outcome of consultation with the businesses that will have to apply any new rules. Hybrid mismatch rules – OECD recommendations 4.6 The OECD recommendations include a series of “linking rules” which adjust the tax treatment of a hybrid mismatch arrangement in one country by reference to the tax treatment in the counterparty country, without disturbing any of the other tax, commercial or regulatory consequences. 22 4.7 The target of the rules is D/NI, DD and indirect D/NI mismatches that arise from payments. The OECD considers that rules that, for example, entitle a taxpayer to “deemed” interest deductions for equity capital, are economically more akin to a tax exemption, so do not produce a mismatch in the sense targeted. 35 The recommended rules are not generally intended to pick up mismatches that result from differences in the value ascribed to a payment. For example, a mismatch in tax outcomes as a result of foreign currency fluctuations on a loan, 36 or differences due solely to timing. They do apply to deductions which, although attributable to payments, are not for the payments themselves, such as interest calculated under the financial arrangement rules. 4.8 While cross-border mismatches arise in other contexts (for example, the payment of deductible interest to a tax-exempt entity, or the sale of an asset from a capital account holder to a trader), the mismatches targeted are only those that rely on a hybrid element to produce the outcome. 37 4.9 The OECD recommended rules are organised into a hierarchy, which takes the form of a primary rule and a secondary, defensive, rule. This hierarchy approach means that double taxation is avoided because the defensive rule only applies when there is no hybrid mismatch rule or the rule is not applied in the counterparty country. It also means that the effects of a hybrid mismatch are neutralised by the operation of the defensive rule even if the counterparty country does not have effective hybrid mismatch rules. 4.10 If New Zealand follows the approach adopted in the UK legislation, it is likely that these linking rules would form a separate subpart in the Income Tax Act. Recommendation 1: Hybrid financial instrument rule 4.11 The hybrid financial instrument rule applies to payments under a financial instrument that can be expected to result in a hybrid mismatch (that is, a D/NI result). A financial instrument can be either a financial arrangement or an equity instrument. The primary rule is for the payer country to neutralise the mismatch by denying the deduction. If it does not, the payee country should tax the payment. Countries only need to apply this rule to payments under financial instruments as characterised under their own domestic law. So, for example, a cross-border lease payment by a resident under an operating lease is not subject to this rule, even if the lessor country treats the lease as a finance lease. 4.12 The rule also applies to substitute payments, which are payments under a transfer of a financial instrument which in effect undermine the integrity of the rules. This will be the case if the transfer and substitute payment secure a better tax outcome than if the transfer had not taken place. 38 35 2015 Hybrids Report at para 28. 36 2015 Hybrids Report at para 54. 37 2015 Hybrids Report at paras 91–98. 38 2015 Hybrids Report at para 79. 23 4.13 The reason for dealing with the deduction first is that it will generally be apparent that a deduction for a payment is being claimed in a country, and then it is possible to determine whether that payment is included in income in the payee country. However, it may not be as straightforward to identify the non-inclusion of a payment in income. 4.14 This rule only applies to payments between related parties (broadly, 25 percent or more common ownership) or under structured arrangements. A structured arrangement is defined in Recommendation 10. In broad terms it is an arrangement that is designed to produce a hybrid mismatch. These limitations are designed so that the rules apply in situations when the part ies are able to obtain information about, or should be aware of, the tax treatment of the payment to the counterparty. Recommendation 2: Specific recommendation for the tax treatment of financial instruments 4.15 The OECD’s recommendations for specific improvements to domest ic rules for taxing financial instruments are rules that: 39 • deny a dividend exemption (or equivalent relief from economic double taxation) for deductible payments made under financial instruments; • prevent hybrid transfers being used to duplicate foreign tax credits for taxes withheld at source, by limiting the amount of a credit to the amount of tax on the net income. A hybrid transfer is a transfer of a financial instrument where differences in two country’s tax rules mean each treats the financial instrument as held by a resident. 4.16 This recommendation has no limitation of scope (for example, it is not limited to related parties or structured arrangements). Recommendation 3: Disregarded hybrid payments rule 4.17 The third recommendation is to neutralise mismatches arising from payments (whether or not in relation to a financial instrument) by hybrid payers. • The payer country should deny a deduction for a payment that gives rise to a D/NI outcome. • If it does not do so, the amount should be included in income in the payee country. • No mismatch will arise to the extent that the deduction in the payer country is offset against income that is included in taxable income in both the payee and payer country (dual inclusion income). • Disallowed deductions can be carried forward and offset against dual inclusion income in future years. 39 2015 Hybrids Report at para 5. 24 4.18 So, for example, if a hybrid entity makes a deductible payment to its foreign parent, and that payment is disregarded in the parent country because it treats the hybrid entity as a part of the parent, then prima facie the country where the hybrid is resident should deny a deduction for the payment. If it does not, the parent country should tax the payment. Neither response is required if the hybrid entity in the same year derives an equal amount of income which is taxed in both countries (that is, is dual inclusion income). 4.19 This rule applies only to payments between members of the same control group, or parties to a structured arrangement. Entities are in the same control group if they are consolidated for accounting purposes, if they are commonly controlled, if they are 50 percent or more commonly owned, or if they are associated under Article 9 of the OECD Model Treaty. Recommendation 4: Reverse hybrid rule 4.20 Recommendation 4 applies to any deductible payment made to a reverse hybrid which results in a hybrid mismatch. A hybrid mismatch arises if the payment is not taxable to the reverse hybrid in either its establishment country or the residence country of an owner, but would have been taxable if paid directly to the owner. Prima facie an interest payment made to a New Zealand zero-rate PIE in respect of the interest of a foreign investor in the PIE might well be subject to this rule (though it would be out of scope unless there were a structured arrangement). The rule is for the payer to be denied a deduction. 4.21 The rule applies where the payer, the reverse hybrid and its owner are in the same control group, and to a payment under a structured arrangement to which the payer is a party. Recommendation 5: Specific recommendation for reverse hybrids 4.22 Recommendation 5 contains 3 specific recommendations for domestic rules relating to reverse hybrids. These are to: • improve controlled foreign company (CFC) and other offshore investment rules to ensure the taxation of the income of hybrid entities in the investor country • restrict the tax transparency of reverse hybrids that are members of a control group,; and • encourage countries to adopt appropriate information reporting and filing requirements for transparent entities established in their country (for example, in the case of New Zealand, partnerships, trusts and PIEs). 25 Recommendation 6: Deductible hybrid payments rule 4.23 Recommendation 6 applies to payments by a hybrid payer who makes a payment that is deductible under the laws of both the payer country and the country of the owner, if the payment results in a hybrid mismatch. The owner country should deny the deduction, and if it does not, the payer country should do so. A payment will only give rise to a hybrid mismatch if it is deducted against income which is not dual inclusion income. Disallowed expenditure can be carried forward and offset against dual inclusion income in future periods. 4.24 A person will be a hybrid payer if they are entitled to a deduction for a payment in a country where they are not resident, and either they or a related person is also allowed a deduction for that payment in the residence country. They will also be a hybrid payer if they are entitled to a deduction for a payment in their residence country and the payment triggers a second deduction for an investor in the payer in another country. 4.25 There is no scope limitation on the primary rule. Disallowance in the payer country (the secondary rule) only applies if the parties are in the same control group or when the person is party to a structured arrangement. 4.26 In addition, the Final Report suggests countries may wish to apply this rule to deductions that are not directly attributable to payments, for example, depreciation. 40 Recommendation 7: Dual-resident payer rule 4.27 Recommendation 7 applies to payments by a dual resident payer. If the payment is deductible in both countries, both should deny a deduction to the extent that it is offset against income which is not taxable in both countries. 4.28 As with Recommendation 6, Recommendation 7 includes an ability to carry forward any unused deductions and set them off against future dual inclusion income. Losses can also be used in one country if they have become unusable in the other (stranded losses). There is no limitation on the scope of this rule. Recommendation 8: Imported mismatch rule 4.29 To expand the coverage of the rules, Recommendation 8 requires a payer country to deny a deduction for an imported mismatch payment to the extent the rules treat the payment as offset against a hybrid deduction in the payee country. This means that the rules can require disallowance even when the payee is returning the amount received as income, if there is the necessary degree of connection between the payee’s receipt of the payment, and the payee making a payment under a hybrid mismatch arrangement. 40 OECD 2015 Final Report at para 192. 26 4.30 This rule is proposed to apply only if the payer is in the same control group as the parties to the mismatch arrangement, or when the payer is party to a structured arrangement. Recommendation 9: Design principles 4.31 Recommendation 9 sets out the design principles for the OECD rules, and also their implementation and co-ordination at a domestic level. These are considered in more detail in Chapter 11. Recommendations 10 – 12: Definitions 4.32 Recommendations 10–12 deal with definitions, including in particular, the definition of a structured arrangement, related persons, control groups and acting together. Double tax agreement commentary 4.33 Chapters 13 and 14 of the Final Report intend to ensure that, through modifications to the OECD Model Tax Convention and its Commentary, 41 the benefits of double tax agreements (DTAs) are not inappropriately accessed through the use of hybrid instruments and entities: • Chapter 13 provides commentary on a proposed change to Article 4(3) of the OECD Model Tax Convention whereby issues of an entity’s dual residence can be resolved by the competent authorities of each DTA partner rather than through the application of an interpretative rule as to the place of effective management. The chapter also suggests a domestic law change deeming an entity not to be a resident of a state if that entity is considered to be resident of another state due to the operation of a DTA. • Chapter 14 provides commentary on the proposed introduction o f Art icle 1(2) to the OECD Model Tax Convention which deals with the treatment of (wholly or partly) fiscally transparent entities. 4.34 Where possible, the suggested changes will be incorporated into New Zealand’s DTA network through the OECD’s work on Action 15 of the BEPS Action Plan (Developing a Multilateral Instrument to Modify Bilateral Tax Treaties), and through bilateral DTA negotiations. 4.35 Chapter 15 of the Final Report provides commentary on any potential conflict in the interaction of tax treaties and the OECD’s domestic law recommendations. The Government does not foresee any potential conflict between the recommendations and New Zealand’s DTA network. However, readers are welcome to submit on that point. 41 OECD (2014), Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version 2014, OECD Publishing. http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/mtc\_cond-2014-en 27 4.36 The DTA commentary will not be considered in Part II of this document as there is no domestic law reform that could be taken in this area (although the dual resident entity domestic law suggestion noted above is discussed in more detail in Chapter 9). Submissions on Part I 4.37 Specific calls for submission are set out in Part II of the document. However, the Government is also open to submissions on any aspects of Part I of the document. Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations and should refer to the document’s labelled submission points where applicable. 28 PART II Details of OECD recommendations 29 30 CHAPTER 5 Hybrid financial instruments 5.1 This chapter discusses and asks for submissions on, various aspects of implementing the first two recommendations in the OECD’s Final Report. It first considers changes to existing domestic rules (which relate to Recommendation 2), and then considers issues relating to the linking rules in Recommendation 1. Recommendation 2 5.2 New Zealand already denies a dividend exemption for deductible and fixed- rate dividends (section CW 9(2)(b) and (c)). Indeed, the definition of a deductible foreign equity distribution contains a simple imported mismatch rule. While this rule seems in general satisfactory, there are two situations referred to in the Final Report which New Zealand law does not deal with. Dividends giving rise to a tax credit in the payer jurisdiction 5.3 First, current New Zealand law does not deal with foreign tax systems that use tax credits triggered by dividend payments to effectively refund corporate tax. This is considered in Example 1.11 of the Final Report. Such a regime has the same effect as a dividend deduction, 42 and it is proposed that section CW 9(2)(c) be expanded to deny exemption for a dividend which gives rise to tax relief equivalent to a deduction in the payer jurisdiction. Denial of imputation credits 5.4 Secondly, there is no provision denying the benefit of an imputation credit to a dividend on a hybrid financial instrument. Example 2.1 in the Final Report (reproduced below as Figure 5.1) is an example of a deductible dividend with an imputation credit attached. The dividend is deductible in Country B because the instrument is treated as debt and funds the assets of the Country B branch. In Country A the dividend is taxed as a dividend and imputation credits are required to be attached to it by A Co, representing payments of corporate income tax to Country A. A number of Australian banks have entered into these types of transactions, in some cases using debt raised by their New Zealand branches, that is, New Zealand is Country B. 42 The FITC regime involves a credit triggered by a dividend payment. However, this credit is used to satisfy the shareholder’s withholding tax obligation, so is not equivalent to a partial deduction – see para 13 of Example 1.11, OECD 2015 Final Report. 31 Figure 5.1: Application of Recommendation 2.1 to imputed dividends 43 A Co. Country B PE Investors Interest / Dividend H yb rid f in an cial ins tr um ent + - 5.5 The Example states that under Recommendation 2.1 Country A should deny the imputation credit, because it is attached to income that has not borne tax in either state. It is true that the attachment of the credit to earnings which have not borne Country A tax may mean that A Co has retained earnings from its domestic activities which it is unable to distribute on a tax paid basis. In that sense the attachment of an imputation credit to a payment is less harmful than the payment being entirely exempt. However, in many cases the distribution of the untaxed earnings can be postponed indefinitely, so there is no practical distinction between exemption and full imputation. 5.6 Example 2.1 would not apply to a hybrid instrument issued by the foreign branch of a New Zealand company because New Zealand would tax the branch income. However, there seems no reason not to amend legislat ion to deny the use of imputation credits to reduce tax on a dividend which is deductible to the payer. 5.7 In relation to Recommendation 2.2, New Zealand has a general rule limiting the ability to claim a credit for foreign tax to the amount of New Zealand tax chargeable on the net income that has been subject to the foreign tax. To ensure that this provision is more closely aligned with Recommendation 2.2, it is proposed that the definition of a “segment” of foreign source income be defined so that any payment of a dividend on a share subject to a hybrid transfer is treated as a separate segment of foreign source income. Submission point 5A Submissions are sought on the proposed approaches to implement Recommendation 2 where necessary. 43 OECD 2015 Final Report, Example 2.1, at p279. 32 Recommendation 1 General 5.8 The hybrid financial instrument rule in the OECD’s Recommendation 1 applies to payments under a financial instrument that can be expected to result in a hybrid mismatch (that is, a D/NI result). A financial instrument can be either a debt or an equity instrument. For this purpose, an equity instrument would include any form of ownership interest in an entity which is not treated as fiscally transparent. 5.9 A simple example of a hybrid financial instrument is given in Figure 2.1 in Chapter 2. 5.10 A D/NI result arises when a payment is deductible to the payer, to the extent that that payment is to a person in a country where the payment would not be fully taxed within a reasonable period of time as ordinary income to a taxpayer of ordinary status, and a reason for that non-taxation is the terms of the instrument. Imposition of withholding tax on the payment by the payer country is not full taxation as ordinary income. D/NI outcomes can arise due to inconsistent characterisation of the financial instrument, or when the payer is entitled to a deduction before the payee has to include an amount in income (typically because the payer is on an accrual basis but the payee is on a cash basis). 5.11 The primary rule is for the payer country to neutralise the mismatch by denying the deduction. The payer country is any country where the payer is a taxpayer. It does not require the payer to be resident, and a payer can have more than one payer country. If the payer country does not deny the deduction, under the secondary rule the payee country should include the payment in the payee’s income. The payee country is any country where the payee is a taxpayer. Rule only applies to financial instruments under domestic law 5.12 Subject to two exceptions (considered below), countries only need to apply this rule to payments under financial instruments as characterised under their own domestic law. So, for example, a cross-border lease payment by a New Zealand-resident under a lease that is not a financial arrangement would not be subject to disallowance under this rule, even if the lessor country treats the lease payment as partially a return of principal under a finance lease. 44 The definition of a financial instrument is considered in Chapter 12. Rule only applies to payments 5.13 This rule only applies to payments between related parties (broadly, 25 percent or more common ownership) or structured arrangements. These definit ions are discussed in Chapter 12. 44 OECD 2015 Final Report, Example 1.25. 33 5.14 The rule does not apply to deductions which are not for payments. Thus it does not apply to deemed deductions on an interest-free loan, but it does apply to deductions which arise from bifurcating an interest-free loan between debt and equity (Final Report, Examples 1.14 and 1.16). So, the deductions claimed by the taxpayer in Alesco would be disallowed by the primary rule in New Zealand, and if New Zealand did not have hybrid rules, be taxable in Australia under the defensive rule. They would not be affected by Recommendation 2, because Australia did not recognise the optional convertible note as giving rise to a dividend. The rule also does not apply to a bad debt deduction, which is attributable to a non-payment, rather than a payment – see Final Report, Example 1.20. Practical considerations 5.15 This rule would mean that any person claiming a deduction for New Zealand tax purposes under a cross-border financial arrangement needs to consider, before claiming the deduction, whether: • the deduction arises as a result of a payment that (assuming no change in the parties to the arrangement) is or will be made to a related person (applying a 25% threshold, as discussed below) or pursuant to a structured arrangement; and (if the answer to the first question is yes) • whether under the laws of the country of the payee, the payment would be taxed as ordinary income in the hands of a taxpayer of ordinary status within a reasonable period of time. If it would not, then no deduction can be claimed. 5.16 Also, any person ent it led to receive a payment under a cross-border financial instrument will need to consider, if that payment is not fully taxable (including where it is taxable but carries a credit, other than for foreign withholding tax), whether: • the payment is from a related person or pursuant to a structured arrangement; and (if the answer to the first question is yes) • whether under the laws of the country of the payer, the payment is deductible to a taxpayer of ordinary status. If it is, then the payment is taxable in the year of the deduction. Particular tax status of counterparty not relevant 5.17 Only hybrid mismatches that arise as a result of the terms of an instrument are relevant. For example, if a New Zealand borrower pays interest to a related party who is tax-exempt, there will be no hybrid mismatch if the related party would have been taxable on the interest were it not tax-exempt. However, there will be a hybrid mismatch if the related party would not have been taxable on the interest if it were not tax-exempt (Final Report, Example 1.5). 34 5.18 Another issue is the relevance of deduction or inclusion that arises only because a payer or payee holds an instrument on revenue account. Generally the principles expressed above mean that such deductions or inclusions are ignored for purposes of this rule. For example, suppose a purchaser on revenue account is entitled to a deduction for the cost of acquiring a financial instrument whereas the vendor if on capital account does not include the sale price in its income. That mismatch does not mean that the hybrid financial instrument rule applies to the payment (see Final Report, Example 1.28). Differences in valuation of payments not relevant 5.19 A borrower in a foreign currency loan will generally have a foreign currency gain or loss with respect to the loan. Assuming the loan is in the currency of the lender’s residence, the lender will have no corresponding gain or loss. If the borrower has a loss, the loss is not thereby denied under the hybrid mismatch rules (Final Report, Example 1.17). The situation would be the same if the loan were in a third currency, even if currency movements mean there is a foreign exchange loss to one party and a foreign exchange gain to the other. 5.20 However, differences in valuation that lead to different characterisat ions o f a payment may lead to Recommendation 1 applying – see Final Report Example 1.16, relating to an optional convertible note. Timing differences 5.21 Where the payer and payee under a financial instrument are in different jurisdictions, it is not uncommon for them to recognise income/expenditure from the instrument on different bases. For example, a payer may be entitled to a deduction for a payment on an accrual basis, whereas a payee is taxable on a cash basis. In that case, there is a hybrid mismatch, which is prima facie subject to Recommendation 1. 5.22 The Final Report suggests 45 that a deduction should not be denied if the payment giving rise to the deduction is included in income in an accounting period that begins within 12 months of the end of the period in which the deduction is claimed. If this test is not met, the payer should still be entitled to a deduction if it can satisfy the tax authority that there is a reasonable expectation that the payment will be made within a reasonable period of time, and once made will be included in ordinary income. A reasonable period is one that might be expected to be agreed between arm’s length parties. Final Report Example 1.21 applies these principles. 45 From p34. 35 5.23 The Final Report does not provide for any denied deductions to be carried forward and allowed if and when the payee does recognise income. 5.24 The UK appears to have adopted this approach, along with a provision that if a supposition ceases to be reasonable, consequential adjustments can be made. 5.25 The Australian Board of Taxation Report recommends a different approach. It suggests that a gap of up to three years between deduction and inclusion should not attract operation of the rule, whereas a longer gap should mandatorily do so. It also suggests that any deduction denial should reverse when and if the payee recognises the corresponding income. This is essentially a carry-forward loss proposal. The proposal seems to mirror what would happen in the case of inclusion under the defensive rule. If the amount of a deduction in a payer jurisdiction were included in the payee’s income under the defensive rule, and the payment giving rise to the income inclusion was later received, it would not be appropriate to tax the payment again, and rules against double taxation would generally achieve this. This supports the Board of Taxation carry-forward proposal in relation to the primary rule. Taxation under other countries’ CFC rules 5.26 When a payment gives rise to a D/NI outcome, tax may still be imposed on the payment under a CFC regime. In this case the tax would be imposed on the owners of the payee, by the owner country. This is discussed at paragraph 36 and following of the Final Report. The Report gives countries the choice as to whether to treat CFC inclusion as taxation of the payee. This would be relevant for a New Zealand taxpayer in: • determining whether to apply the primary response – in this case the New Zealand payer would need to establish that the payment made by it was subject to tax in the hands of the payee’s owners under a CFC regime; or • determining whether or not to apply the secondary response – in this case the New Zealand payee would need to establish that the payment made to it was subject to tax in the hands of the payee’s own owners under a CFC regime. 5.27 The Report also says that a taxpayer seeking to rely on CFC inclusion should only be able to do so if it can satisfy the tax authority that the payment has been fully included under the laws of the CFC country. Unlike the general approach in Recommendation 1, this will require proof of actual taxation of the amount. 36 Application of rule to transfers of assets 5.28 Recommendation 1 generally does not apply to amounts paid for the transfer of an asset. However, transfers can give rise to hybrid mismatches in three different situations. Portion of purchase price treated as payment under a financial instrument 5.29 First, there may be a hybrid mismatch in a cross-border asset sale if one or other country treats a portion of the purchase price of any asset as attributable to a financial instrument (see Example 1.27 of the Final Report). For example, if a purchaser is prima facie entitled to a deduction for a portion of a deferred purchase price under the financial arrangement rules, but the non- resident related party vendor treats the entire amount as purchase price, the hybrid financial instrument rule will deny the purchaser a deduction. Because the application of the rules depends on the tax treatment of a payment for a taxpayer of ordinary status, the linking rule will apply to deny a deduction even if the non-resident vendor is a trader and treats the purchase price as income for purposes of its home country taxation (Example 1.29 of the Final Report). 5.30 The Final Report also states that when a person is entitled to a deduction for a payment only because the person holds an asset on revenue account, and the person is fully taxable on their economic gain or loss from the asset, that deduction should not be denied by the linking rule (see Final Report paragraph 52 and Example 1.28). So if the purchaser in the previous paragraph is entitled to a deduction for a payment because it is a trader, that deduction should not be denied. Hybrid transfers 5.31 A second way the hybrid financial instrument rule can apply to a transfer of an asset is if it is a hybrid transfer. A hybrid transfer is a transaction, such as a share loan or a share repo, where the transferor and transferee are both treated as the owner of a financial instrument. This is usually because the terms of the transfer require both that the asset, or an identical asset, is returned to the transferor, and also that the transferor is compensated by the transferee for any income from the asset that arises during the term of the arrangement (whether or not received by the transferee). This means that economic risk on the asset remains with the transferor throughout the period fro m the initial transfer through to the retransfer. An example of a hybrid transfer is given in Figure 2.2 in Chapter 2 of this document, which is repeated here for convenience. Further examples are the transactions that were the subject of BNZ Investments Ltd v CIR (2009) 24 NZTC 23,582 and Westpac Banking Corporation v CIR (2009) 24 NZTC 23,834. 37 Figure 5.2: Hybrid transfer – share repo (repeated Figure 2.2) B Co. B Sub + - O bligation to p ay p ur chase pr ice Dividend Country BCountry A Right to acquire B Sub - + A Co. 5.32 New Zealand is generally a form country, so in Figure 2.2, if B Co (the share borrower) is a New Zealand company it will be treated as owning the B Sub shares, and deriving a dividend from B Sub, rather than as having lent money to, and deriving a financing return from, A Co. However, because Country A is a substance country, A Co is treated as owning the B Sub shares, receiving the dividend, and making a deductible financing payment to B Co, equal to the amount of the dividend. Accordingly, if Country A does not have hybrid rules, and A Co and B Co are either related parties or the repo is a structured arrangement, then the effect of the hybrid transfer rule is that B Co will have to recognise additional income, unless it is taxable on the dividend from B Sub with no imputation credits. 5.33 In the case of a share loan which is a hybrid transfer, the hybrid mismatch will generally arise because: • the manufactured dividend payment made by the share receiver to the share supplier in the substance country is treated in the same way as a dividend in the share supplier country, which will often be exempt; • the same payment will often be deductible to the share receiver in its country. Substitute payments 5.34 The third situation in which the hybrid financial instrument rule can apply to a transfer of a financial instrument is if the transfer involves a “substitute payment” (as defined). A substitute payment is a payment under a transfer of a financial instrument which represents a financing or equity return on the underlying instrument and which undermines the integrity of the hybrid rules. This will be the case if the underlying payment (that is, the one that gives rise to the substitute payment): 46 46 OECD 2015 Final Report at para 79. 38 • is not included in the income of the substitute payer; • would have been included in the income of the substitute payee; and • gives rise to a hybrid mismatch. 5.35 In any of these circumstances, if the substitute payment gives rise to a hybrid mismatch, the hybrid rules will deny a deduction to the payer (primary response) or tax the payee (secondary response). 5.36 Example 1.36 of the Final Report shows a substitute payment, and is reproduced below. Figure 5.3: Deduction for premium paid to acquire a bond with accrued interest 47 Purchase price + premium + B Co. Loan transfer Interest Loan 50%50% - C Co. A Co. 5.37 The substitute payment is the premium portion of the amount paid by A Co to B Co for the transfer of the bond with accrued interest. The transfer is neither a financial instrument, nor a hybrid transfer. However, the premium is a payment in substitution for the payment of the accrued interest. It is deductible to A Co and treated as a capital gain to B Co, so it gives rise to a hybrid mismatch. On the facts of the example, the payment by A Co to B Co is a substitute payment because the payment of the coupon to the vendor would itself have given rise to a hybrid mismatch. The result would be the same if the coupon payment were taxable to the vendor. Accordingly, if the purchaser and vendor are related, or the sale is a structured arrangement, the payment of the premium will be subject to the hybrid mismatch rule. 47 OECD 2015 Final Report, Example 1.36, at p274. 39 Regulatory capital 5.38 The Final Report gives countries the option to exclude regulatory capital from their hybrid rules. A typical example is when the parent company in a multinational banking group issues regulatory capital instruments to the market for the purpose of using the funds to provide regulatory capital to a bank subsidiary in another country. Countries are free to exclude the intra- group regulatory capital from the hybrid rules. The Final Report also states that an exclusion of bank regulatory capital from one country’s rules does not require any other country with hybrid rules to refrain from applying them to regulatory capital instruments between the two countries. Other exclusions 5.39 Recommendation 1.5 provides an exception to the primary response for investment vehicles that are subject to special regulatory and tax treatment that: • is designed to ensure that while the vehicle itself has no tax liability, its investors have a liability, arising at more or less the same time as the gross investment income was derived by the investment vehicle; and • ensures that all or substantially all of the vehicle’s investment income is paid and distributed to the owners within a reasonable period after the income is earned; and • taxes the owners on the payment as ordinary income. 5.40 An example is a regulated real estate investment trust, which is entitled to a dividend paid deduction but required to pay out all of its earnings on a current year basis. Application to New Zealand 5.41 A number of issues are worthy of further discussion and submission as to how Recommendation 1 could be incorporated into New Zealand law. Applying the secondary rule to hybrid dividends 5.42 In New Zealand’s case, the secondary rule (taxation of amounts that are deductible in the payer jurisdiction) will also require the denial of imputation credits attached to a dividend which is deductible in another jurisdiction. This could arise in the situation set out in Example 1.23 of the Final Report, reproduced below, where New Zealand is Country B. 40 Figure 5.4: Payment by a hybrid entity under a hybrid financial instrument 48 - Interest / Dividend A Co. Dividend Loan B Co. 2 + B Co. 1 5.43 Accordingly, the Government proposes to amend the law so that imputation credits attached to a dividend on a hybrid financial instrument are not included in a New Zealand shareholder’s income and do not give rise to a tax credit. This non-inclusion would not affect the paying company. This ensures that application of the rule does not allow two lots of imputation credits to exist for what is in reality the same income. Denial of one amount of imputation credits correlates with the fact that the dividend payment has given rise to a foreign tax benefit. 5.44 As this example makes clear, implementing the defensive rule in Recommendation 1 will also require New Zealand to tax intra-group dividends that give rise to a hybrid mismatch under the hybrid financial instrument rule, even if these are between members of a 100 percent commonly owned group (whether or not consolidated). Submission point 5B Submissions are sought on whether there are any issues with the proposed approach in applying the secondary rule to hybrid dividends. Timing mismatches 5.45 Wit h respect to timing mismatches, the Australian Board of Taxation approach (see earlier paragraph 5.25) may have advantages for New Zealand. Denial of deductions (with carry forward) where there is a deferral of recognition of the corresponding income for more than three years: 48 OECD 2015 Final Report, Example 1.23, at p235. 41 • applies or not based on objective criteria which can be applied on a self-assessment basis, that is, without the need for the Commissioner to exercise any discretion; and • seems both economically appropriate and consistent with the application of the secondary rule. Submission points 5C Submissions are sought on:  whether the approach recommended by the Australian Board of Taxation would be an acceptable one for New Zealand;  what alternatives might be better to deal with timing mismatches; and  what thresholds should apply to determine when the rule would apply to a difference caused by different income and expenditure recognition rules. Effect of CFC inclusion on application of Recommendation 1 5.46 The need to treat CFC taxation of a payee’s owner to be treated as taxation of the payee itself is not pressing in the case of the secondary response. Taxation of the payee in the payee country under the defensive rule is likely to simply reduce CFC taxation in the owner country. 5.47 Given the complexity of establishing the extent to which taxation under a CFC regime should be treated as inclusion for purposes of the hybrid rules, the fact that there is no need to do so when applying the secondary response, and the fact that there are usually alternatives to the use of hybrid instruments, it is not proposed to treat CFC taxation as relevant in applying Recommendation 1. Submission point 5D Submissions are sought on whether this approach as to CFC inclusion will give rise to any practical difficulties. Taxation of FIF interests 5.48 If a New Zealand resident holds shares subject to the FIF regime, and accounts for those shares using the fair dividend rate (FDR), cost or deemed rate of return (DRR) method, the dividends on those shares are not taxable. Instead the resident returns an amount of deemed income. Dividends are only taxable if the holder uses the comparative value (CV) or attributable foreign interest (AFI) method (note that when those two methods are being used, if the dividend is deductible in the foreign country it will not be exempt in New Zealand even if the shareholder is a company). 42 5.49 FIF taxation therefore presents at least two problems for applying Recommendation 1. • The non-resident payer of a deductible dividend to a New Zealand payee, if resident in a country with the hybrid rules, will not know how a New Zealand taxpayer of ordinary status would treat the dividend, and therefore will not know whether, or to what extent, it is denied a deduction for the dividend by the primary response in its own country. • When the New Zealand payee is applying the defensive rule (in a case where the non-resident payer of a deductible dividend has not been denied a deduction), if the payee is not applying the CV or AFI method, the payee will need to determine how much of the dividend has not been taxed, in order to know how much addit ional inco me to include. 5.50 Possible solutions are to: • deny the FDR, cost and DRR methods to shares on which any dividend would be deductible to the payer. This would be similar to the existing requirement to use the CV method for a non-ordinary (generally, debt- like) share (section EX 46(8)); • include a deductible dividend in the holder’s income, in addition to income already recognised under the FDR, cost or DRR method. This would be similar to the exclusion of deductible dividends from the general exemption for foreign dividends received by New Zealand companies in section CW 9 (though this exclusion does not apply to interests accounted for under the FDR, DRR or cost method); • include a deductible dividend in the holder’s income only to the extent that it exceeds the income otherwise recognised on the shares. This is somewhat similar to the concept of a top-up amount (defined in section EX 60) that applies when a person uses the DRR method. 5.51 As long as one of these solutions is adopted, there should be no need for a non-resident payer of a deductible dividend to a New Zealand payee to apply the primary response. Submission point 5E Submissions are sought on which of these FIF approaches would be preferable and why, and whether there is another better approach. 43 Transfers of assets: revenue account holders 5.52 Recommendation 1 could apply to an asset transfer involving a New Zealand party. For example, suppose a New Zealand resident purchases an asset from a related party on deferred payment terms, and is entitled to deduct a portion of the price as financial arrangement expenditure. If the vendor treats the entire amount as being from the sale of the asset, then there will be a hybrid mismatch, and the purchaser will be denied a deduction for the expenditure. 5.53 The treatment if the New Zealand resident is acquiring the asset on revenue account (for example, because it is a trader), is less clear. As set out above, the Final Report states that where a person is entitled to a deduction for a payment only because the person holds an asset on revenue account, and the person is fully taxable on their economic gain or loss from the asset, that deduction should not be denied by the linking rule. 5.54 However, revenue account holders are not entitled to include in the cost of trading stock the element of their purchase price which is treated as financial arrangement expenditure (section EW 2(2)(d)). The denial of a deduction for that expenditure under the linking rule would not include it in the cost of trading stock. Also, non-taxation of income (for example, dividends on shares accounted for under the FDR method) is not turned off for revenue account holders. So, it is not the case that revenue account holders are always subject to income tax on all of their economic income. 5.55 Given that New Zealand does not tax revenue account holders on the basis referred to in paragraph 52 of the Final Report (referred to above), it is not proposed to exempt revenue account payers from the effect of the hybrid rule. Submission point 5F Submissions are sought as to whether revenue account holders should have an exempt ion fro m the rules. Transfers of assets: hybrid transfers 5.56 New Zealand does have some specific tax rules for share loans and repos (the rules applying to returning share transfers and share lending arrangements, both as defined in the Income Tax Act 2007). Generally, these do not treat the share supplier as continuing to own the shares (though there is an exception for returning share transfers when the share supplier uses the FDR method to determine its income from foreign shares). 49 The closest they come is that in relation to a share lending arrangement the share supplier is treated as owning a share lending right for the period of the arrangement. 49 See sections EX 52(14C) and EX 53(16C), Income Tax Act 2007. 44 5.57 As referred to above, New Zealand has unique rules relating to the taxation of dividends on foreign shares. While dividends from ASX listed shares are generally taxable, other dividends on foreign shares may or may not be taxable. 5.58 Again, the New Zealand tax regime creates a difficulty for both counterparty countries (in this case, the country where the repo or share loan counterparty is resident, rather than where the share issuer is resident) and for New Zealand. Again, it would be possible to solve these issues by having a rule which would ensure that dividends paid on foreign shares to a New Zealand person who is party to a hybrid transfer with respect to the shares are always taxable, applying one of the approaches referred to in paragraph 5.50. The taxation of dividends paid on New Zealand shares held by a New Zealand share receiver who is a party to a hybrid transfer would be unchanged, unless the defensive rule was applied. In that case, the dividends would be taxable with no credit for any imputation credits on the dividends (see Final Report, Example 1.32). Submission point 5G Submissions are sought on whether this proposal for amending the income tax treatment of a New Zealand resident who holds shares subject to a hybrid transfer would be a practical response. Regulatory capital 5.59 The UK proposes to take up the option to exclude bank regulatory capital instruments from its regime in certain circumstances (see discussion at Chapter 8 of Tackling aggressive tax planning (HM Treasury and HMRC, December 2014). However, we understand that the UK has existing anti- hybrid rules that apply to bank regulatory capital. The Australian Board of Taxation Report sought an extension of time to report on this issue. 5.60 It is not proposed that bank regulatory capital is excluded fro m the implementation of hybrid mismatch rules in New Zealand. Submission point 5H Submissions are sought on whether there are any issues with providing no exclusion for regulatory capital. 45 5.61 The exemption of an instrument from the hybrid rules in one country does not require exemption of that same instrument by others (Final Report, page 11). A decision by a country not to fully implement the rules is not intended to bind other countries in their own implementation. That is true even in an area where non-implementation is an option provided by the Final Report. Whether it is intended or not, a hybrid mismatch causes the same loss of overall tax revenue, and gives rise to the same difficulties o f attributing that loss. Other exclusions 5.62 We note that the UK legislation proposes an exception for hybrid transfers to which a financial trader is a party (section 259DD). 50 The Board of Taxation has recommended that consideration be given to an exception for financial traders entering into repos and securities-lending agreements. It is not clear that sufficient activity of this kind is taking place to justify an exception o f this kind in New Zealand. Submission point 5I Submissions are sought on whether such an exception is necessary or desirable, and how it should be designed. 5.63 New Zealand does not seem to have any entities requiring an exception under Recommendation 1.5 from the primary response. In particular, PIEs are not entitled to a deduction for their distributions, and are not required to distribute their income within any period. Submission point 5J Submissions are sought on whether there are any other New Zealand entities that should be eligible for this exemption. 5.64 Finally, although the main target of the rule is cross-border transactions, the OECD recommendations can also apply to payments within a country (see Final Report, Examples 1.13 and 1.21). This means that the hybrid financial arrangement rule might deny deductions in purely domestic transactions in some circumstances. However, the focus of the hybrid mismatch rules should be on cross-border activity and accordingly it is proposed that domestic transactions are specifically excluded from the application of the rules. 50 Section 259DD of Schedule 10 of the Finance (No.2) Bill (United Kingdom). 46 CHAPTER 6 Disregarded hybrid payments 6.1 This chapter considers Recommendation 3 of the Final Report; the disregarded hybrid payments rule. The rule applies when a deductible cross- border payment has been disregarded by the payee country due to that country’s treatment of the payer. This generally results in a D/NI outcome. This outcome can be counteracted by the disregarded hybrid payments rule through a denial of deduction in the payer country (the primary response), or an inclusion of income in the payee country (the secondary response or defensive measure). 6.2 The disregarded hybrid payments rule only applies if the parties to the hybrid mismatch are in the same control group or are party to a structured arrangement (both defined in Chapter 12). 6.3 Figure 2.3 in Chapter 2 of this document is an example of a disregarded hybrid payment structure. Requirements for rule to apply 6.4 A disregarded payment is one that is deductible in a country where the payer is a taxpayer (the payer country) and is not recognised as a payment in any country in which the payee is a taxpayer (the payee country). 6.5 A hybrid payer is an entity that is treated by the payee country in a manner that results in a payment by the entity being disregarded. 6.6 An example of a hybrid payer entity in New Zealand is an unlimited liability company wholly owned by a US parent. The company is fiscally opaque in New Zealand but treated as a foreign branch of the US parent in the US. Accordingly when it makes a payment to its parent, there is a deduction in New Zealand but no inclusion in the US. 6.7 The question of whether an entity is a hybrid payer will not turn on a preordained list of entities and no characteristics in and of themselves would qualify an entity as a hybrid payer. Moreover, an entity that is considered to be a hybrid payer in one scenario may not be a hybrid payer under a different scenario. See for instance, Example 3.2 of the Final Report, reproduced below as Figure 6.1. 47 Figure 6.1: Disregarded hybrid payment using consolidation regime and tax grouping 51 A Co. 1 A Co. 2 B Co. PE Interest (3 00) Operating Income (2 00) Operating Income (2 00) Loan + - 6.8 In this case, the election by A Co 1 and A Co 2 to consolidate for tax purposes results in a disregarded payment and the classification of A Co 2 as a hybrid payer. It is the fact of consolidation rather than the particular characteristics of A Co 2 that mean that the company is a hybrid payer. 6.9 It is possible for a disregarded payment to arise as a result of a deemed payment between a branch and another part of the same legal entity. In some countries, if funds or an asset, attributable to a foreign ent ity’s operations in a foreign country is provided to a domestic branch of the same legal entity, the domestic branch is entitled to a deduction for a notional payment for the provisio n of the funds or asset. If the foreign country does not recognise this payment, there is a disregarded payment. Dual inclusion income 6.10 The disregarded hybrid payment rule will not apply to the extent that the payer’s deduction is offset against income that is dual inclusion income. 51 OECD 2015 Final Report, Example 3.2, at p293. 48 6.11 Dual inclusion income is ordinary taxable income in the payer country and in the payee country. Dual inclusion income is also relevant to the deductible hybrid payments rule and to the double deduction and dual resident payer rules which are discussed in Chapters 8 and 9 respectively. 6.12 The exclusion from the rule for disregarded payments offset by the payer against dual inclusion income recognises that a taxpayer’s circumstances may create a tax advantage through a disregarded payment in the payer country which is neutralised by taxation in the payee country. The advantage is neutralised because the payee country taxes the dual inclusion income with no deduction for the disregarded payment. 6.13 Differences in the way that each country treats income in terms of timing or valuation will not prevent the classification of an item of income as dual inclusion income. This is demonstrated in Example 6.1 of the Final Report. In that example, different timing rules apply in the payer and parent countries to the calculation of dual inclusion income, which means that different amounts are affected by the hybrid rule depending on whether the primary or defensive rule applies. The payer country’s calculation of the dual inclusion income is used to make the primary response whereas the payee country’s calculation would be used to make the defensive response. 6.14 The Final Report recommends that items that are taxed as income in one country and are subject to a type of double taxation relief in the other country can nonetheless be classified as dual inclusion income. 52 Dual inclusio n income includes an equity return that is: • taxable in the payee country (whether or not with an underlying foreign tax credit); and • granted a tax credit or exemption in the payer country, which is designed to avoid economic taxation. 6.15 An example of dual inclusion income that is subject to double taxation relief in one country is Example 6.3 of the Final Report. In that example, a dividend received by a hybrid payer is allowed an intra-group tax exemption in the payer country but is subject to tax in the payee country due to the dividend recipient (hybrid payer) being treated as fiscally transparent in the payee country. 6.16 A further example of dual inclusion income is if B Sub 1 in Figure 2.3/6.1 pays an exempt or fully imputed dividend to B Co, provided that dividend is subject to tax in Country A. 6.17 Broadly speaking, the effect of allowing a D/NI payment to be deducted against dual inclusion income but then applying Recommendation 3 as to any excess is that to the extent of the D/NI payment, any net loss incurred by or through the hybrid entity: 52 OECD 2015 Final Report at para 126. 49 • is unable to be used to offset any other income in the payer country (primary rule); or • is unable to be used to offset any other income in the payee country. The qualification to that statement is that it is only entirely true if all of the income derived by or through the payer entity is dual inclusion income. If some of it is not dual inclusion income, the amount of the D/NI payment that may not be deducted will be increased by that amount. Example Take the example in Figure 2.3/6.1. Suppose that the interest payment to A Co is $300, and that in addition, B Co has $50 of income and B Sub 1 has $100 of net income. The $50 income earned by B Co would prima facie be taxable also to A Co, and is therefore dual inclusion income. The $100 earned by B Sub 1 would not be taxable to A Co and therefore would not be dual inclusion income. Accordingly, under the primary rule, Country B would deny B Co a deduction for $250 of the interest. B Co would have no net income or loss, and B Sub 1 would have $100 income. A Co would have $50 income. Under the defensive rule, Country A would tax A Co on $250 of interest. The result of the defensive rule would be a loss in Country B of $150 (after offset of $100 of B Co’s $250 loss against B Sub 1’s income), and income for A Co in Country A of $300 (the $50 of income earned by B Co plus $250 under the Recommendation 3 defensive rule). Carry-forward of denied deductions 6.18 Any deduction denied under the disregarded hybrid payments primary rule may be carried forward to a future year to be offset against excess dual inclusion income (that is, dual inclusion income against which a hybrid deduction has not already been taken). 6.19 Carry-forward would be subject to the existing continuity of ownership rule that applies to the carry-forward of losses. Example Take the example above. Suppose the only event in year 2 is that B Sub 1 pays a dividend to B Co of $100, which is exempt to B Co in Country B but taxable to A Co in Country A. The dividend is dual inclusion income. If the primary rule applied in year 1, in year 2 $100 of the $250 portion of the interest deduction disallowed in year 1 under the primary rule would be deductible to B Co in year 2, giving it a net loss of $100 in Country B, which it is free to use in accordance with Country B tax rules (for example, it can be grouped with the income of another group member). However, if the defensive rule applied in year 1, the Final Report does not provide for reversal of the $250 income recognised by A Co. 50 Submission point 6A Submissions are sought on whether there are any issues with using the rules for the carrying forward of tax losses as a basis for the treatment of carrying forward disallowed deductions. Application of CFC regimes 6.20 The Final Report states (paragraph 127) that an item of income can be dual inclusion income if it is the ordinary income of a company subject to tax in one country and is attributed income for the shareholder of the company in another country under a CFC regime. The Final Report recommends that for a taxpayer to claim an item of income to be dual inclusion income, they must demonstrate to the relevant tax authority that the effect of the CFC regime is that the item of income is subjected to full rates of tax in two countries. Implementation issues 6.21 To calculate its dual inclusion income, a taxpayer must detect all instances where two countries will consider the same item to be included as income. This task could involve substantial compliance costs where a taxpayer has many cross-border payments and where payments are recognised in different ways by the countries. The Final Report suggests that countries should aim to introduce implementation solutions that maintain the policy intent of the rules while reducing the compliance costs that taxpayers may encounter in assessing their dual inclusion income. 53 6.22 Taxpayers generally prepare accounts of income and expenditure in the countries they operate in. This information could be used as an initial basis for identifying dual inclusion income. A document containing this informat ion with ident ified dual inclusio n inco me items should be maintained by the taxpayer to support the claiming of a deduction for a D/NI payment (and, if the payer country does not apply the primary rule, non- inclusion of such a payment under the secondary rule). 6.23 The Final Report proposes 54 that, to apply the disregarded hybrid payments rule primary response, the total claimed deductions for disregarded payments would be limited to the extent of the total identified dual inclusion income of the taxpayer. The defensive response would be achieved by requiring payee country entities to recognise income to the extent that deductions claimed in the payer country exceed dual inclusion income. 53 At para 130. 54 Example 3.1; paras 13–14. 51 6.24 Another implementation solution suggested by the Final Report (Example 3.2, reproduced in Figure 6.1) is in relation to a consolidated group that crosses two countries (for example, where a member has a branch in another jurisdiction, or where a member is a resident of another jurisdiction). The Final Report proposes that in applying the primary response the payer country could prevent a hybrid payer from using a loss of the payer country consolidated group to the extent that deductions have been claimed in the payer country for payments that were disregarded under the law of the payee country. For the defensive response, the payee country would require a resident entity to include as income the hybrid payer’s deductible payments that are disregarded in the payee country to the extent that they result in a net loss (taking into account dual inclusion income) in the payer country. The Final Report further suggests that specific measures would be needed to ensure that the parties involved in a transaction cannot circumvent these rules by allocating non-dual inclusion income to the hybrid payer in order to offset its losses. Submission point 6B Submissions are sought on the practicalities of assessing a taxpayer’s dual inclusion income, the feasibility of the implementation options described above, as well as any other implementation solutions for the successful operation of dual inclusion income rules in New Zealand. Application to New Zealand Carry-forward/reversal of defensive rule income 6.25 The Final Report does not propose a carry-forward rule for the application of the defensive rule. This creates a potential for over-taxation in a scenario where the defensive rule is applied to include extra income in the payee country and excess dual inclusion income arises in a later year. 6.26 A solution to this problem may be to provide for a “reversal” rule whereby the application of the defensive rule in the payee country could be reversed (through an allowable deemed deduction) in a later year where there is excess dual inclusion income. 6.27 Alternatively, the defensive rule could be limited so that income is only included to the extent that the disregarded payment deduction is offset against non-dual inclusion income in the payer jurisdiction. In the event that there is no non-dual inclusion income that the payment can be offset against, the income inclusion could be suspended until non-dual inclusion income is present. Unlike the reversal approach, this option would require the payee country tax authority and payee jurisdiction taxpayers to be aware of the level of non-dual inclusion income being earned in the payer country. 52 Submission point 6C Submissions are sought on whether it is appropriate to depart from the OECD’s recommendations in this regard, and which approach would be best to take. Dual inclusion income 6.28 As with Recommendation 1, it is proposed that CFC income is not able to be included as dual inclusion income. This will avoid drafting a large amount of very detailed and targeted legislation, aimed at situations that are unlikely to arise, and that in all likelihood will not deal appropriately wit h the peculiarities of such situations when they do arise. Submission point 6D Submissions are sought on whether it is appropriate to depart from the OECD’s recommendations in relation to CFC income as dual inclusion income. 53 CHAPTER 7 Reverse hybrids 7.1 A reverse hybrid is an entity where some or all of whose income is (or can be): • in its establishment country, treated as derived by its investors (generally its owners); and • in an investor country, treated as derived by the entity. 7.2 A New Zealand limited partnership may be an example of such an entity. For New Zealand tax purposes, the income of a New Zealand limited partnership is taxable to the partners. However, if a partner is resident in a country that treats the partnership as an entity separate from the partners for its tax purposes (for example, because it has separate legal personality) the partnership is to that extent a reverse hybrid. Look-through companies can also be reverse hybrid vehicles in New Zealand (though recent proposed law changes will limit the ability for conduit income to be earned through a look- through company). A New Zealand trust may also be a reverse hybrid. For New Zealand tax purposes, income which is treated as beneficiary income is taxed to the beneficiary, not the trustee. However, if the beneficiary is resident in a country which does not recognise trusts, the income may not be treated by the beneficiary’s residence country as derived by the beneficiary, particularly if it is not actually distributed to the beneficiary. 7.3 An example of a reverse hybrid giving rise to a hybrid mismatch is in Figure 2.5 (repeated below from Chapter 2). Figure 7.1: Payment to a reverse hybrid (repeated Figure 2.5) A Co. - Interest Loan Country B Country A B Co. C Co. Country C + 54 Branches as reverse hybrids 7.4 When a country does not tax its residents on income from foreign branches, a mismatch of rules between that country and the country where a branch is located can lead to a reverse hybrid result. This can occur if a payment to a person is treated in the residence country as non-taxable because it is attributed to a foreign branch, but in the branch country the payment is also not taxed, because the branch country either: • does not treat the person as having a branch; or • treats the payment as not attributable to the branch. 7.5 Accordingly, Recommendations 4 and 5 are also applicable to branches in these situations. The branch is analogous to the reverse hybrid entity, and the head office to the investor. Recommendation 4 7.6 Recommendation 4 is when a D/NI payment is made to a reverse hybrid, and the payment would have been included in income if it were made directly to the investor; the payer country should deny a deduction for the payment. The Recommendation also applies if the payment would have given rise to a hybrid mismatch under the hybrid financial instrument rule if made directly to the investor. As with the disregarded payments rule, this rule can apply to any deductible payment. 7.7 Taxation of an investor in its home country on a subsequent distribution by the reverse hybrid of the income does not prevent a payment being subject to disallowance under this Recommendation (Final Report, paragraph 156). 7.8 Many trusts – for example, most family trusts, do not have investors as such. For the purposes of this rule, an investor is any person to whom income is allocated by a reverse hybrid. So it would include any person who is allocated beneficiary income. 7.9 The Recommendation will not apply if the reverse hybrid establishment country taxes as ordinary income the income allocated to the non-resident investor – for example, on the basis that the reverse hybrid is carrying on business in the establishment country. 7.10 The rule only applies if either: • the investor, the reverse hybrid and the payer are members of the same control group; or • the payment is under a structured arrangement to which the payer is a party. 7.11 The definit io ns of a control group and a structured arrangement are in Chapter 12. 55 7.12 There is no defensive rule for reverse hybrids. This is on the basis that if a country adopts Recommendation 5, there is no need for a defensive rule. Recommendation 5 7.13 Recommendation 5 contains three further recommendations regarding tax rules for reverse hybrids as follows: • Countries should ensure that their CFC and other offshore investment regimes are effective to prevent D/NI outcomes arising in respect of payments to a reverse hybrid in which their residents are investors. • Countries should tax reverse hybrids established in their own country to the extent that their income is allocated to non-residents who are not taxable on the income because they are resident in a country that treats the reverse hybrid as fiscally opaque. This recommendation would only apply if the non-resident investor is in the same control group as the reverse hybrid. • Countries should introduce appropriate tax filing and information reporting requirements on tax transparent ent it ies established within their country in order to assist non-residents and tax administrations to determine how much income has been attributed to their investors. 7.14 The proposed application of Recommendations 4 and 5 in New Zealand is considered below. Application in New Zealand Recommendation 4 7.15 From a New Zealand perspective, it will be New Zealand payers rather than New Zealand payees who are affected by New Zealand legislating for this recommendation. There do not seem to be any particular New Zealand- specific issues raised by Recommendation 4 that have not already been discussed in relation to the other Recommendations. Implementing the rule will simply involve denying a deduction if the necessary conditions are satisfied. Submission point 7A Submissions are sought on whether there are any issues relating to implementing Recommendation 4 in New Zealand. 56 7.16 From the perspective of other jurisdictions making payments to New Zealand, we note that a foreign investor PIE would seem to be a reverse hybrid, depending on the treatment of the investors in their home countries (see Final Report, paragraphs 161 and 162). However, a payment to a foreign investor PIE would not be subject to disallowance in most cases, due to the scope limitat ion of Recommendation 4. Recommendation 5.1: CFC and other offshore investment regimes 7.17 This recommendation is for New Zealand to ensure that a payment to a CFC that is fiscally transparent in its establishment country with respect to the payment is caught by the CFC regime, that is, that it is taxed to New Zealand investors in the CFC, if those investors are subject to tax under the CFC regime. In this way, the CFC regime would be used to turn the reverse hybrid into an ordinary fiscally transparent entity, at least insofar as it allocates income to New Zealand investors. 7.18 One way to address this would be to treat any person who has an interest in a CFC, as determined under subpart EX, to derive an amount of income from the CFC equal to the amount allocated to that person by the reverse hybrid for income tax purposes in its establishment country, and which is not taxed in the establishment country because of that allocation. This figure will already have been calculated by the CFC, and so should be readily available to the investor. In the case of an entity that is only partially transparent only the untaxed income would be subject to the CFC regime. 7.19 This is the approach suggested in paragraph 173 of the Final Report. It would override the rules which generally apply to the calculation of CFC income. In particular: • attribution would not be limited to the types of income specified in section EX 20B, being generally passive or base company income; • the exemption for non-attributing Australian CFCs would have to be amended such that reverse hybrid entities established in Australia would be excluded from the exemption; • the amount of income taxable in New Zealand would be determined under the tax rules of the establishment country, rather than under New Zealand tax rules. This is different from the approach taken for foreign entities which New Zealand treats as fiscally transparent – for example, foreign general partnerships. An investor’s taxable income in such entities must be calculated under New Zealand income tax rules. While this ensures that income from foreign sources is determined in the same way as income from domestic sources, it does require an additional element of compliance, and can lead to either double taxation or double non-taxation, either on a temporary or permanent basis; and 57 • the amount allocated to an investor would not be determined by reference to the investor’s income interest as calculated under New Zealand tax rules, but by reference to the investor’s percentage share of the entity’s income as determined by the rules of the establishment country (though the two would usually be the same or very similar). 7.20 This recommendation would also apply to the attributable foreign income method under the foreign investment fund (FIF) regime. It would not seem necessary to apply it in relation to the other FIF methods, which already tax on an accrual basis. While there are certain exemptions from the FIF regime, these do not seem to be available to a reverse hybrid, because all of them require that the non-FIF entity is liable to tax either in Australia or in a grey list country. This requirement might need to be modified to ensure that the exemptions are not available to partially transparent entities. 7.21 Trusts established in a foreign jurisdiction with a New Zealand resident settlor are already fully taxable, that is, it is not possible for such a trust to be a reverse hybrid. However, if a payment received by a foreign or non- qualifying trust which has foreign trustees is: • attributed to a New Zealand beneficiary under the laws of that foreign country and therefore not taxed in that country; and • not taxed by New Zealand, for example, because it is treated by New Zealand as trustee income that is not subject to New Zealand tax, the foreign trust is to that extent a reverse hybrid. 7.22 The mismatch could be resolved by treating such a payment as beneficiary income for New Zealand tax purposes. This should not be problematic from an administrative perspective, since the records of the trust in the establishment country would generally reflect in some way the allocation of the income to the beneficiary. 7.23 Alternatively, New Zealand could depart from the OECD’s approach and achieve the intention of Recommendation 5.1 through a different type of rule. 7.24 The UK has drafted a narrower rule than that in Recommendation 5.1. Its rule includes an amount in the income of a UK investor which is derived through a reverse hybrid only to the extent of a D/NI mismatch in respect of a payment to the reverse hybrid that is not counteracted in another jurisdiction. 55 This rule resembles the “defensive” parts of other OECD recommendations, such as the hybrid financial instrument rule (Recommendation 1) and the disregarded hybrid payments rule (Recommendation 3). However, this rule is more complex in that it requires the investor to determine whether or not a particular payment has given rise to a D/NI outcome and whether or not that has already been counteracted. 55 Section 259GD, Schedule 10, Finance (No. 2) Bill 2016. 58 7.25 Australia already has a set of rules that seek to counteract mismatches arising from reverse hybrid entities established in other countries. 56 These rules provide that a specified list of foreign ent it ies are treated as partnerships under Australian law to the extent that they are tax-transparent in their establishment jurisdiction. The rules therefore link the tax treatment in Australia to the overseas tax treatment and ensures that the untaxed income of the foreign entity will flow through to its Australian investors on an apportioned basis. 7.26 New Zealand taxes residents on the income they derive through foreign branches, so Recommendation 5.1 does not require any change in that respect. Submission points 7B Submissions are sought on whether it would be best for New Zealand to:  follow the OECD’s Recommendation 5.1 and amend its CFC rules as discussed above; or  adopt a more limited approach as in the UK; or  link the New Zealand tax treatment of income earned through a foreign entity to the treatment in the jurisdiction where that entity is established, as Australia has done on a limited basis. If the OECD approach is to be followed, how could New Zealand’s CFC regime best be adapted to impose New Zealand tax on income allocated to a New Zealand resident by a reverse hybrid? Submissions are also sought on the desirability or otherwise of changes to New Zealand’s trust and FIF regimes for the purpose of implementing Recommendation 5.1. Recommendation 5.2: Taxation of reverse hybrids established in New Zealand 7.27 Under this rule New Zealand would tax the foreign source income of (for example) a New Zealand partnership as if it were a company, to the extent that income is allocated to a non-resident 50 percent partner who treats the partnership as fiscally opaque. The ownership threshold is necessary to the example because the scope of the recommendation is limited to investors who are in the same control group as the reverse hybrid. If New Zealand turned off its transparency in this kind of case, neither payer nor investor country would need to apply their reverse hybrid rule to that payment. This approach would also apply to payments that are not deductible (and therefore not subject to Recommendations 4 or 5.1). A dividend paid by a foreign company to a New Zealand partnership with a majority foreign owner who treats the partnership as exempt would be subject to New Zealand tax on the same basis as if the partnership were a company. 56 Division 830, Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. 59 7.28 This rule could apply to limited and general partnerships, and to foreign investor PIEs, to the extent those entities derive foreign sourced income which is allocated to foreign investors. It could also apply to a New Zealand foreign trust (a trust with a New Zealand trustee but no New Zealand settlor, and usually no New Zealand assets), to the extent that the trust allocates foreign inco me as beneficiary income to a non-resident beneficiary in the same control group as the trust. 7.29 There is also an argument in favour of New Zealand taxing the foreign source trustee income of a New Zealand trust to the extent that that income is not taxed in any other country. The non-taxation of foreign-sourced trustee income of a New Zealand foreign trust is premised on the non-residence of the settlor. The trustee income is, in a sense, allocated to the non-resident settlor for the purpose of determining New Zealand’s right to tax. Accordingly, if the settlor is in the same control group as the trust, it would seem logical to apply Recommendation 5.2 to tax the trustee income, if it is not taxed to the settlor or any other person. 7.30 The definit io n of a “control group” is discussed in more detail in Chapter 12. The definition is designed to apply to partnerships and trusts as well as to corporate groups. Example 11.1 of the Final Report demonstrates that: • the power to appoint a trustee of a trust is treated as a voting interest in the trust; • where a settlor’s immediate family are the beneficiaries of a trust, they will be treated as holding equity interests in the trust, and these equity interests will be deemed held by the settlor under the “acting together” test. 7.31 This rule also suggests that New Zealand should tax the non-New Zealand source income of a non-resident if the non-resident’s home country: • treats the income as attributable to a New Zealand branch; and • on that basis, exempts it from tax. Submission points 7D Submissions are sought on whether and to what extent reverse hybrid entities established in New Zealand should (or should not) become taxable on their income under the principle of Recommendation 5.2. In particular, should trustee income earned by a New Zealand foreign trust be subject to New Zealand tax if the requirements of Recommendation 5.2 are met? Submissions are also sought on the proposal to tax income treated by another jurisdiction as attributable to a New Zealand branch, and accordingly not subject to tax, as taxable in New Zealand, even if it otherwise would not be. 60 Recommendation 5.3: Information reporting 7.32 Recommendation 5.3 is that countries should have appropriate reporting and filing requirements for tax transparent entities established in their country. This involves the maintenance by such entities of accurate records of: • the identity of the investors (including trust beneficiaries); • how much of an investment each investor holds; and • how much income and expenditure is allocated to each investor. 7.33 Recommendation 5.3 states that this information should be made available on request to both investors and the tax administration. 7.34 Naturally, New Zealand’s record-keeping and reporting requirements are focussed on ensuring compliance with the obligation to pay New Zealand tax. They are not generally designed to provide information regarding the derivation of income that New Zealand does not tax. However, the requirements vary. Taking the simple example of a tax transparent entit y which is established under New Zealand law but has no New Zealand owners or assets: • For a general and a limited partnership, there is a requirement to file an IR7 and also an IR7P. The IR7 requires overseas income to be recorded, and the IR7P requires the partners to be identified and the allocation of income to them. This seems to satisfy the requirements of Recommendation 5.3. • A look-through company is subject to the same record keeping and return filing requirements as a New Zealand partnership. It also must allocate its income and deductions between its owners (Tax Administration Act, section 42B(2)). • For a New Zealand foreign trust (one where the settlor is not New Zealand resident), the trust is required to keep records allowing the Commissioner to determine its financial position (Tax Administration Act, section 22(2)(fb) and (m). It must keep records of settlements made on and distributions made by the trust. It is also required to keep particulars of the identity of the settlor and distributees, if known (Tax Administration Act, section 22(7)). The trust also has to provide the identifying particulars of the trust and the address of the New Zealand resident trustees (Tax Administration Act, section 59B). There does not seem to be any requirement for the trust to file a tax return if it has no New Zealand source income. • For a foreign investor PIE, a return must be filed in the prescribed form (TAA section 57B). In order for foreign investors to not be subject to New Zealand tax at 33% on the PIE’s foreign income, they must provide to the PIE their name, date of birth, home address, and tax file number in their home country and New Zealand (Tax Administration Act, section 28D). 61 7.35 With the exception of trusts, New Zealand seems to already be compliant with Recommendation 5.3. The record-keeping and disclosure requirements for New Zealand foreign trusts was separately dealt with by the Government Inquiry into Foreign Trust Disclosure Rules, released on 27 June 2016. 57 57 http://www.treasury.govt.nz/publications/reviews-consultation/foreign-trust-disclosure-rules 62 CHAPTER 8 Deductible hybrid payments 8.1 Recommendation 6 concerns payments that are deductible in two countries. A simple example is a payment made by a company’s foreign branch. If the company is resident in a country that, like New Zealand, taxes foreign branch income, this payment will often be deductible both in the branch country and in the residence country. The same outcome arises if expenditure is incurred by an entity which is fiscally transparent in a country where one or more of its owners is resident (such as a New Zealand unlimited liability company with a US owner). 8.2 To the extent that such a payment is deducted in one country against income that is not taxed in the other country, the payment produces double non- taxation. This is shown in Figure 2.4, reproduced below. Figure 8.1: DD arrangement using hybrid entity (repeated Figure 2.4) A Co. +- Interest Loan Country B Country A B Sub 1 B Co. Bank 8.3 The primary response in Recommendation 6 is for the parent country to deny a deduction for the payment, to the extent it exceeds dual inclusion income (income taxed in both countries). The parent country is the country where the payer is resident (in the case of a branch), or where an owner of the payer is resident (in the case of a hybrid entity). There is no limitation on the scope of this rule. 8.4 The secondary response (which applies only to deductions that are not subject to the primary response) is for the payer country to deny a deduction for the payment, to the extent it exceeds dual inclusion income. The defensive rule applies only if eit her the payer is a branch, the owner and the payer are in a control group, or the payer is party to a structured arrangement. 63 8.5 Where a foreign tax credit is available in the parent jurisdiction in relation to an item of dual inclusion income, the Final Report proposes that the foreign tax credit can only be used to the extent of the tax liability in the parent jurisdiction on the net dual inclusion income (dual inclusion income less deductions) that arises. This is discussed in Example 6.4 of the Final Report, in particular paragraphs 13 and 14. Application to New Zealand 8.6 The primary response means that in most cases a New Zealand resident will not be able to claim an immediate deduction for a foreign branch loss except against income from the same country. This is because in most cases it will be possible for those losses to be used to offset non dual-inclusion income in the branch country. Unless it can be shown that such an offset is not possible, those losses will have to be carried forward and used either: • to offset net income from the branch in future years; • without restriction, if the losses have become unusable in the branch country, for instance because the branch has been closed down before the losses have been used or because of an ownership change. In this case the losses are referred to as “stranded losses”. 8.7 This denial extends to all forms of deductions – for example, it applies to depreciat ion and amortisation (Final Report, paragraph 192). It only applies to expenditure which is actually deductible. Thus, it will not apply to expenditure for which a deduction is denied under (for example) Recommendation 1 or Recommendation 4. 8.8 The secondary response will require New Zealand to introduce a rule denying both New Zealand branches of non-residents and non-resident owned New Zealand hybrid entities the ability to deduct expenditure against income which is not also taxable in the parent country, if that expenditure is not subject to the primary response in the parent country. Most obviously, this will deny such branches or entities the ability to group a loss against the profit of a commonly owned New Zealand entity (unless that entity is also a hybrid whose income is taxable in the parent country). It will also deny them a deduction for their expenditure against their own income if that income is for some reason not taxed in the parent country. An example is income earned through a reverse hybrid (see Example 6.1 of the Final Report). 8.9 As discussed in paragraph 200 and Example 6.5 of the Final Report, where the secondary response applies but the owner who is claiming a deduction in the parent country does not own all of the payer, the hybrid rules require the inclusion, in the payer country, of more than the amount which is deductible in both countries. This is necessary so that the amount of additional income allocated to that owner is sufficient to reverse the deduction. 64 Submission points 8 Submissions are sought on whether the denial of a deduction for foreign branch losses against New Zealand income should be matched by an exemption for active income earned through a foreign branch. This would put foreign branches of New Zealand companies in a similar New Zealand tax position to foreign subsidiaries. Submissions are also sought on any other aspect of the proposals relating to implementation of the OECD’s Recommendation 6 in New Zealand. 65 CHAPTER 9 Dual resident payers 9.1 Recommendation 7 applies to dual resident entities. It is similar to Recommendation 6, in that it deals with a situation where a single payment is deductible in two countries. However, in this case there is only one entit y involved, and both countries regard it as a resident. Since it is not easy to differentiate between the two countries, Recommendation 7.1 is for both countries to deny the deduction to the extent that it is offset against non-dual inclusion income. As wit h Recommendation 6, any deduction that is disallowed can be offset against dual inclusion income arising in a later period. 9.2 Since only one taxpayer is involved, there is no limitation on the scope of Recommendation 7. 9.3 If both residence countries have hybrid rules, it is possible for the disallowance to give rise to double taxation – for example, if it is offset against non-dual inclusion income in both jurisdictions (see Final Report, Example 7.1). However, given that dual residence status is in most cases deliberate rather than accidental, it should be possible for taxpayers to be aware of the possibility of double taxation, and by adopting simpler structures, avoid it. Application to New Zealand 9.4 New Zealand already denies a dual resident company the ability to use a loss to offset the income of other group companies (section IC 7(2)) and to join a tax consolidated group (section FM 31). While this substantially limits the kinds of structures that can give rise to double non-taxation using a dual resident company resident in New Zealand, it does not mean that there are no such opportunities. For instance, New Zealand could not be Country A in the Final Report’s Example 7.1, but it could be Country B. 9.5 The dual resident payer rule raises a number of issues that have been considered in previous chapters. In particular: • because a deduction is allowed to the extent of dual inclusion income, dual inclusion income needs to be defined – this is considered in Chapter 6; • determining whether or not a payment is deductible in the other country may require that issue to be determined earlier than when a deduction arises in that country, in which case the ordinary rules applying in that country should govern the question. At the same time the question requires certain entity specific rules in that country to be taken into account; 66 • the rule can sensibly apply to non-cash deductions such as depreciation and amortisat ion. Accordingly it is not necessary to restrict it to payments; • some equity returns that are tax exempt or tax credited on the basis that they are paid out of tax paid income should still be treated as dual inclusion income; • disallowed amounts should be able to be carried forward and offset against dual inclusion income arising in a later year. Carry-forward will be limited in the same way as it is limited for losses; • attributed income under CFC rules cannot be treated as dual inclusion inco me; • credit for underlying foreign taxes may be limited; and • if an entity is unable to carry forward its disallowed loss in one country, the other country can allow the loss to be deducted (see Final Report, Example 7.1 paragraph 13). Submission point 9A Submissions are sought on the OECD’s Recommendation 7 and any issues that may arise in relation to its implementation in New Zealand. DTA dual resident rule suggestion 9.6 In Chapter 13 of the Final Report it is suggested that countries should consider inserting into their domestic law a rule that deems an entity not to be resident if that entity is resident of another country through the operation of a DTA. 58 9.7 If incorporated into New Zealand law, this rule would prevent an entity benefitting from a mismatch between New Zealand’s domestic law definition of residence and the definition of residence found in any of New Zealand’s bilateral DTAs. 9.8 Canada 59 and the UK 60 have domestic law to this effect. New Zealand law currently features a series of provisions that ensure that an entity that is non- resident under a DTA cannot access various features of the New Zealand tax system (such as maintaining an imputation credit account). 61 However, New Zealand’s rules are not comprehensive, which potentially allows room for abuse. In particular, a company could manipulate its place of effective management under a DTA to avoid New Zealand’s corporate migration rules (as they do not provide for a company becoming non-resident under a treaty). 58 At para 432. 59 Section 250(5) of the Income Tax Act 1985 (Canada). 60 Section 18 of the Corporation Tax Act 2009 (United Kingdom). 61 See, for instance, sections FN 4, FO 3, HA 6, IC 7, and OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 67 Submission point 9B Submissions are sought as to the OECD’s DTA dual resident rule suggestion. 68 CHAPTER 10 Imported mismatches 10.1 Recommendation 8 in the Final Report relates to imported mismatches. It requires a country to deny a payer a deduction for a payment (an imported mismatch payment) which meets all of the following requirements: • is made to a payee in a country that does not have hybrid mismatch rules; • does not itself give rise to a hybrid mismatch; • which the payee sets off against a hybrid deduction, that is, a deduction for a payment that gives rise to a hybrid mismatch, or a deduction for a payment made to a third person which is offset by that third person against a payment giving rise to a hybrid mismatch. 10.2 The rule only applies if the payer is in the same control group as the parties to the hybrid mismatch, or the arrangement is a structured arrangement to which the payer is a party. 10.3 The rule is not limited to payments in relation to financial instruments. There is no defensive rule requiring inclusion by payees. 10.4 The objective of the rule is to increase the effectiveness of the hybrid rules. Importantly, the rule will not apply to a payment to a person in a country that has implemented hybrid rules. 10.5 The imported mismatch rule is potentially complex to apply. It will require knowledge of the tax consequences of a wide range of transactions within a group. On the other hand, if a group is structured in a straightforward way, and monitors the existence of hybrid mismatches in intra-group transactions, it is likely that the necessary information will be readily available. 10.6 Figure 2.6 (in Chapter 2 of this document) contains a simple example of an imported hybrid mismatch in a structured arrangement, and is reproduced again here. Figure 10.1: Imported mismatch from hybrid financial instrument (repeated Figure 2.6) Loan A Co. + - H yb rid Financial Instrument Country B Country A Borrower Co. B Co. Country C - + 69 10.7 The arrangement involves A Co providing financing to B Co by way of a hybrid financial instrument, with B Co then lending that money to Borrower Co in Country C. Suppose that Country C is the only one with hybrid rules. Leaving aside the imported mismatch rule, the result of the arrangement is: • a deduction for Borrower Co; • no net income to B Co (because its income from the loan equals its deduction on the hybrid instrument); and • no income to A Co (because Country A treats the financing as equity and does not tax the dividend). The overall outcome is double non-taxation. 10.8 Accordingly, under the imported hybrid mismatch rule, Borrower Co would be denied a deduction for the lesser of its interest payment and the interest payment by B Co. Non-structured imported mismatches 10.9 Final Report Examples 8.3 to 8.9 in particular demonstrate the application of the direct and indirect imported mismatch rule. These rules apply to payments within a control group. They apply when a payment is made by a payer in a country with hybrid rules to a payee in a country without hybrid rules, to the extent that payee is: • a payer under a hybrid mismatch (in which case there is a direct imported mismatch); or • a payer to a payee who is in turn a payer under a hybrid mismatch (in which case there is an indirect imported mismatch). Application to New Zealand 10.10 As it is part of the OECD recommendations, it is proposed that New Zealand should introduce an imported hybrid rule. Multinational groups with Australian or UK members will already need to be keeping track of uncorrected hybrid mismatches for the purpose of compliance with the rules in those countries, so the imposition of such a rule by New Zealand should not involve significant additional costs. This may require the New Zealand members of the group to have access to information held within the group but outside New Zealand. This should not be problematic, in a control group context. 10.11 Accordingly, an imported mismatch rule that is introduced in New Zealand should, so far as possible, be consistent with the rules adopted by the UK and Australia. For instance, the Australian Board of Taxation has noted that a de minimis/safe harbour test may be appropriate for the imported mismatch rule in Australia. 70 Submission point 10 Submissions are sought on whether New Zealand should adopt an imported mismatch rule as recommended by the OECD, and what matters may need to be considered in order to ensure that the rule works as intended, with compliance costs reduced so far as possible. 71 CHAPTER 11 Design principles, including introduction and transitional rules Final Report Recommendation 9 contains recommendations for: 11.1 • the design of the hybrid rules, including their interaction with other parts of the legislation, and • introduction and transitional issues, and how countries should implement the hybrid rules. Design and interaction General Most of the design principles in Recommendation 9 are uncontroversial, and 11.2 it is proposed that they would be utilised if the OECD recommendations were adopted in New Zealand. Adhering as closely as possible to the OECD recommendations is more likely to create rules that are: • Comprehensive. This is important so that the rules do not leave open or create hybrid planning opportunities, while imposing unnecessary compliance costs. • Consistent with those adopted by other countries. This will go some way to creating a single set of rules, so that the rules do not give rise to unintended gaps or overlaps, and anyone who is familiar with hybrid rules in one country will have a good idea of how they work in another. Nevertheless, some variations between countries are inevitable. Ordering of hybrid rules As recommended in the Final Report (paragraph 286), it is proposed that the 11.3 OECD recommendations would apply in the following order if implemented in New Zealand: • hybrid financial instrument rule (Recommendation 1) • reverse hybrid rule (Recommendation 4) and the disregarded hybrid payment rule (Recommendation 3) • imported mismatch rule (Recommendation 8) • deductible hybrid payment rule (Recommendation 6) and the dual resident ent it y rule (Recommendation 7). 72 Interaction of hybrid rules and withholding tax In accordance with the OECD recommendations, we propose that denial of a 11.4 deduction for a payment under any of the hybrid rules would not affect its withholding tax treatment. Interaction of hybrid rules and transfer pricing It is proposed that taxpayers are able to apply the hybrid rules in priority to 11.5 the transfer pricing rules. This will ensure that to the extent a payment is disregarded under the former, there is no need to undertake a transfer pricing analysis. When a New Zealand taxpayer is required to include an amount in income 11.6 under Recommendations 1, 3 or 4, the amount included would be net of (reduced by) any transfer pricing adjustment in the payer country. Interaction of hybrid rules and thin capitalisation Where a deduction is disallowed for an amount of interest under the primary 11.7 rule in Recommendation 1, or under Recommendations 4 or 8, it is proposed that the thin capitalisation rules be applied on the basis that the disallowed interest and the debt relating to that interest are both disregarded. This will produce the same result as if the interest was a dividend and the debt was equity. It will prevent any double deduction denial of the same payment. The interaction with thin capitalisation rules and Recommendations 3, 6 and 11.8 7 is more co mplex due to the carry-forward rule which has no equivalent in New Zealand’s thin capitalisation regime. Due to the carry-forward rule, if the disregarded hybrid payments rule applies before thin capitalisation, a permanent deduction denial under thin capitalisation could be replaced by a deduction denial under anti-hybrid rules which may be reversed by the carry- forward rule in a later year (due to excess dual inclusion income). To address this problem without giving rise to double denial of interest 11.9 expense, it is proposed that the carry-forward rule is limited such that the amount of denied deductions able to be carried forward is reduced by the amount of adjustment that would have occurred under thin capitalisation rules if there was no hybrid counteraction. With this limitat ion, the hybrid rules can apply before thin capitalisation and the intended result of New Zealand’s thin capitalisation rules will be preserved in the event of a carry- forward deduction being allowed in a future year. In applying the defensive rule in Recommendation 1 or 3, or 11.10 Recommendation 2, a New Zealand payee should not consider the thin capitalisation adjustments made by a payer jurisdiction. This is the same approach that is applied to a straightforward interest payment received by a New Zealand payee from a foreign payer. The amount of taxable inco me is not reduced on account of any interest denial in the payer jurisdiction. 73 Table A sets out the interaction between the hybrid rules and the thin 11.11 capitalisation and transfer pricing rules. Table A: Interaction of recommendations with other deduction denial rules Recommendation Transfer pricing Thin capitalisation 1 Recommendation 1 1.1 Primary rule – deny deduction in payer jurisdiction. Primary rule first, and then transfer pricing. Saves having to do a transfer pricing analysis in cases where the deduction will be denied in any case. Primary rule first, then thin capitalisation rules . When applying thin capitalisation, ignore disallowed interest, and treat hybrid debt as equity. Ensures no double disallowance. 1.2 Secondary rule – income inclusion in payee jurisdiction. Do not apply hybrid rules to the extent a deduction is disallowed by transfer pricing in payer jurisdiction. Apply secondary rule regardless of any thin capitalisation disallowance in payer jurisdiction – it is issuer- specific. Result is the same as if the payment were interest under a simple debt. Same applies to non- deductibility due to direct use of borrowed funds – see Final Report, paragraph 28. 2 Recommendation 2 2.1 Dividend inclusion in payee jurisdiction. As for Recommendation 1 secondary rule. As for Recommendation 1 secondary rule. 3 Recommendation 3 3.1 Primary rule – deduction denial in payer jurisdiction. Transfer pricing first, then primary rule. Because primary rule allows carry- forward, transfer pricing has to be done anyway. Primary rule first. However, carry forward reduced to the extent that thin capitalisation would have disallowed a deduction if hybrid rules had not applied. Because primary rule allows carry-forward and thin capitalisation does not, if carry forward is not reduced, deductions will avoid thin capitalisation scrutiny, or have the wrong ratio applied. 3.2 Secondary rule – income inclusion in payee jurisdiction. Do not apply hybrid rule to the extent a deduction is disallowed by transfer pricing in payer jurisdiction. As for Recommendation 1 secondary rule. 4 Recommendation 4 4.1 Primary rule – deduction denial in payer jurisdiction. Primary rule first, and then transfer pricing. As for Recommendation 1.

Submission point 11A Submissions are sought on the intended approach to manage the interaction of the OECD’s recommendations and New Zealand’s withholding tax, transfer pricing and thin capitalisation rules. Interaction of hybrid rules and the CFC regime Recommendation 5.1 as it relates to payments to a reverse hybrid is 11.12 considered in Chapter 7. Recommendation 5.1 also suggests that countries consider introducing or making changes to their offshore investment regimes in relation to imported mismatches. 75 One such change, labelled a “modified hybrid mismatch rule”, is set out in 11.13 paragraphs 29 to 33 of the OECD’s Final Report on Action 3: Designing Effective Controlled Foreign Company Rules. 62 The change suggested is that a payment from one CFC to another should be included in CFC income if it is: • not included in CFC income of the payee; and • would have been included in CFC income if the parent jurisdiction (the jurisdiction applying its CFC rules) had classified the entities and the arrangement the same way as the payer or payee jurisdiction. A more general issue is the extent to which a New Zealand company 11.14 applying the CFC rules has to determine attributable foreign income when taking into account the application of the hybrid rules. Submission points 11B Submissions are sought on: • the desirabilit y or otherwise o f this modified hybrid mismatch rule; and • the interaction more generally between the CFC rules and the hybrid rules. Hybrid rules and anti-avoidance We propose that the rules would apply before (and therefore would be 11.15 subject to) the general anti-avoidance provision. This will ensure that the hybrid rules, which generally apply automatically and do not have a purpose requirement, cannot be used for a tax avoidance purpose. It is consistent with the way section BG 1 applies to any other tax provision. If New Zealand implements the OECD recommendations, the UK approach 63 11.16 of having a specific anti-avoidance provision for its hybrid rules should be adopted. This provision would apply to an arrangement which has a more than merely incidental purpose of reducing taxable income by avoiding the application of either the New Zealand hybrid rules or the equivalent rules in a foreign jurisdiction. Taxable income for this purpose would include income taxable in a foreign jurisdiction as well as New Zealand. This reflects the general purpose and approach of the hybrid rules, which is to counteract the double non-taxation of income without any need to determine which country’s revenue has been affected. It may be useful to explicitly state, as the UK does, that in determining whether an arrangement does avoid the application of the rules, reference should be made to the Final Report and any document which replaces or supplements it. 62 OECD (2015), Designing Effective Controlled Foreign Company Rules, Action 3 – 2015 Final Report, OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, OECD Publishing, Paris. http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264241152-en 63 See proposed section 259M of TIOPA 2010 (United Kingdom). 76 Submission point 11C Submissions are sought on the proposal to include a hybrid rules-specific anti- avoidance rule. Legislative design The Final Report clearly expects countries to draft domestic legislation 11.17 implementing the rules, rather than simply incorporating all or some of the Final Report directly into domestic law. Nevertheless, the Report will continue to be an important document in interpreting the legislation, to the extent that interpretation requires an understanding of the purpose of the rules. It may be possible or desirable in some areas to legislate broad principles, 11.18 which could be fleshed out by regulations of some kind. Regulations, or some other form of subsidiary legislation, would have the benefit of being: • more easily able to be changed than primary legislation; • more flexible in their form. For example, it would be easier to include detailed examples, and to have extended discussion of the examples, in subsidiary legislation. Examples of where some form of subsidiary regulation might be appropriate 11.19 are: • fleshing out the imported mismatch rules; • providing detail on the definition and calculation of dual inclusion inco me; • determination of the extent to which CFC taxation can be treated as preventing a D/NI outcome; • resolut ion of double taxation outcomes resulting from introduction of the rules in New Zealand or a counterparty country – in this case the Commissioner might be given the power to override the rules where they would otherwise give a double taxation result. Submission point 11D Submissions are sought on the legislative design proposals set out above. 77 General rule for introduction The hybrid rules are intended to apply to all payments made after the 11.20 effective date of the implementing law. This effective date should be far enough in advance to give taxpayers sufficient time to determine the likely impact of the rules and to restructure existing arrangements to avoid any adverse consequences (Final Report, paragraph 311). Since the rules generally apply to arrangements between related parties or within a control group, restructuring arrangements should not be as difficult as it might otherwise be. Furthermore, the result achieved by the rules should not generally be a punitive one, rather it involves the loss of an unintended tax benefit. The Final Report also suggests that the rules should generally take effect from the beginning of a taxpayer’s accounting period. The Board of Taxation recommended that the Australian rules come into 11.21 force with respect to payments made on or after the later of 1 January 2018 or six months after enactment. The UK rules come into force for payments made on or after 1 January 2017, which is approximately eight months after the introduction of the Finance Bill which contained the rules. The impact of the proposals will in most cases be able to be established now, 11.22 by reference to the Final Report. We consider that the period from introduction of the relevant legislation to its enactment should give taxpayers sufficient time to determine the likely impact and accordingly the effective date of the legislation should be its enactment date. In accordance with the OECD recommendation, the provisions would then apply to payments made after a taxpayer’s first tax balance date following enactment. This is a similar approach to that taken to the implementation of the NRWT anti- deferral rules, 64 except that in this case there would be no early implementation for post-enactment transactions. An alternative approach would be the Australian one (application to all 11.23 payments made or received a fixed period after enactment), which would have the benefit of giving all taxpayers an identical start date for applying the rules. Submission points 11E Submissions are sought on whether there are any special circumstances that would warrant departing from the general proposition of no grandparenting, and whether the proposed effective date is appropriate. 64 In the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2016–17, Closely Held Companies and Remedial Matters) Bill. 78 Co-ordination with other countries Rules will also be needed to deal with different implementation dates by 11.24 different countries. Issues are raised in particular if one country applies an accrual basis of income or expense recognition while the other applies a cash basis. For example, suppose a hybrid payment in respect of a hybrid financial 11.25 instrument is made by A Co to B Co, and Country A does not have the hybrid rules but Country B does. B Co will be taxable on the payment. If Country A then introduces the rules, then A Co will be denied a deduct ion for its payment under the primary rule and B Co will no longer be taxable on that payment. If both companies are on a cash basis and have the same tax accounting period, there is no issue. However, suppose that the two companies have different tax years. Consider B Co’s tax year during which the Country A hybrid rules take effect. Country B will need to tax payments received by B Co during the part of its tax year before the start of A Co’s tax year, and not tax those received afterwards. Example 2.3 in the Final Report concerns a transitional situation where a 11.26 payer of a deductible/exempt dividend is subject to the primary rule in year two, but in year three the payee country introduces a domestic dividend exemption denial rule, in accordance with Recommendation 2.1. The payer is claiming a deduction on an accrual basis, but the payee is recognising income on a payments basis. The effect of the introduction of the exemption denial rule in the payee country is that the payer is entitled to a full deduction in year 3, and the payee is taxable on the portion of the payment for which a deduction has been claimed. That is less than the entire payment, since a portion of the payment was accrued by the payer in year 2, and was non- deductible due to the primary rule. 65 Submission point 11F Submissions are sought on any particular situations that might require particular care to avoid double taxation, beyond those set out here and in the Final Report. It may be desirable to provide some flexibility for the Commissioner to make discretionary adjustments where co-ordination issues mean that the application of the rules in two countries gives rise to double taxation. 65 Note that there is an error in the example. B Co’s year 4 interest deduction for tax purposes should be 75 and its year 4 taxable income should be 25. 79 CHAPTER 12 Key definitions 12.1 The last three recommendations in the Final Report are about definit ions. Most of the definitions are straightforward and they should be adopted so far as necessary. In this Chapter the question of how some significant definitions might be incorporated into New Zealand law is considered. Financial instrument 12.2 Recommendation 1 applies primarily to “financial instruments”. Recommendation 1.2(c) is that countries treat as a financial instrument any arrangement where one person provides money to another in consideration for a financing or equity return. 12.3 In New Zealand a financial instrument would include a financial arrangement as defined in subpart EW. However, a number of the exclusions from the financial arrangement definition would not apply. • Given the purpose of the hybrid rules, a financial instrument would include shares in a company, as defined for tax purposes. It would not include an interest in a vehicle treated as fiscally transparent for New Zealand purposes, such as a partnership or look-through company. • Variable principal debt instruments would be included. • The definition should also include annuities, farm out arrangements, share lending arrangements and livestock or bloodstock hire purchases, since all of these seem to have some financing component, and could be entered into in a commercial context. 12.4 It is proposed that the remaining excepted financial arrangements would not be financial instruments. This means that operating leases would be outside the definition, while finance leases and hire purchase agreements would be within it. Structured arrangement 12.5 The definit io n o f a “structured arrangement” is set out in Recommendation 10 of the Final Report, and discussed in some detail. The core definition is that it is an arrangement where either: • the hybrid mismatch is priced into the terms of the arrangement; or • the facts and circumstances indicate that it has been designed to produce a hybrid mismatch. 80 12.6 Facts and circumstances which would be taken into account in determining whether or not an arrangement has been designed to produce a hybrid mismatch would include whether or not the arrangement: • incorporates a term, step or transaction used to create a hybrid mismatch; • is marketed as a tax advantage product where some or all of the tax advantage derives from a hybrid mismatch; • is marketed primarily to investors in a country where the hybrid mismatch arises; • contains features that alter the terms if a hybrid mismatch does not exist, for example, a tax gross-up provision; or • produces a negative return absent the hybrid mismatch. 12.7 To incorporate this definition into New Zealand law, it is proposed to use the existing “arrangement” definition, and to define a structured arrangement as one where either: • the hybrid mismatch is priced into the terms of the arrangement; or • the arrangement has a purpose or effect of producing a hybrid mismatch. 12.8 As with the existing Ben Nevis factors which apply in the context of section BG 1, we propose that the list of factors provided in the Final Report be reproduced in guidance, rather than being legislated. This is also the approach recommended by the Australian Board of Taxation. Related persons 12.9 Recommendation 11.1(a) is that two persons are related if they are in the same “control group” (considered below) or: • one of the persons has a 25 percent or greater interest in the second; or • a third person holds a 25 percent or greater interest in both. 12.10 For this purpose, a person who acts together with another person in respect of the ownership or control of any investment in another person will be treated as also owning that other person’s investment. 12.11 Two persons will be treated as acting together in respect of ownership or control of an investment if: • they are family members. A person’s family members are: – persons who are within two degrees of relat ionship of the person, and those persons’ spouses; 81 – the person’s spouse; – persons who are within two degrees of relationship of the first person’s spouse; • one regularly acts in accordance with the wishes of the other; • they have entered into an arrangement that has a material effect on the value or control of the investment; and • the ownership or control of the investment is managed by the same person or group of persons. 12.12 An investment in an entity can be a voting interest or an equity interest or both. A voting interest can apply to non-corporate as well as corporate entities, and is a right to participate in decision making concerning distributions, changes in the person’s constitution or the appointment of a director, broadly defined so that includes the persons who have management and control of an entity. 12.13 A look-through test applies to trace interests through interposed entities. 12.14 This approach is similar to that taken to determining whether or not two companies, two natural persons, and a company and a person other than a company, are associated under subpart YB 2 to YB 4 and YB 13 and YB 14, subject to the fact that for two companies, the test generally requires a 50 percent common ownership. 66 However, the application to trusts and partnerships seems somewhat different. While it would make sense to build so far as possible on existing definitions, it is likely to be preferable to do so by using a stand-alone definition which combines existing concepts plus the modifications necessary to ensure that New Zealand’s hybrid regime has the same scope as others enacted in accordance with Action 2. Control group 12.15 Two persons will be in a control group if: • they are consolidated for accounting purposes, either under IFRS or applicable GAAP; • one of them effectively controls the other, or a single person effectively controls both; • one of them has a 50 percent or greater investment in the other, or a single person has a 50 percent or greater ownership of both; or 66 Also, the definition of a family member seems somewhat broader than the definition of a relative in section YA 1. For example, a person’s sister’s spouse is a family member but not a relative. We propose that the broader definition be used in this context. 82 • they are associated enterprises under Article 9 of the OECD Model Treaty, which defines when transfer pricing adjustments may be made. The Final Report states that countries should apply their own transfer pricing thresholds for this purpose, so that if transactions between two entities are subject to transfer pricing adjustments under domestic law, they are in a control group for purposes of the hybrid rules (Final Report, paragraph 367). 12.16 In determining control and ownership, the same rules apply as those in determining ownership interests for purposes of the related person definition. In particular, interests of persons who act together in respect of their interests, or are treated as doing so, will be aggregated as set out in paragraph 12.11 However, control is clearly a broader concept than ownership. For example, a substantial shareholder in a widely held company may have effective control over the appointment of directors, despite not having 50 percent of the rights to appoint the directors (Final Report, paragraph 364). 12.17 In the New Zealand context, in addition to the issues considered above in relation to the related person definition: • consideration will need to be given to whether the existing reference to “control by any other means” in section YB 2(3) would be interpreted by New Zealand’s courts in a manner consistent with its interpretation in the Final Report. If not, a separate definition may be required; • in accordance with the Final Report, two entities will be in a control group if they are associated persons for purposes of the transfer pricing provisions in subpart GC. Payment 12.18 “Payment” includes non-monetary flows, such as a transfer of shares or any other asset. It includes not only things convertible into money, but also anything that would be paid for if provided at arm’s length. In New Zealand terms it would be covered by the definition of “money” which applies for purposes of the financial arrangement rules. Submission point 12 Submissions are sought on any aspects of the OECD’s recommended definitions and how they could be adopted by New Zealand. 83

Information sharing between Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Social Development A Government discussion document Hon Anne Tolley Minister for Social Development Hon Michael Woodhouse Minister of Revenue First published in November 2016 by Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue, PO Box 2198, Wellington 6140. Information sharing between Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Social Development: A Government discussion document. ISBN 978-0-478-42438-6 CONTENTS CHAPTER 1 Introduction 1 Purpose of this consultation 1 Summary of proposals 2 How to make a submission 3 CHAPTER 2 Background 4 CHAPTER 3 Main proposal 7 Personal information shared 9 Use of information 10 Method of transfer 11 Safeguards 12 CHAPTER 4 Benefits and costs 14 APPENDIX Types of information shared 16 CHAPTER 1 Introduction 1.1 One of the principal objectives of the Government’s public sector reforms is for agencies to take a more collaborative, cross-agency approach to delivering better services to New Zealanders. Government agencies are expected to provide the right service to the right person at the right time, by improving the amount and type of information that can be shared between them. 1.2 Inland Revenue has been exchanging targeted information with the Ministry of Social Development since 1994. Those exchanges have delivered significant benefits to the Government and citizens in terms of service improvements and more accurate payments. 1.3 At present, agencies share information under a number of information matching and sharing agreements, which have specific purposes and enable limited information to be shared. This results in multiple requests for the same information under different legislative provisions to determine a customer’s entitlement to benefits and subsidies. These agreements also provide limited ability for collaboration between agencies, and are difficult, expensive, and time-consuming to amend. 1.4 Alternatively, an Approved Information Sharing Agreement (AISA) is a legal framework outlined in Part 9A of the Privacy Act 1993 that allows for a wider purpose for the information shared compared with individual agreements, while also providing robust privacy and appropriate safeguards around how that information may be used. 1.5 Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Social Development are seeking to replace their existing information sharing agreements with an AISA. This will allow a wider purpose for the sharing of information, which will, in turn, enable services to be delivered more seamlessly and in a timelier manner, by allowing the two agencies to perform their respective roles more efficiently. Purpose of this consultation 1.6 The Government believes the proposals set out in this document will allow the two agencies to provide services more efficiently, while maintaining the protections provided by the Privacy Act 1993 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. 1.7 The Government welcomes feedback on the perceived advantages and disadvantages of these proposals and whether further controls should be put in place. 1.8 These proposals build on the current successful information sharing activity. 1 Summary of proposals 1.9 The Government proposes that the current numerous and diverse information sharing agreements between Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Social Development should be amalgamated into one Approved Information Sharing Agreement. The diagram shows the information shared between the two agencies under those agreements.

The existing exchanges provide for: • better administration of shared services (such as Working for Families tax credits, c hild support, and student loans); • more accurate assessment of tax obligations; and • correct entitlement to benefits and other subsidies as a result of income and relationship information being sent from Inland Revenue to the Ministry of Social Development. 2.2 There are currently nine legislative provisions for the sharing of information between the two agencies. These provisions are reflected in the six administrative processes illustrated in the diagram on page 2. The provisions are: Tax Administration Act 1994 Section 81BA Pro-active sharing of Inland Revenue information with the Ministry of Social Development, to identify beneficiaries who are receiving income while on a benefit, in order to reduce benefit debt. Section 82 Exchange of information to verify entitlement to benefits or earnings-related compensation. Section 82A Exchange of information to ensure correct provision of an IRD number, and to prevent cessation of a benefit. Section 83 Exchange of information for the purposes of providing a Community Services Card to a beneficiary or to verify their entitlement to a Community Services Card. Section 84 Exchange of information to identify when a family is receiving Working for Families tax credits from both Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Social Development, and to determine whether the family was entitled to any benefit. Section 85 Exchange of information to assist the Ministry of Social Development to recover money owed by debtors. Section 85G Exchange of information to enable Inland Revenue to provide Working for Families tax credits, to seek an application from a family for a tax credit, to seek additional information in relation to a tax credit, or to cease payment of a tax credit. Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 Section 207 Exchange of information for the purposes of validating loan applications, setting up and maintaining Student Loan accounts and recording loan transactions. Child Support Act 1991 Section 240 Exchanging information for the purposes of carrying into effect the Child Support Act 1991 and the Social Security Act 1964. 4 2.3 Although the current information sharing is providing excellent improvements across a range of areas, the Government believes a more comprehensive approach would allow these two agencies to provide a better customer experience. For instance, the current information sharing agreements provide limited means to better support citizens or gain future efficiencies because of the specific purposes of the agreements. 2.4 The information exchanged is based on specific products, with each information sharing agreement having a very specific purpose. This restricts the use of the information to the assessment of a specific benefit or subsidy, and has led to multiple requests for the same information under different agreements, when it is needed for different purposes. 2.5 Research conducted by Inland Revenue and Victoria University of Wellington 1 indicates that New Zealanders are generally supportive of information sharing across government. They expect high standards of management around the information shared, and they expect their personal circumstances to be considered holistically. Information sharing will only achieve the benefits from the proposals outlined in this document if government agencies are trusted to share only when appropriate, and handle private information respectfully and with transparent processes. 2.6 This research also explored cultural perspectives on information sharing. In general, the public sees information sharing between government departments as “potentially beneficial but also needing strong protocols for privacy, data quality, transparency, and consent”. 2 2.7 Some common themes emerged from research on 13 overseas tax jurisdictions 3 about information sharing frameworks. These included: • requirements for clear processes; • public registers of approved information sharing activities; • scrutiny and reporting by an authorising body; and • the need for guidance to be provided to those processing personal information. 2.8 Of the 13 jurisdictions that took part in the research: • ten allow for disclosure by government agencies if public interest/benefit to the individual outweighs privacy considerations; and 1 Professor Miriam Lips, Dr Elizabeth Eppel, Amanda Cunningham & Virginia Hopkins Burns, Public Attitudes to the Sharing of Personal Information in the Course of Online Public Service Provision, Victoria University of Wellington, 2009. 2 Inland Revenue, Information sharing between government agencies – Cultural perspectives, Inland Revenue, 2012. 3 The Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, Austria, Australia, Canada, Alberta, British Columbia, New Brunswick, the United Kingdom, South Australia, New South Wales and New Zealand. 5 • nine allow personal information to be used for reasons other than the purpose for which it was gathered, provided the new use is either “compatible with” or “consistent with” the original purpose. 2.9 The proposals in this document would embed similar checks aligned with New Zealand legislation. 6 CHAPTER 3 Main proposal 3.1 The main proposal is to consolidate six of the existing agreements between Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Social Development into one. 3.2 This agreement would be authorised under the new Approved Information Sharing Agreement (AISA) rules contained in Part 9A of the Privacy Act 1993. AISAs are a mechanism in the Privacy Act that allow information sharing between and within agencies to deliver public services. These agreements clarify and improve the rules around how agencies share personal information, while ensuring safeguards are in place to protect an individual’s privacy. 3.3 This AISA has three purposes: • to consolidate the existing information sharing agreements between the two agencies under the Tax Administration Act 1994, Child Support Act 1991, and Student Loan Scheme Act 2011, into one agreement; • to extend the information sharing to enable the provision of targeted housing assistance to those in need; a nd • to extend the information sharing to verify a student’s and their parents’ income for the assessment of student allowance entitlements. 3.4 The proposed amalgamation of agreements under one framework would provide more flexibility to the sharing of information between the agencies. The AISA framework allows amendments to be made in the future when there is a need for including other agencies, new information and new purposes for sharing. However, any changes would still go through a robust process to make sure the Privacy Act safeguards are maintained and consultation is undertaken within government and with the public. 3.5 Including additional information in the sharing agreement would mean the Ministry of Social Development could ensure people receive correct entitlements and benefits across a wider range of services than currently. For example, the extension to include income information for social housing purposes would help in calculating the correct rate of income-related rent a household may be required to pay for a property. The Ministry of Social Development would verify their client’s self-reported income data against their income data from Inland Revenue. This creates greater efficiencies and reduces the impact on employers, who currently are required to provide that information. 3.6 An example where the AISA framework would prove its value is when a new agency for vulnerable children, currently under the Ministry of Social Development, becomes operational. 3.7 The new Ministry for Vulnerable Children – Oranga Tamariki, will begin operating in April 2017. This agency will be separate from the Ministry of 7 Social Development. Information currently provided to the Ministry of Social Development may also need to be provided to this new ministry to enable it to fulfil its functions. This change may involve the AISA being extended to incorporate a new party to the agreement and specify the information to be transferred. The requirements to enable that will be worked through with the new agency. 3.8 An AISA must include certain features required by the Privacy Act, including: • the purpose of the agreement; • privacy safeguards; and • advising what information will be shared and how. 3.9 AISAs can modify or override the Privacy Act’s information privacy principles or codes of practice. The most common exemption or modification, and the two proposed to be modified in this AISA, are: • Principle 2: Source of personal information – It is not a breach of information privacy principle 2 for the agencies to collect personal information from each other for the purposes of the AISA; and • Principle 11: Limits on disclosure of personal information – It is not a breach of information privacy principle 11 for the agencies to disclose personal information to each other for the purposes of the AISA. However, AISAs cannot modify or override information privacy principles 6 and 7, which allow a person to access and correct their personal information. 8 Personal information shared 3.10 Under the proposed AISA agreement, the information that is currently shared between the two agencies will continue to be shared. INFORMATION CURRENTLY SHARED BETWEEN AGENCIES 9 3.11 The information currently shared under each agreement is outlined in more detail in the Appendix. 3.12 Information shared under the proposed AISA will also include information used to assess an applicant’s entitlement to student allowance and housing assistance, including: • personal information – name(s) and contact details; • income information – salary or wages, employer(s) names and contact details, interest, dividends and Māori authority income, as well as self- employed or partnership income of the person, or in relation to student allowance applicants under 24 years of age, the parents’ income details; • family details – a partner’s name and contact details, salary or wages, employer(s) names and contact details, the partner’s interest, dividends and Māori authority income, as well as self-employed or partnership income. Most of this information is already shared under the current agreements. Question Do you think the information being shared will improve the services provided by the agencies? If not, why not? Use of information 3.13 The existing information exchange agreements have purpose provisions that are very specific, which restricts what the information can be used for. This may affect the agency’s ability to correctly determine entitlement to benefits and subsidies, result in multiple requests being made to Inland Revenue for the same information, or delay payments due to the need for evidence to be provided. The following examples illustrate some of the situations where this can occur. Example Currently, the Ministry of Social Development receives income information for the purposes of determining entitlement to main benefits. This income information, once verified with the customer, would also be useful in determining entitlement to social housing, but because of the prescriptive nature of the existing agreements, this income information cannot be used for other purposes. 10 Example A customer applies to the Ministry of Social Development for a benefit and must provide verification of their IRD number but some customers do not have this in their possession. Currently, the customer has to go to Inland Revenue to get verification of their IRD number. Under the Student Loan Scheme, Inland Revenue is able to verify IRD numbers in near real-time. If the purpose of the existing IRD number verification system were to be expanded in the future, the agencies would be able to verify IRD numbers for benefit applications, which would save time for customers. 3.14 To address the issues in these examples, the Government proposes to change the focus for information sharing, from agreements that share information for purposes of determining an entitlement to a product type (such as child support or Working for Families), to one with a more generic purpose. 3.15 The generic purpose would change the way information can currently be used, and the oversight and safeguards that apply to these exchanges. This will enable information to be shared for the purpose of determining an individual’s eligibility to benefits and subsidies provided by the two agencies, and for assessing tax obligations. 3.16 The Government could amend the AISA in the future to enable further information sharing between the two agencies or other agencies that join the AISA, provided the sharing meets the purpose provision. Questions • Do you agree with the proposal to expand use of personal information between the Ministry of Social Development and Inland Revenue? If not, why not? • Would you be prepared to have more of your information shared if it meant faster, more accurate assessment of your entitlements and tax obligations? If not, why not? Method of transfer 3.17 Currently, the agencies use various methods for transferring information between them. Different transfer mechanisms can lead to duplication of effort for each agency and increased costs associated with information sharing. 3.18 As agencies’ business transformation and information technology programmes progress, the two agencies propose to standardise the mechanism for exchanging information as much as possible, using up-to-date technologies and more secure information sharing mechanisms. This will reduce the administration costs associated with sharing information. 11 Safeguards 3.19 The Government takes the protection of personal information seriously. The proposed AISA would include controls and processes to minimise any risk of a privacy or secrecy breach occurring. 3.20 The sharing of information would only occur for the purposes set out in the AISA, namely for determining an individual’s entitlement to benefits and subsidies, and for assessing tax obligations. 3.21 Memorandums of understanding agreed by the two agencies would need to be in place before any information sharing could occur, and would provide: • details on how the information exchanges would occur, such as what information can be exchanged and the safeguards to ensure the privacy of the information shared; and • the designated senior personnel of each agency responsible for the information sharing. 3.22 Information would be available only to authorised staff in each agency, and customers would have rights and options available, to ensure their information is treated appropriately under the proposed AISA. These rights include: • the right to seek access to, and to have corrected the information held about them by an agency, under the Privacy Act 1993; and • the ability to use the internal complaint procedures of the agency concerned or seek assistance from the Office of the Privacy Commissioner if the individual has concerns about how their information has been treated. Inland Revenue and Ministry of Social Development staff who knowingly disclosed information outside what has been legally permitted would face potential criminal liability for breaching taxpayer secrecy. 4 On conviction they could be liable to a term of imprisonment up to six months and/or a fine not exceeding $15,000. 3.23 In the event that a privacy breach did occur, despite the protections in place, measures will be in place to ensure that any affected individuals are identified as quickly as possible. The necessary steps taken to minimise and mitigate any risk to those individuals are: • designated senior personnel in the relevant agencies would meet immediately to assess the issue and manage the response; • information-sharing would be immediately suspended if there was any risk of on-going breaches; and 4 Person would be breaching taxpayer secrecy under section 81 of the Tax Administration Act and on conviction could be liable to penalty and/or term of imprisonment under section 143E of the Tax Administration Act. 12 • the Office of the Privacy Commissioner would be notified and involved where appropriate. Questions • Are there sufficient safeguards for the protection of your information? What else should be considered? • Have all the likely issues relating to consolidating information sharing between the two agencies into one agreement been considered? 13 CHAPTER 4 Benefits and costs 4.1 Research shows there is considerable public trust that information sharing reforms will be beneficial to society, but this has to be balanced with a commitment to transparency by the Government. 4.2 From a customer perspective, greater sharing of customer information facilitated by the proposed AISA would, over time: • reduce the need for individuals to interact with agencies on multiple occasions or to provide duplicate information to government agencies; • make it easier for individuals to meet their obligations, thereby reducing adverse outcomes such as accumulating debt; and • meet evolving expectations of the public to provide joined-up social services across government agencies. 4.3 From a government and agency perspective, the wider scope of the agreement and having all information sharing under one agreement would, over time: • contribute to the Government’s Better Public Service objectives of better service to New Zealanders; • provide a foundation on which to base future sharing of information among the two agencies; • enable agencies to provide services more efficiently and effectively, by improving the timeliness and accuracy of benefits and subsidies, and assisting the assessment of tax obligations; • provide easier and faster access to government services and reduced compliance costs for customers; • reduce the administration costs associated with agencies sharing information; and • create public confidence through the perception of agencies’ efficiency in managing customer information – sharing the right information, in the right way, at the right time. 4.4 Benefits resulting from information sharing between Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Social Development are already evident under the current information sharing agreements. Information sharing has been helping the Ministry of Social Development to provide improved services by accurately determining entitlement to benefits, and quickly identifying changes in income leading to changes in entitlement. 4.5 Currently, one of the agreements shares employer monthly schedule information to identify all working-age beneficiaries who also have employment income. Since its implementation in 2012, the information 14 shared has helped correct thousands of benefits (including cancellations, overpayments and underpayments). This represented a dramatic reduction in beneficiary debt. For example, the average debt value for 2014–15 was $3,877 while the average for 2015–16 reduced to $1,428. 4.6 For the Ministry of Social Development, the benefits are reflected in the accurate determination of entitlements, early detection of customers with overpayments and identification of fraud. This ensures customers are given an opportunity to comply in a timely manner, which reduces the overall number of cases requiring further action. 4.7 For the Government, the more accurate provision of benefits and subsidies, and assessment of tax obligations will reduce the costs of providing such services. 4.8 Both agencies are currently going through a process of transforming their IT systems. Officials are working through the extent to which the IT systems used for the provision of information between the two agencies can be incorporated within each agency’s transformation programmes. To the extent to which this can occur, the additional costs to the Government will be kept to a minimum. 15 APPENDIX Types of information shared This Appendix lists the current agreements and the types of information shared.

MAKING TAX SIMPLER INVESTMENT INCOME INFORMATION A GOVERNMENT DISCUSSION DOCUMENT The sixth in a series of government consultation documents looking towards a better tax administration system for New Zealanders Hon Michael Woodhouse MINISTER OF REVENUE First published in July 2016 by Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue, PO Box 2198, Wellington 6140.

The way people invest is also changing. The sharing economy, where consumers interact with each other, bypassing the traditional third- party suppliers1, is growing rapidly worldwide, with PWC projecting growth in the global sharing economy from USD15 billion in 2013 to USD335 billion by 20232. Peer-to-peer lending platforms are now established in New Zealand, and overseas experience suggests that this type of lending will continue to expand here. Our tax system needs to be flexible enough to cope with growing levels of investment income, changing sources of investment income and new types of investment products. For these reasons, it is important to review how this type of income is administered. The Government wants to ensure that it has an accurate understanding of peoples’ income. It also wants to ensure that people and organisations pay the right amount of tax and receive the right amount of social policy assistance, and wants to enable them to do that easily. This discussion document is part of the Making Tax Simpler series, which began in March 2015. Ultimately, the Making Tax Simpler proposals are about making it easier for people to get their tax right. These are the main underlying principles: • Improve information flows to Inland Revenue and use the information received to pre- populate information for taxpayers to simplify the requirements for those taxpayers that have to, or choose to, file a tax return. • Increase the use of digital services to bring that information together. • Use the information to help ensure that people are on an appropriate tax rate. The Making Tax Simpler proposals are seeking to cumulatively make it easier for people to comply with their tax and social policy obligations, and to ensure they are receiving any tax and social policy entitlements that they are due to receive. The purpose of this discussion document is to seek your views on proposed changes to the way that tax on investment income is administered and in particular to the way investment income information is collected. 1 The most relevant part of the sharing economy for this document is peer-to-peer lending. 2 http://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/megatrends/collisions/ sharingeconomy.html CHAPTER 1 OVERVIEW 4 This discussion document looks at how these goals could be achieved in relation to investment income. In addition, the changes proposed in this document will support a number of future initiatives and are designed to gather enough information to give the Government flexibility in areas that will be consulted on in future such as the taxation of individuals and social policy (including Working For Families tax credits and Child Support). INVESTMENT INCOME AND HOW IT IS TAXED Investment income is income earned from the investment of capital. It can include: • interest; • dividends; • portfolio investment entity (PIE) income; and • royalties. Income distributed by Māori authorities to their members is not strictly investment income but can be subject to resident withholding tax (RWT), and is covered in this document. Withholding taxes are an efficient means of taxing investment income because they: • reduce the cost of tax collection by shifting the obligation from many people to one person – i.e. one withholder deducts and pays the tax for all the taxpayers it pays income to; • support compliance with tax laws as: • the investment income payer is reporting the recipients’ income to Inland Revenue which reduces the non- declaration of investment income; and • people who don’t declare their income still have tax withheld; • ensure taxpayers do not have to pay tax on investment income as one lump sum at the end of the tax year. Some investment income can have credits attached, as well as the tax withheld. Dividends can have imputation credits, and Māori authority distributions can have Māori authority credits. These credits represent tax paid by the company or the Māori authority. They are also a credit against the income tax owed by the recipient and Māori authority credits are refundable if they exceed the recipient’s income tax liability. 5 INTEREST When New Zealand residents invest in debt instruments (for example, bonds or bank deposits) they can provide their IRD number and select a tax rate: 0%, 10.5%, 17.5%, 28%, 30% or 33% (ideally they will match it to their own marginal tax rate in other words the correct rate for their last dollar of income)⁴. If the investor doesn’t provide their IRD number or doesn’t choose a rate, the 33% rate will apply. Interest paid to a non-resident is subject to NRWT at 10% or 15% depending on their country of residence, or the approved issuer levy (AIL) at 2% if elected by the non-resident. DIVIDENDS Dividends on shares (or other equity instruments) paid to New Zealand residents have RWT deducted and may also have imputation credits attached. The total RWT and imputation credits will be 33% of the dividend.3 Dividends paid to a non-resident are subject to non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) of up to 30% depending on their country of residence. THE INVESTMENT INCOME IN DIFFERENT WAYS TYPES ARE TAXED 6 PIE INCOME If a person invests through a PIE they can provide their IRD number and select their appropriate prescribed investor rate (PIR) based on their income in the last two years⁵. The possible PIRs are 10.5%, 17.5% and 28%. If the investor doesn’t provide their IRD number, the 28% rate will apply. The tax on their PIE income is then calculated based on the applicable PIR. MĀORI AUTHORITY TAXABLE DISTRIBUTIONS Taxable distributions from a Māori authority will have credits attached at a maximum of 17.5% of the total of the net distribution and the credit. If the Māori authority decides not to attach credits, or if the credits are less than 17.5%, they can deduct RWT to provide the same amount of tax credits to the member. If the distribution is over $200 and the member has not provided their IRD number, the Māori authority must deduct RWT at 33%, reduced by any credits attached, up to a maximum rate of 17.5%. ROYALTIES Royalities with a New Zealand source paid to a non-resident are subject to NRWT at 10% or 15% depending on the recipient’s country of residence. International tax agreements between New Zealand and some countries may allow for lower rates of tax. 3The Taxation (Annual rates for 2016-17 Closely held Companies and Remedial Matters) Bill proposes allowing companies paying dividends to companies to elect not to deduct RWT from fully imputed dividends. ⁴ The 0% and 10.5% rates are only available when taxpayers meet specific requirements. 5 Income for these purposes includes PIE income. 7 RWT deducted (withheld) from the income before it is paid to the recipient is allowed as a credit against the recipient’s total income tax for the year, in the same way as PAYE on salary and wages. PIE tax is usually a final tax but in situations where a recipient’s PIE income does become part of their taxable income the PIE tax is also allowed as a credit against their total income tax for the year. Royalties and dividends paid to non-residents have been included within the scope of this document as they are subject to the NRWT regime. There are, however, no changes to the administration of the taxation of royalties or dividends paid to non- residents proposed in this document. The Appendix explains how the rules and processes for tax on investment income currently work. It will help put the proposed changes into context. GETTING BETTER INFORMATION Improving the collection of information about investment income and taxes would give Inland Revenue a more accurate picture of an individual’s income during the year, allowing people's tax records to be pre-populated with more information. This in turn should increase voluntary compliance by making it easier for people to get their tax right. Collecting information from the payers of investment income is INTEREST RWT CERTIFICATES FOR 2015 INCOME YEAR PROPORTION OF TOTAL RWT PAID PROPORTION OF INTEREST PAYERS 1.0% 3.9% 4 1.8% 7.3% 3 3.7% 22.4% 2 5.5% 58.6% 15 0.8% 1.7% 0.4% 6 1.3% 0.3% 7 0.7% 0.2% 8 0.6% 0.2% 9 0.4% 0.2% 10 0.2% 0.5% 11-20 1.0% NUMBER OF CERTIFICATES FILED A large number of payers return a small number of certificates 81% file 8 significantly more efficient and reliable than collecting the same information from each of the recipients of the income. The most significant efficiency gains would be driven by the collection of information from investment income payers with large numbers of customers as shown in the diagram below. SUMMARY OF PROPOSALS The main proposals set out in this document are: • requiring payers of investment income to provide Inland Revenue with taxpayer specific withholding information on a monthly basis (or for the month of the business process of paying the income if that occurs less often than monthly); • taxpayer specific information would include: • the amount of income paid to the customer; • the amount of tax withheld (if any), or imputation or Māori authority tax credits attached; • the customer’s IRD number (if held); • the customer’s name; 0.5% 21-30 0.3% 0.3% 31-40 0.2% 0.1% 41-50 0.1% 0.3% 51-100 0.3% 0.4% 101-200 0.2% 0.1% 201-300 0.2% 0.1% 301-400 0.1% 0.2% 401-500 0.1% 0.7% 501-1000 0.2% 82.7% 1,001+ 0.5% A small number of payers return most of the certificates 9 • the customer’s address; • the customer’s date of birth (if held); • if the investment is a joint investment, information on each owner of the investment; • if the payer is paying approved issuer levy, details of the relevant customers; • if the payer is paying interest that is exempt from withholding tax, details of the relevant customers; • removing the need for payers of withholding tax to provide end of year tax certificates to their customers who have provided their IRD number; • increasing the “non-declaration rate”6 for RWT on interest and PIE tax to 45%; • creating a database of taxpayers holding certificates of exemption from withholding tax; and • requiring all taxpayers seeking to receive their investment income not subject to withholding tax to obtain a certificate of exemption. Proposals that the Government decides to proceed with would be expected to be included in legislation to be introduced in 2017. The application date of the legislation would follow a period of time sufficient to allow for system changes. HOW TO MAKE A SUBMISSION This discussion document seeks feedback from both payers and recipients of investment income. The Government invites submissions on the proposals raised.

The calculation of these entitlements and obligations is based around the taxpayer’s total income which includes interest income, dividends and some types of PIE income. By getting details about the recipients of investment income more regularly Inland Revenue will be able to have a more accurate understanding of the total income earned. The numbers of recipients of interest and PIE income shown only takes into account those recipients who have provided their IRD numbers to their investment providers or who have returned the interest income in their tax return or Personal Tax Summary (PTS). The dividend income information shown is limited to those dividend recipients who returned the dividend income in a tax return or PTS. Some recipients of investment income are likely to have more than one of the three types of entitlements or obligations shown and as such the diagrams show overlapping fields. The extent of any overlap has not been quantified at this stage. 12 WHAT CURRENTLY HAPPENS THE PROPOSED FUTURE SOCIAL POLICY PAYMENTS INVESTMENT INCOME INFORMATION TA XPAYER TA XPAYER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS COMPANIES MĀORI AUTHORITIES SOCIAL POLICY PAYMENTS INVESTMENT INCOME INFORMATION It can be difficult for individual taxpayers to keep track of their overall tax position based on the statements and certificates that they have received, as well as any other income they earned. This can make it harder for them to know whether they are fully complying with their tax and social policy obligations or receiving the correct level of social policy entitlement. Obtaining detailed withholding information regularly throughout the year would give Inland Revenue a better understanding of taxpayers’ income positions and the time at which the income was earned. This would enable Inland Revenue to more accurately determine the amount of social policy payments a taxpayer is entitled to receive or the amount of child support or student loan a taxpayer is liable to pay during the income year. 13 BACKGROUND The proposals in this discussion document are designed to remove or reduce inefficiencies in the current system for investment income payers, recipients and Inland Revenue. These current issues are summarised here. Tax information is hard to keep track of Different types of investment income are taxed in different ways. Also, if a taxpayer invests with a number of different investment providers they are likely to receive at least one withholding tax certificate or dividend statement from each of them. It can be difficult for individual taxpayers to keep track of their overall tax position based on the statements and certificates, as well as any other income they earned. This can make it harder for them to know whether they are fully complying with their tax and social policy obligations or receiving the correct level of social policy entitlements. The proposals in this discussion document would increase the amount of information that Inland Revenue will be able to pre-populate for taxpayers. For large numbers of taxpayers that would mean all of their taxable income information is available in one place. Taxpayers who receive income from a number of other sources that would not be able to be pre-populated, such as foreign sourced income and rental income, would still need to provide information on that income to Inland Revenue. The provision of information to Inland Revenue by payers and taxpayers is inefficient The organisations that collect withholding tax from investment income have to provide information to their customers. If their customers file a tax return they also provide the information to Inland Revenue. The inefficiency increases for taxpayers who have to collate investment information from a number of statements and certificates from various different investment providers. It would be more efficient if the information only had to be provided to Inland Revenue once, by the investment providers. CHAPTER 2 TAXATION OF INVESTMENT INCOME IN THE FUTURE 14 The timing of the provision of information, gaps in the information required and significant numbers of records without IRD numbers, mean that Inland Revenue is currently unable to effectively calculate income positions to use for social policy and to ensure returns are correct. This also makes it difficult for Inland Revenue to check that RWT rates and PIRs elected are available to the taxpayer. Non-declaration rates To make sure that investment income is taxed appropriately, people are supposed to provide their IRD numbers. A customer who doesn’t provide an IRD number is taxed at a non-declaration withholding tax rate, which is at least equal to the top withholding tax rate for people who have provided their IRD numbers. The non-declaration rates are intended to encourage people to provide their IRD numbers but do not create an incentive when the non-declaration rate is lower than or equal to the top marginal income tax rate (currently 33%). In fact, some taxpayers may have effective marginal tax rates that are higher than 33% if they receive social policy payments or have to make child support or student loan payments. The non-declaration rates are inconsistent across the tax system. PAYE on wages and salaries has a 45% non-declaration rate; the RWT non-declaration rate is 33% and the PIE non-declaration rate is 28%. As the RWT non-declaration rate is equal with the top marginal tax rate and the PIE non-declaration rate is equal with the top PIR (but lower than the top two marginal tax rates) they do not provide a real incentive for investors to provide their IRD numbers unless the investors are on low marginal tax rates. A SIMPLER FUTURE FOR INDIVIDUALS The Government thinks it would be simpler for taxpayers to comply with their tax obligations if Inland Revenue could show them a list of all of the income it knows they’ve received during a year, and the tax that was withheld from that income. The information could also be useful to taxpayers for non-tax purposes (such as proof of income for borrowing money). This would mean taxpayers with investment income wouldn’t have to collect and collate that information from the withholding certificates they receive from the payers of investment income. Having most or all of their income pre- populated in their tax records would save taxpayers time and reduce the risk of errors. The Government also thinks it would make things easier for taxpayers if Inland Revenue could assist them to work out which tax rate they should select for their investment income, to make sure that they are not overtaxed during the year, or undertaxed and face a tax bill later. Inland Revenue would be in a better position to do this if it received more information about taxpayers’ income during the year, rather than after the end of a year. 15 Obtaining detailed withholding information regularly throughout the year would give Inland Revenue a better understanding of taxpayers’ income positions and the time at which the income was earned. This would enable Inland Revenue to more accurately determine the amount of social policy payments a taxpayer is entitled to receive or the amount of child support or student loan a taxpayer is liable to pay during the income year. The ability to make timely adjustments would reduce end-of-year square-up issues such as taxpayers having significant amounts to repay, or having received too little during the year when they needed the assistance. WHAT WOULD NEED TO CHANGE? To achieve these goals, Inland Revenue would need to receive information from payers of investment income sooner and more often than it currently does. In some cases Inland Revenue would also require more information than it currently receives from payers (although payers already hold this information and they would not need to collect more details from their customers). Inland Revenue would need to receive and process this information efficiently, and match the income information to individual taxpayers’ records. DIFFERENT PROCESSES FOR PAYERS OF INVESTMENT INCOME Depending on the type of investment income that they pay and the type of tax that applies, payers currently have different obligations in terms of the information they are required to provide to Inland Revenue, and how often they provide it. In the future all payers of investment income would be expected to provide similarly detailed information on the recipients of the income and the amounts of income and tax credits they receive for all tax types and for income that is not subject to withholding tax. This information would typically be provided monthly, or in line with business processes if payments are made less frequently. The information would be transferred to Inland Revenue through an electronic data transfer process and would go through validation checks so the payer would be advised immediately if the information that they had provided could not be validated. This would enable corrections to be made quickly and save later rework. Payers could alternatively choose to complete an online form if that better suited their technical capability, or if they have a small number of investors. Payers of investment income and Inland Revenue would be able to communicate via a business- to-business information transfer, allowing the payers to receive electronic notifications of corrections to customer information from Inland Revenue, such as withholding tax rate changes if the customer is using an inappropriate rate. Payers would need to send more information on jointly held investments to enable Inland Revenue 16 CURRENT KEY Social policy payment Taxpayer's income INCOME TIME 1 April 31 March The social policy payments aren't reduced during the year to reflect the higher income received unexpectedly, so the taxpayer is required to repay an amount at the end of the year.

Spike in taxpayer's income Inland Revenue does an end-of-year square up which can result in issues such as taxpayers being under or over paid in regards to their social policy entitlements.

Inland Revenue would add the information received from payers to the recipients’ tax records. Payers would no longer have to prepare end- of-year tax certificates for customers who had supplied their IRD numbers. However, they would still need to prepare an end-of-year tax certificate for customers who hadn’t supplied their IRD numbers. Payers of investment income sometimes have customers who are exempt from withholding tax. Inland Revenue would provide payers with details on their customers who hold valid certificates of exemption, so payers can confirm whether they need to withhold tax. CHANGES FOR INLAND REVENUE AS WELL Inland Revenue would receive the validated information through online forms or electronic data transfers and this would allow Inland Revenue’s system to match the relevant information with individual taxpayers’ tax accounts without manual intervention. This would enable Inland Revenue to much more accurately assess the tax position of individual taxpayers throughout the year. Using the up-to-date information, Inland Revenue would monitor taxpayers’ income levels during the year and be able to increase or reduce income-targeted social policy payments such as Working for Families Tax Credits. This would help to ensure that people are receiving the correct level of assistance throughout the year and reduce the risk of an under or overpayment at the end of the year. Inland Revenue could also potentially advise payers of investment income of corrections to withholding tax rates and other information in time for the payers to make any needed adjustments during the income year. This would help to ensure that taxpayers are on an applicable rate for their circumstances and would reduce adjustments at the end of the tax year. For recipients who haven’t given the investment income payer their IRD number, Inland Revenue would use information matching tools to associate the income to the recipient taxpayer, if sufficient identifying information is available. COMPLIANCE COSTS The proposals in this document are part of a wider change to the tax system and the tax obligations of people and organisations. A fundamental reason to collect information from the payers of investment income is that this is significantly more efficient and reliable than collecting the same information from each of the recipients of the income. The greatest efficiency gains come through collecting information from payers with large numbers of customers. This discussion document proposes changes that are intended to simplify the tax system for individuals and to make more efficient use of 18 information. By collating all of the information that Inland Revenue holds on a taxpayer’s income in one place, and providing easy access for the taxpayer, Inland Revenue will make it easier for taxpayers to manage their tax affairs. It will take less time and effort for the recipients of investment income to understand their tax position and social policy obligations and entitlements, and filing a tax return will be able to be done more quickly. The proposed increases in reporting obligations would be expected to give rise to some additional compliance costs for payers of investment income. However, this is mitigated by the fact that the payers would not need to seek more information from customers, but rather to report more of the information they already hold. The adjustments to the reports that are produced by the payer’s systems should be a one-off cost, although it is possible that reporting additional information more regularly may give rise to some additional ongoing costs. These costs will likely be limited, as payers already have to calculate the tax when they pay the investment income and the more detailed reporting requirements will replace existing summary reporting requirements. Other changes are likely to reduce compliance costs for payers of investment income, including: • changes to make the transfer of information more efficient; • removal of some requirements, such as the need to send end-of- year certificates to all customers; and • the creation of a database of current certificates of exemption to make it easier for payers to manage their obligations. If these changes proceed it will be important to ensure that timeframes for reporting changes are realistic, as payers of withholding income would not be able to make the system changes until the requirements have been fully determined (feedback on realistic timeframes is requested later in the document). Some payers of investment income may also need to make changes to multiple computer systems and need to fit the changes in alongside other system change priorities. A number of other regulatory changes will also require system development, including the international Automatic Exchange of Information which is expected to require financial institutions to begin conducting due diligence and meeting reporting requirements on all new accounts from 1 July 2017. 19 INFORMATION IRD WOULD NEED Dividend information Companies provide detailed information to their shareholders (shareholder dividend statements) for each dividend that they pay but they only provide summary information to Inland Revenue on the total dividends paid, unless additional information is specifically requested. This means Inland Revenue is unable to associate dividend income with each shareholder. In the future companies would need to provide detailed information to Inland Revenue after paying each dividend, so the dividend information can be pre-populated on the shareholders’ tax records. The information that companies would need to provide would include identifying information such as the name, address and IRD number (if held) of the shareholder, as well as the amount of the dividend, any imputation credits attached and any withholding tax deducted. This is information that the company already holds in order to pay the dividends and send out the shareholder dividend statements. No changes are proposed for dividends paid to non- residents. Information for interest subject to RWT and NRWT and PIE income The detailed information that is currently provided to Inland Revenue after the end of the tax year regarding interest subject to RWT or NRWT and PIE income will still be required going forward (although it is likely to be required more regularly as discussed in the Timing, frequency and method section on page 30). This includes details such as the name, IRD number (if held), address, interest paid and RWT, NRWT, or PIE tax deducted from the interest or PIE income for each recipient. Information for exempt interest and interest subject to approved issuer levy Inland Revenue receives no detailed information about interest that is exempt from withholding tax or that is subject to the approved issuer levy (AIL). Having this information would allow Inland Revenue to allocate the QUESTION FOR READERS 1 Would companies have difficulties providing detailed dividend information to Inland Revenue so it can pre-populate shareholders’ tax records? If so, why and how could this be made easier?

Under this proposal the payers of exempt interest and interest subject to AIL (potentially limited to domestically issued debt) would provide detailed reporting like the reporting required for RWT, NRWT on interest and PIE tax. For example, payers will provide details such as the name, IRD number (if held), address, interest paid and AIL paid on the interest (if any) for each recipient. If the interest is paid to a New Zealand resident nominee company or an agent, the first payer would show the payment to the nominee or agent in their reporting, and the nominee or agent would provide detailed reporting for the payments that they in turn make. Where the interest subject to AIL is paid in respect of debt issued domestically (e.g. New Zealand bank deposits and bonds issued in New Zealand) we would expect the interest payers to hold the details of the investors in order to manage the payment of interest (whether themselves or through a New Zealand registry). Inland Revenue understands that where debt instruments (typically wholesale) are issued to offshore investors through offshore paying agents the New Zealand interest payer may not hold detailed information on the investors (they simply pay the interest to the offshore paying agent who pays the investors). Inland Revenue also understand that the offshore paying agents may be constrained in their ability to provide this information by privacy laws in their own jurisdiction. The Government is interested in feedback on whether this understanding is accurate and would welcome suggestions if there are ways that this information could be obtained. The Government is also interested in feedback from issuers of offshore debt instruments on the practical likelihood of New Zealand resident investors (other than collective investment vehicles) investing in these products. Provision of IRD numbers Associating income information with the right taxpayers is vital for pre- populating the income information into taxpayers’ Inland Revenue records. Successful pre-population will make it simpler for taxpayers to complete tax returns if they need to or choose to. If people do not provide their IRD number to the organisation that pays them investment income, it is difficult for Inland Revenue to associate the income with a particular taxpayer and to gain an accurate understanding of their tax position. This limits Inland Revenue’s ability to give the taxpayer the details they need to complete a tax return, and to calculate any social policy entitlements or obligations. It may also make it difficult for the taxpayer to calculate the prescribed investor rate (PIR) available to them in a future year. QUESTIONS FOR READERS 2 If detailed reporting was required for interest that is subject to AIL to determine the recipients eligibility to be subject to AIL how frequently should that information be provided? 3 If providing detailed reporting on interest that is exempt from withholding tax would be difficult please explain why and how this could be made easier. 4 If you issue debt instruments offshore do you hold information on the investors and if not are you reasonably able to obtain it? Contextual information supporting your answers and your views on the likelihood of New Zealand investors investing directly in these products would be greatly appreciated. 5 Are there any practical problems with providing detailed reporting? 22 As the top (and default) withholding tax rate for RWT is 33%, there is no incentive for investors who are already on the top tax rate to provide their IRD number to the organisations that they invest with as their investment income will be taxed at the right rate regardless. Similarly there is no real incentive for taxpayers to provide their IRD number to their PIE when they are on the 30% or 33% marginal tax rate, as their PIE income would likely be taxed at the 28% default PIR. The Government proposes making the non-declaration rates for RWT on interest and PIE income 45%. This gives an incentive for investors to provide their IRD numbers and aligns the non-declaration rates for these taxes with the non-declaration rate for PAYE.⁷ It would be important for investors to be adequately informed of this change, if it was made, to allow reasonable time for them to provide their IRD number and not be subject to the higher tax rate. The RWT non-declaration rate on dividends and taxable Māori authority distributions would remain at 33%. Company dividends have a flat tax rate of 33%, so requiring additional rates would cause significant compliance costs to change systems as they have not been set up to collect tax at different rates. Many Māori authorities also have significant administrative and system constraints and would be likely to have difficulty complying with more complicated requirements. If the PIE income non-declaration rate was increased to 45% this could be seen as unduly harsh as PIE tax is usually a final tax. Under the current PIE rules the recipient could not get a refund of the tax even if they filed a tax return. This could be alleviated by making PIE income that has been taxed at the non-declaration rate part of the recipient’s taxable income. They could then include it in their tax return and get a tax credit for the 45% PIE tax deducted. Alternatively, the tax deducted at the non-declaration rate could be left as a final tax as this would provide the strongest incentive for people to provide their IRD number to their PIE manager. Joint ownership of investments A proportion of the income from jointly owned investments is taxable to each of the owners based on their proportion of ownership of the investment. It is important to accurately allocate the income to each owner to ensure that their tax and social policy obligations and entitlements are correctly calculated. Joint bank accounts, other jointly owned interest-bearing investments and jointly owned PIE Investments Currently Inland Revenue receives only one IRD number for each jointly owned investment when interest and PIE income is reported, and has to rely on the owners correctly allocating the interest income in their tax returns (shown in the diagram on the next page as Option 1). The current method of reporting jointly owned investment income is not considered to be sustainable going forwards. To have some basis for allocating interest and PIE income to each owner for QUESTIONS FOR READERS 6 Should a higher non-declaration rate be put in place for RWT on interest and/or PIE income? If not, please explain why. 7 Would there be administrative difficulties in applying an additional tax rate for non-declared taxpayers? If so, please explain the nature of the problem. 8 If a higher non-declaration rate is put in place for PIE income should the PIE income taxed at the non-declaration rate be treated as taxable income of the recipient to allow them to claim the tax credits in their tax return? ⁷ The “Better Business Tax” issues paper issued in April 2016 also proposes a 45% non-declaration rate for contractors. 23 pre-population, Inland Revenue will need some identification details such as IRD number, name and address for each owner. Jointly owned investments are currently treated as a single record in withholding tax returns (Option 1), which is consistent with the way they are treated by the PIEs’ and interest payers’ systems. In order to include all of the owners’ details it might be necessary for the investment income payer to split the income and the tax withheld among the owners and then treat each portion as an individual record in the withholding tax returns (shown in the diagram as Option 2). The Government is aware that this could cause system difficulties for investment providers and also that the investment providers may not hold information on the proportions of the investment owned by each of the joint owners. As the joint owners may not own the investment in equal proportions there would need to be a way for owners to correct the income attributed to them if the investment provider cannot provide the ownership proportions to Inland Revenue. This would also need to be able to be cross-checked against the proportion attributed to other owners to ensure that all of the income is being returned. It may be possible for the owners to inform OPTION 1 Mary Bob $1,000 interest income goes into the bank account which is registered to Bob’s IRD number. The income information is then sent to Inland Revenue with Bob’s details. Bob and Mary’s money goes into their interest bearing joint account at bank. 123 Inland Revenue pre-populates the information to Bob who should then allocate a proportion of the income online to Mary ($750). INFORMATION BANK Bob Mary $5K $1K $15K 24 OPTION 2 Mary Bob $1,000 interest income goes into bank account registered to Bob’s IRD number.

Bank gives Inland Revenue a file telling us that Bob and Mary jointly own the account. Inland Revenue pre-populates the information to Bob and Mary and evenly proportions the investment to each. Bob and Mary are able to adjust the income levels if they do not hold the ownership of the investment in equal propotions and in this case Mary should adjust her income up to $750 and Bob’s should decrease to $250. INLAND REVENUE ALLOCATES MARY 50% INLAND REVENUE ALLOCATES BOB 50% BOB GOES ONLINE AND ADJUSTS HIS INCOME TO $250 MARY GOES ONLINE AND ADJUSTS HER INCOME TO $750 Bob and Mary’s money goes into their interest bearing joint account at bank. $5K $15K $500 $500 25 Inland Revenue directly if changes to the proportions allocated to the various owners are required. Alternatively, the jointly owned investment could remain as a single record and the investment provider could provide a supplementary return setting out the details for each joint owner (shown in the diagram on the previous page as Option 3). This would need to be linked to the record in the main withholding tax return by some form of unique identifier so Inland Revenue could split the income and the tax credits. The income could be split on a pro-rata basis unless the investment provider had details of the ownership proportions for the investment that could also be provided with the return. Joint ownership of other investments If shares are held jointly, the shareholder dividend information will need to include details for each joint owner to the extent that these are held by the company. The ownership of the shares and the entitlement to the dividend income will be treated as being held in even proportions. Membership of a Māori Authority is held individually rather than jointly and as such the discussion of joint ownership is limited to PIE income, interest bearing investments and shares. Māori authority distribution information Māori authorities provide detailed information to their members (distribution statements) for each taxable distribution, but they only provide Inland Revenue with summary information on the total distributions, unless additional information is specifically requested. This makes it impractical for Inland Revenue to associate distribution income with each member unless they file a tax return and declare the distribution income. Taxable Māori authority distributions are taxable income to the member that receives them. The member’s tax liability on their taxable Māori authority distributions may be covered by the attachment of Māori authority credits to the distribution, or the deduction of RWT. Inland Revenue proposes to include taxable Māori authority distributions and any attached Māori authority credits or RWT credits in the pre-population process. Māori authorities are not currently required to provide detailed distribution information to Inland Revenue. In order to pre-populate the information on taxable Māori authority distributions, Inland Revenue will need detailed information from the Māori authority on the amount of the distribution, the recipient, the amount of the Māori authority credits and the amount of any RWT credits. The information that would be required would be the same as the information that Māori authorities are currently required to send out to their members when they make the distributions, and would include QUESTIONS FOR READER 9 Are there better ways to deal with the allocation of joint interest income to the owners? 10 For interest payers and PIEs, how should joint interest information be provided to Inland Revenue? 11 How should the interest or PIE income be attributed to each joint ow n e r? 12 If you think that it would be difficult for Māori authorities to provide detailed distribution information to Inland Revenue, please explain why and how this could be made easier. 26 recipient details such as name, address and IRD number, as well as the amount of the distribution and any credits attached. It is similar to the type of information provided by banks in relation to interest that they pay to their customers. Date of birth information The Government proposes that date of birth information should be provided if it is held by investment income payers. Privacy concerns have been raised by submitters who responded to the Government’s Green Paper; however, having date of birth information would significantly increase Inland Revenue’s confidence in confirming the identity of the recipient of the income and ensuring that the income is allocated to the correct IRD number. There is also a proposal to collect date of birth information for PAYE purposes in the Making Tax Simpler – Better Administration of PAYE and GST discussion document. Some people use multiple spellings or versions of their name and it is not uncommon for two or more people to have the same name. People can also give incorrect IRD numbers in error. Where people have not provided their IRD number or have given an incorrect IRD number, providing the date of birth will improve Inland Revenue’s ability to match income to a taxpayer. Inland Revenue currently receives name and address information but adding date of birth information adds another layer of accuracy to the matching process and can make it possible to identify people even if they have had a change of name or address. Example Jenny and her mother have the same name and live at the same address. Jenny hasn’t given her interest payer her IRD number, but her mother has supplied hers. There is a risk that Jenny’s investment income could be matched with her mother’s Inland Revenue records. If they both had their date of birth recorded with their investment providers, Inland Revenue could be sure to allocate their income to the right accounts. QUESTIONS FOR READERS 13 Should investment income payers provide Inland Revenue with date of birth information for their customers? If not, please explain why. NAMEADDRESS DATE OF BIRTH EXTRA LAYER OF ACCURACY INFORMATION WILL ADD AN TRIANGULATION OF TAXPAYER 27 WHO SHOULD PROVIDE THE INFORMATION? The key driver of efficiency in withholding tax systems is large payers of investment income deducting tax from many recipients and paying that to Inland Revenue. This also drives compliance as there is third party reporting of the recipients’ income. Given these benefits, it is logical for these responsibilities to remain with the payers of investment income. There may, however, be the opportunity to remove some other obligations from the payers. End-of-year tax certificates Tax certificates – usually printed – are provided to taxpayers by each organisation that they invest with. Taxpayers with multiple investments can end up with dozens of different tax certificates (such as year-end interest certificates, shareholder dividend statements and Māori authority distribution statements) that they need to keep track of in order to understand their tax position. In recognition of this difficulty, some share registries offer their customers a summary of all of the certificates that the share registry has provided to the customer. The recipients then include the collated investment information in their tax return. This seems more difficult than it needs to be, particularly as some of the information has already been provided to Inland Revenue by the payers. If the income details can be pre- populated cumulatively through the year, taxpayers would be able to get a summary of their end-of-year position by logging onto the Inland Revenue website. This would make it easier for taxpayers that need, or want, to complete a tax return. Once this is working effectively it could be appropriate to remove the obligation for interest payers to provide end-of- year tax certificates to customers who have supplied their IRD numbers, as all their information would be in their Inland Revenue record. This could be a significant saving in time, effort and cost for interest payers. They would still need to provide end-of-year certificates to customers who had not supplied an IRD number, as Inland Revenue may not be able to match the income to the right person. In addition, if the non-declaration rate was increased to 45%, the end-of- year certificate would be a reminder to these people that they are being taxed more heavily because they haven’t supplied their IRD number to their investment provider. Private peer-to-peer lending The current withholding system typically requires payers to provide the information to Inland Revenue. This is most efficient for larger organisations who are paying interest and dividends to many customers, but is not as suitable for private peer-to-peer lending. This is not, however, a problem for peer-to- peer lending arranged through a commercial peer-to-peer lending platform as the commercial lending platforms undertake the withholding obligations and provide the required information to Inland Revenue. QUESTIONS FOR READERS 14 Should the Government remove the requirement for interest payers to provide end-of-year tax certificates for customers that have provided their IRD numbers? 28 Interest on private loans (for example, loans between family members) is taxable to the recipient but is unlikely to be subject to withholding tax (if the interest is less than $5,000 per annum it is unlikely to be subject to RWT). The lenders receiving interest from private loans may be unaware that they should be declaring it as income, and there is no third party reporting to help ensure that this type of income is declared. We do not propose extending withholding tax to include this type of lending if it is not included already. Instead, we propose adding a specific question to the tax return asking people whether they have received any interest income that has not had withholding tax deducted from it (this could have a note explaining that this includes private loans). The use of a specific question would aim to ensure that people knew that they had to declare this income and to encourage people to correctly declare their interest income without causing a major increase in compliance costs. QUESTIONS FOR READERS 15 How can disclosure of this type of interest income be encouraged? 16 Do you agree that adding a question to the tax return could be useful to encourage disclosure of this type of income? $ $ YOUNG FAMILY PARENTS GRANDPARENT PRIVATE PEER-TO-PEER LENDING 29 TIMING, FREQUENCY AND METHOD Timing The timeframes for filing withholding tax returns and making payments will remain the same, with the exception of March end-of-year returns. It is proposed that the detailed March returns would be filed by 20 April for RWT, NRWT and AIL and 30 April for PIE tax to enable pre-population of the investment income into taxpayers’ records. This will be necessary to give taxpayers access to complete records so they can use the information in their tax return and to support rate choices and social policy income calculations. Frequency of receipt of information Organisations paying investment income only supply customer-specific withholding information to Inland Revenue after the end of the tax year (and only for some types of income and some tax types). This information is received after Inland Revenue has prepared personal tax summaries and summaries of earnings (these currently only show employment, benefit and some pension income, for people to transfer to their IR3 tax return). The withholding tax information is not matched up with PAYE information, so Inland Revenue cannot intervene if withholding tax rates are not in line with a taxpayer’s marginal tax rate until well after the end of the tax year. This means that a taxpayer may have been overtaxed during the year and need a refund, or undertaxed and have more tax to pay. Inland Revenue is also unable to make adjustments during the year (based on the income for the year to date) to people’s social policy entitlements and obligations. For Inland Revenue to use information during the year to pre-populate taxpayers’ records, check tax rates, adjust social policy entitlements and obligations, and make better informed compliance management choices, it needs to receive taxpayer- specific withholding information more regularly. The Government proposes that taxpayer-specific withholding information should be provided monthly (or for the month of with the business process if the income is paid less frequently than monthly with the returns being due in the following month). This would include information on interest, dividends, royalties and Māori authority distributions subject to RWT, NRWT and AIL, and exempt interest and dividend income. The specific information required would be similar to the end-of-year information currently provided for RWT, NRWT and PIE with some enhancements, as discussed in the “Information IRD would need” section from page 20. Method of reporting The detailed income could be reported for each period or cumulatively to date. Reporting period by period would mean that after validation an amount would be added (or subtracted if there had been a correction) to the pre- populated amount in the recipient’s QUESTIONS FOR READERS 17 If taxpayer-specific information is to be provided more frequently, would it make a significant difference to compliance costs to provide the information monthly rather than quarterly or would the difference be marginal as system changes would be needed either way? 18 For organisations affected by the proposed increased reporting requirements, what would be a realistic timeframe for making changes to systems? 30 tax records. Alternatively, year-to-date reporting would enable the pre- populated information to be replaced as the new figures are transferred to Inland Revenue. Only one option will be made available to avoid confusion and unnecessary complication. PIEs Under the PIE tax rules investors have to select their PIR based on their income in the previous two years. Given the difficulties that taxpayers face in working out their income, there is a reasonable chance that taxpayers will be basing their choice of PIR on incorrect calculations of income. Taxpayers could also fail to complete a tax return when they are required to if they forget to update their PIR as their income level increases (or if they don’t realise that their income has reached an income threshold that requires them to select a higher PIR). If PIE information was provided more regularly Inland Revenue could help taxpayers to fix incorrect rate choices. The majority of PIEs are exit PIEs, which means they only pay tax on income at the end of the income year (unless an investor exits the PIE). This means that while PIE providers regularly calculate income and accrue tax some may not carry out a full and final tax calculation process until the end of the tax year. It could impose an additional compliance burden to require these full and final processes to be carried out during the year, and this may not be justified in cases where taxpayers do not need to include the PIE income for social policy calculations. It may be appropriate to only require monthly investor detail and income reporting for PIE income that is not locked in, as only this PIE income is included in the income calculations for social policy. PIE income that is “locked in”, such as income from KiwiSaver funds and complying superannuation funds with withdrawal restrictions, is not included in income calculations for social policy purposes, so such income may not need to be reported as frequently. An alternative option for locked in PIE funds might be to provide reporting on investors’ details and their current PIRs at some points during the year to allow Inland Revenue to check that the rates are available to the investors. This could perhaps be done quarterly or six-monthly. This reporting could also include the current level of PIE income and therefore the expected PIE tax on that income at the end of the year, to help to inform Government forecasting. Māori authorities As Māori authorities typically make distributions once or twice a year, the information requirement would be connected to the time of payment rather than requiring monthly returns. Companies paying dividends As companies typically pay dividends once or twice a year (and sometimes don’t pay a dividend) the information requirement would also be connected to the time of payment with a return for the month in which the payment was made being required (this QUESTIONS FOR READERS 19 Would it be preferable for payers of withholding income to provide the information for each individual period or for the year to date? 20 If you are a manager of a PIE fund (or funds), would your systems be capable of providing monthly income calculations (and investor details) or would the alternative reporting option be necessary for locked in PIEs? 21 What other alternatives should be considered for reporting investor details and PIRs and income reporting for locked in PIEs? 31 return would be due on the 20 th of the following month) rather than requiring monthly returns. Error correction If detailed information is required more often, it is inevitable that there will be some errors in it. While Inland Revenue would expect withholding tax payers to use due care in their reporting, there does need to be a mechanism for error correction. Minor errors should be allowed to be corrected in subsequent periods as long as the amounts are not significant. A minor error in programming a withholding tax system of a large interest payer could result in errors in the withholding from payments to tens of thousands of recipients. Even though the error for each recipient of the interest income might be very small, the cumulative error could easily be thousands of dollars without being significant compared to the total withholding tax being paid by the interest payer. If possible these types of errors should be corrected in subsequent filings to avoid recalculations for all of the recipients and refilings for the periods in error. There would need to be some restriction on the size of the errors that could be self-corrected in subsequent periods. This could be set as a threshold for the size of the error. Setting a simple dollar value threshold would either be too low to correct relatively minor errors for large payers (as discussed above a very small error across a large number of customers quickly adds up) or would be far too high in relation to smaller payers (as a suitable threshold for large payers would be likely to exceed the annual total of withholding tax remitted by smaller payers). The Government therefore proposes that the relative size of the error compared to the amount of withholding tax being paid should be taken into account in setting the threshold. It would also be inefficient to only have a percentage based threshold as a small payer might make a $50 error that equated to 20% of their total payment of $250. This could be far higher than a percentage based threshold but be too small to justify requiring the payer to resubmit the period that the error related to. For these reasons we propose that it would make sense to have a simple dollar value threshold for self- correction as well as a percentage threshold based on the amount of withholding tax the payer remits to Inland Revenue. As long as the error was lower than the higher of the two thresholds the payer would be entitled to self-correct in a subsequent period. QUESTIONS FOR READERS 22 Do you agree that there should be a simple dollar threshold and a percentage based threshold for error correction? 23 How should thresholds setting a limit on the size of the errors allowed to be self-corrected be calculated and what levels are reasonable? 32 METHODS FOR PROVIDING THE INFORMATION Making it easier to get information to Inland Revenue Currently a number of the withholding tax returns are paper-based (with no option for electronic filing) and the detailed information that accompanies the end-of- year reconciliation can be sent electronically or on paper. There are difficulties with the current methods for transferring electronic information to Inland Revenue as there is a 20 megabyte size limit for files attached to emails. This means that larger payers of withholding tax cannot email their information to Inland Revenue. The only way to provide electronic information is to store it on a CD or a USB stick and deliver that to Inland Revenue. The information is then processed and validated, which can take some time. Inland Revenue’s new technology platform will include changes to the way that withholding information can be provided. This will make it easier for payers to file their returns electronically with Inland Revenue. A key change for RWT, NRWT and AIL will be a gateway to upload information (similar to that already used by PIEs to file returns). Returns filed will go through an automatic validation process (as shown in the diagram on the next page), which means that any errors that PRESENTFUTUREPAST 33 would prevent Inland Revenue from using the information would be communicated back to the filer immediately. These changes would allow larger files to be transmitted to Inland Revenue electronically. In addition to the electronic gateway, there will be an option of an online form for payers who choose not to use the electronic gateway. The online form would be able to be populated with the required information. This option may be particularly useful for smaller withholding taxpayers as it would enable them to provide the information electronically without having to make their information fit the electronic gateway requirements. The pre-population of tax records is best supported by the provision of information electronically rather than by paper. However, we recognise that different types and sizes of investment income payers will have different levels of ability to file information electronically. In particular we acknowledge that some payers of investment income will not be ready to file electronically at this stage. There are several approaches we could take in relation to the filing options available to different payers of investment income. For example, we could: • Continue to provide all investment income payers the option of filing AUTOMATIC VALIDATION PROCESS Taxpayer files return onlineInland Revenue receives return Ò ü Information submitted is verified as being in the wrong format and sent back to filer Information submitted is verified as being in the correct format and is sent to Inland Revenue TA X RETURN 34 by paper, subject to a review after a given period of time, or until a given future date; • Require larger investment income payers to file electronically, for example those with more than a certain number of recipients to whom they pay investment income; or • Require almost all investment income payers to file electronically, with some exceptions, for example for those who do not have access to digital services. The second approach would require a threshold to be set. Setting an appropriate threshold would involve balancing the Government’s desire for earlier investment income information in a digital format and smaller payers’ concerns about the feasibility of accessing digital services. The Government welcomes feedback on these options. MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS Certificates of exemption When customers claim tax exempt status, the organisations paying interest and dividends have to manually check certificates of exemption from withholding tax and have no easy way of checking the status of these certificates. They may also have to ascertain whether the customer can appropriately claim to be exempt under non-tax legislation, in which case they may not even need a certificate of exemption. These challenges make it difficult for paying organisations to test whether all of the exemptions claimed by their customers are valid. Certificates of exemption issued and cancelled are currently published in the New Zealand Gazette each quarter. Inland Revenue proposes to create an electronic database of certificates of exemption that are currently valid. This would allow withholding tax payers to check whether a customer’s claim for an exemption is correct, and could remove the need for customers to supply a copy of their certificate to their investment provider. The database would be kept up to date for any new issues or cancellations and would offer a real-time source of information for withholding tax payers. It would also enable payers to review their customer files to confirm that all customers who are currently being treated as exempt actually are. Some people and organisations are also able to claim exemptions under Acts other than the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. These exempt people and organisations would not be included in the exemption certificate database unless they chose to get an exemption certificate. A database could reduce both the risk of people incorrectly claiming RWT exempt status and the compliance costs of investment providers if people with exemptions under other Acts were required to hold a certificate of exemption. They would QUESTIONS FOR READERS 24 What specific technical constraints or limitations should be considered when designing the electronic gateway? 25 If some investment income payers were to be required to file information electronically based on the number of recipients that they pay investment income to, what number of recipients should result in an investment income payer being required to file electronically? 26 Does the concept of having a database of the currently valid certificates of exemption have merit? If not please explain why. 27 Should people and organisations who are exempt under other Acts need to apply for a certificate of exemption in order to be treated as exempt from RWT? 35 therefore be included on the database of exempt people and organisations. The disadvantage would be a one- off administrative requirement for those people who were exempt under other Acts to get an RWT certificate of exemption when they may not otherwise have chosen to do so. Closely held company dividends and interest The Closely held company taxation issues issues paper (September 2015) discussed issues relating to the application of RWT to dividends and interest payments made by closely held companies (these are companies where five or fewer shareholders control more than 50% of the direct voting interests in the company). The paper referred some of these issues for consideration in the wider context of work being undertaken to streamline business tax processes. These issues are still under consideration and are not included in this discussion document. 36 APPENDIX – CURRENT STATE This appendix summarises the current tax rules and processes applying to the parties involved in investments and withholding tax. INDIVIDUALS If tax is deducted at a person’s marginal tax rate (the rate that applies to their top dollar of income) from their investment income, it is unlikely that they will have to pay any more tax at the end of the tax year. However, if tax is not deducted from their investment income at their marginal tax rate, they may need to request a personal tax summary (PTS) (or file a tax return if they also meet other criteria for needing to file). The following table from the Inland Revenue website sets out when a person is required to request a PTS: You must request a PTS if you...and you received... received income from $14,001 to $48,000 more than $200 of interest taxed at less than 17.5% received income from $48,001 to $70,000 more than $200 of interest taxed at less than 30% received income over $70,000 more than $200 of interest or dividends taxed at less than 33% received income over $48,000 more than $200 of taxable Māori authority distributions paid child support through Inland Revenue more than $200 of interest, dividends or taxable Māori authority distributions The PTS only contains information about salary and wages, and taxpayers have to enter details of their other income (such as investment income that has been incorrectly taxed) in order to confirm their tax position. At the end of the tax year, organisations that deduct tax from interest income are required to send their customers a certificate showing the interest income and the withholding tax. Each organisation that a person has been paid more than $50 of interest by will send the person at least one certificate (they may send more than one if the person has invested in multiple products). The person 37 is then required to look at all of the certificates to determine if they have received interest income totalling $200 that has had withholding tax deducted at a rate that is lower than their marginal tax rate. If they have, they are required request a PTS and potentially file a tax return. The portfolio investment entity (PIE) tax regime has specific rules around the availability of each different portfolio investor rate (PIR). If a person selects a higher PIR than they need to, the PIE tax deducted is a final tax and cannot be refunded. However if a person selects a lower PIR than they are allowed to, their PIE income is not covered by the PIE rules and they have to pay income tax on it. If their income tax rate is 30% or 33% they would end up paying more tax than the highest PIR of 28%. Taxpayers may be unaware that they have selected a lower PIR than they should, and may inadvertently not include their PIE income in a tax return. If people do not provide their IRD number to the PIE administrator they will be put on the top PIR of 28%. The PIE administrator is required, at least once a year, to ask these investors to provide their IRD number, but there is no real incentive for those on the 30% or 33% income tax rates as the PIE tax non-declaration rate is 28% (the same as the top PIE rate for people who have provided their IRD numbers). Even if tax has been deducted correctly from a person’s investment income and they don’t have any further tax obligations, they may still have social policy obligations resulting from that income. For example, even though PIE tax is a final tax, the income from some PIEs (essentially those PIEs where the funds are not locked in for superannuation purposes) has to be included in a person’s social policy calculations. People may be unsure which PIE income they should include in their social policy income estimate and end-of-year calculation. Social policy entitlements such as Working for Families Tax Credits are calculated during the year based on an estimate of income for the year.⁸ Estimates are often wrong, so a square-up calculation needs to be made at the end of the year when a person’s income is finalised. The person will then have to either pay back some of the money received during the year if they had underestimated their income or receive an extra payment if they overestimated. Payers Payers of investment income deduct withholding tax from the payments to investors. They remit the withholding tax to Inland Revenue with their monthly withholding tax returns. The payers provide the following information to Inland Revenue: • summary information (total income paid, total tax deducted) to Inland Revenue for RWT, NRWT, AIL and PIE tax each month; and • more detailed information (identifying the recipients and giving the investment income and ⁸ Child support obligations and entitlements for a year are usu- ally calculated before the beginning of the year based on the liable parent’s income for a previous year rather than being based on an estimate. 38 tax withheld for each recipient) for RWT and NRWT (on interest) and PIE tax at the end of the year with their annual reconciliation return. Payers provide an annual summary return to Inland Revenue for interest subject to AIL and Māori authority distributions. Payers are not required to provide any detailed information to Inland Revenue on interest subject to AIL, dividends, Māori authority distributions and interest paid to recipients who are exempt from withholding tax. Currently a number of the withholding tax returns are paper forms. The detailed information that accompanies the end-of-year reconciliation can be provided to Inland Revenue electronically or on paper. There is a 20 megabyte size limit for files attached to emails sent to Inland Revenue. This means that larger payers of withholding tax cannot email their information to Inland Revenue as their files are often much larger than 20 megabytes. The only way to provide large files of electronic information to Inland Revenue is to store it on a CD or a USB stick and deliver that to Inland Revenue. The information provided is only validated once Inland Revenue processes the information. If errors are detected during the year to 31 March they can often be corrected in the next monthly summary return, but if an error occurs before 31 March and is not found until after 31 March the return for the period to 31 March must be adjusted to correct the error so that the total information for the income tax year is correct. This can result in a significant amount of additional work for both the payer and Inland Revenue. Payers of interest provide tax certificates to their customers at the end of the tax year. When customers receive their certificates from one provider, some quickly decide to call their other investment providers to ask for their tax certificate. This puts pressure on payers to get the tax certificates out as soon as possible after year end to avoid spikes in customer calls. The certificates are usually posted to the customers, which can be a significant cost. If customers have an exemption certificate from RWT they have to show the payer a copy of the certificate before the exemption can be applied to their account. They are also required to advise the payer if the certificate is cancelled. The issue and cancellation of exemption certificates are published in the New Zealand Gazette each quarter, and payers should check this and update their records. This can cause issues if the Gazette shows a customer has had their exemption certificate cancelled in the previous three months and the customer has already provided a copy of their replacement exemption certificate, as the payer may incorrectly think the cancellation applies to the new certificate. Companies When companies pay dividends to their shareholders they deduct RWT at 33% (less any imputation credits 39 attached). The company sends a shareholder dividend statement to each shareholder, setting out the dividends paid, the imputation credits attached and RWT deducted. The company also sends a summary showing the total dividends paid and the RWT withheld to Inland Revenue. The company must keep records of the dividend payments to each shareholder in case it is requested but otherwise does not provide the detailed information to Inland Revenue. The dividends are subject to RWT at 33% (less any imputation credits attached) regardless of the shareholder’s marginal tax rate. This means that shareholders may be overtaxed when the dividend is paid and then have to file a tax return to claim a refund some time later. Inland Revenue Inland Revenue receives annual information about RWT that has been deducted. This information is manually uploaded and validated. This usually takes some time. The annual interest and RWT information is due to Inland Revenue after Inland Revenue has prepared the summaries of earnings (SOEs) and PTSs for individual taxpayers. Accordingly, the investment income and tax information cannot be included in the SOEs and PTSs provided to taxpayers. The timing of receiving and processing RWT information means that the square-up processes for RWT do not match the timing of other square-up processes, such as those for social policy payments. This process is inefficient and reduces Inland Revenue’s ability to effectively manage compliance in a number of areas. The information that Inland Revenue receives has a number of limitations. If a person has not provided their IRD number to their payer it is difficult for Inland Revenue to associate the income with the person. Income from joint accounts (accounts owned by more than one person) is only reported to Inland Revenue under one IRD number, which makes it hard for Inland Revenue to correctly associate the income with all of the owners of joint accounts. Māori authorities and their members Māori authorities can attach credits to taxable distributions to their members. A taxable Māori authority distribution is paid out of the Māori authority’s taxable income for the 2004–05 or later tax years. Māori authorities advise their members of any taxable distributions made to them by sending them a notice. Taxable Māori authority distributions are taxable income to the member that receives them. The member’s tax liability in relation to the distributions may be covered by the credits attached to the distribution and in some cases the RWT deducted from it. Māori authority credits represent the tax paid by the Māori authority on its income. The member receiving a 40 credit can use it to offset their own tax liability (ensuring that the income isn’t subject to double taxation). Tax credits are a maximum of 17.5% of the gross distribution – which means that up to $17.50 of Māori authority credits can be attached to every $82.50 of income distributed. Taxable Māori authority distributions are also subject to RWT if the: • Māori authority decides not to attach any credits to the distribution, • credits attached are less than 17.5% of the gross distribution, • Māori authority does not hold the member's IRD number and the distributions exceed $200, in which case the withholding tax rate is 33%, reduced by any Māori authority credits attached, up to a maximum rate of 17.5%. The member can offset the Māori authority credits and any RWT against their own income tax liability. They may get a refund if their marginal tax rate is less than 17.5%, or may have to pay more if their marginal tax rate is higher than the rate of credits or RWT. The Government understands that while some Māori authorities do still have balances relating to years before 2004–05 these balances are running out. As a result it is likely that most Māori authority distributions in the future will be taxable, with Māori authority credits attached. 41
The Government would like to get your views on changes it is proposing to make to the administration of information on investment income. The Government wants to improve the way Inland Revenue uses the information that it collects. It also wants to make it easier for taxpayers to access the information that Inland Revenue holds about their tax position. The amount of income New Zealanders earn from savings and investments is likely to grow over the coming years, as our population ages and more capital is accumulated. The Government wants to ensure it has an accurate understanding of peoples’ income. It also wants to ensure that people and organisations pay the right amount of tax and receive the right amount of social policy assistance, and wants to enable them to do that easily. The Making Tax Simpler discussion document just released continues the Government’s focus on finding out what New Zealanders want to see in our future modernised tax system. Specifically, the Investment Income Information discussion document consults on proposals that will increase the amount and frequency of information that investment income payers provide to Inland Revenue to enable recipients’ tax records to be pre- populated. The changes proposed will affect the following types of investment income: • interest income; • dividends paid to residents; • Portfolio Investment Entity (PIE) income; and • Māori Authority distributions. These types of income are subject to resident withholding tax (RWT), non- resident withholding tax (NRWT), PIE tax and approved issuer levy (AIL). The proposals will affect a wide range of payers of investment income including banks, all companies that pay dividends, PIEs, Māori authorities and individuals paying withholding income such as interest. The proposals also affect the recipients of investment income. In addition, the changes will support a number of areas that will be consulted on in future such as the taxation of individuals and social policy (including Working For Families tax credits and Child Support). This discussion document is your opportunity to tell the Government how you would like tax on investment income to be administered in the future. Please consider the proposals and take some time to tell us what you think. By helping the Government to shape the future of the tax system you can make a difference. makingtaxsimpler.ird.govt.nz INVESTMENT INCOME INFORMATION MAKING TAX SIMPLER THE PROPOSALS • Payers of investment income would be required to provide Inland Revenue with taxpayer specific information on a monthly basis (or for the months that they pay investment income if that is less often than monthly); • taxpayer specific information would include: • the amount of income paid to the customer; • the amount of tax withheld (if any); • imputation or Māori authority credits attached (if any); • the customer’s IRD number (if held); • the customer’s name; • the customer’s address; • the customer’s date of birth (if held); • if the investment is a joint investment, information on each owner of the investment; • if the payer is paying AIL, details of the relevant customers; • if the payer is paying interest that is exempt from withholding tax, details of the relevant customers; • payers of interest would not have to provide end of year tax certificates to their customers who have provided their IRD number; • the “non-declaration rate” will increase to 45% for RWT on interest, and for tax on PIE income (the “non- declaration rate” is applied when a customer does not provide the payer with their IRD number); • Inland Revenue will create a database of taxpayers holding certificates of exemption from withholding tax; and • all taxpayers seeking to receive their investment income not subject to withholding tax will be required to obtain a certificate of exemption. HAVE YOUR SAY Go to makingtaxsimpler.ird.govt.nz to find out more about these proposals and to have your say. These proposals would require changes to the law. If the proposals are passed by Parliament, Inland Revenue will communicate the changes to payers of investment income well in advance of the changes coming into effect. Consultation is open until Friday 19 August 2016. CUSTOMER STORIES Bob and Cathy: Retired couple with investments in bank term deposits, shares and PIEs Bob and Cathy worked hard and have saved for their retirement. They have made a number of small investments to reduce the impact if one of their investments doesn’t perform. Cathy looks after all of their important documents so has to collect all of their dividend statements, end of year tax certificates and PIE tax summaries. She is pretty good at filing the information but sometimes things get misplaced and she is always worried that they might miss something when they do their tax returns at the end of the tax year. They also have to split the income that they have received when they calculate their tax positions as they invest jointly. What if all of Bob and Cathy’s investment income was pre-populated on their Inland Revenue tax records and their income from their jointly owned investments was evenly split for them? Bob and Cathy could log on to their MyIR accounts, check that all of their income was shown and confirm their tax position there and then. They could also see what portfolio investor tax rate they were entitled to use in the coming year as all of the information would be showing in one place. Lenny: Finance team at a small bank Lenny works in the finance team of a small bank and has responsibility for looking after withholding taxes. Lenny knows that customers can be exempt from withholding tax on their interest income if they have an exemption certificate or if they are exempt under a non-tax Act. Lenny also knows that he has to remove a customer’s exempt status if their certificate of exemption expires or is cancelled. Lenny sometimes has to spend quite a lot of time trying to confirm that a customer’s claim that they are exempt under a non-tax Act seems reasonable and is uncomfortable with this where he is unfamiliar with the relevant law. He also worries that the bank may sometimes fail to remove a customer’s exempt status promptly enough if their exemption certificate expires or is cancelled. What if Lenny could just look up the customer’s details on a database administered by Inland Revenue that provided up to date information on the taxpayers that were eligible to be treated as exempt from withholding tax? Lenny could look up the status of a new customer in a few moments and he could also use the database to check that all of the customers that the bank is treating as exempt are still eligible to be treated that way. #makingtaxsimpler
