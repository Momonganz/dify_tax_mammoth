This includes transitional tax residents who are eligible for the temporary tax exemption. It updates and replaces IR1069 Tax agents’ guide for migrants and returning New Zealanders published in May 2018. The guide complements information on Inland Revenue’s general website at www.ird.govt.nz and our technical website at www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz. There are references at the end of many sections to relevant publications on these websites and to sections of the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. This legislation can be found at www.legislation.govt.nz. International tax can be complex and this guide is unable to address all scenarios. We therefore recommend consulting a tax agent if you’re unsure how the laws apply to your situation. This guide, the foreign income checklist (IR1248) and the flowchart for determining whether you’re a transitional resident (IR1249) can help you with those conversations. Voluntary disclosures New Zealand has entered into various agreements with other countries to exchange information about taxpayers to combat global tax evasion. For example, we now receive information annually from many countries about financial accounts held by New Zealand tax residents as part of the Common Reporting Standard. We match this information electronically to our records. There are shortfall penalties for not complying with New Zealand’s tax laws. We encourage you to correct tax positions that are wrong at the earliest opportunity. If you do this by way of a voluntary disclosure, penalties may be reduced by up to 100%. For further information, see www.ird.govt.nz/ managing-my-tax/fixing-mistakes-in-my-return/make-a- voluntary-disclosure.

Your worldwide income can include FOREIGN income even if you have not repatriated it to New Zealand or you have paid tax on it in the other country or the income is exempt in the other country. Some rules in New Zealand may tax CAPITAL GAINS and may do so even though the gain has not been realised. Examples include the foreign investment fund rules and financial arrangements rules. New tax residents and former tax residents returning after 10 YEARS may qualify for a temporary tax exemption on most, but not all, forms of foreign income. New Zealand will usually give a CREDIT for tax paid to another country, capped at the amount of tax payable here on the foreign income. We advise you to consult a tax AGENT knowledgeable in international tax if you’re not sure how the law applies to your situation as some of the rules can be complex. If New Zealand has a DOUBLE tax agreement with another country, it may affect how your income is taxed. Inland Revenue exchanges financial INFORMATION about taxpayers annually with many other countries and matches it to tax returns. There are shortfall penalties for not declaring income but they can be reduced by up to 100% if you make a VOLUNTARY disclosure. Top 10 facts ABOUT INTERNATIONAL TAX | 3 Foreign Income Guide 2022 How New Zealand taxes foreign income In general, New Zealand tax residents pay income tax on their worldwide income even if: • the income has not been repatriated here • the income has been taxed in another country • the income is exempt in the other country. Income is not necessarily limited to cash receipts but can include accrued and unrealised gains. New Zealand has double tax agreements with a number of countries. These determine taxing rights if you’re resident in more than one country or otherwise both countries may tax the same income. A DTA will usually provide for a tax credit to prevent double taxation. Even if there is no agreement, New Zealand will give a credit if the tax paid overseas is of substantially the same nature as income tax here. In both cases, the credit is limited to the lesser of the amount paid or the tax that would apply in New Zealand on the foreign income. New tax residents and some returning New Zealand tax residents may qualify for a temporary tax exemption on most, but not all, types of foreign income. This exemption generally lasts for four years. It does not exempt income with a source in New Zealand. A tax resident who earns foreign income will generally not qualify for the annual automatic assessment process and will need to file an IR3 return each year. The foreign income must be converted to New Zealand dollars. The general rule is to use the applicable spot rate but other methods may be permitted or required. In most cases, the tax year ends on 31 March. If your foreign income is under $100,000, you may be able to elect to report certain types of income you’ve included in a foreign tax return according to your balance date in that country, declaring that income in the New Zealand tax year in which the foreign balance date falls. Your IR3 return will usually be due by 7 July unless you have a tax agent. If any tax is owing, it’ll usually be due by 7 February the following year but if you have a tax agent, this date is extended to 7 April. An amount could be owing, for example, where the tax deducted in the other country is less than what is applicable in New Zealand. If the amount owing exceeds $5,000, it’ll usually be necessary to start paying provisional tax. Non-residents generally only pay income tax on income with a source in New Zealand and file IR3NR returns. If you need to pay income tax in New Zealand, you must apply for an IRD number. New Zealand tax residents should use IR595 IRD number application – resident individual. We also recommend registering for a myIR account on our website. This will allow you to file returns electronically should you wish to do so, manage your personal details and correspond with us through secure email. 4 | Determining your New Zealand tax residency It’s essential to determine your tax residency status in New Zealand. As noted, New Zealand tax residents generally pay income tax on worldwide income while non-residents pay it on income with a New Zealand source. You become tax resident in New Zealand in 1 of 2 ways. The 183-day test You’re a tax resident in New Zealand if you’ve been here for more than 183 days in a rolling 12-month period. The days you arrive in or leave New Zealand count as whole days. If you exceed 183 days, the starting date of your residency is backdated to the first of those days. EXAMPLE James arrives in New Zealand on 16 June 2020. He leaves on 17 September 2020 but returns again on 18 October 2020. He stays until 28 February 2021. James exceeds 183 days on 15 January 2021, calculated as follows: MONTHDAY June 202015 July 202031 August 202031 September 202017 October 202014 November 202030 December 202031 January 202115 Total days184 The start of James’s tax residency is backdated to 16 June 2020. The permanent place of abode test You may also become resident by acquiring a permanent place of abode even if you have not met the 183-day test. It’s usually more relevant when a person leaves New Zealand. Whether you have a permanent place of abode depends on the facts and circumstances. The key element is whether you have a dwelling in New Zealand where you habitually reside even if you spend periods of time overseas. It is not necessary that you own the property. It may also be relevant to look at your continuing ties to New Zealand, such as your travel movements, family and social ties and the location of personal property. EXAMPLE In the previous example, assume James purchases a house to live in on 31 August 2020. Although he’s resident from that date under the permanent place of abode test, this is superseded by the 183-day test and his residency will be backdated to 16 June 2020. Becoming non-resident You become non-resident by being absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in a rolling 12-month period. Your non- residency is backdated to the first of the 325 days. However, you cannot become a non-resident unless you cease to have a permanent place of abode. | 5 Foreign Income Guide 2022 Transitional residents and dual residents See the sections on transitional residents (page 6) and double tax agreements (page 8), respectively. Special cases • If you’re absent from the country in the service of the New Zealand government, you remain tax resident. This rule does not apply to your family if they travel with you. • If you’re employed under recognised seasonal employer instructions or foreign crew of fishing vessels instructions, you’re not subject to the 183-day test. You remain non- resident unless you acquire a permanent place of abode. • If you’re a member of the crew of a visiting pleasure craft, you are not subject to the 183-day test. You remain non- resident if you do not stay for more than 365 days in any 2-year period and do not acquire a permanent place of abode. Other conditions need to be met. • If you were unable to return to or leave New Zealand due to COVID-19 travel restrictions and this has affected your residency status under the day-test rules, you may be able to disregard these days. See COVID-19 variations on our tax technical website. Help If you’re unsure about your status, you can complete and send us form IR886 or seek advice from a tax agent. You may also be eligible to apply for a short-process ruling and obtain increased certainty. There is a fee but the ruling is binding on the Commissioner. You can make an application in myIR or use the online form on our website.

You’re eligible for the exemption if: • you’re a new tax resident • you’ve been non-resident for more than 10 years before becoming tax resident again. However, you cannot claim the exemption if: • you or your partner have applied for Working for Families Tax Credits • you’ve claimed the exemption before • you opt out. You claim the exemption by not reporting foreign income in an IR3 return. Inland Revenue encourages you to let us know. The IR1249 flowchart will help you to determine whether you qualify. Opting out of the exemption You do not have to claim the exemption. You may prefer to pay tax on your worldwide income so that you can claim Working for Families Tax Credits or foreign losses. As you cannot change your decision, you may want to seek advice. You advise us that you do not wish to be a transitional resident by doing any of the following: • either you or your partner applying for Working for Families Tax Credits • returning foreign income in your IR3 return • writing to us. Taxable income for transitional residents Most types of foreign income are exempt for the period of the exemption. However, you need to pay income tax on: • foreign employment income • foreign income from services. You also need to pay tax on New Zealand income. If you invest in a zero-rate portfolio investment entity, you can use a prescribed investor rate of 0% while you’re a transitional resident. | 7 Foreign Income Guide 2022 REFERENCES IR855 Information for resident individuals who invest in PIEs, June 2021 IR1249 Transitional residency flowchart for individual New Zealand tax residents, June 2022 Interpretation Statement IS 16/03 Tax residence – Part 1, September 2016 Section CW 27 Certain income derived by transitional resident Section HR 8 Transitional residents Length of the exemption The exemption starts on the first day you qualify as a tax resident. The exemption applies until the earlier of the following events: • you opt out • you become non-resident • your transitional residency period ends. The transitional residency period ends on the last day of the 48th month after you first became tax resident. For the purposes of the rule, there is no backdating as is the case when applying the 183-day test. EXAMPLE Sanil arrives in New Zealand on 1 January 2020 for the first time in his life to start a job here. He buys a house on 1 February 2020. Sanil’s exemption starts on 1 January 2020 under the 183-day test. It ends on 29 February 2024 as that is 48 months after he first became a resident under the permanent place of abode test. EXAMPLE Steven returns to New Zealand on 1 January 2020 after having been overseas for 15 years. He travels internally before renting a property in Auckland on 15 August 2020. Steven meets the tax residency requirements on 2 July 2020 under the 183-day test. His transitional residency starts on 1 January 2020. It ends on 31 July 2024 as this is 48 months after the end of the month in which he became a resident. The backdating rule is ignored when calculating the end date. Steven acquired a permanent place of abode in August 2020 but it is not relevant as it falls after the date used for the 183-day test. Ceasing to be a transitional resident You usually will not be advised when your transitional residency period ends and will need to self-assess when to start returning any foreign income in your IR3 returns. Double tax agreements DTAs are agreements between countries which aim to prevent double taxation. They may do this by giving taxing rights to one country and exempting the income in the other country. Alternatively, the income may be taxable in both countries but the country of residence will usually provide a tax credit. The rate of withholding tax in the country of source will often be reduced. They also have provisions enabling the exchange of information between countries. While the agreements follow a model convention, no two agreements are the same. Many DTAs are being updated as part of a global effort to combat tax practices that abuse or exploit them to minimise tax in inappropriate ways. New Zealand’s DTAs New Zealand has DTAs with the following 40 countries or territories. GermanyBelgium PolandThailand SwedenNorwayFijiJapan FinlandSwitzerlandAustralia Papua New Guinea Korea FranceTaiwanAustriaPhilippinesMalaysia Hong KongCanada United Arab Emirates Russian Federation India United Kingdom ChileSamoa Indonesia United States of America ChinaSingapore Ireland Czech Republic Viet Nam Mexico South Africa DenmarkItalyNetherlandsSpain Turkey To check if there are any changes, go to http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/tax-treaties#dta There are also links to each agreement. 8 | | 9 Foreign Income Guide 2022 REFERENCES IR486 File a tax sparing disclosure return, October 2014 Interpretation Statement IS 14/02 Income tax - Foreign tax credits – What is a tax of substantially the same nature as income tax imposed under s BB 1? , April 2014 Interpretation Statement IS 16/03 Tax residence – Part 1, September 2016 Subpart LJ Tax credits for foreign income tax Dual residents It’s possible to be a tax resident in more than one country. For instance, you may have become a New Zealand tax resident due to being here for more than 183 days but be resident in another country due to having a permanent place of abode there. Individuals absent from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand government are deemed to be tax resident here but may also qualify as a resident in the other country. DTAs have ‘tie-breaker’ tests to determine which country an individual will be tax resident of for treaty purposes. The person remains a tax resident in both countries for other purposes. EXAMPLE Walter is a dual tax resident of Germany and New Zealand but tie breaks to Germany. He derives interest from a New Zealand bank account. The bank deducts resident withholding tax as Walter is tax resident here but the rate is reduced by the DTA as for that purpose he is a tax resident of Germany. Foreign tax credits for New Zealand tax residents When you pay tax twice on the same income in 2 countries, a DTA will usually allow a tax credit where you’re tax resident. If you’re a New Zealand tax resident, you claim foreign tax credits in your IR3 return but you’re limited to the lowest amount of the: • tax paid to the other country • amount allowed in the DTA • tax you would need to pay in New Zealand on the same income. You’ll need to show proof of the tax you’ve paid to the other country. If there’s no DTA, New Zealand will usually give a credit if the tax is substantially the same as income tax here but subject to the limitations above as to amount. Tax sparing credits for New Zealand tax residents A small number of DTAs allow tax sparing credits to be claimed in New Zealand in specified situations. The credits are concessionary and represent tax deemed to have been paid under the relevant DTA. Agreements are currently in place with 7 countries. China Fiji India Korea Malaysia Singapore Viet Nam You must complete an IR486 to claim tax sparing credits. 10 | Foreign interest income and the financial arrangements rules If you’re a New Zealand tax resident and party to a financial arrangement, you may have income under the financial arrangements rules. Financial arrangements involve a deferral between when money is provided and when it’s returned. Common examples are bank accounts and term deposits. During the life of an arrangement, the income you return (or expenditure you may deduct) is determined by whether or not you’re a cash basis person. Either way, you must usually do a base price adjustment at the end of the arrangement to capture all gains (or expenditure). Cash basis persons If you’re a cash basis person under the rules, you can return income during the life of the arrangement on a cash basis. A cash basis person is a person who either: • has total income and expenditure from all financial arrangements on an accrual basis under $100,000 and the difference between this and a cash basis is less than $40,000 • has total financial assets and liabilities less than $1 million and the difference between income using a spreading method and the cash basis is less than $40,000. ‘Total’ means you add items together as absolute values. For example, if you have assets of $500,000 and debts of $600,000 you have a total of $1.1 million and are over the threshold. The $40,000 threshold is particularly relevant in the case of foreign currencies. Large movements in the exchange rate or smaller movements on large amounts can result in going over the threshold. Therefore, you need to monitor whether you’re still a cash basis person annually. A cash basis person must perform a BPA when the financial arrangement ends. One exception is when you’re a cash basis person who ceases to be a New Zealand tax resident within a period of between 3 and 4 years depending on when you became resident. You must have been a party to the arrangement before becoming a New Zealand tax resident and when you cease to be a New Zealand tax resident. EXAMPLE Kapil has a bank account in India when he first qualifies as a New Zealand tax resident and a transitional resident on 1 March 2020. If Kapil becomes a non-resident before 1 April 2023 and still has the bank account, he does not have to do the BPA. Not a cash basis person If you are not a cash basis person, you must spread income over the life of the arrangement and do the BPA at the end. There are several methods which can and cannot be used depending on the situation. The Commissioner has also issued determinations showing how income should be calculated in a number of scenarios. If you no longer qualify as a cash basis person, you’ll need to calculate a cash basis adjustment to put yourself on a spreading basis. | 11 Foreign Income Guide 2022 Excepted financial arrangement Some financial arrangements are called excepted financial arrangements. They have their own rules or are taxed according to general principles. Common examples are: • variable principal debt instruments such as a current bank account with a balance always under $50,000 • an interest-free loan in New Zealand dollars which is repayable on demand • a foreign currency loan you receive as a cash basis person and you use the loan for private or domestic purposes. You may want advice from a tax agent as the financial arrangements rules can be complex. EXAMPLE Hina is a New Zealand resident who is not a transitional resident. She has an account denominated in yen at a bank in Japan which she uses when she visits her family. The account pays a small amount of interest monthly and she can withdraw funds or make deposits to it at any time. The balance never goes above $50,000. The bank account is a financial arrangement. However, due to the size and nature of the account, it qualifies as a variable principal debt instrument. It is therefore an excepted financial arrangement, which means that the financial arrangements rules do not apply. If the interest income is over $200 after conversion into New Zealand dollars, Hina will need to file an IR3 return and include this income. There are two worked examples of the financial arrangements rules in Appendix 2. REFERENCES PUB00396 Cash basis persons under the financial arrangements rule Section CC 3 Financial arrangements Section CC 4 Payments of interest Subpart EW Financial arrangements rules Determination G9A Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency or commodity other than New Zealand dollars (13 pages), December 1989 Transitional residents If you’re a transitional resident and are a party to a financial arrangement, it’s regarded as an excepted financial arrangement as long as: • no other party to the arrangement is a New Zealand resident • the arrangement is not for the purpose of a business carried on in New Zealand by a party to the arrangement. Interest income is exempt until your transitional residency ends. When you cease to be a transitional resident or you’re party to an arrangement which ceases to be an excepted financial arrangement, the opening value of your financial arrangement will equal the market value of your accrued entitlement. EXAMPLE Penelope is a transitional resident and has a bank account in the United Kingdom. Her period of transitional residency ends on 31 March 2021. She’s treated as having acquired the bank account at its market value in New Zealand dollars on 1 April 2021. This would include any interest accrued but not yet credited to the account. 12 | Foreign rental income If you’re a New Zealand tax resident who is not a transitional resident and own rental property overseas, you would generally need to pay tax on any rental income. The rules for calculating income in the other country may differ from New Zealand and require you to make adjustments here. For example, you generally cannot claim a deduction for depreciation for residential property in New Zealand but you may be able to in the other country. If the balance date in the other country is different from New Zealand, you may also need to make adjustments unless you qualify to make an election to use that balance date for relevant foreign income. You’ll also need to convert any income into New Zealand dollars. If the property is funded by a loan, you’ll need to consider how the financial arrangements rules apply. If the loan is denominated in a foreign currency, fluctuations in currencies will affect how much interest expenditure can be claimed. If the New Zealand dollar appreciates, income may result. You may also need to deduct non-resident withholding tax or pay the approved issuer levy on payments of interest in respect of the foreign currency loan. If you receive rent from residential property, even if it is overseas, you may be subject to the ring-fencing rules from the 2020 tax year if your rental property makes a loss. These rules restrict the expenses you can claim in a year and require excess deductions to be carried forward to the following year. You may also need to consider the mixed-use asset rules where you have a rental property overseas which is used privately and unused for 62 or more days a year. If you make a loss, you may have to carry it forward. If you also pay tax in the other country, you may be able to claim a foreign tax credit. This would be limited to the New Zealand tax payable on the income. There are other gains which you may make from property – see the section on Foreign property gains on page 14. Help We have issued two interpretation statements dealing with rental income from overseas property (IS 20/06 and IS 20/07). The IS 20/07 has a worked example showing how the financial arrangements rules apply to a foreign currency loan. These statements are supported by an approval explaining options for converting foreign income and expenses into New Zealand dollars. The IR264 guide explains the rules for people who rent out residential property or holiday homes. There is more guidance on expenses you can and cannot deduct, the ring-fencing rules, depreciation of chattels, the bright-line tests and the mixed-use asset rules. The guide is equally relevant if the property is overseas. Other publications provide assistance on specific topics.

REFERENCES IR313 Buying and selling residential property, April 2020 IR361 Tax and your property transactions, May 2020 IR833 Bright-line residential property sale information, June 2021 Sections CB 3 to 5 Schemes for profit and personal property Sections CB 6A to 23B Land EXAMPLE Robbie is a New Zealand tax resident who is not a transitional resident. He goes on holiday to the Gold Coast and is persuaded that buying a condo in a new development would be a smart investment. He does so with the intention of selling it and making a quick profit. As Robbie bought the property with the intention of selling it, any gain would be taxable. This would also be the case if Robbie planned to rent it for a while until he could find a buyer. Profits are also likely to be taxable if you have a history of buying and selling properties. Bright-line rules Under the bright-line rules, if you bought a residential property between 1 October 2015 and 28 March 2018 and sold it within 2 years, any gain may be taxable regardless of your intention. Similarly, any gain may be taxable if you purchased a property on or after: • 29 March 2018 and sell it within 5 years • 27 March 2021 and sell it within 5 years if it is a new build • 27 March 2021 and sell it within 10 years. The bright-line rules can apply to your main home in certain circumstances. EXAMPLE Assume in the above example that Robbie buys the condo on 25 March 2019 with the intention of using it as a holiday home but sells it on 19 June 2020 due to COVID-19 travel restrictions. As the property is not Robbie’s main home, any gain would be taxable under the bright-line rules despite a lack of intention to sell it. Business of dealing in land If you or an associate are in the business of dealing in land, developing or subdividing land or erecting buildings, in general the amounts derived from disposing of the land within 10 years of acquiring it will be taxable whether or not the land was acquired for the business. If the land was acquired for the business, the amounts derived on disposal will generally be taxable whenever that occurs. There are exclusions for residential homes and business premises but they do not apply if there is a pattern of buying and selling. If you are not in a land-related business, you may also be taxable on amounts derived from: • schemes for the development or division of land begun within 10 years of acquisition • selling land within 10 years of acquiring it and 20% of the increase is due to certain factors. | 15 Foreign Income Guide 2022 Foreign investment fund rules Our guide IR461 Foreign investment funds explains the FIF rules in more detail. This page summarises the guide. The FIF rules apply to New Zealand tax residents who are not transitional residents. They may be relevant if you hold rights in any of the following during an income year: • a direct income interest in a foreign company • a FIF superannuation interest • a foreign life insurance policy. There is a list of exemptions from the FIF rules in the guide. Even if an exemption applies, you may have tax obligations under other rules in respect of your rights. For example, there is an exemption from the rules if the cost of all your rights is equal to or under $50,000 at all times in an income year and you’re a natural person. If the exemption applies and you derive income from foreign dividends, these will be taxable under the general rules rather than the FIF rules. If no exemptions apply, you’ll have an attributing interest and need to choose a method for each right to calculate your FIF income. There are restrictions on your choices. If you do not make a choice at the time you’re required to file a return, you’ll generally be limited to the FDR and CM methods at a later date, which could result in paying more tax. The 5 methods are: • fair dividend rate (FDR) • comparative value (CV) • deemed rate of return (DRR) • cost method (CM) • attributable FIF income method. There are limitations on claiming losses depending on which method you use. For a natural person who has an attributing interest in a listed foreign company, the choice will usually be between the FDR and CV methods. The FDR method taxes 5% of the market value of the shares at the beginning of a year. Dividends are not taxed separately under this method. There may be a need to make an adjustment if any shares are bought and sold in the same year. The CV method compares the closing market value with the opening market value after adjusting for items such as purchases, sales and dividends. There are limitations on choices of method, the same method must be applied across all FIFs of the same type for that year unless other restrictions apply. In cases where the CV method results in losses, these generally cannot be claimed. There are rules for how to convert foreign amounts into New Zealand dollars. There are special rules as to how foreign tax credits are calculated in the case of FIF income. Some rights need to be disclosed in your annual return. 16 | Foreign dividend income and the foreign investment fund rules If you’re a New Zealand tax resident who is not a transitional resident and own shares in a foreign company, the FIF rules may apply. You need to calculate FIF income from a shareholding in a foreign company when: • the total cost of all your FIF interests is over $50,000 • the shareholding is not exempt from the rules. If you or your shareholding are exempt from the FIF rules, other rules apply. You’ll usually need to include any dividends you receive in your IR3 return and may have to pay tax on any gains from trading or buying with the purpose of sale. EXAMPLE Molly is a New Zealand tax resident who is not a transitional resident. On 30 April 2020, she bought some shares in a Japanese company costing the equivalent of $30,000. On 30 November 2020, she received a dividend of $1,000 after conversion into New Zealand dollars. As the cost of Molly’s shareholding is under $50,000 and she has no other FIF interests, the FIF rules do not apply. Molly would include dividend income of $1,000 in her IR3 return for the year ended 31 March 2021. In this case, Molly is exempt from the requirement to disclose her interest. Even if the cost of your FIF interests is under $50,000, you can elect to apply the FIF rules but there are restrictions on switching into and out of them. Exemptions Some of the more common exemptions are: • certain shareholdings in ASX-listed Australian companies • certain holdings in Australian unit trusts • income interests of 10% or more in controlled foreign companies. These are only exemptions from the FIF rules but you need to consider whether other rules apply. For example, dividends from ASX-listed Australian companies are taxed on a cash basis. | 17 Foreign Income Guide 2022 REFERENCES IR458 Interest in a foreign investment fund disclosure schedule for individuals and closely-held entities (myIR form) IR461 Guide to foreign investment funds, November 2021 International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR30, updated annually www.ird.govt.nz - Foreign Investment Fund Australian listed share exemption tool Section CD 36 Foreign investment fund income Section CQ 5 When FIF income arises Section CQ 6 Calculation of FIF income Section CX 57B Amounts derived during periods covered by calculation methods Subpart EX Controlled foreign company and foreign investment fund (FIF) rules Section 61 Tax Administration Act 1994 Calculating your FIF income All 5 methods may be relevant depending on your circumstances. If your FIF income is calculated using a method other than the attributable FIF income method, dividends and any other gains from your shareholdings except fee rebates do not need to be included in your IR3 return. EXAMPLE Apu is a New Zealand tax resident who is not a transitional resident. He has an account with a financial advisor in India and owns shares in several companies there but none of his holdings are 10% or higher. On 1 April 2020, the market value of his portfolio in New Zealand dollars is $4 million. On 31 March 2021, the value of his shares is $3 million due to currency and share price fluctuations. He does not buy and sell any shares in the year which would require an additional calculation called a quick sale adjustment. He receives dividends of $50,000. Under the FDR method, Apu’s FIF income is 5% of $4 million, which is $200,000. Apu is eligible to compare this result with the CV method, which gives a loss of $950,000 ($3 million + $50,000 - $4 million). The rules permit Apu to choose the result under this method. However, he cannot deduct this loss against other income or carry it forward, so Apu would have FIF income of zero. He does not need to include the dividends in his IR3 return. Since there is no FIF income, foreign tax credits cannot be claimed. Entering the FIF rules When your transitional residency period ends or you become a tax resident if you cannot claim the temporary exemption, your shareholding is usually treated as having been acquired at market value immediately after the change of residency. EXAMPLE Michael is a New Zealand tax resident who is a transitional resident. His transitional residency period ends on 31 December 2020. At the time, the market value of his shares after conversion into New Zealand dollars is $200,000. Under the FDR method, the value of his shares at the beginning of the tax year on 1 April 2020 is zero. As long as he does not buy and sell any shares between 1 January and 31 March 2021, he will not need to do a quick sale adjustment and, his FIF income will be zero. 18 | Foreign pension income and the foreign investment fund rules If you’re a New Zealand tax resident who is not a transitional resident and are a beneficiary or member of a foreign superannuation scheme, you may have to calculate FIF income and include it in your IR3 return. If this is the case, you do not have to include related pension payments. If the FIF rules do not apply, the pension payments received from a foreign superannuation scheme are taxable and need to be included in your IR3 return. When the FIF rules apply You need to calculate FIF income from an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme in the following circumstances: • the total cost of all your FIF interests is more than $50,000 • the foreign superannuation scheme is a FIF superannuation interest. Even if the cost of your FIF interests is under $50,000, you can elect to apply the FIF rules but there are restrictions on switching into and out of them. A foreign superannuation scheme is one that is registered overseas. A FIF superannuation interest is an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme in two situations: • you were a New Zealand tax resident when you acquired the interest or were treated as one under a double tax agreement • you were a non-resident when you acquired the interest and complied with the FIF rules for an income year before 1 April 2014, returned that income in returns filed before 20 May 2013 and continue to return the income on that interest. If you acquired the interest while a non-resident and continue to apply the FIF rules correctly, you do not pay tax on lump sum withdrawals. If you do not qualify to use the rules or choose not to continue using them, you’ll need to consider the foreign superannuation rules. Other exemptions may apply and you should check the IR461 guide. Calculating your FIF income The applicable methods will be the FDR, CV and CM. Where market value is relevant, it is equal to the total costs of acquiring the rights if it is not reasonably practical to calculate the actual value and no material gains have been derived. EXAMPLE Craig is a New Zealand tax resident who is not a transitional tax resident. For a number of years, Craig paid into a foreign superannuation scheme based in the United States. The cost of his contributions in New Zealand dollars was $250,000 and he has no other interests in FIFs. He now receives an annual pension of $5,000 from the scheme. As Craig acquired the interest while he was a New Zealand tax resident and the cost of his FIF interests is over $50,000, he must apply the FIF rules. Craig is a natural person and would probably choose between the FDR or CV methods to calculate his FIF income. He does not need to include the cash payments in his IR3 return. Craig may need to make a disclosure. EXAMPLE Bryan is a New Zealand tax resident and acquired an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme when he was non-resident. He has reached retirement age and started to receive monthly payments. Assuming the FIF rules do not apply, he must convert the monthly payments to New Zealand dollars and include them in his IR3 return. | 19 Foreign Income Guide 2022 REFERENCES IR257 Overseas pensions and annuity schemes, July 2020 IR461 Guide to foreign investment funds, November 2021 International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR30, updated annually Section CF 1 Benefits, pensions, compensation, and government grants Section CQ 5 When FIF income arises Section CQ 6 Calculation of FIF income Section CX 57B Amounts derived during periods covered by calculation methods Subpart EX Controlled foreign company and foreign investment fund (FIF) rules 20 | Foreign life insurance policies and the foreign investment fund rules If you’re a New Zealand tax resident who is not a transitional resident and have the right to benefit from a life insurance policy, you may have to calculate FIF income and include it in your IR3 return. This only applies when the policy is not offered or entered into in New Zealand. REFERENCES IR458 Interest in a foreign investment fund disclosure schedule for individuals and closely- held entities (myIR form) IR461 Guide to foreign investment funds, November 2021 Section CQ 5 When FIF income arises Section CQ 6 Calculation of FIF income Subpart EX Controlled foreign company and foreign investment fund (FIF) rules Exemptions You do not need to calculate FIF income if the total cost of all your FIF interests is under $50,000. However, you can elect to apply the FIF rules but there are restrictions on switching into and out of them. See the IR461 guide for other exemptions which may apply. When measuring the cost of your interests, premiums are excluded if they relate only to term life insurance and do not increase the surrender value. Calculating your FIF income The applicable methods will be the FDR, CV and CM. Where market value is relevant, it equals the surrender value but only for the purpose of calculating the cost of a person’s rights when they enter the rules due to a change of residence or where an exemption no longer applies. Income received solely from a death benefit under a life insurance policy is not FIF income. This applies if: • the contracting party (being the person or the deceased) entered into a binding contract giving rise to the benefit when not a New Zealand tax resident • the contracting party had not been a New Zealand tax resident or had not been a New Zealand tax resident for the previous 10 years at the time of entering into the contract • the benefit was not increased by a voluntary action after the contracting party became resident. EXAMPLE Andy is a New Zealand tax resident who is not a transitional resident. He acquired an interest in a life insurance policy by an overseas insurer five years ago and the total cost of his FIF interests is over $50,000. Andy would need to calculate FIF income from the policy and may need to make a disclosure. | 21 Foreign Income Guide 2022 Foreign social security pensions If you’re a New Zealand tax resident who is not a transitional resident and receive a social security pension from another country, you’ll usually have to pay tax on it here. REFERENCES IR258 Overseas social security pensions, April 2020 QB 14/12 Income tax - foreign tax credits for amounts withheld from United Kingdom pensions, 2014 If the other country also deducts tax, you may be able to claim a foreign tax credit in your return. However, you cannot do this if a double tax agreement gives New Zealand sole taxing rights. In these cases, you’ll need to apply to the administrator of the pension scheme in the other country for a refund. If you receive a social security pension from the United Kingdom, you should read QB 14/12 for information on how to apply for a refund of tax deducted there. You’ll probably have to pay provisional tax in New Zealand if no tax is deducted from your pension before you receive it. Some DTAs give the other country sole taxing rights so this income does not need to be returned in New Zealand. If you receive your pension from overseas via the special banking option, it’ll be deposited into a bank account at Westpac. Work and Income will withdraw the funds and pay you the equivalent amount of New Zealand Superannuation after deducting New Zealand tax. Depending on your circumstances, you may not need to file an IR3 return. This might be the case where you have no other income. New Zealand has a special banking option with the following countries: Australia Ireland Netherlands United Kingdom. Help Our IR258 guide has examples explaining the rules applying to pensions from several countries. There is also a chart for you to track payments and convert them into New Zealand dollars. 22 | Foreign superannuation scheme withdrawals and the foreign investment fund rules If you’re a New Zealand tax resident who is not a transitional resident and have an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme, you might have to pay tax on lump sum withdrawals or transfers. The taxable amount is calculated according to 1 of 2 methods. There is a 4-year exemption for some withdrawals or transfers. Before considering the foreign superannuation rules, you need to determine whether the FIF rules apply - see the section on Foreign pension income and the foreign investment fund rules on page 18. Temporary exemption for lump sum withdrawals There is a temporary exemption for lump sum withdrawals if you first acquired the interest in the foreign superannuation scheme while you were a non-resident. You must not have previously claimed the exemption. Unlike the temporary exemption for transitional residents, there is no requirement for returning New Zealand tax residents to have been non-resident for 10 years. The exemption starts on the date you become a New Zealand tax resident. It ends 48 months after the month in which you first became resident ignoring the backdating rule in the 183- day test. EXAMPLE Markus returns to New Zealand on 1 July 2020 after working overseas for three years. He becomes a New Zealand tax resident again under the permanent place of abode test on 30 September 2020. While overseas, Markus acquired an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme. The FIF rules do not apply. Markus’ exemption starts on 1 July 2020 and ends on 30 September 2024. During this period, there is no tax on lump sum withdrawals from Markus’ scheme. Note that Markus does not qualify as a transitional resident as he was not a non-resident for at least 10 years before becoming resident again. As a result, he’ll need to pay tax on his worldwide income from 1 July 2020. | 23 Foreign Income Guide 2022 Calculating your income from a foreign superannuation scheme If the FIF rules do not apply and you do not qualify for an exemption, you’re liable for tax in the following situations: • you’ve received a lump sum from a foreign superannuation scheme • you’ve transferred your foreign superannuation scheme into a New Zealand or Australian superannuation scheme • you’ve transferred your superannuation interest to another person. You also have to apply these rules if the FIF rules do not apply because the total cost of all your FIF interests is under $50,000. This is known as a low-value FIF superannuation interest. You calculate your income using 1 of 2 methods. Both of these methods require you to calculate your duration of tax residence to determine your ‘assessable period’. The schedule method is the default option. In general, it taxes any withdrawals based on the number of years you have been a New Zealand tax resident and the contributions you have made. Any difference between the amount of the withdrawal and the amount calculated is exempt. The formula method is more complicated and taxes actual investment gains that have accrued to your scheme while you have been a New Zealand tax resident. It can only be used for defined contribution schemes when a number of conditions have been met. EXAMPLE Refer to the IR257 guide for examples. REFERENCES IR257 Overseas pensions and annuity schemes, July 2020 IR1024 Tax rules for foreign superannuation lump sums, May 2014 Section CF 3 Withdrawals from foreign superannuation scheme Section CW 28B Foreign superannuation withdrawal in initial period of residency Section CW 28C Foreign superannuation withdrawal exceeding given amount Section CW 29 Reinvested amounts from foreign superannuation schemes in Australia Section CW 29B Amounts from Australian complying superannuation schemes reinvested in KiwiSaver schemes 24 | Foreign dividend income and the controlled foreign company rules If you’re a New Zealand tax resident who is not a transitional resident and have an income interest of 10% or more in a CFC, you may have to pay tax on income attributed from that company. A CFC arises if a group of 5 or fewer New Zealand tax residents has more than 50% in 1 of 4 control interest categories or controls the exercise of shareholder decision-making rights in a foreign company. A CFC also arises when a single New Zealand shareholder holds a control interest higher than 40% in a foreign company and other conditions are met. If your income interest is 10% or over but the foreign company is not a CFC, you’ll also need to consider modified CFC rules to calculate attributable FIF income. The rules can be complex and you may need advice from a tax agent. Exemptions You do not have to calculate income under the CFC rules in either of the following cases: • the CFC is a non-attributing active CFC • the CFC is a non-attributing Australian CFC. Basically, a non-attributing active CFC has passive income, such as interest, dividends and rents, which is not more than 5% of gross income in an accounting period. A non-attributing Australian CFC is resident in Australia and subject to income tax there. In these cases, you include any dividends you receive in your IR3 return. Calculating your CFC income Your CFC income is found by multiplying your income interest in the CFC by the net attributable income of the company. There are detailed rules for the calculation of each item in the formula. If you have an attributed loss, it must generally be carried forward and offset against CFC/attributed FIF income derived from the same country. If your income interest is over 10% in a CFC, you may be able to use modified rules in limited circumstances. These rules are the same as those applied for calculating FIF income under the attributable FIF income method. Disclosures Unless you are exempt, you must make a disclosure of an income interest of 10% or more in a CFC electronically on form IR458. We publish a list of people who are exempt each year. If you do not make a disclosure, we can issue a default assessment. It’s an offence not to make a disclosure or to give false information to Inland Revenue. | 25 Foreign Income Guide 2022 REFERENCES IR458 Foreign Investment fund/Controlled foreign company disclosure(s) (myIR form) International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR30, updated annually Section CD 1 Dividend Section CQ 1 Attributed controlled foreign company income Section CQ 2 When attributed CFC income arises Section CQ 3 Calculation of attributed CFC income Subpart EX Controlled foreign company and foreign investment fund rules Section 61 Tax Administration Act 1994 Part 9 Tax Administration Act 1994 Special anti-avoidance rules You also have CFC income if the following conditions apply: • you have an attributing interest in a FIF • you use the attributable FIF method • the FIF receives a taxable distribution from a non- complying trust. You also may have attributed CFC income if a non-attributing active CFC or a non-attributing Australian CFC derives income from personal services and you have an income interest of 10% or more. EXAMPLE Miles is a New Zealand tax resident who is not a transitional resident. He heard incorrectly that he can reduce his tax bill by forming a company in Bermuda and earn interest tax free. However, as the company is a CFC and more than 5% of its income is passive, it must attribute income to Miles who has to pay tax in New Zealand on it. In addition, Miles would have to make a disclosure of his interest in the company. 26 | Foreign beneficiary income and taxable distributions from trusts If you’re a New Zealand tax resident who is not a transitional resident, you’re generally taxable on your worldwide income. This can include beneficiary income and taxable distributions from any trust or estate overseas. Beneficiary income Beneficiary income is current year income derived by trustees which has either: • vested in you as a beneficiary during the income year • been paid to you in the income year or within certain time frames after the end of the year. EXAMPLE Henry is a New Zealand tax resident who is not a transitional resident. His rich uncle, also a New Zealand tax resident, has settled a trust for his nephews and nieces. The New Zealand trustees derive income from assets in the United Kingdom and Australia which vests in the interest of Henry in the 2021 income year. Henry would report the income in his IR3 return for that year. Taxable distributions Taxable distributions are other distributions made by the trustees to you other than beneficiary income, such as undistributed income from previous years, capital gains and corpus. The taxation of taxable distributions depends on the classification of the trust. If the trust is a complying trust, distributions other than beneficiary income are exempt. Complying trusts are usually settled by a New Zealand tax resident and the trustees have paid tax on all of the trust’s income. If the trust is a foreign trust, distributions other than beneficiary income, certain capital gains and corpus are taxable for the recipients at their marginal rates. Foreign trusts are basically those settled by non-residents. If the trust is a non-complying trust, distributions other than beneficiary income and corpus are taxable. Non-complying trusts are those which are neither complying nor foreign trusts. There are special ordering rules to determine the make-up of a distribution. If you’re a beneficiary of a foreign or non-complying trust, you’ll need to attach a completed IR307 to your IR3 return. If you receive taxable distributions from a non-complying trust, follow the instructions in the IR3 guide when completing the return as taxable distributions are taxed separately at a higher rate of 45%. If you receive money or property from overseas, including inheritances, we advise you to read Interpretation Statement IS 19/04. It explains distributions from foreign trusts and clarifies some areas of difficulties due to some countries not using the same concept of a trust as New Zealand. Special rule There is a special rule which applies where you become a tax resident after having been a non-resident for fewer than 5 years. In this situation, you’re taxed on your beneficiary income and distributions from foreign and non-complying trusts for the period of your absence. | 27 Foreign Income Guide 2022 REFERENCES IR307 Schedule of beneficiary’s estate or trust income Interpretation Statement IS 16/03 Tax residence – Part 3, September 2016 Interpretation Statement IS 18/01 Taxation of trusts – income tax, June 2018 Interpretation Statements IS 19/04 Income tax – Distributions from foreign trusts, December 2019 Section CV 13 Amounts derived from trusts Section CV 15 Amounts derived from trusts while person absent from New Zealand Section CW 53 Distributions from complying trusts Section CW 54 Foreign-sourced amounts derived by trustees Section CX 59 Taxable distributions from non-complying trusts Subpart HC Trusts Transitional residents If you’re a New Zealand tax resident who is a transitional resident, you’re generally only taxed on income or taxable distributions with a source in New Zealand. EXAMPLE The Happy Trust was settled by Judith, a resident of the United Kingdom, for her grandchildren. One of them is Melissa, who is a New Zealand tax resident and not a transitional resident. The trustees in the United Kingdom allocate current year interest income to the beneficiaries in equal shares. Melissa will convert the income into New Zealand dollars and include it in her IR3 return. She can claim any tax paid in the United Kingdom as a foreign tax credit limited to the amount of New Zealand tax payable on the income. She’ll also need to complete an IR307 as the trust is a foreign trust. If Melissa was a transitional resident, she would not need to include the income in her IR3 return. 28 | Services you may need Need to contact us?

Foreign Income Guide 2022 Appendix 1 – Converting foreign currencies The general rule is that foreign amounts should be converted to New Zealand dollars using the applicable spot rate. The Commissioner currently publishes tables giving mid-month and end-of-month spot rates. These tables can be found here: www.ird.govt.nz/managing-my-tax/overseas-currency- conversion-to-nz-dollars. To calculate the New Zealand dollar amount, divide the foreign amount by the rate in the table. Spot rates for other days can be provided by trading banks and other reputable sources. You may also be able to use the mid-month rate as a proxy for the spot rate on a day during the same month. Specific conversion rules for foreign investment funds If you apply the FIF rules and do not use the attributable FIF method, you can use either the spot rate or the average of the close of the trading spot exchange rate for the 15th of the months falling in the relevant period. You should use the same method for all your interests. The Commissioner publishes the rolling 12-month mid-month table for periods of exactly 12 months. If the period is shorter or longer than 12 months, use the mid-month table to derive an average rate. This is done by adding the rates for the relevant months and then dividing by the number of months. Specific conversion rules for financial arrangements The Commissioner has published a number of determinations setting out how income or expenditure from certain financial arrangements should be calculated. Determination G9A is likely to be the most useful for most individuals. See Appendix 2 for two worked examples using this determination. Specific conversion rules for controlled foreign companies and the attributable FIF method The calculations can be complex and you may need the help of a tax agent. Permitted method for foreign rental income The Commissioner has published an approval for individuals with foreign rental income. This approval sets out acceptable methods for converting such income to New Zealand dollars. The methods may suit some individuals rather than using spot rates.

Example 1 – foreign currency term deposit Kapil is a New Zealand tax resident who is not a transitional resident. He is not a cash basis person and has a balance date of 31 March. On 1 October 2018, he opens a term deposit for INR 3 million at an Indian bank. The term is for one year and interest compounds at 7% six-monthly. The bank deducts non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) at 10%. Calculate the closing book value as at 31 March 2019 in Indian rupees Calculate income for the year ended 31 March 2019 in New Zealand dollars The result is $3,465.80. As the amount is positive, it’s income (sections EW 14 and CC 3).

The result is $6,970.56 and is income (sections EW 31 and CC 3). There is a foreign tax credit of $245.37. Most of the income arises from the New Zealand dollar devaluing against the Indian rupee during the life of the arrangement. a = ((3,094,500+(3,094,500\*7%\*180/360))/44.1408)+ (10,831/44.1408)+ 223.38 – 62,591.28 (consideration received less consideration given during the arrangement) ‒b = 3,465.80 (income in previous years) +c = 0 (expenditure in previous years) +d = 0 (amount remitted) 30 | Example 2 – foreign currency current account Kapil also opens a current account on 1 October 2018 at the same bank in India. Interest is calculated daily and compounds quarterly. The bank deducts non-resident withholding tax at 10%. The bank account can be analysed as follows: Calculate the closing book value as at 31 March 2019 in Indian rupees e = 0 (opening tax book value) +f = 4,600,000 (consideration given by Kapil) +g = 27,000 (base currency income) ‒h =2,700 + 1,300,000 (consideration given to Kapil) ‒I = 0 (base currency expenditure) CTBV = 3,324,300. Calculate income for the year ended 31 March 2019 in New Zealand dollars The result is $2,681.81 and is income (section EW 14 and CC 3). There is a foreign tax credit of $57.53. Note that the account is not a variable principal debt instrument as the balance exceeded $50,000 during the year. If the account was a variable principal debt instrument, it’d be an excepted financial arrangement.

IR1251 September 2021 Accounting for the wage subsidy Example scenarios for individuals for the 2021 income year SCENARIOS FOR ACCOUNTING FOR THE WAGE SUBSIDY FOR INDIVIDUALS 2 Introduction Employers/Businesses – the Covid-19 wage subsidy (WS), including WS extension, WS resurgence and WS March 2021 payments are treated as excluded income 1 (s CX 47 of the ITA07) and the portion of wage payments to staff subsidised by the WS are not deductible (s DF 1(2) of the ITA07). The WS is taxable in the hands of the employees – employers should continue to make standard deductions such as PAY E . Employees – where the WS is already included in their gross earnings which appear in their income profile and auto calc assessment, they do not need to file an IR3. Self-employed/other individuals – the tax-free treatment in respect of eligible employers who receive the WS for their employees does not apply to individuals who received the WS whether as a sole trader, shareholder-employee (without tax deducted at source on earnings), partner, trustee etc. The WS received by anyone where tax was not deducted at source must be returned in their IR3/IR3NR in a new box/field "Government subsidies" in the "Further income" tab in their myIR return (Question 26 2 on the paper version of the IR3). Information concerning the spreading of income (where the payment from MSD was received before 31 March 2020 but the WS period falls in both the 2019–20 and 2020–21 income years 3 ; and where the payment from MSD was received before 31 March 2021 but the WS period falls in both the 2020–21 and 2021–22 income years 4 ), ACC and repayments can be found on our website at ird.govt.nz/covid-19/ business-and-organisations/employing-staff/financial-support/wage-subsidy-issues-for-self-employed This document provides various examples of situations that may apply to self-employed persons and other individuals that received the WS and how their WS payments must be accounted for in their IR3/IR3NR. Disclaimer The example scenarios in this guide highlight the tax treatment of wage subsidy receipts, but they do not provide guidance as to whether a business or individual is entitled to the underlying wage subsidy amount – either in full or a partial amount. There may be instances where the businesses or individuals in the scenarios are not entitled to the full wage subsidy and may be required to repay part or all of the wage subsidy received. Contact the Ministry of Social Development for further information on eligibility requirements and repayment obligations. 1 Excluded income to the extent that the full wage subsidy amount is passed on to employees 2 Question 23 on the IR3NR 3 1 April 2019 – 31 March 2020 and 1 April 2020 – 31 March 2021 4 1 April 2020 – 31 March 2021 and 1 April 2021 – 31 March 2022 SCENARIOS FOR ACCOUNTING FOR THE WAGE SUBSIDY FOR INDIVIDUALS 3 Contents Introduction 2 Sole trader/individual – claimed subsidy personally 4 Sole trader – claim subsidy as self-employed and for employees 5 Sole trader/contractor – employer claimed subsidy on their behalf 7 Tax deducted at source 7 Tax NOT deducted at source; gross earnings included in Employment Information form 8 Tax NOT deducted at source; gross earnings NOT included in Employment Information form 8 Tax deducted at source, received additional wage subsidy 8 Tax deducted at source, received independent WS extension and WS resurgence payments 9 Tax NOT deducted at source, received additional wage subsidy/independent WS extension and WS resurgence payments 10 Children/students receiving the wage subsidy 11 Home based childcare provider – using standard costs 12 Partner in partnership/look-through company owner 14 Working partner/LTC owner 14 Non-working partners/LTC owners 15 Shareholder-employee of company – treated ws as 100% salary/wages 16 Tax deducted at source 16 Tax NOT deducted at source; gross earnings included in Employment Information form 16 Tax NOT deducted at source; gross earnings NOT included in Employment Information form 16 Shareholder-employee of company – treated ws as 100% shareholder salary 18 Shareholder-employee of company – part salary/wages & part shareholder salary 19 Directors/chairpersons/executive office holders 20 Trustees/beneficiaries of trusts 21 SCENARIOS FOR ACCOUNTING FOR THE WAGE SUBSIDY FOR INDIVIDUALS 4 Sole trader/individual – claimed subsidy personally The wage subsidy (WS) received by the sole trader/individual/self-employed person is taxable and must be included in their IR3 as it is a payment to replace personal loss of earnings (s CG 5B ITA07). When calculating the business taxable income (net profit), do not include the WS receipt there. A self-employed recipient of the WS will report any usual business income (taxable income/net profit) in the "Self-employed income" box/field of the return. The portion of WS received for loss of earnings must be returned in the "Government subsidies" box/field. Any WS extension, WS resurgence and WS March 2021 payments in addition to the initial WS payment are treated in the same manner as the WS payment above. Ani, self-employed part-time dance teacher Ani Kowhatu is a self-employed dance teacher and provides regular private lessons at her home, as well as tutoring a couple of dance students at a local high school. She does not employ any other dance instructors and is not registered for GST. Ani applies for and receives a $4,200 wage subsidy from MSD on 3 April 2020. Net income received from her usual business activities/self- employment for the year ended 31 March 2021 was $24,000 (excluding the wage subsidy receipt). Ani will include the following income in her IR3 (assuming no other income sources): • $24,000 in the "Self-employed income" box/field • $4,200 in the "Government subsidies" box/field. • Ani's total taxable income is $28,200 SCENARIOS FOR ACCOUNTING FOR THE WAGE SUBSIDY FOR INDIVIDUALS 5 Sole trader – claim subsidy as self-employed and for employees The receipt of the wage subsidy (WS) when used to pay employee wages is not taxable income to the business (it is excluded income) and the payment of the WS on to the employees is not deductible as an expense for salary/wages. When calculating taxable business income (net profit), the WS receipt is excluded and the salary/wage expense is reduced by the amount of the WS received. A self-employed person will report any usual business income (taxable income/net profit) in the "Self-employed income" box/field of the return as well as their portion of WS received in the "Government subsidies" box/field. Note: in the 2020 tax year WS income was required to be included as "Other income" to ensure the WS was not subject to ACC. The Government subsidies box was added for the 2021 year onwards. Any WS extension, WS resurgence and WS March 2021 payments in addition to the initial WS payment are treated in the same manner as the WS payment above. Mark, self-employed plumber with employees Mark is a self-employed plumber with a standard balance date of 31 March. He operates his plumbing business as a sole trader using his personal IRD number and not through a structure like a company or partnership. He employs Mary part-time to assist with book-keeping and other administration work that is required within the business and has a full-time apprentice Joe. Both Mary and Joe receive regular fortnightly wages. Mark applies for and receives a wage subsidy of $18,259.20 from MSD for himself, Joe and Mary. This was paid to him on 28 March 2020. Mark's employees (Mary and Joe) $7,029.60 of the wage subsidy should be passed on to Joe and $4,200 to Mary over the 12 weeks following the wage subsidy receipt. These amounts will be treated as ordinary PAYE earnings in the hands of Mark's employees with the relevant KiwiSaver, child support, student loan and PAYE deductions withheld. This portion of the wage subsidy which relates to Mark's employees ($11,229.60, being $7029.60 + $4,200) will be processed in the normal manner, regularly through its payroll system and the business will not take this portion of the subsidy into account when calculating its income tax liability. Mark's first wage payment to his employees after receiving the wage subsidy fell due on 10 April and accordingly the Employment Information dated 10 April 2020 will include total wages paid (including the amount partially funded by the wage subsidy). This means that for the purposes of calculating his business income and deducting the correct amount of salary/wage expenses, Mark will need to adjust for the portion of salary and wages funded by the WS in his 2020-21 return, but not the 2019-20 return because the first payment of salary and wages partially funded by the WS occurred after 31 March 2020. Mark The remaining $7,029.60 of the wage subsidy relates to Mark's own work in the business. Mark is required to account for income tax on this portion of the wage subsidy as it relates to Mark's personal lost earnings. Mark will file his IR3 showing his regular income from the business in the "Self-employed income" box and his $7,029.60 wage subsidy in the "Government subsidies" box. As the wage subsidy received by Mark spans across two income tax years (2019–20 and 2020–21) he is required to spread the 12-week payment across these two years. Refer next section for the calculations for each year. Working out Mark's own portion of WS required to be included in each tax year As the subsidy covers a 12-week period from the date it was credited to Mark's bank account on 28 March 2020, Mark must calculate what part of the $7,029.60 subsidy applies to his own work in the business for the year ending 31 March 2020. The portion of the subsidy that relates to the 2020 tax year is calculated as follows: • 12 weeks = 84 days. • Only 4 days of the subsidy related to the 2020 tax year (28 – 31 March 2020). • 4/84 × $7,029.60 = $334.74 The amount of the WS to be included in Mark's IR3 for the year ended 31 March 2020 is $334.74. The balance of the WS to be included in the year 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021 is $6,694.86. SCENARIOS FOR ACCOUNTING FOR THE WAGE SUBSIDY FOR INDIVIDUALS 6 Mark's IR3 – 2020 Assuming the total income received by the business for the year was $285,000 (excluding the WS receipt) and expenditure totalled $189,000 including salary/wage payments, the net profit from usual business trading was $96,000. Since none of the salary and wages partially funded by the WS were paid to Mary or Joe in the year ending 31 March 2020, Mark does not need to adjust his salary/wage deduction in his 2020 IR3. Mark will report the following income in his IR3 (assuming no other income): • "Self-employed income" of $96,000 (net profit) • "Other income" of $334.74 (WS portion) • Mark's total taxable income $96,334.74 Mark's IR3 – 2021 Assuming the total income received by the business for the year was $171,000 (excludes the wage subsidy receipt), the total salary/wage bill for the year was $57,200 and other expenditure totalled $35,000, the net profit of the business would be $78,800. However, the salary/ wages funded by the WS ($11,229.60) is non-deductible so that must be added back to the net profit to get the self-employed income amount to be returned of $90,029.60. Mark will report the following income in his IR3 (assuming no other income): • "Self-employed income" of $90,029.60 (net profit) • "Government subsidies" of $6,694.86 (remaining WS portion) • Mark's total taxable income $96,724.46 SCENARIOS FOR ACCOUNTING FOR THE WAGE SUBSIDY FOR INDIVIDUALS 7 Sole trader/contractor – employer claimed subsidy on their behalf The wage subsidy (WS) received by a sole trader/self-employed person is taxable and must be included in their IR3 as it is a payment to replace personal loss of earnings. However, we are aware of some instances where the WS was not claimed by the sole trader/contractor directly – an 'employer' may have claimed it on their behalf. The treatment of the WS by the sole trader/contractor then depends on how that employer passes that WS on to the contractor, and if they also claimed the WS personally. The following examples address the various situations: • Tax deducted at source • Tax NOT deducted at source; gross earnings included in Employment Information form • Tax NOT deducted at source; gross earnings NOT included in Employment Information form • Tax deducted at source, received additional wage subsidy • Tax deducted at source, received independent WS extension and WS resurgence payments • Tax NOT deducted at source, received additional wage subsidy/independent WS extension and WS resurgence payments Tax deducted at source Where a person in receipt of schedular payments was included in an employer application, providing that WS was fully passed on by the employer applicant to the contractor with withholding tax deducted at source (included in the Employment Information form), the contractor is not required to declare this separately on their IR3. The income and withholding tax deductions will automatically come across to their IR3 in the schedular payments field. Refer scenario below for Robbie. Robbie, WT contractor (WT deducted on WS payment) Robbie contracts to Keen Buzzers Ltd as a shearing contractor. Keen Buzzers Ltd submitted a wage subsidy application for its employees and contractors, of which Robbie was one of the parties named on the employer application. Keen Buzzers Ltd received the wage subsidy on 2 April 2020 for all parties named on the application. The wage subsidy received on behalf of Robbie ($7,029.60) was passed on to him over the following 12 weeks as part of his schedular income and withholding tax was deducted on the payments. When checking his income profile, Robbie can see the income received from Keen Buzzers Ltd with the tax deducted at source. When it comes time to file his IR3 for 2021, Robbie will see the schedular income (which included the $7,029.60 wage subsidy) reported with the withholding tax deducted. Robbie doesn't need to do anything further regarding the wage subsidy received as the income is reported in his return. Robbie will only need to declare other income received where tax was not deducted at source or shown in his income profile. Tax NOT deducted at source; gross earnings included in Employment Information form Where the WS was passed on by the employer to the contractor without withholding tax deducted at source but the gross earnings were included in the Employment Information form (therefore the income including the wage subsidy payment shows in the person's Income Profile, just without any withholding tax deducted) they will not need to declare the WS separately on their IR3. The income will automatically come across to their IR3 in the schedular payments field, but without any tax deductions showing. Tax will be payable once their IR3 has been processed. Refer scenario below for Malcolm. SCENARIOS FOR ACCOUNTING FOR THE WAGE SUBSIDY FOR INDIVIDUALS 8 Malcolm, WT contractor (WT not deducted on WS payment, included on EI) Malcolm contracts to Tidy Parks Ltd as a street cleaning contractor. Tidy Parks Ltd submitted a wage subsidy application for its employees and contractors, of which Malcolm was one of the parties named on the employer application. Tidy Parks Ltd received the wage subsidy on 4 April 2020 for all parties named on the application. The wage subsidy received on behalf of Malcolm ($7,029.60) was passed on to him as a lump-sum payment a few days later and withholding tax (WT) was not deducted on the payment. Tidy Parks didn't realise they needed to deduct WT on the WS payment passed on. Despite not deducting WT, the gross payment was reported on Tidy Park's Employment Information. Malcolm's contract was then terminated. When checking his income profile, Malcolm can see the income received from Tidy Parks Ltd but without tax deducted on the payment. When it comes time to file his IR3 for 2021, Malcolm will see the schedular income reported, but without tax deducted. This includes the $7,029.60 initial wage subsidy payment passed on to him as a lump sum. Malcolm doesn't need to do anything further regarding the wage subsidy received as the income is reported in his return. Malcolm will only need to declare other income received where tax was not deducted at source or included in his income profile. Tax NOT deducted at source; gross earnings NOT included in Employment Information form Where the WS was passed on by the employer to the contractor without withholding tax deducted at source and also not included in the Employment Information form (therefore is not showing in the person's Income Profile), they will need to declare this on their IR3 in the "Government subsidies" box. Refer scenario below for Sylvia. Sylvia, WT contractor (WT not deducted on WS payment, not on EI) Sylvia contracts to Quick Clean Ltd as a commercial premises cleaning contractor. Quick Clean Ltd submitted a wage subsidy application for its employees and contractors, of which Sylvia was one of the parties named on the employer application. Quick Clean Ltd received the wage subsidy on 6 April 2020 for all parties named on the application. The wage subsidy received on behalf of Sylvia ($7,029.60) was passed on to her as a lump-sum payment a few days later without any withholding tax deducted on the payment as required. Quick Clean Ltd then terminated her contract. When checking her income profile, Sylvia cannot see the wage subsidy income received from Quick Clean Ltd. This is because Quick Clean Ltd has not included the lump-sum payment on their Employment Information form, thinking that they didn't need to. Sylvia starts cleaning residential premises (where withholding tax is not required to be deducted on payments) and derives net income of $8,020. When it comes time to file her IR3 for 2021, as Inland Revenue has not been notified of the gross earnings, Sylvia will need to report the wage subsidy on her return in the "Government subsidies" box and her other income earned without tax deducted at source as normal. Sylvia will include the following income in her IR3 (assuming no other income sources): • $7,029.60 in the "Government subsidies" box/field. • $8,020 in the "Self-employed income" box/field • Sylvia's total taxable income is $15,049.60 Tax deducted at source, received additional wage subsidy If a person in receipt of schedular payments was included in an employer application for any wage subsidy payments (including WS extension and WS resurgence) AND also applied for and received the wage subsidy as a sole trader, the wage subsidy amount paid directly to them without tax deducted at source will be required to be returned in their IR3 in the "Government subsidies" box 5 . The amount passed on to them as a schedular payment with Withholding Tax already deducted at source will already pre-populate into the IR3.

ABC Builders Ltd submitted a wage subsidy application for its employees and contractors, of which Dalip was one of the parties named on their employer application. Outside of his job at ABC Builders Ltd, Dalip contracts to XYZ Land Ltd for 15 hours a week. XYZ Land Limited has informed all of its contractors to apply for the wage subsidy as sole traders. Dalip applied independently on a sole trader application on 2 April 2020 for his contracting work for XYZ Land Ltd. He received $4,200 directly from MSD. ABC Builders Ltd received the wage subsidy on 8 April 2020 for all parties named on the application. The wage subsidy received on behalf of Dalip ($7,029.60) was passed on to him as part of his fortnightly pay and was included on ABC Builders Ltd's Employment Information forms (with tax deducted on the payment as required). When checking his income profile, Dalip can see income received from ABC Builders Ltd for the year of $54,000 with tax deducted. When it comes time to file his IR3 for 2021, Dalip will see his employment income received via ABC Builders Ltd pre-populate into the "Gross salary/wages" field which includes the wage subsidy of $7,029.60 passed on with the tax deducted at source. The wage subsidy payment he received directly for his contracting work for XYZ Land Ltd is required to be declared separately in the "Government Subsidies" box as this did not have tax deducted at source. Dalip will include the following income in his IR3 (assuming no other income sources): • $54,000 "Gross salary/wages" (pre-populated which includes the $7,029.60 employee wage subsidy applied for by ABC Builders Ltd). • $4,200 in the "Government subsidies" box/field (sole trader wage subsidy pertaining to contract work for XYZ Land Ltd). • Dalip's total taxable income is $58,200. Tax deducted at source, received independent WS extension and WS resurgence payments This scenario covers a person in receipt of schedular payments who was included in an employer application for the initial wage subsidy, but by the time the WS extension and WS resurgence subsidies were announced the person was no longer contracted or the contracting business did not apply on their behalf. They applied for and received the WS extension and/or WS resurgence as a sole trader. The wage subsidy amounts paid directly to them without tax deducted at source will be required to be returned in their IR3 in the "Government subsidies" box. The amount passed on to them as a schedular payment and included in the Employment Information form with withholding tax already deducted at source will pre-populate on the IR3. Refer scenario below for George. George, WT contractor (WT deducted on WS payment, extension payments received) George contracts to Affordable Houses Ltd as a labour-only contractor. Affordable Houses Ltd submitted a wage subsidy application for its employees and contractors, of which George was one of the parties named on the employer application. Affordable Houses Ltd received the wage subsidy on 10 April 2020 for all parties named on the application. The wage subsidy received on behalf of George ($7,029.60) was passed on to him as a lump-sum payment a few days later and included on the Employment Information form with withholding tax deducted on the payment as required. George's contract was then terminated. When checking his income profile, George can see the income received from Affordable Houses Ltd with tax deducted. With only adhoc building work since April totalling net $5,000, in July George personally applied for and received the wage subsidy extension on the sole trader application. George received this payment of $4,686.40 on 9 July 2020. When it comes time to file his IR3 for 2021, George will see the schedular income of $7,029.60 reported with the tax deducted. This is the initial wage subsidy payment passed on to him as a lump sum. The wage subsidy extension payment of $4,686.40 paid directly to him is not populated in his return and he is required to declare this separately in the "Government subsidies" box. George will include the following income in his IR3: • $7,029.60 in the "Schedular income" box/field (pre-populated). • $5,000 in the "Self-employed income" box/field • $4,686.40 in the "Government subsidies" box/field. • George's total taxable income is $16,716.00.

Refer scenario below for Isaac. Isaac, WT contractor (WT not deducted on WS payment, extension payments received) Isaac contracts to EZ Clean Ltd as a commercial premises cleaning contractor. EZ Clean Ltd submitted a wage subsidy application for its employees and contractors, of which Isaac was one of the parties named on the employer application. EZ Clean Ltd received the wage subsidy on 12 April 2020 for all parties named on the application. The wage subsidy received on behalf of Isaac ($7,029.60) was passed on to him as a lump-sum payment a few days later. Withholding tax (WT) was not deducted on the payment as required. Isaac's contract was then terminated. When checking his income profile, Isaac cannot see the income received from EZ Clean Ltd. This is because EZ Ltd has not included the lump-sum payment on their Employment Information form, thinking that they didn't need to. Still without work, in July Isaac personally applied for and received the wage subsidy extension on the sole trader application. Isaac received this payment on 14 July 2020. When it comes time to file his IR3 for 2021, Isaac will need to report the wage subsidy received of $7,029.60 that wasn't reported by EZ Clean Ltd on their EI (and therefore did not have WT deducted) and the wage subsidy extension payment of $4,686.40 paid directly to him in the "Government subsidies" box. Isaac will include the following income in his IR3 (assuming no other income sources): • $11,716 in the "Government subsidies" box/field. • Isaac's total taxable income is $11,716.00. SCENARIOS FOR ACCOUNTING FOR THE WAGE SUBSIDY FOR INDIVIDUALS 11 Children/students receiving the wage subsidy Children and school students who earn income from self-employment, other than as a beneficiary of a trust, are not required to file a tax return when they earn less than $2,340 in an income year, as this is treated as exempt income (s CW 55BB of the ITA07). Examples include income from paper and pamphlet delivery. Where a child or school student earns $2,340 or more, the income exemption does not apply, and they may have to file a tax return 6 and pay tax on all of the income they received (not just the amount that exceeds $2,340). Where a child or school student applied for and received the wage subsidy (WS), the income they received would result in them exceeding the $2,340 threshold and the WS income did not have tax deducted at source. Therefore, they will now be required to file an IR3 tax return and declare both the income from self-employment and the wage subsidy. The wage subsidy must be declared in the "Government Subsidies" box/field on the return. Any WS extension, WS resurgence and WS March 2021 payments in addition to the initial WS payment are treated in the same manner as the WS payment above. Refer scenario below for Josie. Josie, school student delivering pamphlets Josie is a school student who delivers pamphlets twice a week. Josie does this work as an independent contractor. On average she receives $40 per week for all of her deliveries. This equates to $2,080 therefore her income is usually exempt from tax and she does not need to file a tax return. Josie's paper run was reduced by roughly 50% in March and April. Josie applies for and receives a $4,200 wage subsidy from MSD on 14 April 2020. Her income received from self-employment (pamphlet delivery) for the year ending 31 March 2021 is $1,900, rather than her usual $2,080. Her total income including the wage subsidy is $6,100. The income Josie received from the pamphlet delivery is no longer exempt income because her total income exceeds the $2,340 threshold and she is required to file a tax return and include all income from her pamphlet delivery for the year and the wage subsidy received. The wage subsidy amount received must be included in the "Government subsidies" box/field on the return. Josie will include the following income in her IR3 (assuming no other income sources): • $4,200 in the "Government subsidies" box/field. • $1,900 in the "Self-employed income" box/field • Josie's total taxable income is $6,100 6 If all income had tax deducted at source they may receive an auto-calc SCENARIOS FOR ACCOUNTING FOR THE WAGE SUBSIDY FOR INDIVIDUALS 12 Home based childcare provider – using standard costs An individual who provides childcare in their own home has the option of calculating their taxable income using either the Standard Cost method provided in DET 09/02 or using actual costs. Wage subsidy income must be included when calculating an individual's taxable income using either the Standard Cost method or actual costs. The following example addresses individuals who choose to use the Standard Cost method. For individuals who choose to use actual costs, refer to the "Sole Trader – claimed subsidy personally" example above. The wage subsidy (WS), including WS extension and WS resurgence, and WS March 21 payments, must be included in the "Gross income received for childcare" calculation (Part A on the IR413). For the period where no children were cared for, the "hours" in Part B (IR413) of the standard cost calculation will be NIL. Note: As the wage subsidy payment has been treated as a compensation payment for the purposes of s CG 5B of the ITA 2007, the payment can be returned in the income year which the income being replaced would have been derived. Therefore, where the payment was received prior to 31 March 2020, the payment can be spread over the 12 weeks following receipt and attributed to both the 2020 and 2021 tax returns. This also applies to the March 2021 wage subsidy, where the two-week wage subsidy period may cover both the 2020–21 and 2021–22 income years depending on when it was received. After completing the Standard Cost calculation: • If the amount is a loss (negative), enter nil in the "Self-employed income" field on the return. • If the amount is a profit (positive) and: –less than the amount of the wage subsidy received, then enter the profit amount in the "Government subsidies" box/field on the IR3 –equal to the amount of the wage subsidy received, then enter that amount in the "Government subsidies" box/field on the IR3 –greater than the amount of the wage subsidy received, • enter the wage subsidy amount in the "Government subsidies" box/field on the IR3 • enter the balance of the profit (profit minus wage subsidy amount) into the "Self-employed income" box/field on the IR3 Note: The "Government subsidies" box was not available for the 2020 tax return and for this year customers were recommended to enter the amount in the "Other income" box/field to prevent ACC levies from being charged. Refer example below for Cynthia. Cynthia - home based childcare provider Cynthia is a home-based childcare provider. As a result of the lockdown, she was unable to provide childcare for the period 25 March to 13 May. She applied for the wage subsidy and received the payment of $7,029.60 on 25 March 2020. In previous years she has chosen to use the Standard Cost method for calculating her income and she chooses to do so again in the 2020 and 2021 tax years. She spreads the payment over the 12 weeks so effectively is required to account for 1 week in the 2020 year ($585.80) and the remainder in the 2021 year ($6,443.80). Using the Standard Cost method she calculates her 2020 net income to be $5,200. One week of the wage subsidy was included in her gross income before her deduction for standard costs. As her net income ($5,200) exceeds the wage subsidy amount ($585.80), she accounts for her net income in her 2020 IR3 as follows: • $585.80 in the "Other income" representing one week of wage subsidy income • $4,614.20 in the "Self-employed income" representing the balance of her income (being $5,200 minus $585.80). • Cynthia's total taxable net income is $5,200 Using the Standard Cost method she calculates her 2021 net income to be $3,300. 11 weeks of the wage subsidy ($6,443.80) was included in her gross income before her deduction for standard costs. As Cynthia's net income is less than the amount of the wage subsidy received for 2021, Cynthia accounts for her net income in her 2021 IR3 as follows: • $3,300 in the "Government Subsidies" box/field • Cynthia's total taxable net income is $3,300 SCENARIOS FOR ACCOUNTING FOR THE WAGE SUBSIDY FOR INDIVIDUALS 13 Although the remaining 11 weeks of wage subsidy income is $6,443.80, this is greater that the net income calculated using the Standard Cost method, so Cynthia only has to include the amount of net income calculated using this method in the "Government subsidies" box/field – $3,300. Cynthia's colleague, Scott, is in a similar situation and needs to account for 11 weeks of the wage subsidy in his 2021 IR3. However, using the Standard Cost method, Scott's net income (including the wage subsidy amount) is $8,800 for 2021. As Scott's net income exceeds the wage subsidy amount for 2021, he accounts for the $8,800 in his IR3 as follows: • $6,443.80 in the "Government subsidies" box/field • $2,356.20 in the "Self-employed income" representing the balance of his income (being $8,800 minus $6,443.80) • Scott's total taxable income is $8,800 SCENARIOS FOR ACCOUNTING FOR THE WAGE SUBSIDY FOR INDIVIDUALS 14 Partner in partnership/look-through company owner Wage subsidy (WS) receipts by a partnership and look-through company (LTC) must consider whether there are working partners (s DC 4 of the ITA07) or LTC owners (s DC 3B of the ITA07) when allocating such receipts. Where there is a working partner or owner, the WS received by the partnership or LTC must first be applied to the working partner or owner's regular salary/wages and the necessary PAYE and other required deductions made. Subsequent allocations of the WS receipt must be dealt with in accordance with the partnership agreement or Partnership Law Act 2019 for partnerships, and the LTC owners' interests in accordance with their shareholding. Ultimately, all WS payments allocated to partners or LTC owners, either via a salary/wage or via their allocation of their share of income is taxable income to them and is required to be returned in their IR3/IR3NR. The WS portion of the income received by partners and LTC owners is not subject to the ACC levy as it was not derived from personal exertion. Therefore, when the partner/LTC owner files their IR3/ IR3NR, their respective income assigned will need to be split between active partnership/LTC income and the WS portion of the income which must be included in the "Government subsidies" box/field. In terms of the partnership/LTC accounting for the receipt of the WS, the receipt will either be: • Excluded income (s CX47) to the extent it is used to pay wages (in which case those wages are then not deductible (s DF 1(2)). See working partner/LTC owner example below. • Taxable income in all other instances. Working partner/LTC owner Where a working partner/LTC owner receives a regular salary/wage in accordance with ss DC 4 or DC 3B, the WS must be used to fund those regular wages and will be addressed via the PAYE system. Their regular salary/wage income including the WS will appear in their income profile and their IR3 (gross earnings/tax deductions fields). If the full amount has not been passed on via the regular wages, the balance will form part of the net income allocation from the partnership or LTC, and the amount of WS left which is allocated to them as part of that (without tax deducted at source) will need to be included in the "Government subsidies" box/field of their IR3 in addition to the salary/wage income. Refer example below for the BV Partnership. The BV Partnership submitted a wage subsidy application on 3 April 2020 listing Bruce and Vaughan as partners. A total of $14,059.20 WS was paid to the partnership. Bruce is a working partner (s DC 4) paid $700 per week. The WS must be used to pay Bruce's regular salary and wages. Where there is excess WS that is not allocated to someone's wages during the wage subsidy period, it should be used to top up the wages of other staff. This means that part of Vaughan's wage subsidy amount will be used to offset the remainder of Bruce's wages. BV Partnership IR7 In the financials for BV Partnership, the WS receipt will be recognised as follows: • Salary/wage expense $36,400 ($700 × 52, being Bruce's total annual salary and wages) • Non-deductible salary/wage expense $8,400 (equal to excluded income amount below, being Bruce's salary and wages during the wage subsidy period funded by BV Partnership's WS receipt) • Excluded income of $8,400 ($700 × 12) (being the part of BV Partnership's wage subsidy receipt used to pay for salary and wages during the wage subsidy period, equal to non-deductible salary/wage expense above) • Taxable income of $5,659.20 ($14,059.20 − $8,400, being the remainder of BV Partnership's wage subsidy amount not used to fund salary and wages during the wage subsidy period) The balance of the WS not paid as wages during the 12-week wage subsidy period which must be treated as taxable income ($5,659.20) is available for distribution to the partners in accordance with their partnership agreement/Partnership Act. The BV Partnership made net income of $46,000 from trading (of which $5,659.20 is from the WS). The partnership will report net taxable income of $46,000 in the IR7. Bruce and Vaughan are equal partners and therefore the IR7P will show an allocation of partnership income of $23,000 each. Of this $23,000, only $20,170.40 is active partnership income and $2,829.60 is attributed to the WS so must be included in the "Government subsides" box/field. SCENARIOS FOR ACCOUNTING FOR THE WAGE SUBSIDY FOR INDIVIDUALS 15 Bruce's IR3 The following is what Bruce will show in his IR3 (assuming no other income sources) • $36,400 will automatically populate in the "Gross earnings" box/field in myIR • $20,170.40 in the "Active partnership income" box/field • $2,829.60 in the "Government subsides" box/field • Bruce's total taxable income is $59,400 Vaughan's IR3 The following is what Vaughan will show in his IR3 (assuming no other income sources) • $20,170.40 in the "Active partnership income" box/field • $2,829.60 in the "Government subsides" box/field • Vaughan's total taxable income is $23,000 Non-working partners/LTC owners The WS received will be taxable income to the partnership and available for allocation in accordance with normal tax rules for partnerships/ LTC s . The partnership/LTC will determine the net income to be allocated to each partner/LTC owner and this will be represented in the IR7 and IR7P/IR7L. Once the allocation is determined, this will then need to be split further to determine the 'active partnership income' and the portion funded by the WS that is to be included in the respective partner/LTC owners IR3 to ensure WS amounts received are included in the "Government subsidies" box/field and ACC is not charged on the WS amount. Refer example below for the A&B Partnership. A&B Partnership submitted a wage subsidy application for Abbey and Brett as partners. A total of $14,059.20 WS was paid to the partnership. Neither Abbey nor Brett are working partners so do not receive a salary or wage during the year. The WS received by the A&B Partnership is taxable income to the partnership and will be available for allocation via net profits. The net profit (income) of the partnership was $34,000 from trading. This figure includes the $14,059.20 wage subsidy receipt that was not paid out as salary and wages. The partnership will report net taxable income of $34,000 in the IR7. Abbey and Brett are equal partners and therefore the IR7P will show an allocation of partnership income of $17,000 each (of which $7,029.60 represents the WS being passed on). Abbey and Brett will each declare the following in their respective IR3s (assuming no other income sources): • $9,970.40 in the "Active partnership income" box/field (this will be the amount subject to ACC levies) • $7,029.60 in the "Government subsidies" box/field • Total taxable income - $17,000 each SCENARIOS FOR ACCOUNTING FOR THE WAGE SUBSIDY FOR INDIVIDUALS 16 Shareholder-employee of company – treated WS as 100% salary/wages Where a company applied for the wage subsidy (WS) which included shareholder-employees in the application, and that wage subsidy was treated as paid to the shareholder-employee as a regular salary/wage from the business, the treatment in the hands of the shareholder- employee will be dependent on whether it was included on the Employment Information form and had tax deducted at source or not. Any WS extension, WS resurgence or WS March 2021 payments in addition to the initial WS payment are treated in the same manner as the WS payment above. The following examples address the various situations: • Tax deducted at source • Tax NOT deducted at source; gross earnings included in Employment Information form • Tax NOT deducted at source; gross earnings NOT included in Employment Information form Tax deducted at source Where the WS was passed on to a shareholder-employee as part of their regular salary/wage and it was included on the Employment Information form with tax deducted at source, all of this information will appear in the shareholder's income profile in myIR and will pre-populate into the gross earnings and tax deductions boxes in their IR3. The WS amount does not need to be included in the "Government subsidies" box/field in their IR3. Refer scenario below for Kiri. Kiri, shareholder-employee, wages with tax deducted at source Kiri is a shareholder in a mechanic business, Well Oiled Motors Ltd, in which she regularly is paid a wage of $650 per week. Well Oiled Motors Ltd applies for the wage subsidy and receives the $7,029.60 wage subsidy payment from MSD. It must pass this on to Kiri. As Kiri is paid regular wage payments from her company, the wage subsidy is used to fund her wages over the 12-week period the subsidy applies to ($585.80 partially funded by the wage subsidy, $64.20 topped up by the company). Well Oiled Motors Ltd does not have any GST obligations for the wage subsidy. For income tax, the receipt is excluded income and salary/ wages funded by the wage subsidy are not deductible. Well Oiled Motors Ltd files its Employment Information forms declaring the wages paid to Kiri in the normal manner through its payroll system. PAYE and Kiwisaver deductions were made on the full wage payment ($650). In the 2021 financials for Well Oiled Motors Ltd they will report the following: • Excluded income of $7,029.60 which is the full amount of the WS received. • Non-deductible salary/wage expense of $7,029.60 When it comes time for Kiri to file her IR3 return, Kiri can see her income, partially funded by the wage subsidy in her income profile. She does not need to report the wage subsidy separately in the "Government Subsidies" box/field. Tax NOT deducted at source; gross earnings included in Employment Information form Where a shareholder-employees takes a regular salary/wage from the company, the company should make the necessary PAYE and other tax deductions from this payment and submit Employment Information forms (s RD3B of the ITA07 does not apply). Where tax was not deducted at source but the gross earnings were included on the Employment Information form, the gross will still appear in the shareholder(s) income profile in myIR and will pre-populate into the gross earnings box in their IR3 and the amount of income tax payable will be calculated when the IR3 is filed. The WS amount does not need to be included in the "Government subsidies" box/field in their IR3. Tax will be payable once their IR3 has been processed. Tax NOT deducted at source; gross earnings NOT included in Employment Information form Where a shareholder-employee takes a regular salary/wage from the company, the company should make the necessary PAYE and other tax deductions from the payment and submit Employment Information forms (s RD 3B of the ITA07 does not apply). Where tax was not deducted at source when required and the relevant income details were not included on an Employment Information form, the shareholder will be required to report this income in the "Government Subsidies" box/field in their IR3 (as is required by a shareholder-employee taking an annual salary). SCENARIOS FOR ACCOUNTING FOR THE WAGE SUBSIDY FOR INDIVIDUALS 17 Refer scenario below for Benji. Benji, shareholder employee, regular salary without tax deducted at source Benji is a shareholder in an IT company, IT Help Ltd, from which he regularly takes $1,500 per week from the company ($78,000 for the year). IT Help Ltd applies for the wage subsidy listing Benji as an employee and receives the $7,029.60 wage subsidy payment from MSD. It must pass this on to Benji. IT Help Ltd is not registered as an employer and has not used the PAYE system to pay Benji. IT Help Ltd does not have any GST obligations for the wage subsidy. For income tax, the receipt is excluded income (to the extent paid out as shareholder salary) and the portion of the shareholder salary funded by the wage subsidy is not deductible. Since it was not processed through the PAYE system, the income will not appear in Benji's income profile in myIR and his IR3. He will be required to include the wage subsidy amount of $7,029.60 in the "Government subsidies" box/field on his IR3 and the balance of the income taken from the business in the "Shareholder salary" box/field. In the 2021 financials for IT Help Ltd they will report the following: • Excluded income of $7,029.60 which is the full amount of the WS received. • Shareholder salary $78,000 ($1,500 × 52 weeks) • Non-deductible salary/wage expense of $7,029.60 The IR4S will show the following: • Shareholder salary $78,000 (the split will occur in the IR3 only) Benji will report the following in his 2021 IR3: • $7,029.60 in the "Government subsidies" box/field • $70,970.40 in the "Shareholder salary" box/field • Benji's total taxable income is $78,000 SCENARIOS FOR ACCOUNTING FOR THE WAGE SUBSIDY FOR INDIVIDUALS 18 Shareholder-employee of company – treated WS as 100% shareholder salary Where a company applied for wage subsidy (WS) which included shareholder-employees in the application, the treatment of the WS for shareholder-employees depends on whether they take a regular salary/wage from the business. Regardless of how a shareholder-employee derives income from the business, the business is required to pass the WS to the employees listed in its WS application. If the shareholder-employee takes a regular salary or wage from the business, the business is required to use the WS to pay that regular salary/wage, deduct tax at source and include the relevant information on the Employment Information forms (refer discussion in the previous section). Where the shareholder-employee does not take a regular salary or wage, it must be paid to them as a shareholder salary at year end. This is required even if the company is in a loss position or if the shareholder salary allocation would put the company into a loss position. The amount of the shareholder salary funded by the wage subsidy must be returned in the "Government Subsidies" box/field on the shareholder-employee's IR3 return. The balance of the shareholder salary will be reported in the "Shareholder Salary" box/field on the return. Any WS extension, WS resurgence or WS March 2021 payments in addition to the initial WS payment are treated in the same manner as the WS payment above. Refer scenario below for XYZ Limited. XYZ Limited submitted a wage subsidy application for five full-time staff. Two of those listed in the application are shareholder- employees, Tama and Wiremu who do not draw a regular salary/wage, only an annual shareholder salary. The total wage subsidy paid to XYZ Limited on 4 April 2020 was $35,148. The total wage subsidy passed on to the three employees via their salary/wages (which accordingly had PAYE and other deductions made) was $21,088.80. The total salary and wage bill for XYZ Limited for the three employees for the 2021 year was $109,200. A shareholder salary is required to be declared for each of the shareholder-employees, Tama and Wiremu, which at a minimum must be an amount equal to the wage subsidy received for each of them. The company was able to pay a shareholder salary of $40,000 each to Tama and Wiremu. In the 2021 financials for XYZ Limited they will report the following: • Excluded income of $35,148 which is the full amount of the WS received. • Shareholder salary of $80,000 ($40,000 × 2) • Salary/wage expense of $109,200 (other employees) • Non-deductible salary/wage expense of $35,148 (passed on to both employees and shareholders) The IR4S will show the following: • Shareholder salary of $40,000 for each shareholder (the split will occur in the IR3 only) Tama and Wiremu will be required to report their shareholder salary (part funded by the wage subsidy), in their respective IR3s as follows: • $7,029.60 in the "Government subsidies" box/field being the WS received. • $32,970.40 in the "Shareholder salary" box/field, being the shareholder salary amount not funded by the WS ($40,000 − $7,029.60). • $40,000 total taxable income each (with no tax deducted at source) assuming no other income sources. SCENARIOS FOR ACCOUNTING FOR THE WAGE SUBSIDY FOR INDIVIDUALS 19 Shareholder-employee of company – part salary/wages and part shareholder salary Where a company applied for a wage subsidy (WS) which included a shareholder-employee(s) in the application, the company should continue to pay the shareholder-employee(s) their regular salary/wages (as was done prior to COVID-19) and make the necessary PAYE and other tax deductions. Where the shareholder-employee's regular salary/wage is less than the weekly WS amount that was received (e.g. their standard wage is $400 per week but the WS applied for on their behalf was $585.80 per week), part of the WS will be applied to the regular salary/wage and the balance applied as an annual shareholder salary (applying the treatment in s RD 3C of the ITA07). The portion that does not have tax deducted at source (e.g. $185.80, using the example below) will be required to be returned in the "Government subsidies" box/field in their IR3, with the balance that was paid out as salary and wages will show as Gross earnings or Shareholder salary. Any WS extension, WS resurgence or WS March 2021 payments in addition to the initial WS payment are treated in the same manner as the WS payment above. Refer scenario below for Mr Bert and Mr Ernie. Mr Bert and Mr Ernie, mix of shareholder-employee income N2020 Ltd submitted a wage subsidy application for 8 full-time staff. Two of those listed in the application are shareholder-employees, Mr Bert and Mr Ernie who draw a regular salary/wage of $400 per week each. The total WS paid to the company on 6 April 2020 was $56,236.80. The total passed on to the six employees via their salary/wages which accordingly had PAYE and other tax deductions was $42,177.60. In addition, the total WS passed on to Mr Bert and Mr Ernie via their salary/wages, which accordingly had PAYE and other tax deductions at source, was $9,600 ($4,800 each – being their standard $400 weekly salary/wage during the wage subsidy period). The total salary/wage bill for the company for the 2021 year was $249,600. A shareholder salary is required to be declared for each of the shareholder-employees, Mr Bert and Mr Ernie which at a minimum must be the residual wage subsidy amount that was not paid out to them as salary and wages during the wage subsidy period (i.e. the wage subsidy received for each of them minus the amount already passed on and included in the Employment Information ("EI") schedules). Of the WS received of $7,029.60 each for Mr Bert and Mr Ernie, $4,800 has already been accounted for via the EI schedules with tax deducted at source. The balance of the WS amount ($2,229.60 each) must be returned as a shareholder salary. The company was able to pay an end of year shareholder salary of $50,000 each to Mr Bert and Mr Ernie. Of this, $2,229.60 for each is funded by the wage subsidy. Company financials/tax return In the 2021 financials for N2020 Ltd they will report the following: • Excluded income of $56,236.80 which is the full amount of the wage subsidy received. • Shareholder salary of $100,000 ($50,000 × 2) • Salary/wage expense of $249,600 • Non-deductible salary/wage expense of $56,236.80 The IR4S will show the following: • Shareholder salary of $50,000 for each shareholder (the split will occur in the IR3 only) Shareholder-employees tax returns The salary/wages received by Mr Bert and Mr Ernie through the Employment Information schedules with tax deducted at source will already pre-populate into their IR3 return. Mr Bert and Mr Ernie will be required to report their shareholder salary (partly funded by the wage subsidy) in addition to this. Amounts showing in their respective IR3s are as follows (assuming no other income): • $20,800 will pre-populate as "Gross earnings" ($400 × 52, salary/wages partially funded by wage subsidy; tax deducted at source) • $2,229.60 will need to be included in the "Government subsidies" box/field, being the balance of the wage subsidy received from MSD in their name (without tax deducted at source). • $47,770.40 will need to be included in the "Shareholder salary" box/field, being the shareholder salary amount not funded by the excess wage subsidy ($50,000 − $2,229.60) • $70,800 total taxable income each. SCENARIOS FOR ACCOUNTING FOR THE WAGE SUBSIDY FOR INDIVIDUALS 20 Directors/chairpersons/executive office holders Where a director, chairperson, or executive office holder received a wage subsidy, either directly or indirectly via an entity with which they are involved, the wage subsidy (WS) received is taxable. Typically, such amounts are schedular payments and will have withholding tax deducted and returned via the PAYE system. If the director, chairperson, or executive office holder received the subsidy without tax deducted at source (e.g. not passed on via the PAYE system), it must be included in their IR3 in the "Government subsidies" box/field. Any WS extension, WS resurgence or WS March 2021 payments in addition to the initial WS payment are treated in the same manner as the WS payment above. Geoff, tax deducted at source Geoff is a director at Wise Owl Ltd and typically receives a $3,000 director's fee every month. A wage subsidy application was submitted by Wise Owl which included Geoff in the application. Wise Owl continued to pay Geoff his director fee of $3,000 per month in April through to June 2020 and correctly deducted withholding tax on the payments. Geoff can see these schedular payments (which fully utilised the wage subsidy attributed to him) along with the withholding tax deducted in his income profile in myIR. Geoff doesn't need to do anything further regarding the wage subsidy received as the income will already appear in his auto calc or IR3. Theresa, tax NOT deducted at source Theresa is a director at Daisy Boo Ltd. Theresa does not receive regular director's fees from Daisy Boo Ltd. Daisy Boo Ltd applied for and received a part-time wage subsidy for Theresa. Daisy Boo Ltd passed the full $4,200 onto Theresa as a lump sum without tax deducted. As a result, this does not appear in her income profile in myIR. Theresa will need to include the $4,200 wage subsidy in the "Government Subsidies" box/field of her IR3. SCENARIOS FOR ACCOUNTING FOR THE WAGE SUBSIDY FOR INDIVIDUALS 21 Trustees/beneficiaries of trusts Where a trustee or beneficiary of a trust received a wage subsidy, either directly or indirectly via the trust, the wage subsidy (WS) received is taxable. Where the trustee or beneficiary is an employee of the trust and is paid a salary/wage, the wage subsidy applied for on their behalf is required to be passed on as part of their salary/wages with PAYE and other deductions made. Where the full wage subsidy applied for on their behalf has been passed on and tax deductions at source made, the trustee/beneficiary is not required to do anything further. This income will appear in their income profile and either their auto calc or IR3. If the trustee/beneficiary of the trust received the subsidy without tax deducted at source (e.g. not passed on via the PAYE system), it must be included in their IR3 in the "Government subsidies" box/field. Any WS extension, WS resurgence or WS March 2021 payments in addition to the initial WS payment are treated in the same manner as the WS payment above. Lacey, tax deducted at source Lacey is a beneficiary of the Macey Investment Trust. She is also an employee and paid a regular wage of $700 per week. The $585.80 per week wage subsidy received by the Trust is used to fund her regular wage payments. Lacey did not receive any other wage subsidy payments from the Trust. Lacey can see her gross earnings in her income profile in myIR (which fully utilised the wage subsidy attributed to her). Lacey doesn't need to do anything further regarding the wage subsidy received as the income will already appear in her auto calc or IR3. Malu, tax NOT deducted at source Malu is a trustee of the Macey Investment Trust. The Trust applied for and received a part-time subsidy for Malu. The $4,200 received by the Trust was passed on to Malu as a lump sum without tax deducted at source. Malu cannot see any payments from the Trust in the gross earnings in his income profile in myIR. Malu is required to file an IR3 and declare the $4,200 wage subsidy received in the "Government Subsidies" box on his return together with any other income received.

Self-employed/other individuals Covid-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS), Leave Support Scheme (LSS), Short-term Absence Payment (S TA P) and the Cultural Sector Emergency Relief Grant (CSERG) payments received by self-employed applicants are taxable income as it is a payment to replace personal loss of earnings (s CG 5B ITA07). These receipts must be reported in the “Government subsidies” field of their IITA. For the 2022 year onwards, the WSS, LSS or STAP payments from the Ministry of Social Development will be pre-populated to the IITA. Individuals/Tax Agents will be required to check the amounts pre-populated to ensure they are correct. The Cultural Sector Emergency Relief Grant (CSERG) payments made by the Ministry of Culture & Heritage will not pre-populate to the returns and will be required to be manually added to the WSS/LSS/STAP amounts that have pre-populated. The Resurgence Support Payment (RSP) and Covid Support Payment (CSP) are not taxable income (therefore must not be included in the Government subsidies field) however they must be applied to expenditure and the relevant expense must be reduced by the value of the payment(s) received. Hereafter, the Covid-19 receipts that are taxable (WSS, LSS, STAP and CSERG) will be collectively referred to as “Taxable Covid-19 receipts”. Information concerning the spreading of income (where the payment from MSD or MCH falls into both the 2021–22 income years 2 ), ACC and repayments can be found on our website at ird.govt.nz/covid-19/business-and-organisations/employing-staff/financial-support/ wage-subsidy-issues-for-self-employed Employers/Businesses The Covid-19 WSS, LSS and STAP receipts are treated as excluded income 3 (s CX 47 of the ITA07) and the portion of wage payments to staff subsidised by the WSS, LSS and/or STAP are not deductible (s DF 1(2) of the ITA07). The subsidies passed on are taxable in the hands of the employees – employers should continue to make standard deductions such as PAYE, Kiwisaver, student loan, child support etc. Employees WSS, LSS and STAP should have been passed on as salary/wages with PAYE and other deductions made. Where this has occurred, these will be included in their gross earnings which appear in their income profile and IITA. Disclaimer The example scenarios in this guide highlight the tax treatment of Covid-19 subsidy/grant receipts, but they do not provide guidance as to whether a business or individual is entitled to the underlying subsidy amount – either in full or a partial amount. There may be instances where the businesses or individuals in the scenarios are not entitled to the Covid-19 subsidy/grant receipt and may be required to repay part or all of the subsidy/grant received. Contact the Ministry of Social Development or Ministry of Culture & Heritage for further information on eligibility requirements and repayment obligations. 1 Refer to the IR1251 guide (2021 version) for the treatment for the 2020 and 2021 years. 2 1 April 2020 – 31 March 2021 and 1 April 2021 – 31 March 2022 3 Excluded income to the extent that the full wage subsidy amount is passed on to employees SCENARIOS FOR ACCOUNTING FOR COVID-19 SUBSIDIES FOR INDIVIDUALS 4 Summary table of Covid-19 payments Covid-19 SchemeTaxable income – INCTaxable income – GST MSD Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS)Employer\* ✗✗ Self-employed ✓✗ MSD Leave Support Scheme (LSS)Employer\* ✗✗ Self-employed ✓✗ MSD Short-term Absence Payment (S TA P)Employer\* ✗✗ Self-employed ✓✗ IR Resurgence Support Payment (RSP) ✗✓ IR Covid Support Payment (CSP) ✗✓ MCH Cultural Sector Emergency Relief Grant (CSERG)Self-employed ✓✓ \* Excluded income to the extent it was applied to salary/wages SCENARIOS FOR ACCOUNTING FOR COVID-19 SUBSIDIES FOR INDIVIDUALS 5 Contents Abbreviations 2 Introduction 3 Summary table of Covid-19 payments 4 Sole trader/individual – claimed subsidy personally 6 Sole trader – claim subsidy as self-employed and for employees 7 Sole trader/contractor – employer claimed subsidy on their behalf 8 Tax deducted at source 8 Tax NOT deducted at source; gross earnings included in Employment Information form 9 Tax NOT deducted at source; gross earnings NOT included in Employment Information form 9 Tax deducted at source, received additional Taxable Covid-19 receipts 10 Tax NOT deducted at source, gross earnings included in Employment Information form and received additional Taxable Covid-19 receipts 11 Tax NOT deducted at source, gross earnings NOT included in Employment Information form and received additional Taxable Covid-19 receipt 12 Children/students receiving the wage subsidy 13 Home based childcare provider – using standard costs 14 Partner in partnership/look-through company owner 15 Partnership example – working partner and employee 15 Partnership example – non-working partners/LTC owners 17 Shareholder-employee of company – treated taxable Covid-19 receipt as 100% salary/wages 18 Tax deducted at source 18 Tax NOT deducted at source; gross earnings included in Employment Information form 18 Tax NOT deducted at source; gross earnings NOT included in Employment Information form 19 Shareholder-employee of company – treated taxable Covid-19 receipt as 100% shareholder salary 20 Shareholder-employee of company – part salary/wages & part shareholder salary 21 Directors/chairpersons/executive office holders 23 Trustees/beneficiaries of trusts 24 SCENARIOS FOR ACCOUNTING FOR COVID-19 SUBSIDIES FOR INDIVIDUALS 6 Sole trader/individual – claimed subsidy personally Taxable Covid-19 receipts must be included in the “Government subsidies” field of the IITA. The WSS, LSS and STAP payments should pre-populate to this field. Check that the amount showing is correct for these subsidies. If you received the CSERG payment it will not be included in the amount showing and you are required to amend the amount in the Government subsidies field to include this. When calculating the business taxable income (net profit), do not include the Taxable Covid-19 receipts you received personally as these are required to be reported in the Government subsidies field. A self-employed recipient will report any usual business income (taxable income/ net profit) in the “Self-employed income” field of the return. Aroha, self-employed lighting technician Aroha is a part-time self-employed lighting technician that gets contracts to various music events. She does not employ anyone and is not registered for GST. Aroha receives WSS payments totalling $5,744 from MSD during the period August to October 2021. She also receives the one off CSERG payment of $5,000 on 24 March 2022. Total Taxable Covid-19 receipts are $10,744 and must be included in the “Government subsidies” field. The payments from MSD will pre-populate but the CSERG payment from MCH will not and is required to be manually added to this field. Net income received from her usual business activities/self-employment for the year ended 31 March 2022 was $22,500 (excluding the Taxable Covid-19 receipts). Aroha will include the following income in her IR3 (assuming no other income sources): • $22,500 in the “Self-employed net income” field • $10,744 in the “Government subsidies” field • Aroha’s total taxable income is $33,244. SCENARIOS FOR ACCOUNTING FOR COVID-19 SUBSIDIES FOR INDIVIDUALS 7 Sole trader – claim subsidy as self-employed and for employees Covid-19 payments received by a self-employed person for themselves must be separated from the payments received for employees. • The portion of the payment received for the self-employed person is a Taxable Covid-19 receipt and must be included in the “Government subsidies” field of their IITA. • When calculating the net profit of the business the portion of the receipt related to employees is not taxable income to the business when used to pay employees (it is excluded income) and the portion of salary/wage payments funded by the WSS, LSS or STAP to the employees is not deductible as an expense for salary/wages (the salary/wage expense deduction is reduced by the total amount of the Covid-19 subsidies received for the employees). David, self-employed electrician with employees David is a self-employed electrician with a standard balance date of 31 March. He operates his electrical business as a sole trader using his personal IRD number and not through a structure like a company or partnership. He employs Daisy part-time to assist with book-keeping and other administration work that is required within the business and has a full-time apprentice, Elijah. Both Daisy and Elijah receive regular fortnightly wages. David receives WSS payments totalling of $24,944 from MSD for himself ($9,600), Daisy ($5,744) and Elijah ($9,600) from August to November 2021. A LSS payment of $1,200 was received for David on 25 March 2022. David’s employees (Daisy and Elijah) WSS payments of $9,600 should be passed on to Elijah and $5,744 to Daisy over the 16 weeks (August to November 2021) that the WSS receipts applied to as part of their salary/wages. These amounts will be treated as ordinary PAYE earnings in the hands of David’s employees with the relevant KiwiSaver, child support, student loan and PAYE deductions withheld. This portion of the wage subsidy which relates to David’s employees ($15,344, being $9,600 + $5,744) will be processed in the normal manner, regularly through his payroll system and reported on the Employment Information forms. The WSS receipts for the employees will not be included in income when calculating the net profit of the business (these receipts passed on to employees are excluded (not taxable) income). The WSS receipts totalling $15,344 are also not deductible and must be deducted from the total salary/wage expense i.e. if salary/wages for the year totalled $108,000, the salary/wage expense deduction that can be claimed when calculating the net profit is only $92,656 ($108,000 – $15,344). David The remaining $9,600 of the WSS payment and the $1,200 LSS payment totalling $10,800 relates to David’s own work in the business. David is required to account for income tax on these payments as they relate to his personal loss of earnings, and these are required to be shown in the “Government subsidies” box of his IR3. These amounts may pre-populate and David will be required to check they are accurate. As the LSS payment received by David on 25 March 2022 spans across two income tax years (2021-22 and 2022–23) he can spread the 2-week payment across these two years. One week relates to the 2022 year and one week relates to the 2023 year. The amount David must include in the Government subsidies box of his 2022 return is $10,200 ($9,600 + $600) but note the full $10,800 will pre-populate. If David wishes to spread the payments across the two income years, he can remove $600 and this must then be included in his 2023 return (together with any further subsidies received in that year). David will file his IR3 showing his regular income from the business in the “Self-employed net income” box. David’s IR3 – 2022 Assuming the total income received by the business for the year was $285,000 (excluding the Covid-19 subsidies), salary/wage payments were $92,656 (after reducing these by the subsidy received) and other expenses totalled $86,344, the net profit from usual business trading was $106,000, the following will be reported in David’s 2022 IR3: • $106,000 (net profit) in the “Self-employed net income” • $10,200 (WSS and LSS) in the “Government subsidies” • David’s total taxable income $116,200. David’s IR3 – 2023 Assuming the net profit of the business as at 31 March 2023 was $94,000 and no further subsidies were received, David is only required to report the $600 subsidy portion that was spread to the 2023 year. David will report the following income in his 2023 IR3 (assuming no other income): • $94,000 (net profit) in the “Self-employed net income” • $600 (remaining WSS portion) in the “Government subsidies” • David’s total taxable income $94,600. SCENARIOS FOR ACCOUNTING FOR COVID-19 SUBSIDIES FOR INDIVIDUALS 8 Sole trader/contractor – employer claimed subsidy on their behalf Taxable Covid-19 receipts that are received by a sole trader/self-employed person are taxable and must be included in their IITA as it is a payment to replace personal loss of earnings. However, we are aware of some instances where these receipts were not claimed by the sole trader/contractor directly – an ‘employer’ may have claimed it on their behalf. The treatment of these receipts by the sole trader/contractor then depends on how that ‘employer’ passes the receipt onto the contractor, and if they also claimed other Taxable Covid-19 receipts personally. The following examples address the various situations: • Tax deducted at source • Tax NOT deducted at source; gross earnings included in Employment Information form • Tax NOT deducted at source; gross earnings NOT included in Employment Information form • Tax deducted at source, received additional Taxable Covid-19 receipts • Tax NOT deducted at source, gross earnings included in Employment information form and received additional Taxable Covid-19 receipts • Tax NOT deducted at source, gross earnings NOT included in Employment information form and received additional Taxable Covid-19 receipts. Tax deducted at source Where Taxable Covid-19 receipts are applied for by the employer to the contractor and the Taxable Covid-19 receipt was fully passed on by the employer to the contractor with withholding tax deducted at source (and included in the Employment Information form), the contractor is not required to declare this Taxable Covid-19 receipt separately on their IITA. The income and withholding tax deductions will automatically come across to their IITA in the schedular payments field. Refer scenario below for Ramek. Ramek, WT contractor (WT deducted on Taxable Covid-19 receipt) Ramek contracts to Keen Buzzers Ltd as a shearing contractor. Keen Buzzers Ltd submitted their Wage Subsidy August 2021 applications for its employees and contractors, of which Ramek named as an employee in each of Keen Buzzers Ltd applications. Total WSS payments received on behalf of Ramek was $9,600. The full amount was passed on to him over the 16 weeks (that the subsidies related to) as part of his schedular income and withholding tax was deducted on the payments. When checking his income profile, Ramek can see his income received from Keen Buzzers Ltd with the tax deducted at source. When it comes time to finalise his IITA for 2022, Ramek will see his income from Keen Buzzers Ltd in the “Schedular payments” section of his IITA (which included the $9,600 WSS payments) reported with the withholding tax deducted. Ramek doesn’t need to do anything further regarding the WSS payments received as the income is reported in his IITA. SCENARIOS FOR ACCOUNTING FOR COVID-19 SUBSIDIES FOR INDIVIDUALS 9 Tax NOT deducted at source; gross earnings included in Employment Information form Where Taxable Covid-19 receipts are applied for by the employer to the contractor and are passed on by the employer to the contractor without withholding tax deducted at source but the gross earnings were included in the Employment Information form (therefore the income including the Taxable Covid-19 receipt(s) shows in the person’s income profile, just without any withholding tax deducted) they will not need to declare the Taxable Covid-19 receipt(s) separately on their IITA. The income will automatically come across to their IITA in the schedular payments field, but without any tax deductions showing. Tax will be payable once their IITA has been processed. Refer scenario below for Leana. Leana, WT contractor (WT not deducted on Taxable Covid-19 receipt, included on EI) Leana contracts to Tidy Parks Ltd as a part-time gardening contractor. She receives weekly payments of $396 ($22 per hour, 18 hours per week. $20,592). Tidy Parks Ltd submitted Wage Subsidy August 2021 applications for its employees and contractors, of which Leana was one of the parties named on the employer applications. Tidy Parks Ltd received part-time wage subsidy payments totalling $5,744 for Leana. The WSS payments received on behalf of Leana were passed on to her each week over the 18-week period but withholding tax (WT) was not deducted on the payments. Tidy Parks didn’t realise they needed to deduct WT on the WSS payments passed on to Leana. Despite not deducting WT, the gross payment was reported on Tidy Park’s Employment Information form. When checking her income profile, Leana can see her income received from Tidy Parks Ltd. When it comes time to finalise her IITA for 2022, Leana will see the earnings from Tidy Parks Ltd reported in the “Schedular payments – total gross payments” section of her return. This includes the $5,744. Leana doesn’t need to do anything further regarding the WSS payments received as the income is reported in her IITA (although without sufficient tax deducted). Tax NOT deducted at source; gross earnings NOT included in Employment Information form Where Taxable Covid-19 receipts are applied for by the employer to the contractor and the Taxable Covid-19 receipt was fully passed on by the employer to the contractor without withholding tax deducted at source and also not included in the Employment Information form (therefore is not showing in the person’s income profile), the contractor will need to declare this on their IITA in the “Government subsidies” field (will need to manually add this amount). Refer scenario below for Stacey. Stacey, WT contractor (WT not deducted on Taxable Covid-19 receipt, not on EI) Stacey contracts to Quick Clean Ltd as a commercial premises cleaning contractor. Quick Clean Ltd submitted a Wage Subsidy August 2021 #1 application for its employees and contractors, of which Stacey was one of the parties named on the employer application. Quick Clean Ltd received the WSS payment from MSD on 28 August 2021 for all parties named on the application. The WSS received on behalf of Stacey ($1,200) was passed on to her as a lump-sum payment on 2 September 2021 without any withholding tax deducted on the payment as required. Quick Clean Ltd then terminated her contract. When checking her income profile, Stacey cannot see the WSS income received from Quick Clean Ltd in September 2021 (only showed schedular payments totalling $14,000 received from April to August 2021). This is because Quick Clean Ltd has not included the lump-sum payment on their Employment Information form in September 2021, thinking that they didn’t need to. Stacey starts cleaning residential premises (where withholding tax is not required to be deducted on payments) and derives net income of $10,500. When it comes time to file her IR3 for 2022, as the WSS payments were not included on in her earnings from Quick Clean Ltd, Stacey will need to self-report the WSS payment on her return in the “Government subsidies” field. Stacey will include the following income in her IR3 (assuming no other income sources): • $14,000 in the “Schedular income” field (this will pre-populate) • $1,200 in the “Government subsidies” field • $10,500 in the “Self-employed net income” field • Stacey’s total taxable income is $25,700. SCENARIOS FOR ACCOUNTING FOR COVID-19 SUBSIDIES FOR INDIVIDUALS 10 Tax deducted at source, received additional Taxable Covid-19 receipts Where Taxable Covid-19 receipts are applied for by the employer to the contractor and the Taxable Covid-19 receipt was fully passed on by the employer applicant to the contractor with withholding tax deducted at source (and included in the Employment Information form), the contractor will not need to declare the Taxable Covid-19 receipt(s) separately on their IITA. The income and withholding tax deductions will automatically come across to their IITA in the schedular payments field. If the contractor ALSO received the Taxable Covid-19 receipts as a self-employed person (applied personally), the Taxable Covid-19 receipts paid directly to them (without tax deducted at source) will be required to be declared in their IITA in the “Government subsidies” box (and should pre-populate). Refer scenario below for Delauney. Delauney, WT contractor (WT deducted on Taxable Covid-19 receipt, additional Taxable Covid-19 receipt received) Delauney contracts to ABC Builders Ltd. ABC Builders Ltd submitted applications for the Wage Subsidy August 2021 payments for its employees and contractors, of which Delauney was one of the parties named on their employer application. A total of $9,600 was received by ABC Builders Ltd for Delauney. These WSS payments were passed on as part of his gross earnings and included on ABC Builders Ltd’s Employer Information forms (with withholding tax deducted on the payment as required). Outside of his job at ABC Builders Ltd, Delauney drives for Uber approximately 15 hours a week. In the year ended 31 March 2022 he has earned net income from Uber totalling $15,600. In addition, Delauney applied independently for the part-time Wage Subsidy August 2021 payments on a self-employed application and received payments totalling $2,872 directly from MSD (in relation to loss of Uber income during lockdown). When checking his income profile, Delauney can see schedular income received from ABC Builders Ltd for the year of $62,000 with tax deducted. When it comes time to file his IR3 for 2022, Delauney will see his income received via ABC Builders Ltd pre-populate into the “Schedular payments” section of his IR3 which includes the full time WSS payments of $9,600 passed on with the tax deducted at source. The part- time WSS payments he received directly from MSD for his Uber driving ($2,872) is required to be declared separately in the “Government Subsidies” field as this did not have tax deducted at source. His net income from Uber (excluding the WSS payments) is required to be reported in the “Self-employed net income field” of his IR3. Delauney will include the following income in his IR3 (assuming no other income sources): • $62,000 in “Schedular payments – total gross payments” field (pre-populated) • $2,872 in “Government subsidies” field (should pre-populate) • $15,600 in “Self-employed net income” field • Delauney’s total taxable income is $80,472.

The income will automatically come across to their IITA in the schedular payments field, but without any tax deductions showing for the subsidy(s). If they ALSO received additional Taxable Covid-19 receipts paid directly to them (without tax deducted at source) they will need to declare this on their IITA in the “Government subsidies” field (this should pre-populate). Refer scenario below for Xiang. Xiang, WT contractor (WT not deducted on Taxable Covid-19 receipt but included in Employment Information form, additional Taxable Covid-19 receipt received) Xiang contracts to Big City Homes Ltd as a labour-only contractor part-time. Big City Homes Ltd submitted a Wage Subsidy August 2021 #1 application for its employees and contractors, of which Xiang was one of the parties named on the employer application. Big City Homes Ltd received the wage subsidy payment on 22 August 2021 for all parties named on the application. The wage subsidy received on behalf of Xiang ($718) was passed on to him as a lump-sum payment a few days later and included on the Employment Information form as gross earnings but without withholding tax deducted on the payment as required. Xiang’s contract was then terminated. When checking his income profile, Xiang can see the lump sum payment received from Big City Homes Ltd in August 2021 in his gross earnings in his income profile. Xiang also undertakes building work as a sole trader and also applied for the Wage Subsidy August 2021 #1 to #8 payments. He personally received a further $9,600 directly from MSD. When it comes time to file his IR3 for 2021, Xiang will see all payments from Big City Homes Ltd in the schedular receipts section, this totalled $15,000 from April to August 2021. The wage subsidy payments totalling $9,600 paid directly to him are required to be declared separately in the “Government subsidies” box of his IR3 and should pre-populate. Assuming Xiang earned net profits totalling $39,500, he will include the following income in his IR3: • $15,000 in the “Schedular income” field (pre-populated) • $39,500 in the “Self-employed net income” field • $9,600 in the “Government subsidies” field (should pre-populate) • Xiang’s total taxable income is $64,100.

The amount received from MSD directly should pre-populate to the IITA but the amount received via the employer will need to be manually added to the Government subsidies field. Refer scenario below for Shelden. Shelden, WT contractor (WT not deducted on Taxable Covid-19 receipt, other Taxable Covid-19 receipt received) Shelden contracts part-time to EZ Clean Ltd as a commercial premises cleaning contractor. EZ Clean Ltd submitted a Wage Subsidy August 2021 # 1 application for its employees and contractors, of which Shelden was one of the parties named on the employer application. EZ Clean Ltd received the WSS payment on 29 August 2021 for all parties named on the Wage Subsidy August 2021 # 1 application. The part-time wage subsidy received on behalf of Shelden ($718) was fully passed on to him as a lump-sum payment on 2 September 2021. Withholding tax (WT) was not deducted on the payment as required. Shelden’s contract was then terminated. In the months April to August 2021, Shelden had gross earnings totalling $6,600 from EZ Clean Ltd. Shelden carried on with his residential cleaning contracts but due to a drop in income, Shelden personally applied for and received the remaining Wage Subsidy August 2021 payments (#2 to #8) on the sole trader applications. Shelden received a further $5,026 WSS payments directly from MSD. Shelden also earned a net profit of $39,050 from his cleaning business (excluding WSS receipts). When checking his income profile, Shelden cannot see any income received from EZ Clean Ltd for the month of September 2021, only income from previous months totalling $6,600. This is because EZ Ltd has not included the lump-sum payment on their Employment Information form, thinking that they didn’t need to. When it comes time to file his IR3 for 2022, Shelden will need to report both the WSS payment of $718 received directly from EZ Clean Ltd (and not reported on their EI therefore did not have WT deducted) and the WSS payments of $5,026 paid directly to him in the “Government subsidies” box. The amount he received directly from MSD will pre-populate to this field in his return. He will then need to modify that to add the extra $718 received via EZ Clean Ltd. Total to be reported in the “Government subsidies” field is $5,744. Shelden will include the following income in his IR3 (assuming no other income sources): • $5,744 in the “Government subsidies” field (likely only $5,026 will pre-populate and will need to be updated to include the additional $718) • $6,600 in the “Schedular Payments” section of the return – this will pre-populate • $39,050 in the “Self-employed net income” field • Shelden’s total taxable income is $51,394. SCENARIOS FOR ACCOUNTING FOR COVID-19 SUBSIDIES FOR INDIVIDUALS 13 Children/students receiving the wage subsidy Children and school students who earn income not taxed at source less than $2,340 in an income year are not required to include this in their IITA, as this is treated as exempt income (s CW 55BB of the ITA07). Examples include income from lawnmowing, and dog walking. Where a child or school student earns $2,340 or more of income not taxed at source, the income exemption does not apply, and they are required to include and pay tax on all of the income they received (not just the amount that exceeds $2,340). Where a child or school student received a Taxable Covid-19 receipt, this may result in them exceeding the $2,340 threshold and they will be required to declare both the income not taxed at source and the Taxable Covid-19 receipt(s). The Taxable Covid-19 receipt(s) must be declared in the “Government Subsidies” field on the IITA (and should pre-populate). Refer scenario below for Daylen. Daylen, school student walking dogs Daylen is a school student who walks his neighbours’ dogs twice a week. Daylen does this work as an independent contractor. On average he receives $40 per week for all of his dog walking. This equates to $2,080 therefore his income is usually exempt from tax and he does not need to include it in his IITA. Daylen’s dog walking was reduced by 80% in August and September 2021. Daylen applies for and receives the part time Wage Subsidy August 2021 #1 and #2 payments totalling $1,436. His income received from dog walking for the year ending 31 March 2022 is $1,960, rather than his usual $2,080. His total income including the wage subsidy is $3,396. The income Daylen received from the dog walking is no longer exempt income because his total income not taxed at source exceeds the $2,340 threshold and he is required to include all income from his dog walking for the year and the wage subsidy received in his IITA. The wage subsidy amount received must be included in the “Government subsidies” field on the IITA; this should pre-populate to his return. Daylen will include the following income in his IITA (assuming no other income sources): • $1,436 in the “Government subsidies” field • $1,960 in the “Self-employed net income” field • Daylen’s total taxable income is $3,396. SCENARIOS FOR ACCOUNTING FOR COVID-19 SUBSIDIES FOR INDIVIDUALS 14 Home based childcare provider – using standard costs An individual who provides childcare in their own home has the option of calculating their taxable income using either the Standard Cost method provided in DET 09/02 or using actual costs. Taxable Covid-19 receipts must be included when calculating an individual’s taxable income using either the Standard Cost method or actual costs. The following example addresses individuals who choose to use the Standard Cost method. For individuals who choose to use actual costs, refer to the “Sole Trader – claimed subsidy personally” example above. Taxable Covid-19 receipts must be included in the “Gross income received for childcare” calculation (Part A on the IR413). For the period where no children were cared for, the “hours” in Part B (IR413) of the standard cost calculation will be NIL. After completing the Standard Cost calculation: • If the amount is a loss (negative), enter nil in the “Self-employed net income” field on the IITA. • If the amount is a profit (positive) and: –less than the amount of the Taxable Covid-19 receipts, then enter the profit amount in the “Government subsidies” field on the IITA –equal to the amount of the Taxable Covid-19 receipts, then enter that amount in the “Government subsidies” field on the IITA –greater than the amount of the Taxable Covid-19 receipts, enter the Taxable Covid-19 receipts amount in the “Government subsidies” field on the IITA enter the balance of the profit (profit minus wage subsidy amount) into the “Self-employed net income” field on the IITA. Note: The “Government subsidies” box will pre-populate with the Taxable Covid-19 receipt. Where the Standard Cost calculation is applied this may need to be altered. Refer example below for Ester. Ester - home based childcare provider Ester is a home-based childcare provider. As a result of the lockdown in August 2021, she was unable to provide childcare for the period 18 August to 12 October. She applied for the Wage Subsidy August 2021 payments #1 to #4 receiving payments totalling $4,800. This amount will pre-populate to the “Government subsidies” field of her 2022 IR3. In previous years she has chosen to use the Standard Cost method for calculating her income and she chooses to do so again in the 2022 tax year. Using the Standard Cost method she calculates her 2022 net income to be $5,400. As her net income ($5,400) exceeds the wage subsidy amount ($4,800), she accounts for her net income in her 2022 IR3 as follows: • $4,800 in the “Government subsidies” field. • $600 in the “Self-employed net income” field representing the balance of her income (being $5,400 minus $4,800). • Ester’s total taxable net income is $5,400. SCENARIOS FOR ACCOUNTING FOR COVID-19 SUBSIDIES FOR INDIVIDUALS 15 Partner in partnership/look-through company owner To be eligible for Taxable Covid-19 receipts partners/look-through company (LTC) owners needed to be either working partners/owners (s DC 4/DC 3B of the ITA07) or otherwise take regular drawings from the partnership.  Where this did not apply, subsidies applied for incorrectly should be repaid to MSD. Taxable Covid-19 receipts paid to a partnership or LTC, or amounts received by partners on behalf of the partnership and owners of behalf of the LTC, must be reported in the partnership accounts and then allocated to employees in the first instance, including working partners (s DC 4 of the ITA07) or working LTC owners (s DC 3B of the ITA07). Where there is a working partner or owner, the Taxable Covid-19 receipts paid to the partnership or LTC (or partners/LTC owners) must first be applied to meet the normal salary/wages of the employees named in the application (including working partner/ LTC owner’s regular salary/wages in accordance with ss DC 4 or DC 3B) and the necessary PAYE and other required deductions made. The working partner/LTC owners regular salary/wage income will appear in their income profile and their IR3 (gross earnings/tax deductions fields). Any Taxable Covid-19 receipts that are not used for the named employees (including working partners/owners) can then be applied to other working partners/owners and employees (if any) to top up their wages where their subsidy payment is less than their regular salary/wage. Excess Taxable Covid-19 receipts that have not been passed on as salary/wages to employees (including working partners/owners) in the relevant subsidy/grant periods (the periods to which the relevant subsidy/grant relates) must then form part of the net income of the partnership or LTC and must be distributed in accordance with the partnership agreement or Partnership Law Act 2019 (PLA) for partnerships, and the LTC owners’ interests in accordance with their shareholding. The excess Taxable Covid-19 receipts left will be allocated to them as part of that (without tax deducted at source) and the subsidy portion will need to be included in the “Government subsidies” field of their IR3/IR3NR separate to the amount passed to them as salary/wage income. Therefore, when the partner/LTC owner files their IR3/IR3NR, they need to determine their Taxable Covid-19 receipts which must be included in the “Government subsidies” field. An amount may have been pre-populated based on application data but this must be amended if the calculation following the instructions above results in a different amount. In terms of the partnership/LTC accounting for the Taxable Covid-19 receipt, the receipt will either be: • excluded income (s CX47) to the extent it is used to pay wages (in which case those wages are then not deductible (s DF 1(2)). See SC Partnership example below. • taxable income in all other instances (and allocated as part of partnership profits). Partnership example – working partner and employee Applying the above allocation rules, the subsidy(s) must be allocated first to the working partner and employee to meet their normal salary/ wage expense. Any excess is allocated as part of the partnership profits (and the amounts reported in the “Government subsidies” field). Refer example below for the SC Partnership. SC Partnership The SC Partnership submitted an application for the Wage Subsidy August 2021 #1 payment on 19 August 2021 naming the partners, Sean and Callum, as well as one employee, Ester. The application stated Sean and Callum were full-time (receiving $1,200 subsidy each) and Ester was part-time (receiving $718 subsidy). The total amount paid to the partnership was $3,118 on 21 August 2021.The partnership also submitted an application for the Wage Subsidy August #2 payment on 2 September 2021 just for Ester and received $718 on 3 September 2021. Sean and Callum also personally applied for the Wage Subsidy August #2 payments, as partners of the partnership, and received $1,200 each on 3 September 2021. Sean is a working partner (s DC 4) and is paid $800 per week. Callum is not a working partner. Ester receives a weekly wage of $350. The first pay period after receipt of the subsidy is 23 August 2021. The partnership agreement allocates 50% of the profits to each partner. The partnership has received wage subsidy payments totalling $6,236 ($3,118 + $719 + $1,200 + $1,200) which must be applied to salary/ wages or distributed as part of the partnership profits (and the amounts reported in the Government subsidies field). SCENARIOS FOR ACCOUNTING FOR COVID-19 SUBSIDIES FOR INDIVIDUALS 16 Wage Subsidy August 2021 #1 allocation The $3,118 received on 21 August 2021 is allocated as follows: • Pay period 23 August 2021 - $800 applied to Sean, $350 applied to Ester, total $1,150 • Pay period 30 August 2021 - $800 applied to Sean, $350 applied to Ester, total $1,150. The total amount of the Wage Subsidy August 2021 #1 payment allocated to salary/wages within the 2-week period which it applies to is $2,300. The excess of $818 not utilised for salary/wages will be required to be distributed in accordance with the partnership agreement/ PLA. This $818, together with any further excess amounts for other subsidies during the year, will need to be distributed as part of the partnership profits. Wage Subsidy August 2021 #2 allocation The $1,200 received by the partners personally is required to be declared in the partnership accounts. Therefore, in total $3,118 was received by the partnership to distribute and will be allocated as follows: • Pay period 6 September 2021 - $800 applied to Sean, $350 applied to Ester, total $1,150 • Pay period 13 September 2021 - $800 applied to Sean, $350 applied to Ester, total $1,150. The total amount of the Wage Subsidy August 2021 #2 payment allocated to salary/wages within the 2-week period which it applies to is $2,300. The excess of $818 not utilised for salary/wages will be required to be distributed in accordance with the partnership agreement/ PLA. This $818, together with any further excess amounts for other subsidies during the year, will need to be distributed as part of the partnership profits. SC Partnership IR7 In the financials for SC Partnership, the Taxable Covid-19 receipts will be recognised as follows: • Salary/wage expense $59,800 ($800 + $350 x 52, being Sean and Ester’s total annual salary and wages) • Non-deductible salary/wage expense $4,600 (being the salary/wages funded by the wage subsidy receipts) • Net deductible salary/wage expense $55,200 ($59,800 - $4,600) • Excluded income of $4,600 (being the part of SC Partnership’s total wage subsidy receipt used to pay for salary and wages during the wage subsidy period, equal to non-deductible salary/wage expense above) • Taxable income of $1,636 ($6,236 - $4,600, being the excess of SC Partnership’s total wage subsidy receipt not used to fund salary and wages during the wage subsidy period). The excess of the WSS receipts not paid as wages during the relevant periods which must be treated as taxable income is $1,636 ($818 x 2) is available for distribution to the partners in accordance with their partnership agreement/Partnership Act. Assuming the SC Partnership made net income of $46,000 from trading (which includes the taxable portion of the wage subsidy of $1,636), the partnership will report net taxable income of $46,000 in the IR7. Sean and Callum are equal partners and therefore the IR7P will show an allocation of partnership income of $23,000 each. Of this $23,000, only $22,182 is active partnership income and $818 (50% of $1,636) is attributed to Taxable Covid-19 receipts so must be included in the “Government subsidies” field of their IR3/IR3NR returns. Sean’s IR3 The following is what must show in Sean’s IR3 (assuming no other income sources) • $41,600 ($800 x 52) will automatically populate in the “Gross earnings” field in myIR • $818 in the “Government subsidies” field (share of Taxable Covid-19 receipts) • $22,182 in the “Active partnership income” field (balance of partnership income) • Sean’s total taxable income is $64,600. Callum’s IR3 The following is what Callum will show in his IR3 (assuming no other income sources) • $818 in the “Government subsides” field (share of Taxable Covid-19 receipts) • $22,182 in the “Active partnership income” field (balance of partnership income) • Callum’s total taxable income is $23,000. SCENARIOS FOR ACCOUNTING FOR COVID-19 SUBSIDIES FOR INDIVIDUALS 17 Partnership example – non-working partners/LTC owners The Taxable Covid-19 receipts will be taxable income to the partnership and available for allocation in accordance with normal tax rules for partnerships/LTCs. The partnership/LTC will determine the net income to be allocated to each partner/LTC owner and this will be represented in the IR7 and IR7P/IR7L. Once the allocation is determined, this will then need to be split further to determine the ‘active partnership income’ or ‘LTC income’ and the portion funded by the Taxable Covid-19 receipt that is to be included in the respective partner/LTC owners IR3/IR3NR to ensure Taxable Covid-19 receipts are included in the “Government subsidies” field and ACC is not charged on the Taxable Covid-19 receipt amount. Refer example below for the M & T Partnership. M & T Partnership M & T Partnership submitted Wage Subsidy August 2021 applications (rounds #1 to # 8) for Mohammed and Taji as partners. A total of $19,200 ($9,600 each) was paid to the partnership. Neither Mohammed nor Taji are working partners so do not receive a salary or wage during the year. The wage subsidies received by the M & T Partnership is taxable income to the partnership and will be available for allocation via net profits. The net profit (income) of the partnership was $62,000 from trading. This figure includes the $19,200 wage subsidy receipts that were not paid out as salary and wages. The partnership will report net taxable income of $62,000 in the IR7. Mohammed and Taji are equal partners according to their partnership agreement and therefore the IR7P will show an allocation of partnership income of $31,000 each (of which $9,600 each represents the Taxable Covid-19 receipts passed on and required to be reported separately). Mohammed and Taji will each declare the following in their respective IR3s (assuming no other income sources): • $9,600 in the “Government subsidies” field – this may pre-populate and will need to be checked and confirmed • $21,400 in the “Active partnership income” field (being the partnership income of $31,000 - $9,600 Taxable Covid-19 receipts) • Total taxable income - $31,000 each (which will match the IR7P). SCENARIOS FOR ACCOUNTING FOR COVID-19 SUBSIDIES FOR INDIVIDUALS 18 Shareholder-employee of company – treated taxable Covid-19 receipt as 100% salary/wages Where a company applied for Taxable Covid-19 receipts and included shareholder-employees in the application, the taxation of that Taxable Covid-19 receipt to the shareholder-employee will depend on whether it was included on the Employment Information form and had tax deducted at source or not. The following examples address the various situations: • Tax deducted at source • Tax NOT deducted at source; gross earnings included in Employment Information form • Tax NOT deducted at source; gross earnings NOT included in Employment Information form (effectively shareholder salary). Tax deducted at source Where the Taxable Covid-19 receipts were passed on to a shareholder-employee as part of their regular salary/wage and it was included on the Employment Information form with tax deducted at source, all of this information will appear in the shareholder’s income profile in myIR and will pre-populate into the gross earnings and tax deductions boxes in their IITA. The Taxable Covid-19 receipt amount does not need to be included in the “Government subsidies” field in their IITA. Refer scenario below for Nikau. Nikau, shareholder-employee, wages with tax deducted at source Nikau is a shareholder in a mechanic business, Repair Shop Ltd, in which he is regularly paid a salary/wage of $650 per week. The Repair Shop Ltd applies for the Wage Subsidy August 2021 # 1 payment on 19 August 2021 and receives $1,200 ($600 per week x 2) for Nikau. The Repair Shop Limited applies for the remaining Wage Subsidy August 2021 #2 to #8 payments every fortnight thereafter and receives a total of $9,600 from MSD in the period 19 August 2021 to 25 November 2021 which it must pass on to Nikau (declarations made to MSD). As Nikau is paid regular wage payments from the company, the wage subsidy is used to fund his wages over the 18-week period the subsidy applies to being 19 August 2021 to 8 December 2021. The subsidy of $600 per week almost funds all of his weekly salary/wages ($600 funded by the wage subsidy, $50 topped up by the company). The Repair Shop Ltd files its Employment Information forms declaring the wages paid to Nikau in the normal manner through its payroll system. PAYE and Kiwisaver deductions were made on the full wage payment ($650). For income tax, the WSS receipts are excluded income and salary/wages funded by the wage subsidy are not deductible. In the 2022 financials for Repair Shop Ltd they will report the following: • Excluded income of $9,600 which is the full amount of the wage subsidy applied to salary/wages • Non-deductible salary/wage expense of $9,600. When it comes time for Nikau to finalise his IITA, Nikau can see his salary/wage income, partially funded by the WSS in his income profile and this will pre-populate the gross earnings field of his IITA. He does not need to report the WSS separately in the “Government Subsidies” field. Tax NOT deducted at source; gross earnings included in Employment Information form Where the Taxable Covid-19 receipts were included on the Employment Information form but tax was not deducted at source, the gross earnings will still appear in the shareholder(s) income profile in myIR and will pre-populate into the gross earnings field in their IITA and the amount of income tax payable will be calculated when the IITA is finalised. The Taxable Covid-19 receipt does not need to be included in the “Government subsidies” field in their IITA. SCENARIOS FOR ACCOUNTING FOR COVID-19 SUBSIDIES FOR INDIVIDUALS 19 Tax NOT deducted at source; gross earnings NOT included in Employment Information form Where a shareholder-employee takes a regular salary/wage from the company, the company should make the necessary PAYE and other tax deductions from the payment and submit Employment Information forms (s RD 3B of the ITA07 does not apply). Where tax was not deducted at source when required and the relevant income details were not included on an Employment Information form, the shareholder will be required to report their income from Taxable Covid-19 receipts in the “Government Subsidies” field in their IR3/IR3NR (as is required by a shareholder-employee taking an annual salary). Refer scenario below for Shazmeen. Shazmeen, shareholder employee, regular salary without tax deducted at source Shazmeen is a shareholder in an IT company, IT Solutions Ltd, from which she regularly takes $1,500 per week from the company ($78,000 for the year). IT Solutions Ltd applies for the Wage Subsidy August 2021 #1 to #8 payments listing Shazmeen as an employee and receives a total of $9,600 WSS payments from MSD. It also received a Short-term Absence Payment (STAP) of $359 for Shazmeen on 15 December 2021. It must pass these on to Shazmeen (declaration made to MSD at time of application). IT Solutions Ltd is not registered as an employer and has not used the PAYE system to pay Shazmeen. For income tax, the receipt is excluded income (to the extent paid out as shareholder salary) and the portion of the shareholder salary funded by the wage subsidy is not deductible. Since it was not processed through the PAYE system, the income will not appear in Shazmeen’s gross earnings in the income profile in myIR or her IR3. The Taxable Covid-19 receipts of $9,959 ($9,600 + $359) are required to be reported in the “Government subsidies” field on her IR3 and the balance of the income taken from the business in the “Shareholder-employee salary” field. Company financials/tax return In the 2022 financials for IT Solutions Ltd they will report the following: • Excluded income of $9,959 which is the full amount of the Taxable Covid-19 receipts (required to be passed on as shareholder salary) • Shareholder salary $78,000 ($1,500 x 52 weeks) • Non-deductible shareholder salary expense of $9,959 • Net deductible shareholder salary expense of $68,041 ($78,000 - $9,959). The IR4S will show the following: • Shareholder salary/non-taxed shareholder remuneration of $78,000 Shareholder-employee IR3/IR3NR return Shazmeen will report the following in his 2022 IR3 (assuming no other income): • $9,959 in the “Government subsidies” field – this should pre-populate • $68,041 in the “Shareholder-employee salary” field • Shazmeen’s total taxable income is $78,000. SCENARIOS FOR ACCOUNTING FOR COVID-19 SUBSIDIES FOR INDIVIDUALS 20 Shareholder-employee of company – treated taxable Covid-19 receipt as 100% shareholder salary Where a company applied for Taxable Covid-19 receipts which included shareholder-employees in the application, the treatment of the WSS, LSS and STAP for shareholder-employees depends on whether they take a regular salary/wage from the business. Regardless of how a shareholder-employee derives income from the business, the business is required to pass the Taxable Covid-19 receipts on to the employees (including shareholder-employees) listed in its applications. If the shareholder-employee takes a regular salary or wage from the business, the business is required to use the WSS, LSS or STAP to pay that regular salary/wage, deduct tax at source and include the relevant information on the Employment Information forms (refer discussion in the previous section). Where the shareholder-employee does not take a regular salary or wage, it must be paid to them as a shareholder salary at year end. This is required even if the company is in a loss position or if the shareholder salary allocation would put the company into a loss position due to the requirements of the Covid-19 support payments/declarations made at the time of application. The amount of the shareholder salary funded by the Taxable Covid-19 receipts must be returned in the “Government Subsidies” field on the shareholder-employee’s IR3/IR3NR return. This should pre-populate into the field. The balance of the shareholder salary will be reported in the “Shareholder-employee Salary” field on the return. Refer scenario below for NPC Limited. NPC Limited – 100% shareholder salary NPC Ltd submitted Wage Subsidy August 2021 applications #1 to #8 for five full-time staff. Two of those listed in the application are shareholder-employees, Nellie and Pania who do not draw a regular salary/wage, only an annual shareholder salary. The first application was submitted on 19 August 2021 and every fortnight after that. NPC Ltd received $6,000 ($1,200 each person) for each Wage Subsidy August 2021 application. A total of $48,000 was received over the 8 applications. The wage subsidies were required to be passed on to the named applicants over the 18-week period from 19 August 2021 to 8 December 2021 which the subsidies apply to. In this time, no salary/wages were paid to the shareholder-employees, but the full amount received for the employees $28,800 (which accordingly had PAYE and other deductions made) was used to subsidise their salary/wages. The remaining amount of $19,200 for Nellie and Pania is required to be passed on to them as a shareholder salary ($9,600 each). The total salary and wage bill for NPC Ltd for the three employees for the 2022 year was $109,200. A shareholder salary is required to be declared for each of the shareholder-employees, Nellie and Pania, which at a minimum must be an amount equal to the wage subsidy received for each of them ($9,600). The company was able to pay a shareholder salary of $40,000 each to Nellie and Pania. Company financials/tax return In the 2022 financials for NPC Ltd they will report the following: • Excluded income of $48,000 which is the full amount of the WS received • Shareholder salary of $80,000 ($40,000 x 2) • Salary/wage expense of $109,200 (other employees) • Non-deductible salary/wage expense of $28,800 (subsidies passed on to employees) • Non-deductible shareholder salary expense of $19,200 (subsidies passed on to shareholders). The IR4S will show the following: • Shareholder salary (non-taxed remuneration) of $40,000 each Shareholder-employees IR3/IR3NR returns Nellie and Pania will be required to report their shareholder salary (part funded by the wage subsidy), in their respective IR3s as follows: • $9,600 in the “Government subsidies” field being the WS received - this should pre-populate but if not is required to be added manually • $30,400 in the “Shareholder-employee salary” field, being the shareholder salary amount not funded by the WS ($40,000 - $9,600) • $40,000 total taxable income each assuming no other income sources. SCENARIOS FOR ACCOUNTING FOR COVID-19 SUBSIDIES FOR INDIVIDUALS 21 Shareholder-employee of company – part salary/wages & part shareholder salary Where a company applied for Taxable Covid-19 receipts which included a shareholder-employee(s) in the application, the company should continue to pay the shareholder-employee(s) their regular salary/wages and make the necessary PAYE and other tax deductions. Where the shareholder-employee’s regular salary/wage is less than the weekly subsidy amount that was received for the relevant wage subsidy period (e.g. their standard wage is $400 per week but the subsidy received on their behalf was $600 per week), part of the subsidy will be applied to the regular salary/wage and the balance applied as a shareholder salary (applying the treatment in s RD 3C of the ITA07). The portion that is required to be treated as a shareholder salary does not have tax deducted at source (e.g. $200, using the example below) will be required to be returned in the “Government subsidies” field in their IR3/IR3NR. The balance that was paid out as salary and wages will show as gross earnings in their IR3/IR3NR. Refer scenario below for Khaled and Daniel Khaled and Daniel, mix of shareholder-employee income N2021 Ltd is an engineering company which submitted a Wage Subsidy August 2021 #1 application on 19 August 2021 for seven full-time staff and received $8,400 the same day. Further Wage Subsidy August 2021 applications were submitted every fortnight thereafter (#2 to #8). In total the company received $67,200 ($8,400 x 8) for the seven staff which was required to be passed on during the 18-week wage subsidy period (19 August 2021 and 8 December 2021). Two of those listed in the application are shareholder-employees, Khaled and Daniel, who drew a regular salary/wage of $400 per week each over the 18-week wage subsidy period. Khaled was also listed on a Short-term Absence Payment (STAP) application dated 28 February 2022 and $359 received was received by the company to pass on to Khaled as part of his salary/wages. In February 2022, the company was no longer paying regular salary/wages to Khaled and Daniel therefore this was not passed on with taxed deducted at source. The total Taxable Covid-19 receipts paid to the company was $67,559. The total passed on to the five employees via their salary/wages which accordingly had PAYE and other tax deductions was $48,000 (all employees are paid amounts greater than the subsidy received for them). In addition, the total wage subsidies passed on to Khaled and Daniel via their salary/wages, which accordingly had PAYE and other tax deductions at source, was $14,400 ($7,200 each – being their standard $400 weekly salary/wage x 18 weeks). Therefore, in total $62,400 ($48,000 + $14,400) of the wage subsidies received by the company were passed on with tax deducted at source. The balance of $4,800 was not passed on and relates to the shareholders (whose salary/wages were less than the subsidy amount). This amount must be passed to them as a shareholder salary (where not refunded to MSD). Khaled must be allocated a shareholder salary of at least $2,759 ($2,400 + $359) and Daniel at least $2,400. The total salary/wage bill for the company for the 2022 year was $245,600. The company was able to pay an end of year shareholder salary of $50,000 each to Khaled and Daniel. Of this, $2,759 and $2,400 were funded by the subsidies and must be declared in the Government subsidies field of their IR3/IR3NR return. Company financials/tax return In the 2022 financials for N2021 Ltd they will report the following: • Excluded income of $67,559 which is the full amount of the subsidies received • Shareholder salary of $100,000 ($50,000 x2) • Salary/wage expense of $245,600 • Non-deductible salary/wage expense of $62,400 (wage subsidies passed on to employees and shareholder-employees) • Non-deductible shareholder salary expense of $5,159 ($4,800 wage subsidies passed on to shareholder-employees + $359 STAP for Khaled) • The net salary/wages and shareholder salary deductions claimed for income tax are $278,041 ($100,000 + $245,600 - $62,400 - $5,159).

SCENARIOS FOR ACCOUNTING FOR COVID-19 SUBSIDIES FOR INDIVIDUALS 23 Directors/chairpersons/executive office holders Where a director, chairperson, or executive office holder received a Taxable Covid-19 receipt, either directly or indirectly via an entity with which they are associated to, the subsidy/grant received is taxable. Typically, such amounts are schedular payments and will have withholding tax deducted and returned via the PAYE system. If the director, chairperson, or executive office holder received the subsidy without tax deducted at source (e.g. not passed on via the PAYE system), it must be included in the “Government subsidies” field of their IITA. Jordan, tax deducted at source Jordan is a director at Get Lost Ltd and typically receives a $3,000 director’s fee every month. A Wage Subsidy August 2021 #1 application was submitted by Get Lost Ltd on 24 August 2021 which named Jordan as an employee in the application. Get Lost Ltd continued to pay Jordan his director fee of $3,000 per month in August and September 2021 and correctly deducted withholding tax on the payments. Jordan can see these schedular payments (which fully utilised the wage subsidy attributed to him) along with the withholding tax deducted in his income profile in myIR. Jordan doesn’t need to do anything further regarding the wage subsidy received as the income will already appear in his IITA. Alana, tax NOT deducted at source Alana is a director at Expo Ltd. Alana does not receive regular director’s fees from Expo Ltd. Expo Ltd applied for and received the full- time Wage Subsidy August 2021 #1 and #2 payment for Alana ($1,200 each). Expo Ltd passed the full $2,400 onto Alana as a lump sum without tax deducted. As a result, this does not appear in her income profile in myIR. Alana will need to include the $2,400 wage subsidy receipt in the “Government Subsidies” field of her 2022 IITA. SCENARIOS FOR ACCOUNTING FOR COVID-19 SUBSIDIES FOR INDIVIDUALS 24 Trustees/beneficiaries of trusts Where a trustee or beneficiary of a trust received a Taxable Covid-19 receipt, either directly or indirectly via the trust, the amount received is taxable. Where the trustee or beneficiary is an employee of the trust and is paid a salary/wage, the Taxable Covid-19 receipt applied for on their behalf is required to be passed on as part of their salary/wages with PAYE and other deductions made. Where the full Taxable Covid-19 receipt applied for on their behalf has been passed on and tax deductions at source made, the trustee/beneficiary is not required to do anything further. This income will appear in their income profile and their IITA as gross earnings. If the trustee/beneficiary of the trust received the subsidy without tax deducted at source (e.g. not passed on via the PAYE system), it must be included in their IITA in the “Government subsidies” field. Keira, tax deducted at source Keira is a beneficiary of the GBK Investment Trust. She is also an employee and paid a regular wage of $700 per week. The Trust received the full-time Wage Subsidy August 2021 #1 to #8 payments for Keira totalling $9,600. The $600 per week wage subsidy received by the Trust is used to fund her regular wage payments. Keira did not receive any other wage subsidy payments from the Trust. Keira can see her gross earnings in her income profile in myIR (which fully utilised the WSS payments attributed to her). Keira doesn’t need to do anything further regarding the WSS payments received as the income will already appear in her IITA as gross earnings. Layton, tax NOT deducted at source Layton is a trustee of the GBK Investment Trust. The Trust received the part-time sole-trader Wage Subsidy August 2021 #1 and #2 payments for Layton totalling $1,436.

If the weekly standard-cost deduction amount in box B is less than box A — continue to Annual housing standard-cost deduction. 1 The “weekly standard-cost” is an amount set by Inland Revenue and Consumer Price Index (CPI) adjusted each year. It represents the direct day-to-day expenses involved in having boarders (eg, food, utility bills, use of furniture, entertainment). For the 2023 - 2024 income year, the “weekly standard-cost” has been set at $231 per boarder per week, subject to CPI adjustment. At the start of each year tax year, we will publish the updated “weekly standard-cost” amount for the previous income year on our website. Annual housing standard-cost deduction The “annual housing standard-cost” reflects the cost of using your home to earn boarding income which includes costs such as home loan interest or rent, insurance and rates.

If you are not required to file an income tax return but want to, you can not offset this loss against any other income in this year or any future year (the boarding income needs to be declared as nil). 3 EXAMPLES TO HELP WITH YOUR CALCULATIONS Examples of calculating annual housing costs The following examples explain the annual housing costs calculation in straightforward situations. There are examples showing more complex situations in Appendix C of the Commentary in the Determination 19/01 found on our tax technical website. Example 1: Hosts own their home Norma and Frank own their home. They bought it for $480,000. They have one boarder for the whole year. Norma, Frank and the boarder are the only people who live in the house. Norma and Frank don’t receive any accommodation supplement. The formula is: (a – b) × c × d a = $19,200 (0.04 or 4% of the cost of the home – ie, 4% of $480,000) b = 0 (because Norma and Frank don’t receive any accommodation supplement) c = 33.33% (because 1/3 of the occupants of the home (33.33%) are boarders, to work out the percentage divide the number of boarders by number of household occupants’ then times by 100. (1 ÷ 3 = 0.3333 x 100 = 33.33%) d = 1 (the number of weeks the boarder is there (52) divided by 52 weeks in the year = 1) Norma and Frank’s annual housing cost = $6,399.36 ($19,200 – 0) × 33.33% × 1 = $6,399.36 Example 2: Host rents their home Harry rents his home for $350 per week. He has one boarder for 48 weeks of the year. Harry and the boarder are the only people who live in the house. Harry doesn’t receive any accommodation supplement. The formula is: (a – b) × c × d a = $18,200 (the total rent Harry paid for the year) b = 0 (because Harry doesn’t receive any accommodation supplement) c = 50% (because 1/2 of the occupants of the home (50%) are boarders, to work out the percentage divide the number of boarders by number of household occupants’ then times by 100. (1 ÷ 2 = 0.5 x 100 = 50%) d = 0.92 (the number of weeks the boarder is there (48) divided by 52 weeks in the year) Harry’s annual housing cost = $8,372 ($18,200 – 0) × 50% × 0.92 = $8,372 Examples of calculating annual transport costs The following example explains the annual transport costs calculation in a straightforward situation. If the vehicle travels more than 14,000 km in the year, there is a lower Commissioner’s tier 2 kilometre rate for any kilometres over 14,000 km. Example of annual transport costs calculation Jacqui has a teenage boarder. Part of the boarding agreement is that Jacqui will provide transport to the boarder when required. Jacqui drives the boarder to their sports and other activities. Jacqui keeps a logbook of these and any other trips she makes where the dominant purpose of the trip was to transport the boarder. The total kilometres travelled on all the eligible trips for the year was 2,000. Jacqui’s car travels less than 14,000 kilometres during the year. The formula is: kilometre rate × kilometres travelled Kilometre rate = $1.04 per km for the first 14,000 kilometres (The Commissioner of Inland Revenue sets the motor vehicle tiers 1 and 2 kilometre rates each year). The Commissioner’s tier 2 rates for any kilometres over 14,000 are 35 cents for petrol or diesel, 21 cents for petrol hybrid and 12 cents for electric. Kilometres travelled = 2,000 (the total kilometres travelled where the main purpose of the trip related to providing the boarding service) Jacqui’s annual transport cost = $1,520 2,000 × 1.04 = $2,080 You can choose to use the Commissioner’s kilometre rates or claim actual vehicle costs if you have records to support the calculation. If you choose to use actual costs and do not maintain a logbook to record your vehicle usage; you will be restricted to 25% running costs or less if you cannot show actual vehicle usage.

shuttle and ride-sharing3 Who this guide is for This guide is for self-employed taxi, shuttle, or ride-sharing drivers. This guide is not for employees who are employed as drivers and have PAYE deducted from their salary or wages. If you’re not sure if you’re self-employed or an employee, read the section Common arrangements between owners and drivers. The guide gives you some helpful information when you first start out in this industry, and lets you know where you can find more in-depth information on our ird.govt.nz website and our publications. myIR You can get your tax and entitlements sorted online with myIR, including registering for GST or as an employer, and filing tax returns. Go to ird.govt.nz/myir-personal Common arrangements between owners and drivers We’ve listed some common arrangements between owners and drivers to help you work out whether you are an employee, or self-employed. If you have workers driving for you, this information will also help you work out if they’re employees or self-employed. 1Owner drives the taxi and does not employ a driver The owner is the only one who drives the taxi. They are self- employed for tax purposes. 2Owner drives the taxi and employs a driver at other times The owner is self-employed for tax purposes. Whether the driver is an employee of the owner depends on the conditions explained in number 3. 3Owner does not drive a taxi but employs a driver The owner is self-employed for tax purposes. If the driver • is paid a set wage and has little control over the hours worked, they are an employee. The owner must deduct PAYE from the driver’s wages and pay it to us. • pays a fixed lease to the owner for the use of the taxi, the driver is most likely self-employed. • pays the owner a percentage of takings (usually calculated excluding GST) the situation depends on if –the driver takes the risk of a loss, pays the running costs, pays the fixed costs (such as insurance) and controls the use of the taxi, then the driver is most likely self-employed. –the owner takes responsibility for all or most of these things, the driver is most likely an employee. 4 ird.govt.nz 4Taxi organisation owns taxis and employs drivers The organisation could be a sole trader but is usually a limited liability company, or a cooperative company with owner-drivers as shareholders. How the drivers pay tax depends on the situations explained in number 3. 5Taxi organisation controls a pool of relief drivers A taxi organisation has a pool of part-time drivers available for taxi owners to use as replacements when required. The taxi organisation and the independent owners are self- employed for tax purposes. How the relief drivers pay tax depends on the situations explained in number 3. 6Ride-sharingThe owner makes a car and driver available for public hire for passengers using an online marketplace (digital platform) to request a ride. The owner is self-employed for tax purposes. Go to page 12 for more information about ride-sharing If you’re still not sure, go to ird.govt.nz/employment-status For more information about ride-sharing, go to ird.govt.nz/ride-sharing Starting out in business If you’re self-employed, you must pay your own tax to us. You’ll need to keep business records for your income and expenses, and you may also need to register for GST. There’s a lot to think about when you’re starting a new business and it’s important to understand your responsibilities. This will help you get things right from the start with filing returns and paying your tax on time, avoiding penalties and interest. You can get advice from an accountant, lawyer, tax agent or business advisor when you are starting your business. The business.govt.nz website has lots of useful information about starting up a new business. Read our information about starting a new business at ird.govt.nz/new-business Record keeping Start keeping records as soon as you decide to go into business. Good record keeping makes it easier to: • work out your income tax, expenses, and GST if you’re registered • meet your employer obligations if you have staff • prepare your financial accounts. It's much harder to work backwards later when you need your records to file returns. IR35 Taxi, shuttle and ride-sharing5 What you need to keep • invoices and receipts (taxable supply information if you are GST registered) • bank statements and deposit information • logbooks • cashbooks • working papers showing your calculations and how you arrived at your figures. You should file your records in a logical order so they can easily be retrieved if you need them later. Keep your records for 7 years You’ll need to keep all your business records for at least 7 years from the end of the tax year or the taxable period they relate to. Even after you stop operating your business, you still have record keeping responsibilities. For more information about record keeping go to ird.govt.nz/new-business On this page you’ll find links to our: • Smart business guide - IR320 • Starting a new business - checklist IR1007 • Business tax seminars, workshops, and videos. Separate business bank account It’s good practice to keep a separate business bank account. A business bank account will make it easier to keep your business and private matters separate. • Use your business account when you bank your takings and pay business expenses. • Do not use your business account for private transactions. • When you withdraw money from the business for personal spending, make sure you record it as ‘drawings’. Income tax Income tax return and payment due dates Every year you're in business, you'll need to file an income tax return and pay tax. Your return must include all your income and business expenses. For most businesses the tax year begins on 1 April and ends the following 31 March. Your balance date is 31 March. Income tax returnDue 7 July after the end of the tax year Income tax Due 7 February the following year 6 ird.govt.nz Standard provisional tax instalments\* For a 31 March balance date: • 28 August • 15 January • 7 May \*These dates do not apply if you’re using the GST ratio option or the accounting income method (AIM) Example For the 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024 tax year, the return is due 7 July 2024 and income tax payment is due 7 February 2025. To find out how to pay your tax, go to ird.govt.nz/payments Need more time to file your return? If you’re doing your own tax return and need more time to file it, you can apply to us for an extension of time, telling us why you need it. If we approve an extension, this only applies to the date to file your return. Your end-of-year income tax payment is still due by 7 February. If you have a tax agent with an extension of time, your return is due 31 March the following year and you have until 7 April to pay your end-of-year income tax. Income All the ride fares you receive in your taxi, shuttle or ride-sharing business are income - whether your customer pays by voucher, taxi card, cash or barter arrangement. You will also need to include credit card and airport entry surcharges, additional fees (for instance soiling the taxi), tips or other similar receipts as income. You need to include other income you receive from outside of your taxi business in your tax return, for example, interest, dividends, rental income, wages and any other self-employed income you may earn. Expenses You can claim a deduction for most expenses relating to your business, including vehicle, garaging and uniform expenses. You can also claim depreciation on your vehicle and other assets used in your business. Vehicle expenses You can claim vehicle expenses, based on actual running costs or the per kilometre rate. • If you have a vehicle only used for business purposes, you can claim a business expense for the full running costs. • If you use your vehicle for both business and personal trips you will need to make an adjustment for private use. For more information on how to make adjustments go to page 8. Garaging expenses You may be able to claim expenses if your business vehicle is garaged at your home, for example, a percentage of your rates, mortgage interest, or rent. For more information on what you can claim go to ird.govt.nz/home-office-expenses IR35 Taxi, shuttle and ride-sharing7 Uniforms If you buy distinctive work clothing or a uniform, that clearly identifies your business and you would not normally wear it for private purposes, you can claim the purchase cost and drycleaning. Example Joe buys 3 sets of shirts and pants to wear while working. He puts his business logo on 2 sets of the clothes. Although he uses all 3 sets of clothing for work, he can only claim expenses for 2 sets with the business logo. Examples of expenses you can claim Vehicle expenses • Certificate of fitness• Repairs and maintenance• Insurance • Fuel and oil• Road user charges• Loan interest • Registration• Ty re s• Depreciation (vehicle) • Car wash/grooming Note – using the per kilometre rate You can use the per kilometre rate instead of the vehicle examples listed if your vehicle is powered by petrol, diesel, hybrid, or electric. If your vehicle is not powered by one of these means, you must use the actual cost method. The latest kilometre rates are published each year after 31 March on our website (usually by May). Garaging expenses • Power• Rates• Insurance • Rent/mortgage interest Other expenses • ACC• Airport and road tolls• Bank fees • Communication• Company levies• Depreciation (other) • Equipment repairs/rentals• Medical/police license• Public liability insurance • RT fees• Uniform• Voucher discounts • Wages paid• Stationery (logbook, business cards) For more information go to ird.govt.nz/business-expenses 8 ird.govt.nz Depreciation Depreciation is an allowance you can claim as an expense for wear and tear on some fixed assets. The amount of depreciation you can claim is based on the cost of the asset and the depreciation rate applying to the asset. Generally low value assets (costing less than $1000) can be fully deducted as an expense in the year of purchase. For assets you do depreciate, you will need to keep a schedule of fixed assets showing the cost price and the adjusted tax value - the asset’s cost price less depreciation claimed since you bought it. You must claim depreciation on all fixed assets kept in your business for longer than a year, unless you tell us you have decided not to depreciate a particular asset. You can choose either the diminishing value or straight-line method to work out your depreciation rate. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/depreciation If you’re depreciating an asset you use for both business and private purposes, you will need to make a private use adjustment (see next section). For more information about depreciation, go to • ird.govt.nz/depreciation • ird.govt.nz/forms-guides - Depreciation – a guide for businesses – IR260 • ird.govt.nz/rate-finder for a list of depreciation rates and to calculate how much you can claim. Adjustments for private use You may need to make private use adjustments for expenses. For example, you own a laptop used in your business 80% of the time and 20% for private use. The adjustment means you only claim the business portion of the expenses. If you use your taxi for any private use, you’ll need to separate the running costs between business and private use. The simplest way to do this is keeping a logbook showing the use of the vehicle for at least 90 days (about 3 months). Otherwise, you will need to keep records of all your business and private use to show the actual use of the vehicle. You need to use 1 of these methods for as long as you own the vehicle. If you do not use either of these methods, you can claim the lesser of the proportion of actual business use or 25% of the vehicle's running costs. You will still need to keep records to support this claim. Keeping a logbook You can work out your private use adjustments by using a logbook to record all your non-work use. • You must keep a logbook for at least 90 days • Your calculation can be used for up to 3 years if the proportion of business use does not change by more than 20% • After 3 years you will need to keep a logbook for another 90 days. IR35 Taxi, shuttle and ride-sharing9 Logbook example Robbie sometimes uses the taxi to pick up groceries, run their children to school when Fran his partner is busy. Robbie keeps track of private use with a logbook for 3 months. 3-month vehicle logbook 1/01/2024 – 31/03/2024 Meter reading on 1/01/2024 - 15,165 DateFrom ToStartFinishDistance (km)Reason 01/02/2024HomeSchool15,16515,18520Taking kids to school 01/02/2024HomeSupermarket15,71815,75335Grocery shopping 18/03/2024HomeAirport16,48516,56075Drop Fran at airport 30/03/2024AirportHome17,52517,60075Airport pickup Fran Private distance205 Meter reading 31/03/2024 Total distance travelled (17,701 – 15,165) 17,775 2,610 Percentage of private use (205/2,610) = 7.85% Percentage of business vehicle expenses = 92.15% Robbie can use the logbook information to claim 92.15% of all the vehicle related expenses such as depreciation, fuel, insurance, and other running costs for the next 3 years. Expenses adjustments using logbook results Depreciation Robbie uses the information from the logbook to work out the taxi depreciation. The taxi has an adjusted tax value of $30,000 and the depreciation rate for the car is 30% $30,000 x 30% = $9,000 depreciation before adjusting for private use. Private use adjustment $9,000 x 7.85% = $706.50. Robbie’s depreciation expense claim is $8,293.50 ($9,000 - $706.50). Vehicle running costs Robbie works out the amount he can claim for the vehicle running costs based on the logbook. • Vehicle costs for the year total $12,000. • Private use adjustment $12,000 x 7.85% = $942.00 Robbie claims $11,058 as an expense in his income the tax return ($12,000 -$942.00). Using the per kilometre rate If Robbie chooses to use the per kilometre rate instead of depreciation and vehicle running costs, he will need to apportion that amount between business and private use. For more information on what expenses you can claim go to ird.govt.nz/vehicle-expenses 10 ird.govt.nz Non-deductible expenses You cannot claim • private expenses (for example, meals and private use of your vehicle including depreciation – see adjustments for private use) • speeding and parking fines (if you’re an employer and you pay an employee’s fine you may be able to claim a deduction) • drawings (money you take from your business for private spending). Taxable income Taxable income is your total income less expenses you’re allowed to deduct. You pay income tax on your taxable income. Income tax in your first year of business Your first year in business is not tax free. Income tax from your first year is usually due by 7 February the following year, or 7 April if you have a tax agent. You may also need to start paying provisional tax if your end-of-year tax payment is more than $5,000. This means you may have to pay both your first year’s tax bill and provisional tax in your second year of business. Early payment discount for voluntary payments You can spread the amount you’ll need to pay for your first year in business by making voluntary payments and this may qualify you for an early payment discount. Your voluntary payments must be paid to us by your balance date (31 March) at the end of your first year in business. If you decide to make voluntary payments, you’ll need to apply for the early payment discount in your income tax return. Not a provisional payer after your first year in business? If your income tax bill is $5,000 or less, you do not need to pay provisional tax. However, if you think you’ll need to pay provisional tax in a later year, you may still qualify for the early payment discount by making voluntary payments. They will need to be paid by 31 March of that year and you’ll need to apply for the discount when you file that year’s tax return. Note The early payment discount only applies to self-employed or partnership income. For more information about early payment discount and how to qualify, go to ird.govt.nz/first-year-tax Provisional tax Provisional tax is paid in instalments. It is not a separate tax but a way of paying your income tax as you receive your income through the year. These payments go towards the amount you need to pay after the end of the tax year, and usually mean you do not have a large bill to pay. You only need to pay the difference (if any) by your income tax due date. If you pay more provisional tax than you needed, we’ll refund the difference. You’ll have to start paying provisional tax if the amount you need to pay after the end of the tax year is more than $5,000. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/provisional-tax IR35 Taxi, shuttle and ride-sharing11 Goods and services tax – GST GST is a tax charged on most goods and services in New Zealand. It is collected by GST registered businesses and paid to Inland Revenue. The GST rate is 15%. If you register for GST, • you can charge GST on the fare cost • you can claim back GST charged on your business expenses such as fuel, vehicle registration, repairs and maintenance. If you are not GST registered, you cannot charge GST on your fares or claim GST on expenses relating to running your taxi, shuttle, or ride-sharing business. When you must register for GST You must register for GST if the annual turnover from your taxi business is: • more than $60,000 in any 12-month period, or • you expect it to be more than $60,000 over the next 12 months. This applies whether you own or lease the taxi. Note If your fare schedule includes GST, you must register for GST, even if your annual turnover is less than $60,000. If you’re not sure, please check with the company you’re driving for. You can voluntarily register for GST if your turnover is less $60,000. For help deciding if you need to register, go to ird.govt.nz/gst-need-to-register You can register for GST in myIR. Returning GST collected If you're registered, you must charge GST on your fares, and account for it in your GST returns. You must also pay GST on tips. If you have other sources of income, you may have to pay GST on those too. Note - Taxi owners with drivers working for them You must account for GST on all the takings for the taxi including those earned by the employee drivers. Do not take out the wages before you calculate the GST. If the GST you charge is more than the GST you’ve paid on your business expenses, the difference is paid to us. If the GST you have been charged on purchases and expenses is more than the GST you collected on your business sales, we’ll refund the difference. You will need to complete GST returns based on the accounting basis and frequency you choose when you register. Expenses you can claim Generally, you can claim GST on supplies if • the supplies are used in your business, and • you hold taxable supply information. 12 ird.govt.nz Taxable supply information is what buyers and sellers need to keep as evidence of a transaction. The taxable supply information required depends on the value and the type of supply. For more information about what you need to keep, go to ird.govt.nz/gst-taxable-supply You may be able to claim the GST on any of your garaging expenses and uniform expenses. In most cases if you can claim the expense for income tax you can also claim the GST you were charged. For more details, please read Expenses on page 6. Expenses you cannot claim You cannot claim GST on interest, drawings, salary or wages, any private expenses, mortgage interest or residential rental. Adjustments You may need to make private use adjustments in your GST returns. For more information about GST adjustments go to ird.govt.nz/gst-adjustments Ride sharing drivers If you’re providing driving services through an online marketplace operator (also known as digital platform operators) you will need to tell them if you are GST registered or not. If you are GST registered Your online marketplace operator collects the GST directly from the passengers you transport (they return this GST directly to us). You include the total fare you receive from the operator in your GST return as income and as zero-rated supplies. Note Zero-rating only applies to income from the marketplace operator. You cannot zero-rate income from another taxi company. You can claim GST on business expenses such as fuel, vehicle registration, repairs and maintenance paid during the return period. Example - GST registered ride-share driver Daniel provides driving services in Wellington for an online marketplace operator. The operator charges a fare of $30 for Daniel’s services and adds 15% GST, charging the customer a total of $34.50. The GST on the fare is paid to us by the operator. When it is time for Daniel to file the GST return for the period, $30 is included as income and the same $30 is included as a zero-rated supply, resulting in $0 GST collected. Daniel can claim back the GST on any expenses related to his ride-share business for the GST return period. IR35 Taxi, shuttle and ride-sharing13 If you are not GST registered Your online marketplace collects GST directly from the passengers you transport and pays you a flat-rate credit of 8.5%. This credit recognises costs you incur when supplying your services. Example ride-share driver not GST registered Jared provides driving services in Christchurch for an online marketplace operator. The operator charges a fare of $30 for Jared’s services and adds 15% GST, charging the customer a total of $34.50. The GST charged on the fare is dealt with as follows: • $1.95 (6.5%) is returned by the operator to us • $2.55 (8.5%) is passed on by the operator to Jared. Jared receives a monthly statement from the operator confirming the flat-rate credits passed on to him. For more information about GST and how this may affect your ride-share business income, go to ird.govt.nz/online-marketplace-gst and read Goods and Services (GST) on listed services - sellers - AD277 Employing staff If you’re going to employ drivers or other staff to work for you, you’ll need to register as an employer. When you employ staff, you’re required to make PAYE (pay as you earn) deductions from your employees earning a salary or wage. You must deduct PAYE tax on your employees’ behalf and pay this to us by the due dates. Note If you have self-employed owner-operators working for you, they are responsible for their own tax. You do not need to deduct PAYE from their earnings. You’ll still need to keep business records of income and expenses. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/employing-staff 14 ird.govt.nz Getting it right Sometimes it can be hard to get everything right. We’ve included some of the most common mistakes and ways you can avoid making them. SituationWhat to do Paying expenses from cash takings (this can mean you under-declare your income) Make sure you add back the expenses when you work out your day’s income Not registering for GST when your turnover goes over $60,000 Keep track of your turnover and register for GST if it looks like you’re going to be over $60,000 Not registering for GST when your fare schedule includes GST Make sure you register – even if your turnover is less than $60,000. If you have charged GST, you’re considered to be registered, even if you have not officially done so. If you’re working for a taxi owner, not knowing if you’re self-employed or an employee Make sure you understand your employment relationship – read the common arrangements between owners and drivers on page 3 Poor or incomplete record keepingKeep all your invoices and receipts (taxable supply information if you’re GST registered), update your cashbook and file your records regularly. Not adjusting your income tax and GST for private use of business assets If you’re using an asset from your business for private use, make sure you adjust the amount you are claiming as an expense– see page 8 for more information. Claiming private expenses for income tax and or GST Keep your business and private expenses separate and only claim those for your business. Not including income from cash jobs, tips, and casual work Make sure to include your income from all sources for income tax and GST. Filing returns and/or paying your tax late Set up reminders to keep track of the due dates for filing and paying and avoid penalties and interest. Not returning the GST when you sell an asset (for example your taxi) If you sell a business asset, you’ll need to return the GST on the sale price.

Reducing your child support payments Even if you do not qualify to have your payments stopped, you may still be able to have them reduced. How to qualify for a payment reduction If you believe your income will be lower than the amount we’ve used to work out your child support payments, you may be able to estimate your income for child support. Your income needs to be at least 15% less to qualify. If your estimate is accepted, we’ll reassess your child support and your payments will reduce. For example, if we originally used an income of $30,000 a year to work out your payments and the income you expect to get for the whole year has fallen by at least $4,500 (15%), you may be able to estimate your income. How to estimate your income You can either complete: • an income estimate in myIR. To register or log in, go to ird.govt.nz/myIR, or • an Estimate of income for child support assessment - IR104 form. You can download a copy from ird.govt.nz/forms-guides We may ask you for evidence to support your estimation, for example: • a payslip • a letter from your accountant if you’re self-employed. If you already owe child support An exemption applies to ongoing child support only. Any child support debt you already owe, remains payable. Ending your exemption Any exemption ends when you leave the hospital or rehabilitation centre, or your illness no longer prevents you from meeting your child support payments. Contact us as soon as possible after you leave the hospital, rehabilitation centre or your illness no longer prevents you from meeting your child support.

Child support Turuki Tamariki ird.govt.nz/childsupport The information in this document was current at the time of publication. Refer to our website for the most up-to-date information. IR151 | July 2022 If you believe your income will be lower than the amount used for your child support assessment, you may be able to estimate your income. If we accept your estimate, we'll reassess your child support. When you can estimate your income You can estimate your income for child support if: • your year-to-date income, plus estimated taxable income, has reduced by 15% or more from the income we used in your child support assessment, and • you’ve estimated during the child support year, and your “annualised income” is less than the income used in your assessment. If your estimate is accepted, we will reassess your child support and send you a letter telling you the new amount you need to pay or what you are entitled to receive. At the end of the child support year we will compare your estimated income to your actual income and reassess your child support to make sure you paid or received the right amount. When your estimated income applies If you estimate before or during April your estimated income will apply to the whole child support year (1 April – 31 March). If you estimate anytime from May, your estimated income will apply from the start of the month in which you estimate until 31 March. Example You make an estimate in August. Your estimated income will apply from 1 August – 31 March. The information we need from you If you’re estimating before the start of, or during, April of the child support year, you need to tell us the income you expect to receive from 1 April to 31 March. If you’re estimating any time from 1 May to 31 March of the child support year, you’ll need to tell us: • your year-to-date income. This is the total income you’ve received so far from 1 April to the end of the month before the month you’re completing your estimate in, and • how much you expect to earn from the start of the month you are estimating in, until the end of the child support year (31 March). Child support - estimating your income Example You make an estimate on 17 August. You need to tell us: • your year-to-date income for 1 April to 31 July, and • how much income you expect to receive from 1 August – 31 March. Income you need to tell us about You need to tell us about all the taxable income you will receive in the child support year unless it is income from a superannuation fund, for example KiwiSaver. Tax losses from a previous year cannot be included to reduce your estimated income. These losses are not considered for child support purposes. We may ask for evidence to support your estimate, for example, payslips or a letter from your accountant or tax agent. Note: If you live overseas or earn overseas income, you need to make your estimate in the currency you’ve earned or expect to earn your income in. We will convert your income into New Zealand dollars. If you live in a country where you do not have to pay tax on your income, include that income in your estimate. Estimating for the full child support year If you estimate before or during April of the child support year you need to estimate the income you expect to receive for 1 April to 31 March. We can use your estimated income provided it is at least 15% less than the income we used to work out your child support. Example We worked out your child support on $40,500. You estimate in April that you will receive $33,000 for 1 April to 31 March. Your estimated income for the year is more than 15% lower than the income we used for your child support. We work out your child support based on $33,000. The information in this document was current at the time of publication. Refer to our website for the most up-to-date information. ird.govt.nz/childsupport Estimating during the child support year If you estimate during the year you need to tell us your year-to-date income and what you expect to receive until 31 March. We take the income you expect to receive and convert it to an equivalent annual figure. That is; we work out the amount you would receive if the income was for 12 months (or 365 days). This is your “annualised estimated income” and we use this for your child support. Example You estimate on 17 August that you will receive $35,000 from 1 August to 31 March (a 243-day period). We convert this into an “annualised estimated income” by working out the amount you will receive each day then multiplying that by 365: ($35,000 ÷ 243) × 365 = $52,572. Your child support from 1 August will be based on $52,572. If you estimate during the year your estimate can be accepted when: • your year-to-date plus estimated income has reduced by 15% or more from the income we used in your child support assessment, and • your “annualised estimated income” is less than the income we used in your child support assessment. Example We worked out your child support on $65,000. You estimate in December. You tell us your year-to-date income for 1 April to 30 November is $33,000, and you estimate you’ll receive $19,000 for 1 December to 31 March (a 121-day period). Your year-to-date plus estimated income of $52,000 is more than 15% below the income we assessed you on. Your annualised estimated income is: ($19,000 ÷ 121) × 365 = $57,314. Your annualised estimated income is less than the income we assessed you on of $65,000. We can accept your estimate. Your child support will be based on $57,314 from 1 December. When we will not accept an estimate We cannot accept your estimate of income for child support if: • your year-to-date plus estimated income for the year hasn’t reduced by at least 15% • your annualised estimated income is more than the income we used to work out your child support • you’ve estimated your income for a previous child support year and you were required to file a tax return for that year, but did not and the due date for filing has passed • the month your child support ends has passed, for example, you cannot estimate your income after 30 June if your child support ended on 15 June • the child support year you want to estimate for has ended. • your adjusted income, child support income or annual amount of child support payable has been set as a result of an administrative review or court ordered departure. • a receiving order has been made for your child support arrears. How to estimate your income You can estimate your income through your myIR Secure Online Services account at ird.govt.nz/myIR by calling us on 0800 221 221, or by completing an Estimate of income for child support assessment - IR104 form. You can download a copy from ird.govt.nz/forms-guides If your income changes If your income changes but still meets the requirements for estimating, you can make a new estimate if: • you have not elected to estimate within the last three months, or • any time your annualised estimated income will change by more than $500. If we accept your new estimate of income, we’ll reassess your child support from the first day of the month in which we received your estimate. Example Your child support assessment originally used an income of $95,000. In October, you estimated your income at $53,145. In December, you get a pay rise. You tell us your year-to-date earnings from 1 April to 30 November are $43,000 and you estimate you’ll earn $20,000 from 1 December to 31 March (121 days). The total income is $63,000, which is still more than 15% below your original income. Your annualised income is: ($20,000 ÷ 121) × 365 = $60,330.58 The annualised estimated income of $60,330.58 is less than the original income of $95,000. Your income is still reduced enough for you to re-estimate. Change or cancel your estimate If your income changes and no longer meets the requirements for estimating, you need to cancel your estimate. We’ll then work out your child support as if you had not estimated. You can change or cancel your estimate: • through your myIR Secure Online Services account at ird.govt.nz/myIR or • by calling us on 0800 221 221 from New Zealand, 1800 504 042 from Australia, or +64 9 984 2537 from the rest of the world or • by completing: – a new Estimate of income for child support assessment - IR104 form to change your estimate, or – Cancellation of child support income estimation - IR111 form to cancel your estimate. The information in this document was current at the time of publication. Refer to our website for the most up-to-date information. ird.govt.nz/childsupport You can download these forms from our website ird.govt.nz/forms-guides End of year square-up After the end of the child support year, we compare the income you actually received with your estimated income and reassess you for the period your estimate was in place. This process is called the “square-up”. We’ll use any year-to-date income you gave us in your estimate and subtract it from your actual income for the full year to work out the income you received in the period your estimate applied. Example You estimate in July. You tell us your year-to-date income is $9,000 and you estimate your income for 1 July to 31 March will be $22,000. At the end of the year your actual income was $33,000. The income you received over the period your estimate applied was: $33,000 - $9,000 = $24,000. We will take $24,000 and annualise it when working out the income to square you up on. What income is used in your square up We use the lesser of the following income in your square-up: • your actual income earned in the period your estimate applied, which has been annualised, or • the amount originally used to work out your child support. We will not square up your child support using an income higher than the one we used for your original assessment. We’ll send you a square-up assessment after the end of the child support year, once your actual income for the tax year has been confirmed. If your estimate includes overseas income, you’ll need to provide your income for the New Zealand tax year (1 April to 31 March) in the currency you earned it. We then convert your overseas income into New Zealand dollars. You may need to provide one or more of the following: • payslips • tax returns • letters from employers or your accountant • a signed declaration of your overseas income. If you've estimated your income incorrectly Liable parent If you’ve underpaid your child support, you’ll have 30 days to pay the increased amount. If you’ve paid too much, we’ll put the credit towards your future child support. Receiving carer (parent only) If you have not received enough child support, we’ll pay you the balance when we receive it from the liable parent. If you’ve received too much, we may need to collect it back from you. We’ll contact you if this happens. How to contact us By email Send a message through myIR Secure Online Services at any time.

Helping you to understand recognised care IR156 July 2019 Introduction This guide is for people who are providing or who intend to provide care for a child or children and the care is shared with someone else. It explains how Inland Revenue recognises care when calculating a child support formula assessment. A person’s care of a child will affect a child support formula assessment. This depends on whether the carer is a parent or non‑parent carer of the child and the level of care they provide. Your level of care may affect your Working for Families Tax Credits Any change in your level of care for a child may also affect your entitlement to Working for Families Tax Credits (WfFTC). There are four payment types available and you may qualify for one or more of them, depending on your family situation. The level of care required to qualify for WfFTC is different to the one we use for child support. You may be entitled to WfFTC if you care for a child at least five days a fortnight on average (122 days a year). If you have any questions about your entitlement to WfFTC, or you need to notify us of a change in family circumstances or income that affects it, please call us on 0800 227 773. If you or your partner are in business, please call 0800 377 774. The information in this guide is based on current tax laws at the time of printing.

They are entitled to receive child support if they care for the child for 35% or more of the time. Parenting agreement/care arrangement An agreement between parents, or carers, that records a child’s care arrangements. Recognised care The amount of care a parent provides their child that is taken into account in the formula assessment (must be for at least 28% of the time). Who is a carer? A “carer” of a child is a person who provides them with ongoing daily care other than on a commercial basis. This can be a parent or a non‑parent. A non‑parent carer isn’t the child’s parent but provides care for the child. If two people live together and they both provide care for a child, and: "one of them is a parent of the child, only the parent can be treated as the carer "neither one is a parent of the child, only one of them can be treated as the carer, and they can decide who this will be "both are parents of the child, we’ll treat both parents as carers. If Oranga Tamariki–Ministry for Children is making payments for a child who has been placed in foster care, any care the parents of the child provide can’t be taken into account. HELPING YOU TO UNDERSTAND RECOGNISED CARE 4 When is care recognised? The child support formula assessment recognises that a parent provides for their child if they provide ongoing daily care for at least 28% of the time. A parent or non‑parent carer won’t receive child support unless they provide ongoing daily care for at least 35% of the time. We generally determine care based on the number of nights a person cares for a child over a 365‑day period: "28% is approximately two nights a week on average, or 103 nights a year "35% is approximately five nights a fortnight, or 128 nights a year. If the number of nights is not a reasonably accurate reflection of the amount of care a person provides, we can consider the time the person is responsible for caring for the child. For example, although a father (who works nights) provides no overnight care for his daughter, he does provide care from 8 am to 6 pm, six days a week. How recognised care affects a formula assessment Care is shared between two parents If two parents share a child’s care between them and each provides care for at least 28% of the time, we’ll take this into account in the formula assessment. If only one of the carers is the parent If two people care for the child and only one is the child’s parent, we’ll assess both parents using the formula assessment. If the parent caring for the child provides at least 28% of the care, they’ll have their care recognised in the formula. They could also be a liable parent and have to pay child support to the non‑parent carer, along with the other parent. www.ird.govt.nz/childsupport 5 Care of a child is shared between the mother and the grandfather. The parents are assessed for child support. The formula determines that the father should pay 67% of the child’s costs. The mother’s income and amount of care mean she’s entitled to receive 20% of the child support the father pays. The grandfather will receive the other 47%. Example The child is cared for by two people who aren’t the parents Only the parents of a child can be assessed to pay child support. In most cases, this will be the child’s natural mother and father. However, a “parent” for child support purposes can include an adoptive parent or a person declared to be a step‑parent by the Family Court. Non‑parent carers each receive child support paid by the child’s parents, based on the amount of care they each provide. Care of a child is shared between the grandmother and the uncle. Both carers can claim child support from the child’s mother and father. Both parents pay child support, based on their share of the child’s costs, and this is paid to the grandmother and the uncle, based on their share of the care. Example How we recognise care in the formula We recognise care by using a care cost percentage in the formula assessment calculation. Parents who care for their child, at least 28% of the time, are allocated a care cost percentage, based on the amount of care they provide. The care cost percentage recognises the amount of costs associated with raising children. The more care provided, the more costs there will be. HELPING YOU TO UNDERSTAND RECOGNISED CARE 6 Parents who care for their child more than 65% of the time are given a care cost percentage of at least 76%. When a parent’s care cost percentage is 76% or more, they won’t have to pay child support. This is because carers with more than 65% actual care are already meeting their share of the child’s costs. Child support care percentage \* Child support care cost percentage 0–27%Nil 28–34%24% 35–47%25% plus 2% for every percentage point over 35% of care 48–52%50% 53–65%51% plus 2% for every percentage point over 53% of care 66–72%76% 73–100%100% \*If the care percentage is not a whole percentage we’ll round it like this: "under 50% will be rounded down, eg, 46.8% will be rounded down to 46% "over 50% is rounded up, eg, 52.2% is rounded up to 53%. The care percentage is usually calculated over a 365‑day period. A father provides 30% of his son’s care, so his “care cost percentage” will be 24%. The father’s share of the costs when his son is in his care is 24%. The mother cares for him the other 70% of the time. Her care cost percentage will be 76%, and she won’t be required to pay child support.

HELPING YOU TO UNDERSTAND RECOGNISED CARE 8 Parenting agreements and orders Before assessing child support, we need to determine the percentage of care a carer provides. If a care order, such as a parenting agreement or order is in place, you should send us a copy of it. Written parenting agreements are a great way for parents and carers to set out the care arrangements for their children. They also help us determine the care arrangements when the parties disagree. The Family Court makes parenting orders and sets out the care arrangements for children. The parenting order states who is responsible for the day‑to‑day care of a child, and when and how someone else important in the child’s life can have contact with them. We usually rely on the contents of any parenting agreement or parenting order to establish the amount of care. But, if the care arrangements aren’t fully detailed in the agreement or order, or aren’t being followed, we may ask you for evidence of this. Disagreements over care If carers can’t agree on the care arrangements for a child, and no parenting agreement or order is in place, or if a parenting agreement or order is in place but isn’t being followed, we’ll assess the situation and make a decision. We may ask both parties to give us evidence about the care both carers provide, eg, a calendar to show us when the children have been and/or will be in each person’s care. We must establish whether a care arrangement is for an ongoing period and not just for a temporary or short‑term break. This is important, because the law requires a child’s recognised care to be ongoing. www.ird.govt.nz/childsupport 9 When care patterns change If the care patterns change, try to make another parenting agreement setting out the number of nights each carer has and send us a copy of the new agreement. We’ll then adjust the care cost percentage. Altering the care percentage may not always result in a change to the care cost percentage. Note If care patterns change but you can’t agree on the changes with the other carer, you should let us know. We may need to make a decision on whether the care has changed enough to alter the child support assessment. If you start to provide care for a child or the care you provide changes, please update your details through your myIR secure online services account at www.ird.govt.nz or call us on 0800 221 221. HELPING YOU TO UNDERSTAND RECOGNISED CARE 10 Key points to remember "If you start to provide care for a child, let us know in writing as soon as possible. Remember to include details of the care arrangements. "In most cases, we can’t backdate changes to the formula assessment if there’s been a delay advising us of the change in care. So, if your care increases and you don’t tell us within 28 days of the change, we’ll change the assessment from the day you advise us. "If you no longer provide enough care for it to be recognised, tell us as soon as possible. You may end up paying or receiving the wrong amount of child support if you don’t. "It’s a good idea for parents and carers to sign a parenting agreement setting out the agreed care arrangements for the children, including the number of nights for each carer. It’s also a good idea for each person to keep a record, eg, a diary of when they care for the child, in case there’s a future dispute over the care. "Our decision on the amount of care doesn’t affect who has the legal day‑to‑day care of the child or who may have contact with the child. This decision just lets us work out the child support formula assessment. "If you don’t provide evidence when we ask you to, we’ll make a decision based on the information we hold at the time. We can’t backdate this decision if you later provide the evidence we asked to see. We can only make a change from the date we receive the information. www.ird.govt.nz/childsupport 11 For more help www.ird.govt.nz/childsupport If you’d like more information about child support, go to our website.

Child Support - Helping you to understand recognised care IR156 July 2022 Introduction This guide is for people who are providing or who intend to provide care for a child or children and the care is shared with someone else. A person’s care of a child will affect a child support formula assessment. This depends on whether the carer is a parent or non-parent carer of the child and the level of care they provide. Our decision on the amount of care does not affect who has the legal day-to-day care of the child or who may have contact with the child. This decision just lets us work out the child support formula assessment. Your level of care may affect your Working for Families Tax Credits The level of care required to qualify for Working for Families Tax Credits (WfFTC) is different to the one we use for child support. You may be entitled to WfFTC if you care for a child at least five days a fortnight on average (122 days a year). If there are any changes in care for the children you receive WfFTC payments for you need to tell us about them straight away as they could affect your payments. You can notify us of a change in family circumstances including income in myIR. If you have any questions about your entitlement to WfFTC, please call us on 0800 227 773. The information in this guide is based on laws at the time of printing.

Parenting agreement/care arrangement An agreement between parents, or carers, that records a child’s care arrangements. Recognised care The amount of care a parent provides their child that is taken into account in the formula assessment (must be for at least 28% of the time). Who is a carer? A “carer” of a child is a person who provides them with ongoing daily care other than on a commercial basis. This can be a parent or a non-parent. If two people live together and they both provide care for a child, and: • one of them is a parent of the child, only the parent can be treated as the carer • neither one is a parent of the child, only one of them can be treated as the carer, and they can decide who this will be • both are parents of the child, we’ll treat both parents as carers. If Oranga Tamariki–Ministry for Children is making payments for a child who has been placed in foster care, Oranga Tamariki are the only carer for child support purposes. Any care the parents of the child provide can not be taken into account. HELPING YOU TO UNDERSTAND RECOGNISED CARE 4 When is care recognised? The child support formula assessment recognises the care a parent provides for their child if they provide ongoing daily care for at least 28% of the time. If a person is a non-parent, they are considered a carer for child support if they look after the child 35% of the time or more. They must have at least 35% care of a child before they can apply for child support. We generally determine care based on the number of nights a person cares for a child over a 365-day period: • 28% is approximately two nights a week on average, or 103 nights a year • 35% is approximately five nights a fortnight, or 128 nights a year. If the number of nights is not a reasonably accurate reflection of the amount of care a person provides, we can consider the time the person is responsible for caring for the child. For example, although a father (who works nights) provides no overnight care for his daughter, he does provide care from 8 am to 6 pm, six days a week. How recognised care affects a formula assessment Care is recognised in the child support formula assessment as a contribution towards the costs of raising a child and helps determine what a parent pays or receives: • Care between 25% and 35% of the time can reduce the amount of child support a parent pays • A parent can receive child support if they have care of a child for at least 35% of the time • A parent will not pay child support if they have care of a child more than 65% of the time. ird.govt.nz/childsupport 5 Allocating costs to recognised care The amount of care a parent is recognised as having for a child, is used to work out the amount of a child’s costs that the parent meets through their care. A parent’s recognised care percentage is turned into a care cost percentage for use in the child support formula assessment calculation. The more care a parent is recognised as providing, the more costs we recognise they meet through their care. Child support care percentage Child support care cost percentage 0–27%Nil 28–34%24% 35–47%25% plus 2% for every percentage point over 35% of care 48–52%50% 53–65%51% plus 2% for every percentage point over 53% of care 66–72%76% 73–100%100% Example A father provides 30% of his son’s care, so his “care cost percentage” will be 24%. The father’s share of the costs when his son is in his care is 24%. The mother cares for him the other 70% of the time. Her care cost percentage will be 76%, and she won’t be required to pay child support. HELPING YOU TO UNDERSTAND RECOGNISED CARE 6 Calculators To help you work out the amount of recognised care you have there is a calculator on our website, the child support nights per year calculator. There is also a calculator to help you work out what you might pay or receive – the child support liability/entitlement c al culator. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/child-support/ types/formula-assessment/amount/estimate Parenting agreements and orders Before assessing child support, we need to determine the percentage of care a carer provides. If a care order, such as a parenting agreement or order is in place, you should send us a copy of it. Written parenting agreements are a great way for parents and carers to set out the care arrangements for their children. They also help us determine the care arrangements when the parties disagree. The Family Court makes parenting orders and sets out the care arrangements for children. The parenting order states who is responsible for the day-to-day care of a child, and when and how someone else important in the child’s life can have contact with them. We usually rely on the contents of any parenting agreement or parenting order to establish the amount of care. But, if the care arrangements are not fully detailed in the agreement or order, or are not being followed, we may ask you for evidence of this. ird.govt.nz/childsupport 7 If you do not have an agreement If you do not have a formal agreement you need to provide us with the details of your care arrangement, for example the pattern of care, and care arrangements over holiday periods. It’s a good idea for each person to keep a record, for example, a diary of when they care for the child, in case there’s a future dispute over the care. Disagreements over care If carers cannot agree on the care arrangements for a child, and no parenting agreement or order is in place, or if a parenting agreement or order is in place but is not being followed, we’ll assess the situation and make a decision. We may ask both parties to give us evidence about the care both carers provide, for example, a calendar to show us when the children have been and/or will be in each person’s care. If you do not provide evidence when we ask you to, we’ll make a decision based on the information we hold at the time. We cannot backdate this decision if you later provide the evidence we asked to see. We must establish whether a care arrangement is for an ongoing period and not just for a temporary or short-term break. This is important, because the law requires a child’s recognised care to be ongoing. HELPING YOU TO UNDERSTAND RECOGNISED CARE 8 When care changes If the care patterns change you need to let us know straight away. Try to make another parenting agreement setting out the number of nights each carer has and send us a copy of the new agreement. We’ll then update the recognised care percentage and the care cost percentage. For example, a parent has care of a child 28% of the time – this results in a care cost percentage of 24%. The parent’s care increases to 33% of the time. The care cost percentage remains at 24%. Note Updating the care percentage may not always result in a change to the care cost percentage. Let us know about changes in your care as soon as possible. We need details of the care arrangements or a copy of any new parenting agreement. In most cases, we cannot backdate changes to your child support formula assessment if there’s been a delay advising us of the change in care. For example, if your care increases and you do not tell us within 28 days of the change, we’ll change your child support from the day you advise us. If you no longer provide enough care for it to be recognised, tell us as soon as possible. You may end up paying or receiving the wrong amount of child support if you do not. If care patterns change but you cannot agree on the changes with the other carer, you should still let us know straight away. We may need to make a decision on whether the care has changed enough to alter the child support assessment. If you start to provide care for a child or the care you provide changes, you can let us know at ird.govt.nz/myIR or by calling us on 0800 221 221. ird.govt.nz/childsupport 9 For more help ird.govt.nz/childsupport If you’d like more information about child support, go to our website.

Helping you to understand child support and the Family Court IR174 August 2018 The information in this guide is based on the current tax laws at the time of printing. www.ird.govt.nz/childsupport1 Introduction A child support assessment is usually based on a formula which works out how much child support should be paid and who receives it. In certain circumstances, if you thought the child support assessment or decision was unfair, you may have objected to it or asked for a review. Or you may have been the other party to a review. This guide explains what to do if you disagree with a decision Inland Revenue has made about an objection or a review and you want to take the matter to the Family Court. It also covers what to do if you’ve received a notice naming you as the other party in court proceedings about child support. This guide tells you: • where to get help and advice • when you can apply to the Family Court • how and where to apply • which forms to use and how to get them • what will happen throughout the process. We recommend you seek legal advice if you’re considering applying or appealing to the Family Court or the High Court. Help and advice Inland Revenue can’t give you legal advice, but we can talk to you about the Family Court process. If you’re applying to the Family Court and you need help or advice, you can: • talk to a lawyer • see your nearest Community Law Centre • see your nearest Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) • phone your local Family Court (look for the number online or in the blue Government pages at the front of the phonebook) • go to the Ministry of Justice website www.justice.govt.nz/services/legal-help HELPING YOU TO UNDERSTAND CHILD SUPPORT AND THE FAMILY COURT2 Terms we use The Commissioner: The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (CIR) is the Chief Executive of Inland Revenue and delegates powers and responsibilities to other Inland Revenue employees.

Decision, determination: The outcome of a review in the Family Court. Respondent: The person an application is made against, and any other party who takes part in the review or court hearing who isn’t the applicant. Subject parent: A parent who is the subject of a Commissioner- initiated review. Administrative review: A determination can be made to depart from some or all of the provisions relating to a formula assessment if certain grounds for departure are satisfied. Commissioner-initiated review: A process to determine whether a parent’s formula-assessed amount accurately reflects their ability to provide financial support for their children. The first step of this process is an investigation by us into the parent’s income, earning capacity, property and financial resources. Exemption review: A receiving carer can ask for a liable parent’s exemption to be looked at and possibly overturned. Liable parent: A qualifying child’s parent, who is normally required to pay child support. Receiving carer: A qualifying child’s parent or non-parent carer, who is normally entitled to receive child support from a liable parent.

You can apply to the Family Court for an appeal: • if you were the respondent (or other party) and you disagree with some decisions made by the Commissioner as the result of an objection, or with a decision made by Inland Revenue as the result of an administrative review, exemption review or Commissioner review • for a departure order if you were the applicant and you disagree with some decisions made by the Commissioner as a result of an administrative review. You’ll need to apply to the High Court for a judicial review if you made a late objection and we didn’t accept it. Use the following to work out whether you should apply to the Family Court for a departure order or file an appeal. What if I disagree with the Commissioner’s decision on my objection?

This depends on the objection considered or the type of review held and the decision the Commissioner has made. Appeals are heard in the Family Court. Appealing an objection decision If you objected to a decision the Commissioner made or to the child support assessment and the objection was disallowed, or allowed in part, you can appeal as follows: • an appealable decision under section 102 of the Child Support Act 1991, or • a child support assessment under section 103 of the Child Support Act 1991. For information on how to apply to the Family Court see page 12. Appealing a review decision Only respondents to an administrative review may appeal a decision. An administrative review applicant can’t file an appeal. They must apply to the Family Court for a departure order instead. You can appeal against a decision made by the Commissioner in relation to: • a child support review (under sections 103A to 103C of the Child Support Act 1991) if: –you were the applicant in an exemption review and the Commissioner refused to make a decision because the matter was too complex or there were no grounds for making a decision –you were the applicant or respondent in an exemption review and you disagree with the Commissioner’s decision following the review hearing –you were the respondent in an administrative review and you disagree with the Commissioner’s decision following the review hearing –you were the subject parent or respondent who elected to take part in a Commissioner-initiated review and you disagree with the Commissioner’s decision. For information on how to apply to the Family Court see page 12. HELPING YOU TO UNDERSTAND CHILD SUPPORT AND THE FAMILY COURT10 How much time do I have to appeal? If you want to apply to the Family Court for an appeal, you have two months from the date we disallowed your objection or made the decision relating to the child support review. Departure orders A departure order is a written decision from either a review officer appointed by the Commissioner or from the Family Court, authorising a departure from an existing formula assessment. The same grounds are used when considering applications for administrative reviews and departure orders. Who can apply? You can apply for a departure order (under section 104 of the Child Support Act 1991) only if the Commissioner has: • made a decision about your application for an administrative review, you’re the applicant and you disagree with that decision • decided the case was too complex to make a decision and you’re the applicant for or respondent to an administrative or Commissioner-initiated review. You can apply for the Family Court to reconsider the same grounds or reasons. You can apply for a departure order at any time after an administrative review decision. For information on administrative reviews read our guide Helping you to understand child support reviews (IR175). If you’re a liable parent, you can’t apply for an assessment of less than the minimum weekly payment of child support. What does the Court consider? The Family Court must be satisfied that: • at least one of the reasons (grounds) for altering the formula exists • an altered formula would be just and equitable for the child, for you and the other party • it would be proper to make the departure order. www.ird.govt.nz/childsupport11 The Court will also determine the special circumstances of your case. Each person’s circumstances will be considered individually. In considering what is just and equitable, the Court will look at: • the duty of a parent to maintain the child • the needs of the child (including special needs) • the income, financial resources and assets of each parent who is a party to the application • the income, financial resources and assets of the child • the financial commitments required for each parent who is a party to the application to support themselves and/or other people • the costs incurred by the receiving carer in bringing up the child, including what could have been earned if the receiving carer had not been caring for the child • any hardship caused to you or the other party by not making the order. HELPING YOU TO UNDERSTAND CHILD SUPPORT AND THE FAMILY COURT12 How to apply to the Family Court About applying We recommend you get legal advice before filing an appeal or applying for a departure order.

You’re allowed to discuss information from a review with your lawyer (if you have one) if you’re considering: • an application to the Family Court, or • responding to an application. This isn’t a breach of privacy because the proceedings are private between the parties and members of the legal profession. You’re not allowed to disclose information from a review to any other person without written permission from the Family Court or Inland Revenue. HELPING YOU TO UNDERSTAND CHILD SUPPORT AND THE FAMILY COURT16 What happens next? 1. A copy of the application for a departure order or an appeal against a review decision is served (delivered to) the other party or parties and/or Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue will receive a copy of the application for an appeal relating to an objection. 2. The other party has 21 days (or another period of time set by the Court) to file a notice of defence. For details see pages 18-20. 3. The Court will then arrange a date and time for the lawyers/ parties to attend a meeting (a judicial conference). At this meeting the judge tries to find out what the issues are and tells the lawyers/parties what, if anything, needs to happen and when before the case goes any further. 4. If you don’t have a lawyer you can either complete an Application for fixture (G17) form, or wait for the Court to set a hearing date. 5. The Court will let you or your lawyer (if you have one) know the time and date of the hearing. 6. If a departure order is made or the appeal is granted, the Court will issue its decision. Any order the Court makes will be issued after this. A copy of the decision and the order is then sent to Inland Revenue. 7. We then do whatever the Court orders. We can’t change an assessment until we get a copy of the order. Do I still pay child support while I’m waiting for a hearing? Yes, you should still pay the amount on your notice of assessment until the Family Court makes its decision. If it will cause you hardship to pay that amount, you can apply separately to the Court to suspend or reduce payments until the Court makes a decision. You’ll need to complete an Application for suspension order (CS23) form and an affidavit to support your application. You may want to complete this form at the same time you complete your application for a departure order or appeal. www.ird.govt.nz/childsupport17 Exception If a person is appealing on the grounds that they aren’t the parent of a child, their liability to pay child support for that child will be suspended until the Court makes its final decision. You don’t need to apply for a suspension order in this situation. How long does a Court order last? The decision made by the Court will state the date the Court order begins. This applies to both a departure order and an order resulting from an appeal. It may also give a date or event (eg, the child’s birthday) when the order ends. The order will also end if the: • liable parent or receiving carer dies • receiving carer or child ceases to qualify for child support • liable parent ceases to be liable. If a later application restarts the formula for the same parties, the departure order starts again. It’s not necessary to go back to the Court for a new order if there’s a short break in liability, if liability recommences during the period covered by the order. If you have a change in circumstances after the departure order is made, Inland Revenue may take this into account without asking the Family Court to vary it (see page 21). HELPING YOU TO UNDERSTAND CHILD SUPPORT AND THE FAMILY COURT18 Filing a defence Receiving a document naming you as the other party This could be an application for a departure order, a notice of appeal against a review, an objection decision, or an assessment. Departure order This document will be an Application for departure from formula assessment in special circumstances (CS13), filed in the Family Court by the child’s liable parent or receiving carer. The person applying for the departure order will have stated the special circumstances that affect the amount of child support the liable parent has to pay. You have a right to state in Court why you think the formula assessment should remain as it is or change. You can do this by filing a Notice of defence (G12). Appeal This document will be a notice of appeal, filed in the Family Court by the child’s liable parent or receiving carer (see pages 9-13). Review appeals The person filing the appeal will have stated that there are reasons why the amount of child support the liable parent pays should change. You have the right to state in Court why you think the formula assessment should remain as it is or change. You can do this by filing a Notice of defence (G12). Objection appeals If the party who objected to a decision or assessment isn’t satisfied with the Commissioner’s decision, they may appeal the decision in the Family Court. The Commissioner may advise the other party of the appeal and that they may elect to intervene as a party. www.ird.govt.nz/childsupport19 What does “filing a notice of defence” mean? Filing a notice of defence means advising the Family Court in writing that you want to state your side of the case in Court. Even if you defended the application for a child support review, your comments won’t be passed on to the Court. You’ll need to defend the application for a departure order or appeal as though it’s a brand new case. We recommend you see a lawyer as your first step. A lawyer will know what to do and can represent you in Court. If you think you can’t afford a lawyer you may qualify for legal aid. For information about legal aid, go to the Ministry of Justice website www.justice.govt.nz/services/legal-help If you don’t want to hire a lawyer you can file a notice of defence yourself. How much time do I have to file a notice of defence? You should file your notice of defence within 21 days of receiving your copy of the application for a departure order or appeal. How do I file a defence? If you have a lawyer, they’ll arrange this for you. If you’re filing a defence yourself, follow these steps: 1. You need to complete: • a Notice of defence (G12) form stating the facts as you see them, and an affidavit, see page 13 for details. 2.

Helping you to understand child support and the Family Court IR174 August 2020 The information in this guide is based on the current tax laws at the time of printing. ird.govt.nz/childsupport1 Introduction A child support assessment is usually based on a formula which works out how much child support should be paid and who receives it. In certain circumstances, if you thought the child support assessment or decision was unfair, you may have objected to it or asked for a review. Or you may have been the other party to a review. This guide explains what to do if you disagree with a decision Inland Revenue has made about an objection or a review and you want to take the matter to the Family Court. It also covers what to do if you’ve received a notice naming you as the other party in court proceedings about child support. This guide tells you: • • where to get help and advice • • when you can apply to the Family Court • • how and where to apply • • which forms to use and how to get them • • what will happen throughout the process. We recommend you seek legal advice if you’re considering applying or appealing to the Family Court or the High Court. Help and advice Inland Revenue can’t give you legal advice, but we can talk to you about the Family Court process. If you’re applying to the Family Court and you need help or advice, you can: • • talk to a lawyer • • see your nearest Community Law Centre • • see your nearest Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) • • phone your local Family Court (look for the number online or in the blue Government pages at the front of the phonebook) • • go to the Ministry of Justice website www.justice.govt.nz/services/legal-help HELPING YOU TO UNDERSTAND CHILD SUPPORT AND THE FAMILY COURT2 Terms we use The Commissioner: The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (CIR) is the Chief Executive of Inland Revenue and delegates powers and responsibilities to other Inland Revenue employees.

Court proceedings: what happens during the time someone applies to the Family Court or becomes a party to someone’s application to the Family Court. Decision, determination: The outcome of a review in the Family Court. Respondent: The person an application is made against, and any other party who takes part in the review or court hearing who isn’t the applicant. Subject parent: A parent who is the subject of a Commissioner- initiated review. Administrative review: A determination can be made to depart from some or all of the provisions relating to a formula assessment if certain grounds for departure are satisfied. Commissioner-initiated review: A process to determine whether a parent’s formula-assessed amount accurately reflects their ability to provide financial support for their children. The first step of this process is an investigation by us into the parent’s income, earning capacity, property and financial resources. Exemption review: A receiving carer can ask for a liable parent’s exemption to be looked at and possibly overturned. Liable parent: A qualifying child’s parent, who is normally required to pay child support.

You can apply to the Family Court for an appeal: • • if you were the respondent (or other party) and you disagree with some decisions made by the Commissioner as the result of an objection, or with a decision made by Inland Revenue as the result of an administrative review, exemption review or Commissioner review • • for a departure order if you were the applicant and you disagree with some decisions made by the Commissioner as a result of an administrative review. You’ll need to apply to the High Court for a judicial review if you made a late objection and we didn’t accept it. Use the following to work out whether you should apply to the Family Court for a departure order or file an appeal. What if I disagree with the Commissioner’s decision on my objection? You can file an appeal in the Family Court (see pages 9-13) The Family Court hears your case The Family Court issues a decision allowing or dismissing your appeal ird.govt.nz/childsupport7 Applying for a departure order - when your administrative review failed You were the applicant or respondent and the Commissioner has refused to make a decision on your case because it’s too complex OR The Family Court hears your case The Family Court issues a decision granting or declining the application for a departure order Apply to the Family Court for a departure order (see pages 10-13) You were the applicant and you disagree with the administrative review decision Appealing - after an exemption review File an appeal in the Family Court (see pages 9-13) The Family Court rehears the case The Family Court issues a decision confirming, modifying or reversing the Commissioner’s decision in whole or part You were the applicant or the other party and you disagree with the review decision HELPING YOU TO UNDERSTAND CHILD SUPPORT AND THE FAMILY COURT8 Appealing - when your administrative review failed File an appeal in the Family Court (see pages 9-13) The Family Court rehears the case The Family Court issues a decision confirming, modifying or reversing the Commissioner’s decision You were the respondent and you disagree with the administrative review Appealing - after a Commissioner initiated review You elected to be a party to the Commissioner review hearing and you disagree with the decision OR The Family Court hears your case The Family Court issues a decision confirming, modifying or reversing the Commissioner’s decision in whole or part File an appeal in the Family Court (see pages 9-13) You are the subject parent and you disagree with the review decision ird.govt.nz/childsupport9 Appeals and departure orders Appeals Who can appeal? This depends on the objection considered or the type of review held and the decision the Commissioner has made. Appeals are heard in the Family Court. Appealing an objection decision If you objected to a decision the Commissioner made or to the child support assessment and the objection was disallowed, or allowed in part, you can appeal as follows: • • an appealable decision under section 102 of the Child Support Act 1991, or • • a child support assessment under section 103 of the Child Support Act 1991. For information on how to apply to the Family Court see page 12. Appealing a review decision Only respondents to an administrative review may appeal a decision. An administrative review applicant can’t file an appeal. They must apply to the Family Court for a departure order instead. You can appeal against a decision made by the Commissioner in relation to: • • a child support review (under sections 103A to 103C of the Child Support Act 1991) if: –you were the applicant in an exemption review and the Commissioner refused to make a decision because the matter was too complex or there were no grounds for making a decision –you were the applicant or respondent in an exemption review and you disagree with the Commissioner’s decision following the review hearing –you were the respondent in an administrative review and you disagree with the Commissioner’s decision following the review hearing –you were the subject parent or respondent who elected to take part in a Commissioner-initiated review and you disagree with the Commissioner’s decision. For information on how to apply to the Family Court see page 12. HELPING YOU TO UNDERSTAND CHILD SUPPORT AND THE FAMILY COURT10 How much time do I have to appeal? If you want to apply to the Family Court for an appeal, you have two months from the date we disallowed your objection or made the decision relating to the child support review. Departure orders A departure order is a written decision from either a review officer appointed by the Commissioner or from the Family Court, authorising a departure from an existing formula assessment. The same grounds are used when considering applications for administrative reviews and departure orders. Who can apply? You can apply for a departure order (under section 104 of the Child Support Act 1991) only if the Commissioner has: • • made a decision about your application for an administrative review, you’re the applicant and you disagree with that decision • • decided the case was too complex to make a decision and you’re the applicant for or respondent to an administrative or Commissioner-initiated review. You can apply for the Family Court to reconsider the same grounds or reasons. You can apply for a departure order at any time after an administrative review decision. For information on administrative reviews read our guide Helping you to understand child support reviews - IR175. If you’re a liable parent, you can’t apply for an assessment of less than the minimum weekly payment of child support. What does the Court consider? The Family Court must be satisfied that: • • at least one of the reasons (grounds) for altering the formula exists • • an altered formula would be just and equitable for the child, for you and the other party • • it would be proper to make the departure order. ird.govt.nz/childsupport11 The Court will also determine the special circumstances of your case. Each person’s circumstances will be considered individually. In considering what is just and equitable, the Court will look at: • • the duty of a parent to maintain the child • • the needs of the child (including special needs) • • the income, financial resources and assets of each parent who is a party to the application • • the income, financial resources and assets of the child • • the financial commitments required for each parent who is a party to the application to support themselves and/or other people • • the costs incurred by the receiving carer in bringing up the child, including what could have been earned if the receiving carer had not been caring for the child • • any hardship caused to you or the other party by not making the order.

Please note that Inland Revenue or Court staff can’t complete or lodge an application for you. HELPING YOU TO UNDERSTAND CHILD SUPPORT AND THE FAMILY COURT14 Who else is involved? Who the other party or respondent is depends on the type of application you make.

If a person intervenes in a proceeding under the Child Support Act 1991, the person is considered to be a party to the proceedings with all the rights, duties and liabilities of a party. Information given to the other parties involved If you’re a party to any of the proceedings outlined in the table on page 14, information provided for a review or objection can be used by any party to those proceedings when they prepare their affidavits or give evidence. This means information the review officer gives you, the other party or the Commissioner during the review may be used in Court. You’re allowed to discuss information from a review with your lawyer (if you have one) if you’re considering: • • an application to the Family Court, or • • responding to an application. This isn’t a breach of privacy because the proceedings are private between the parties and members of the legal profession. You’re not allowed to disclose information from a review to any other person without written permission from the Family Court or Inland Revenue. HELPING YOU TO UNDERSTAND CHILD SUPPORT AND THE FAMILY COURT16 What happens next? 1. A copy of the application for a departure order or an appeal against a review decision is served (delivered to) the other party or parties and/or Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue will receive a copy of the application for an appeal relating to an objection. 2. The other party has 21 days (or another period of time set by the Court) to file a notice of defence. For details see pages 18-20. 3. The Court will then arrange a date and time for the lawyers/ parties to attend a meeting (a judicial conference). At this meeting the judge tries to find out what the issues are and tells the lawyers/parties what, if anything, needs to happen and when before the case goes any further. 4. If you don’t have a lawyer you can either complete an Application for fixture (G17) form, or wait for the Court to set a hearing date. 5.

Yes, you should still pay the amount on your notice of assessment until the Family Court makes its decision. If it will cause you hardship to pay that amount, you can apply separately to the Court to suspend or reduce payments until the Court makes a decision. You’ll need to complete an Application for suspension order (CS23) form and an affidavit to support your application. You may want to complete this form at the same time you complete your application for a departure order or appeal. ird.govt.nz/childsupport17 Exception If a person is appealing on the grounds that they aren’t the parent of a child, their liability to pay child support for that child will be suspended until the Court makes its final decision. You don’t need to apply for a suspension order in this situation. How long does a Court order last? The decision made by the Court will state the date the Court order begins. This applies to both a departure order and an order resulting from an appeal. It may also give a date or event (eg, the child’s birthday) when the order ends. The order will also end if the: • • liable parent or receiving carer dies • • receiving carer or child ceases to qualify for child support • • liable parent ceases to be liable. If a later application restarts the formula for the same parties, the departure order starts again. It’s not necessary to go back to the Court for a new order if there’s a short break in liability, if liability recommences during the period covered by the order.

Helping you to understand child support reviews IR175 July 2023 Helping you to understand child support reviews 2 Introduction Child support is paid by parents who either do not live with their children, or who share the care of their children with another person. This usually happens when: • • a couple with children split up • • two people not living together have a child, or • • the children do not live with either parent. When a person applies for a child support assessment, we use a formula as set out in the Child Support Act 1991, to work out how much child support should be paid. However, in certain circumstances, if you believe the assessment is unfair, you may be able to ask for a child support review. If you are involved in a formula assessment of child support. It explains: • • options other than a review • • administrative reviews • • Commissioner reviews • • the review process. If you are involved in any type of child support assessment or domestic maintenance and the liable person has been granted an exemption it explains: • • exemption reviews Terms we use in this guide Liable parent - a parent of a qualifying child who is normally required to pay child support Receiving carer - a parent or non-parent carer of a qualifying child who is normally entitled to receive child support. They must have at least 35% care to receive child support Formula assessment - the calculation we use to work out a person’s child support Applicant - the person who applies for the review Respondent(s) - the other party or parties involved in the review.

There may be another way your assessment can be changed. If you think the assessment is wrong If you think we have made a mistake in your child support assessment, contact us on 0800 221 221 to check we have your information correct. If we cannot resolve the matter with you over the phone, and you still believe the assessment is wrong, you can make a formal objection. You can make an objection in myIR, fill in a Notice of objection - child support - IR119 form or write us a letter to say why you think it’s wrong. We need to receive your objection within 28 days of the date on your child support entitlement or child support to pay letter. For more information about objections, see our website ird.govt.nz/childsupport If your income has dropped (parents only) If you believe your income for the current child support year will be lower than the amount we’ve used to work out your child support assessment, you may be able to estimate your income for child support. Your income needs to have dropped by 15% or more than the income used to work out your child support assessment. If we accept your estimate, we’ll reassess your child support. We’ll use your estimated income to work out your new child support payments. You can make an estimate of income in myIR. For more information, go to our website ird.govt.nz/childsupport or read our factsheet Child support - estimating your income - IR151. If you share the care of a child If you provide care for a child or children and the care is shared with someone else, this can affect the child support you’re paying or receiving. For the care you provide to be recognised by Inland Revenue, you must be providing at least 28% (103 nights) of ongoing daily care. For more information, see our guide Helping you to understand recognised care - IR156. ird.govt.nz/childsupport 7 Exemptions from paying child support (liable parents only) You may be able to apply for a temporary exemption from paying child support if you’re: • • in prison for 13 weeks in a row or more • • in hospital for 13 weeks in a row or more • • suffering from an illness that will last for at least 13 weeks • • under 16 years old. You may not qualify for an exemption if, for example, your income is over a certain level. There are some restrictions about when you can apply for the exemption. For more information, go to our website ird.govt.nz/childsupport or read our factsheets Child support - prisoners - IR154 or Child support - hospital patients or long-term illness - IR148. To apply, fill in a: • • Prisoner and hospital patient exemption - application - IR105 or • • Long term illness exemption - application - IR105C. • • If you are under 16 years old call us on 0800 221 221 to apply for an exemption. If your circumstances have changed It’s important to tell us when your circumstances change. Some changes will affect your child support formula assessment. If we do not have the correct information for you, as shown in your assessment, please let us know. We may be able to adjust it. For example, you need to tell us if: • • a child starts to live with you or leaves your care • • you start living with the person you pay child support to, or receive child support from • • the amount of care you provide for your child changes • • any of your children start working full-time (30 hours or more), receiving a benefit or student allowance, or start living with a person in a marriage, civil union or de facto relationship. Does Inland Revenue need to be involved? If you can come to a child support arrangement with the other parent or carer, we do not have to be involved. If you want to make your own arrangement any child support formula assessment with us should be ended first. If a carer receives an unsupported child’s benefit, then we do need to be involved and child support needs to be through us. Helping you to understand child support reviews 8 What is a review? A review is a way of looking at your child support formula assessment to see if it can be altered to fit your particular situation. Child support reviews are free and managed by us. Depending on the type of review, the liable parent, receiving carer and even the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, can apply for a child support review. There are three types of reviews: • • Administrative reviews • • Exemption reviews • • Commissioner reviews A review is based on the Family Court departure order process. We organise them, but the review is done by an independent person contracted to us. This person is called the review officer. Review officers are experienced in law and are required to follow precedents set by past court cases. ird.govt.nz/childsupport 9 Application received and accepted If the other party or parties want to be involved, we’ll send them a response form, a copy of the application and supporting documents If any other party responds, we send a copy of their response, and any supporting documents, to the applicant If the other party or parties do not want to be involved, we continue the review process without their involvement Set hearing date Hold hearing Send out written decision Acceptance letter sent to applicant We’ll contact any other party involved in the child support assessment and tell them that: • • we have the application • • they can ask for a copy of the information provided • • they can respond to the issues raised and be involved in the review Administrative reviews - how they work Helping you to understand child support reviews 10 Applying for an administrative review If none of the other options for changing the assessment cover your situation and you want to apply for an administrative review, you have to be able to show that you have grounds for review. These grounds are set by law and are listed on pages 11-19. As well as having to satisfy one of the 11 grounds for review, you also have to show that: • • your ability to provide financial support for the child is significantly reduced, or • • the costs of maintaining the child are significantly affected, or • • the assessed amount isn’t fair to you or the other party. In deciding whether to change the child support formula assessment, the review officer considers the following points: • • Your special circumstances - this means that the facts of your case must be different or out- of-the-ordinary and set it apart from other cases. The review officer does not consider special circumstances for Ground 11. • • Whether a change would be fair to all parties and the child or children - this means that the financial position of all parties, the needs of the child or children and any other relevant facts are considered. • • If a change would be otherwise proper - this means the review officer considers the aims of the Child Support Act 1991, including the public interest. There is a four-year time limit on assessing past child support years, with some limited exceptions. This means you cannot apply for an administrative review of a child support year that ended more than four years ago. If you have had an assessment for a child support year that ended more than four-years ago you have four months from the date you were notified of that assessment to apply for an administrative review. If you are unsure if you can still apply for a review of a past year please call us on 0800 221 221. Note ird.govt.nz/childsupport 11 Grounds for an administrative review This section explains each ground and gives an example of the circumstances that might apply. These are not the only situations where the ground could apply, but they will help you to decide whether your circumstances fit. After the explanation of the ground, there’s a list of the documents and information you need to send with your application. We ask for your financial details for all grounds, but the other details required are specific to each ground. Ground 1 You have a moral or legal responsibility to support another child (or children) or person This ground applies if the ability of either parent to support their children is significantly reduced by responsibilities to another child or person. To apply under this ground you should have a duty to maintain another person or child. This usually means you have a legal or moral duty that makes you responsible for their financial support. For example: • • a private arrangement to support another child from a previous relationship • • a court order requiring payment of domestic maintenance. Information and documents needed: • • a copy of any agreement or court order • • proof of child support or maintenance paid, and • • your financial details. Ground 2 You have extra costs to cover the special needs of another child (or children) or person you have a duty to maintain This ground applies if the ability of either parent to support their children is significantly reduced by obligations to care for another child or person with special needs. To apply under this ground you should have a duty to maintain another person or child with special needs. In most cases this means you have a legal or moral duty that makes you responsible for their financial support. Helping you to understand child support reviews 12 For example: • • the person or child has high medical costs or needs special care because of a disability. Information and documents needed: • • a copy of any court order • • medical certificate or evidence showing the person’s or child’s condition and specific treatment and costs • • a list of costs showing extra expenses after deducting any benefit or allowance paid or medical insurance refunds, and • • your financial details. Ground 3 You have necessary expenses in supporting yourself This ground applies when the ability of either parent to support their children is significantly reduced by commitments that are necessary for that parent to support themselves. For example: • • one parent is still paying off a loan they and the other party had • • high medical costs. Necessary commitments do not usually include voluntary payments towards superannuation, life insurance, health insurance and similar policies, or donations to churches. Information and documents needed: • • a list of the costs necessary for your support (you should explain why the expenses are necessary and give details of any steps you’ve taken to reduce them) • • confirmation of your current earnings if you earn a salary or wage • • if you’re in business, details of your interest in the business, your latest profit and loss statement and balance sheet • • if you have loan commitments, the loan start date, term and purpose, minimum liability and actual repayments, and • • your financial details. ird.govt.nz/childsupport 13 Ground 4 You have necessary expenses in supporting another child (or children) or person you have a duty to maintain This ground applies if the ability of either parent to support their children is significantly reduced by necessary commitments for that parent to support another child or person they have a duty to maintain. To apply under this ground you should have a duty to maintain another person or child. In most cases, this means you have a legal or moral duty that makes you responsible for their financial support and you also have necessary expenses in supporting them. For example: • • one parent incurred debts in paying tuition fees for a child they have a duty to maintain. Information and documents needed: • • a copy of any agreement or court order • • a list of the costs necessary to support the other child or person (explain why the expenses are necessary and give details of any steps you’ve taken to reduce them) • • confirmation of your current earnings if you earn a salary or wage • • if you’re in business, details of your interest in the business, your latest profit and loss statement and balance sheet • • if you have loan commitments, the loan start date, term and purpose, minimum liability and actual repayments, and • • your financial details. Ground 5 Your costs to contact or visit your child are more than 5% of your adjusted income This ground applies when the high costs of contact (for example, travel, reasonable and necessary accommodation) significantly affect either person’s ability to maintain the children. To apply under this ground, the costs incurred in maintaining contact with the child must be more than 5% of the adjusted income of the person incurring the costs. The adjusted income is the income used to assess your child support before any allowances are subtracted from it. In determining whether there should be a change to the assessment, review officers can only take into account the costs over and above the 5% threshold. Contact costs do not include costs of enjoying contact, (for example, food, clothing and entertainment). Helping you to understand child support reviews 14 It costs $2,000 for transport and reasonable accommodation to have contact with the children, and the adjusted income for the person incurring the costs is $25,000. This ground applies because the costs are more than 5% of the income (5% of $25,000 = $1,250). Example Information and documents needed: • • confirmation of the contact arrangements (for example, a court order, agreement, a letter from a solicitor) • • a list of costs (for example, travel fares, accommodation, toll calls, legal fees for maintaining contact with the child) • • an estimate of future costs with confirmation from a travel agent (if applicable), and • • your financial details. Working out your cost of travel If you use a private vehicle to travel to and from visits with your child or children, the cost of this travel is calculated using the mileage rates below: Tax year (1 April - 31 March) mileage rate (per kilometre) 2020 (after 1 August 2019) onwards–40 cents 2019 (1 June 2018 - 31 July 2019)–36 cents 2016 to 2018 (up to 31 May 2018)–33 cents When applying under this ground you need to fill in both the Application for an administrative review - IR470 form and the Ground 5 - High cost of contact worksheet - IR470A. Both forms are in the back of this guide. Note Ground 6 You have extra costs to cover the child’s (or children’s) special needs This ground applies if a child’s needs are unusual and require funding beyond the normal costs of bringing up a child and the extra costs significantly affect either parent’s ability to support the child. You cannot claim the costs of food, clothing, medical and day care that would normally be incurred. Potential special needs cannot be taken into account. This means anticipated future costs normally cannot be considered. ird.govt.nz/childsupport 15 For example: • • the child has high medical costs or needs special care because of a disability • • the child has high costs related to dental work. Information and documents needed: • • medical certificate or evidence showing the child’s condition and specific treatment and costs • • a list of costs, showing extra expenses after deducting any benefit or allowance paid, or medical insurance refunds • • an estimate of future costs, and • • your financial details. Ground 7 You have extra costs to care for, educate or train the child (or children) This means the child is being cared for, educated or trained in a way that was expected by either parent and the extra costs significantly affect the parent’s ability to maintain the child. The expectation needn’t be held by both parents, but must be reasonable in relation to the family circumstances. Anticipated future costs cannot normally be taken into account. For example: • • high educational expenses due to the private schooling of the child • • the child is especially gifted and there are additional costs for sports, music or other activities related to the particular talent. Information and documents needed: • • evidence of school fees, additional tuition fees or costs of the child’s additional activities • • other information showing expectation of the special training or education (for example, family history, situation before separation, formal agreement), and • • your financial details. Helping you to understand child support reviews 16 Ground 8 The income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of either parent or the child (or children) isn’t taken into account You can use this ground if you feel the child support assessment is unfair because it does not reflect the true income, financial position or earning capacity of either parent or the child. For example: • • one party’s financial position has changed significantly • • assets which could be earning income are not doing so. Information and documents needed: • • evidence of your changed income (for example, a letter from your employer, copy of latest profit and loss account and balance sheet), and • • your financial details. If the situation relates to the other party’s or the children’s circumstances: • • details of their income, assets and financial position, and • • your financial details. Ground 9 Payments, transfers or property settlements you have previously made for the benefit of the child (or children) are not taken into account This ground applies if the child support assessment is unfair because a liable parent or receiving carer has previously made financial provisions to the child, parent or any other person, specifically for the benefit of the child. The aim of this ground is to avoid unfair doubling up of support payments where provision has already been made, possibly as a result of an agreement or court order between the parties. The payments, transfers or settlements need to have been made before the child support assessment was made and should be genuinely for the benefit of the child. They cannot just be accounting adjustments between the parties or payments for day-to-day expenses. For example: • • a parent has transferred property to a family trust the child is a beneficiary of, and that trust is meeting some of the costs of raising the child. • • the liable parent’s share of the matrimonial home was left to the receiving carer for the benefit of the child. ird.govt.nz/childsupport 17 Information and documents needed: • • confirmation or evidence of the payments, transfers or settlements made, and • • your financial details. Ground 10 You still have a financial interest in a property that the other person is entitled to live in This ground applies if the child support assessment is unfair because the liable parent or receiving carer is legally entitled to live in a property you have a financial interest in. This ground recognises that a considerable amount of a person’s capital may be tied up in the home over a period of time while the receiving carer and children or liable parent continue to live there. For example: • • the liable parent has agreed to the receiving carer and child continuing to live in the home until the child turns 16. Information and documents needed: • • a copy of any agreement or court order • • evidence that the other person is residing in the property and how long they’re allowed to do this • • confirmation of your financial interest in the property, and • • your financial details. Ground 11 Extra income earned from additional work to cover costs of re-establishing yourself after separation are included in the child support assessment You can apply under this ground for the child support year 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2017 or later child support years. This ground applies if all of the following are met: • • you’re a parent of a child included in a child support formula assessment • • you’ve separated from the child’s other parent • • you’ve earned extra income from additional work (explained below), within the first three years after separation • • the extra income is included in the child support assessment being reviewed • • some or all of that income has been used or will be used on actual and reasonable costs to re-establish yourself and any child or any other person you have a duty to maintain. Helping you to understand child support reviews 18 A non-parent carer of a child can also apply for a review under this ground, to have the re-establishment costs of the child’s parent taken into account. However, they will still need to get the relevant details and supporting information from the parent. For example, Grandma who is a receiving carer for her granddaughter applies to have her son’s re-establishment costs taken into account. Additional work The work must be additional in quantity and/or nature to the work done before separation. For example: • • a parent took on a second job, or worked overtime, which they hadn’t done before the separation • • a self-employed parent worked longer hours, took on extra contracts, or increased production, after separation. Reconciliations and the first three years after separation The three-year period, during which the extra income must have been earned, begins on the date the child’s parents stopped living together in a marriage, civil union or de-facto relationship. If the parents reconciled for a total of three months or less, the reconciliation period(s) may be ignored. If the parents reconciled for more than three months, the three-year period stops the day before they reconciled. A new three year period restarts if the parents separate again. Reasonable re-establishment costs Re-establishment costs (the costs to set up your new living situation) can include buying a house, furniture, white-ware, household appliances, paying a rental property bond and removal costs. These costs need to be actual and reasonable given the circumstances of your case. Maximum extra income that can be excluded There’s a maximum amount of income from additional work that can be excluded from the assessment. It’s the lesser of: (a) the amount that has been or will be used for re-establishment costs, or (b) the extra income earned from additional work, or (c) 30% of the parent’s adjusted income for the child support year. ird.govt.nz/childsupport 19 Tom and Sally separated on 1 May last year. Tom has spent $8,000 (a) on reasonable re-establishment costs. Current child support year Income from Tom’s main job$40,000 Income from a second job (started after separation)$10,000 (b) Tom’s adjusted income (used in the assessment)$50,000 × 30% $15,000 (c) Because Tom’s re-establishment costs (a) are less than (b) and (c), the maximum amount his adjusted income for the current child support year can be reduced by is $8,000. Example You do not have to show that your circumstances are “special”. However, the review officer will consider whether a change would be: • • fair to all parties to the assessment, and the child or children, and • • otherwise proper. (see page 10) Supporting information and documents: • • evidence showing the additional work started after separation, for example, a secondary employment contract • • evidence of income earned from additional work, for example, payslip(s) showing overtime, letter from employer showing details of the work that was not being done before separation • • evidence showing extra income has been or will be used for reasonable re-establishment costs eg receipts, quotes, hire purchase agreements • • dates of any reconciliation(s) after the original separation date • • your financial details. When applying under this ground you need to fill in both the Application for an administrative review - IR470 form and the Ground 11 - Re-establishment costs - IR470B form. You’ll find both forms at the back of this guide. Note Helping you to understand child support reviews 20 Financial information When you apply for a review we’ll ask you to provide details of your financial situation. It’s very important that you do this, because we may not be able to make a decision to change the assessment without them. You’ll find a Child support review - statement of financial position - IR178 form in the back of this guide. It’s your choice to provide this information, but the review officer can only make a review decision based on the information available to them. Providing information is voluntary. The information you provide must be relevant to the review. You should only provide information you are comfortable with the other party or parties receiving. The review officer cannot consider any information that you do not want passed on, as this would be against the rules of natural justice. The information you send with your application will be exchanged with any other parties in the review. You can apply for an administrative review in myIR or send your application, with all the supporting information (including your financial statements), to: Child Support PO Box 39010 Wellington Mail Centre Lower Hutt 5045 Accepting your application Before we accept your application, we’ll confirm you’ve provided all information for the review process. We will not accept any additional information during the process unless the review officer has requested it. We’ll accept your application if: • • it is based on one of the grounds listed on pages 11-19, and • • the grounds or facts you give are different from those used in any earlier administrative review, for the same year. Who’s invited to take part in a review? A change in the child support formula assessment for one party can have an impact on all the other parties in the assessment. If one party applies for a review we invite all the other parties to take part and let them know the reasons listed in your application. For example, if you’re the Grandma and you apply against one of the liable parents, we must also invite the other parent to take part. We aim to complete the review within 10 weeks or so of receiving the application. This gives all parties time to see and respond to the information provided. ird.govt.nz/childsupport 21 Decisions that may result When you apply for an administrative review, you need to understand that the review isn’t limited to the grounds or reasons given in the application. The decision can have the opposite effect to the change you’ve applied for. We call this a “contrary decision”. You apply to have your child support payments reduced because your costs to contact or visit your children are high (Ground 5). The review officer finds that you do have high contact costs but also sees that you’ve had a significant increase in income recently. Under Ground 8, they can take your increased income into account when considering your application under Ground 5. They can take this into consideration even though you did not apply to have your income reviewed. Taking into account the recent increase income the overall result may be an increase in your child support payments. This is a contrary decision, that is, not one that you were expecting. Example If the review officer believes that a contrary decision should be made, the applicant and respondent(s) will have the chance to comment on the information that may lead to the contrary decision. Cross-applications The other party or parties can complete their own application for an administrative review at the same time as they respond to your original application. This is called a cross-application and you’ll have the opportunity to respond to it. The review officer will consider all related applications at the same time, where possible. If there are time constraints, the other application(s) may need to be heard at a later date. If we do not accept your application If we decline your application because you do not meet the requirements, or your circumstances are too complex for the review officer to make a decision, you can apply to the Family Court for a departure order. To find out how to do this, read our guide Helping you to understand child support and the Family Court - IR174. Helping you to understand child support reviews 22 Exemption reviews - how they work Application received and acceptedAcceptance letter sent to applicant We’ll contact the other party involved in the application and tell them that: • • we have the application • • they can ask for a copy of the information provided • • they can respond to the issues raised and be involved in the review If the other party wants to be involved, we’ll send them a response form, a copy of the application and supporting documents If the other person responds, we’ll send a copy of the response and any supporting documents to the applicant If the other party does not want to be involved, we continue the review process without their involvement Set hearing date Hold hearing Send out the decision ird.govt.nz/childsupport 23 Applying for an exemption review If a liable parent is a prisoner, hospital patient, suffering from a long-term illness or under 16 years of age, and meets certain other criteria, they can apply for an exemption from paying child support. If an exemption is granted the liable parent’s child support liability is reduced to zero for the period covered by the exemption. If you are a receiving carer and you disagree with an exemption given to a liable parent, you can apply for an exemption review to see if the exemption can be overturned. There is only one ground for an exemption review: • • The child support assessment does not take into account the income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of the liable parent. You can also ask for the assessment amount to be changed if you’re receiving child support under a formula assessment. The review officer can: • • confirm that the exemption is to stay in place • • overturn the exemption for all or part of the period the exemption was granted for • • overturn the exemption and change the assessment if the amount is payable under a child support formula assessment. The review officer takes into account the following factors when considering a change to the assessment: • • Whether a change would be just and equitable - this means that the financial position of all parties, the needs of the child or children and any other relevant facts are considered. • • If a change would be otherwise proper - this means the review officer considers the aims of the Child Support Act 1991, including the public interest. How to apply Fill in an Application for an exemption review - IR472 form, or write us a letter. To support your application, you’ll need to provide: • • details of the liable parent’s income, assets and financial position, and • • your financial details (if you are also asking for your assessment to be changed). Go to pages 28 -33 for more information about the review process. The information you send with your application will be exchanged with any other parties in the review. Helping you to understand child support reviews 24 You can send your application, along with all the supporting information to: Child Support PO Box 39010 Wellington Mail Centre Lower Hutt 5045 Accepting your application Before accepting your application, we’ll confirm you’ve provided all information for the review process. We’ll accept your application if you’re a receiving carer and: • • your application is based on the qualifying ground • • the facts you give are different from those used in any earlier exemption review for the same year. After accepting your application, we will contact the liable parent. We’ll tell them you’ve applied for a review and let them know the reasons listed in your application. They can then tell us if they wish to be involved in the review. We aim to complete the review within 10 weeks or so of receiving the application. This time period allows all the parties to see and respond to each other’s information. If we do not accept your application We’ll decline your application if you do not meet the requirements above or your circumstances are too complex for the review officer to make a decision. If we do, you can appeal to the Family Court. To find out how to do this, read our guide Helping you to understand child support and the Family Court - IR174. ird.govt.nz/childsupport 25 Commissioner reviews - how they work Commissioner decides to investigate a parent’s financial circumstances (the subject parent) Stop - the review ends Hold hearing Send out decision The subject parent is contacted and advised that: • • we’re looking at reviewing their assessment • • they can contribute to the decision whether or not to go ahead with the review by completing a questionnaire Based on information held and discovered by Inland Revenue and provided by the subject parent, a decision is made to continue to stage 2 of the review or stop the process The subject parent is contacted and: • • advised that the review is to go ahead • • provided with a summary of information • • advised they can respond to the issues raised The subject parent becomes first respondent to the review (as first respondent) Set hearing date If the first respondent provides further information for the review, a copy is sent to the second respondent if they elect to become a party The other party or parties are given the opportunity to become a party to the review (as a second respondent) or end the review Elects not to take part Elects to become a party Elects to end the review Second respondent’s participation in the review ends The review ends, only if all the second respondents elect to end If the second respondents provide information for the review, a copy is sent to the first respondent Helping you to understand child support reviews 26 Commissioner reviews Sometimes, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue may decide to review an assessment, if an investigation into a parent’s financial affairs shows the assessment does not accurately reflect their ability to provide financial support to their children. There is only one ground under which the Commissioner can initiate a review: • • The child support assessment does not take into account the income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of either parent or the child (or children). For example: • • one parent’s financial position has changed significantly • • assets which could be earning income are not doing so. Stages in a Commissioner review There are two main stages in a Commissioner review. Stage 1: Deciding if a parent should be subject to a review of their child support. We identify that a parent, the “subject parent” may be able to contribute more to the financial support of their children based on their financial circumstances. We contact that parent and give them the opportunity to contribute to our decision whether or not to conduct a full review of the assessment. We’ll ask the subject parent to fill in a questionnaire to provide details that will help us decide whether or not to proceed with the review. Stage 2: Completing the review. If, at the end of stage 1, we decide to hold a full review, we formally advise the subject parent that the review will go ahead. We also contact the other parties involved in the child support formula assessment who can then decide if they want to take part in the review. If they do, they become a respondent. In some cases there may be multiple respondents. The subject parent and other parties who elect to take part in the review (the respondents) will be asked to provide details of their income, assets and financial position. Stage 2 ends when Inland Revenue advises the subject parent and respondent(s) about any changes being made to the assessment, or if the other parent or carer(s) elects to stop the review. Any of the other parties (the respondents) who receive an unsupported child’s benefit cannot stop the review. If there is more than one other respondent (not including the subject parent), the review can only be stopped if all respondents request it. Note ird.govt.nz/childsupport 27 The review officer also considers the following points. • • Your special circumstances - this means that the facts of your case must be different or out of the ordinary and set it apart from other cases. • • Whether a change would be fair to all parties and the child or children - this means that the financial position of all parties, the needs of the child or children and any other relevant facts are considered. • • If a change would be otherwise proper - this means the review officer considers the aims of the Child Support Act 1991, including the public interest. Any parties who elect to take part in the review will be asked to provide details of their financial situation. It’s very important that you do this, because it helps the review officer make a decision that is fair to all parties. The information you send will be exchanged between the subject parent and the party (or parties) taking part in the review. Note The exchange of information does not apply to information provided to the review officer in stage 1 or sourced from Inland Revenue records. We aim to complete a Commissioner review within 10 weeks of the decision to initiate the review (stage 2). This gives both parties time to see and respond to each other’s information. Helping you to understand child support reviews 28 The review process Exchange of information An important part of the review process is the exchange of information. We do this so everyone involved knows what matters the other party or parties intend to raise and can prepare for the hearing. Providing information is voluntary. The information you provide must be relevant to the review. You should only provide information you are comfortable with the other party or parties receiving. Review officers only consider information that has been provided and seen by both parties, with both parties having had a chance to respond. The review officer cannot consider any information you do not want passed on, because this would be against the rules of natural justice. You must send all your supporting information with your application or response. Once we have accepted your application or response to an application, no further information will be released or exchanged between the parties, unless the review officer has requested it. The other parties involved in the review are entitled to have a copy of your application and all supporting information you provide, including your financial details and information about your household. You will also receive a copy of any response and supporting information they provide. The exchange of information does not apply to information provided to the review officer from Inland Revenue records. For a Commissioner review, only information provided by a parent or carer from stage 2 is exchanged. Information is only exchanged between the subject parent and the other party (or parties) involved in the review and is not exchanged between the other parties themselves. Responding to a review You can choose whether or not to take part in a review. Taking part means the review officer can consider your side of the story, as well as the applicant’s. Before you make this decision, it’s important for you to understand how the review could affect you. If you choose to take part in the review, we’ll send you a copy of the application and any supporting information. You’ll be able to provide your response: • • in myIR if you are registered • • by completing the Child support review - response by other party - IR471 at the end of this guide by sending a letter. ird.govt.nz/childsupport 29 Any information you provide must be relevant to the review. You should only provide information you’re comfortable for the other party to receive. If you’re responding to an administrative review or an exemption review we must receive your response within 14 days of the date: • • the copy of the application was forwarded to you, or • • notification of the application was sent. About the hearing Once we’ve accepted your application and contacted the other party or parties to discuss if they want to be involved, we’ll organise a hearing. A hearing generally takes approximately 30 minutes. You can choose to: • • take part in the hearing by telephone • • ask the review officer to make a decision from written information you provide • • attend the review hearing in person in Takapuna, Manukau, Hamilton, Wellington or Christchurch. We then set a date and time for the hearing and let you know the details of where and when it will be held. The whole review and hearing process is free. Separate hearings will be held, one for you and one for the other party or parties. You cannot insist that the other party attends the same hearing as you. Review officers can only consider an application to review the assessed amount of child support. They cannot negotiate payment of arrears or consider the charging or waiving of penalties. Attending the hearing The hearing will be informal and not at all like a court hearing. Someone from Inland Revenue may be there if the review officer requests this. The review officer may ask you some questions. The review officer runs the hearing, which is held at an Inland Revenue office. The review officer does not make a decision at the hearing. The hearing is to discuss and clarify information already provided by the parties. Unless requested by the review officer, no further written information will be accepted at the hearing. If your circumstances change If your circumstances change after we’ve accepted your application for a review, please tell us immediately. We’ll take changes of circumstances into account right up until the decision is made. You may also ask for the application to be withdrawn at any time before it’s heard. Helping you to understand child support reviews 30 Representatives and support people In some cases, a representative may stand in and speak for you at the hearing. The other party or parties also have this right. You may be allowed a representative if you cannot: • • present the information yourself • • get to the review hearing and a telephone hearing is not possible. You can also take a support person to the hearing. This person could be a relative, friend or business associate. They can help you prepare your information and attend the hearing, but they do not have an automatic right to speak. We’ll determine, after considering all the necessary factors, whether the support person can attend the hearing. Their participation is at the review officer’s discretion. A representative or support person cannot be a lawyer or anyone experienced in advocacy work. If you want a representative or support person at the hearing, you’re required to get approval before the hearing date. Paying child support during the review A liable parent must continue to pay their normal child support assessment (unless they have an exemption) until the decision about the application is known. They may, however, apply to have the payments reduced if they are the applicant. We only consider reductions to payments if unusual delays in considering the case are likely. We’ll consider the effect on all parties before making a decision. You’ll get an opportunity to respond to an application for reduction of child support payments. If you believe there’s no reason for payments to be reduced, we’ll take any comments you want to make when the decision is made. ird.govt.nz/childsupport 31 Applying to have your payments reduced Send us a letter: • • explaining why your case is likely to be delayed • • telling us you want a reduction in your payments • • with supporting information attached, for example: - a statement of financial means - documents showing that a delay will cause you serious financial hardship. We’ll tell the other party about your request for reduced payments and they’ll have a chance to respond. We then consider how the reduced payments will affect all the parties before making a decision. Disagreeing with the decision on reduced payments Any party affected by the decision about reducing the payments has 28 days to object to it. You need to object in writing. If we do not allow your objection, you can appeal to the Family Court. This will not delay the review hearing. Helping you to understand child support reviews 32 After the review hearing Considering the facts After the hearing, the review officer considers all the information given by everyone involved, as well as any relevant information held by Inland Revenue (including tax information). The review officer looks at how the child support assessment affects the child, you and the other parties involved. They must be satisfied that: • • special circumstances exist if applying under Grounds 1 to 10 (special circumstances are not considered for Ground 11), and • • a change in the assessment would be just and fair for the child, you and the other parties involved, and • • a change in the assessment would be appropriate in other ways. Remember, even if you have a valid reason for a review, this does not guarantee the assessment will be changed. The review decision The decision is usually finalised within three weeks of the hearing and we send all parties a copy of the written decision. The review officer must provide reasons for their decision. This is a legal requirement. Any information given to the review officer may appear in the written decision. This could include any information given by the other party (or parties and information already held by Inland Revenue). ird.govt.nz/childsupport 33 If you disagree with the review decision Inland Revenue cannot amend the review decision once it has been issued to the parties involved in the review. If you disagree with the review decision, you have the following options: 1. If you applied for the administrative review, you can have the same grounds considered at the review looked at again by applying to the Family Court for a departure order. You can only rely on the grounds put to the review officer in the administrative review. 2. If you were the respondent to the administrative review, you can appeal the decision in the Family Court. The Court will then hear the original case. 3. You can lodge an appeal in the Family Court to have the exemption review reheard. 4. If you were a party to the Commissioner review (including any party that did not elect to be part of the review), you can appeal the decision in the Family Court. The Court will hear the original case again. If the review officer decided the matter was “too complex”, and you were a party to the review (not the subject parent) you can apply to the Family Court for a departure order. If there’s a new ground or matter not considered by the review officer, or a change of circumstances since the last review, you can apply to Inland Revenue for an administrative review. A liable parent cannot apply for an exemption review. If they want a new matter, or circumstances not taken into account in the exemption review, considered, they can apply for an administrative review. For information about how to apply for a departure order or lodge an appeal, read our guide Helping you to understand child support and the Family Court - IR174. Disclosing information from the review It is unlawful to discuss or pass on information provided by any party in a review or any information contained in the review decision. The only exceptions are, for example, if you’re seeking advice from your lawyer or providing information for a Family Court proceeding where the parties are the same as in the review. Inland Revenue or the Family Court has to approve any other request to disclose information from a review.

Gaming machine duty (GMD) is a duty payable on the "gaming machine profits" that an organisation takes from its gaming machines. It's charged at 20% of the profits. Which machines are gaming machines? A gaming machine is any machine or device that is adapted, designed or constructed for use in gambling. It doesn't include: • a device used only to draw a lottery • a random selection device used for housie • a device used only to dispense tickets that can't be used to decide the outcome of gambling • a communication device that is used both to dispense tickets in and draw a lottery that is a sales promotion scheme. Who must pay GMD? All gaming machine operators must pay GMD. This includes: • any society licensed to operate gaming machines under the Gambling Act 2003 • any person who operates a gaming machine, but isn't licensed under the Gambling Act 2003. GAMING MACHINE DUTY 4 What to do if you're liable for GMD You must register as a gaming machine operator. Complete a Gaming machine duty-registration (IR181) form online at www.ird.govt.nz or download and complete this form. Post your completed registration to the nearest address on page 17. If you're registering a new club, society or trust, you'll also need to complete the IRD number application-non-individual (IR596) form. You can download a copy of this form from www.ird.govt.nz or order one by calling 0800 257 773. Your IRD number is preprinted on all the returns and forms we send you. Please quote this number whenever you contact us. Problem gambling levy Problem gambling levy (PGL) is payable on gaming machine profits and is charged at 0.78% plus GST. For further information about the development, management and delivery of the problem gambling strategy, contact the Ministry of Health or visit www.moh.govt.nz Record keeping You must keep full records of all the GMD you pay. Your records must be in English, unless we give you written authority to keep them in another language. You're required to keep your records for seven years. If we're currently auditing or have contacted you about auditing your records, we may ask you to keep them for a further three years. 5 www.ird.govt.nz Part 2 - Calculating the duty How GMD is calculated If you're a gaming machine operator you must calculate and pay GMD for each calendar month. GMD is calculated on each machine's gaming machine profit. Gaming machine profit (GMP) is calculated for a given period as follows: The increase in metered turnover lessthe increase in metered total wins lessjackpot prizes awarded (if these aren't included in metered total wins) plus or minusrequired adjustments equalsgaming machine profits All gaming machines are connected to an electronic monitoring system (EMS). The EMS will show the following: • the amount of money gambled on gaming machines • the amount required to be banked • the location and number of machines • gaming machine usage • machine faults and tampering. GMD is calculated at 20% of all gaming machine profits and PGL is calculated at 0.78% of all gaming machine profits plus GST. If your organisation is registered for GST, GMD and PGL must be calculated on gaming machine profits which are GST-inclusive. Turnover means the total amount of all bets made on a gaming machine during the return period (this is the amount of money gambled on gaming machines). Total wins means the total amount of all prizes paid from a gaming machine from all games during the return period. This includes individual game wins, but doesn't include wins awarded by a linked jackpot system. GAMING MACHINE DUTY 6 Linked jackpot systems are of two basic types: • downloadable and • non-downloadable. In both cases, wins awarded by these systems are recorded by the relevant EMS reports separately from "Total wins". If, for any reason, a prize awarded by a gaming machine or jackpot system hasn't been paid out to a player, the amount won must not be included in the calculation of GMP. This can happen for example, when payment is refused on the grounds that the player is under-age, or the win has occurred as a result of faults or malfunctions of gambling equipment. Gaming machine profit is calculated using the Department of Internal Affairs report, The Gaming Machine - Monthly Meters plus Adjustments for Month Report. EMS produces a specific report at calendar monthly intervals to help calculate taxes and levies. This is the Monthly Venue Activity - Society Level (7.2.10) report. It's generated within 5 days of the end of the month. The report includes all relevant data to determine the amount of gaming machine profits for the preceding monthly period. Use this report to fill in the gaming machine profits section of your Gaming machine duty (IR680) return. For more help If you need assistance in: • interpreting EMS reports • knowing when a GMP adjustment needs to be made • calculating your gaming machine profits contact your nearest Department of Internal Affairs Gambling Compliance office. All gambling compliance staff can be contacted by phoning 0800 257 887. EMS reports are available to registered users at www.dia.govt.nz (search keywords: Electronic Monitoring System (EMS)) then choose EMS reporting login. For problems accessing the reports, please contact helpdesk@intralot.co.nz or phone 0800 468 725. For general information on gaming machines, go to www.dia.govt.nz 7 www.ird.govt.nz Part 3 - Paperwork and payments Filing returns You must file a Gaming machine duty (IR680) return and pay the duty each month. We'll send you an IR680 before the due date each month or you can complete your return at www.ird.govt.nz You can apply for a return period that ends within seven days either side of the last day of the month, if this will help you to coordinate your internal month- end accounting system. Paying the duty You must send us your return and payment by the 20th of the month following the month in which the gaming machine profits were collected. For example, the return and payment for July 2019 are due on 20 August 2019. If the due date falls on the weekend or public holiday you can make your payment on the next working day without penalty. If you made a loss or didn't operate your gaming machine during the month, you must still file a "nil" return. Losses can't be carried forward because the gaming machine profit can't be less than zero. Completing the IR680 We send you an IR680 automatically about three weeks before your payment is due. It shows these preprinted details: • your name and address • your IRD number • the period the IR680 covers • the due date for payment. There's an example of an IR680 on page 9, showing the preprinted details and the information you need to fill in. Once you've completed it, tear off the bottom (pink) part and send it to us with your payment by the due date. Keep the top (white) part for your records. GAMING MACHINE DUTY 8 Keep the top part for your records. Send the pink part to Inland Revenue.

The bottom portion will be a tax invoice showing the GST content of PGL. If we reassess an assessment, this will either be a debit or credit note. If your organisation is registered for GST, you must include this information in your GST return. Statement of account We’ll send you a statement of account if you don’t pay the full amount owing. The statement has a payment section at the bottom. Please use this to pay the amount shown as owing. If you can’t make the payment by the due date, call us on 0800 377 771. If the statement is showing an overpayment, you need to contact us to request either a refund or a transfer to another period or tax type. We also send a statement after certain transactions, such as: • a transfer from another tax type (eg GST or PAYE) or account • a back-period adjustment • if you make a payment without any IR680 details. You can also request a statement of account at any time to keep you up-to- date with the duty paid on your account. Call us on 0800 377 774 - for service times see page 16. Not all transactions are shown on a statement, for example, penalties that have been charged and then reversed. Credits of less than $5 are rolled forward to the next period. If you disagree On occasions you may disagree with our views or actions. You should use Inland Revenue’s disputes resolution process if you: • think an adjustment or assessment is wrong, or • disagree with our Notice of proposed adjustment (IR770). There are rules and time limits governing this process. For more information read our factsheet If you disagree with an assessment (IR778). 11 www.ird.govt.nz If you don’t send in a return or pay the duty If you don’t file your return by the due date, we’ll issue an assessment charging you an estimate of your amount payable. This is known as a default assessment. You are legally required to pay the default assessment and you must still file your return. Late payment penalties and interest will be charged on the estimated amount if it isn’t paid. When you send us your completed return, we’ll replace the default assessment with the actual assessment worked out from your return. You’ll have to pay any tax owing from your actual assessment, including any penalties and interest that apply. If you don’t pay your GMD and PGL, we’ll recover the amount from whoever is legally liable for your organisation’s debts. By law, the officers, trustees, other managers or members of an organisation are jointly and severally liable for any GMD and PGL unpaid by the organisation. We can also recover unpaid amounts from a third party who owes you money. This means the third party will make the payments to us instead of to you until the amount is paid. Income tax If you’re licensed to operate gaming machines, all income from gross gambling proceeds is exempt from income tax. To calculate your gross gambling proceeds take your: turnover plusinterest or other investment return on the turnover plusproceeds from the sale of fittings, chattels and gambling equipment purchases from the turnover or investment return lessprizes equalsgross gambling proceeds If your only source of income is from gross gambling proceeds, you’ll automatically qualify for an exemption from income tax. If this situation applies to you, let us know so we don’t send you any income tax returns. GAMING MACHINE DUTY 12 If you receive other income, only the income from gross gambling proceeds will be exempt from income tax. In this case you’ll need to file an income tax return, unless you have an exemption from us. GST (goods and services tax) If your taxable supplies (including gaming machine revenue) have exceeded or are expected to exceed $60,000 in any 12-month period, you are required to register for GST. Even if your organisation is exempt from income tax, the exemption doesn’t apply to GST. If your organisation isn’t registered for GST, but may need to be, read our factsheet GST - do you need to register? (IR365). GST is paid on gaming machine revenue. Gaming machine revenue for GST purposes is calculated in the same way as gaming machine profit for GMD - see page 6. The Gaming Machine - Monthly Meters plus Adjustments Report should be prepared on a monthly-calendar cycle which coincides with the last day of your taxable periods for GST purposes. This means that the report prepared for the months during your taxable periods can be used to calculate the gaming machine revenue. Problem gambling levy In your GST returns, you may claim back the GST on PGL. We’ll send you a tax invoice so that you have the necessary documentation to do this. We’ll also send you a credit note if we reassess a period that reduces PGL, or a debit note if we increase an earlier assessment. The rules about when you may make claims depend on the GST accounting basis you are registered for. For more information about accounting for GST, see our GST guide (IR375). 13 www.ird.govt.nz If you stop operating gaming machines If you are ceasing operations for a few months of the year, you must file “nil” returns for the months that your machines do not operate. However, if you stop operating permanently, please send a letter with your final return telling us when you stopped operating, along with disposal details of the gaming machines. If Internal Affairs cancels your licence as an operator or refuses to renew it, you must file a final return by the due date. Late payment We may charge you a late payment penalty if you miss a payment or it’s late. We’ll also charge you interest if you don’t make your tax payment by the due date. Call us if you can’t pay your tax by the due date. We’ll look at your payment options, which may include an instalment arrangement depending on your circumstances.

Gaming machine duty (GMD) is a duty payable on the "gaming machine profits" that an organisation takes from its gaming machines. It's charged at 20% of the profits. Which machines are gaming machines? A gaming machine is any machine or device that is adapted, designed or constructed for use in gambling. It does not include: • a device used only to draw a lottery • a random selection device used for housie • a device used only to dispense tickets that can not be used to decide the outcome of gambling • a communication device that is used both to dispense tickets in and draw a lottery that is a sales promotion scheme. Who must pay GMD? All gaming machine operators must pay GMD. This includes: • any society licensed to operate gaming machines under the Gambling Act 2003 • any person who operates a gaming machine, but is not licensed under the Gambling Act 2003. GAMING MACHINE DUTY 4 What to do if you're liable for GMD If you have to pay GMD, you should register as a gaming machine operator through myIR. Make sure you have your gaming machine license number and site number (if this applies). If you're registering a new club, society or trust, you can do this online - ird.govt.nz/managing-my-tax/ird-numbers, or you can complete a IRD number application – resident non-individual - IR596. You can get copies of our forms and guides at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Problem gambling levy Problem gambling levy (PGL) is payable on gaming machine profits and is charged at 1.08% plus GST. For further information about the development, management and delivery of the problem gambling strategy, contact the Ministry of Health or visit www.moh.govt.nz Record keeping You must keep full records of all the GMD you pay. If we audit you, we may check these records. Records must be in English or Māori, unless we've given you written authority to keep them in another language. You need to keep these records for at least 7 years. 5 Part 2 - Calculating the duty How GMD is calculated If you're a gaming machine operator you must calculate and pay GMD for each calendar month. GMD is calculated on each machine's gaming machine profit. Gaming machine profit (GMP) is calculated for a given period as follows: The increase in metered turnover lessthe increase in metered total wins lessjackpot prizes awarded (if these are not included in metered total wins) plus or minusrequired adjustments equalsgaming machine profits All gaming machines are connected to an electronic monitoring system (EMS). The EMS will show the following: • the amount of money gambled on gaming machines • the amount required to be banked • the location and number of machines • gaming machine usage • machine faults and tampering. GMD is calculated at 20% of all gaming machine profits and PGL is calculated at 1.08% of all gaming machine profits plus GST. If your organisation is registered for GST, GMD and PGL must be calculated on gaming machine profits which are GST-inclusive. Turnover means the total amount of all bets made on a gaming machine during the return period (this is the amount of money gambled on gaming machines). Total wins means the total amount of all prizes paid from a gaming machine from all games during the return period. This includes individual game wins, but does not include wins awarded by a linked jackpot system. GAMING MACHINE DUTY 6 Linked jackpot systems are of two basic types: • downloadable and • non-downloadable. In both cases, wins awarded by these systems are recorded by the relevant EMS reports separately from "Total wins". If, for any reason, a prize awarded by a gaming machine or jackpot system has not been paid out to a player, the amount won must not be included in the calculation of GMP. This can happen for example, when payment is refused on the grounds that the player is under-age, or the win has occurred as a result of faults or malfunctions of gambling equipment. Gaming machine profit is calculated using the Department of Internal Affairs report, The Gaming Machine - Monthly Meters plus Adjustments for Month Report. EMS produces a specific report at calendar monthly intervals to help calculate taxes and levies. This is the Monthly Venue Activity - Society Level (7.2.10) report. It's generated within 5 days of the end of the month. The report includes all relevant data to determine the amount of gaming machine profits for the preceding monthly period. Use this report to fill in the gaming machine profits section of your Gaming machine duty - IR680 return. For more help If you need assistance in: • interpreting EMS reports • knowing when a GMP adjustment needs to be made • calculating your gaming machine profits contact your nearest Department of Internal Affairs Gambling Compliance office. All gambling compliance staff can be contacted by phoning 0800 257 887. EMS reports are available to registered users at www.dia.govt.nz (search keywords: Electronic Monitoring System (EMS)) then choose EMS reporting login. For problems accessing the reports, please contact helpdesk@intralot.co.nz or phone 0800 468 725. For general information on gaming machines, go to www.dia.govt.nz 7 Part 3 - Paperwork and payments Filing returns You must file your return and pay the duty each month, this can be done via myIR or a return will be sent to you. You can apply for a return period that ends within seven days either side of the last day of the month, if this will help you to coordinate your internal month- end accounting system. Paying the duty You must send us your return and payment by the 20th of the month following the month in which the gaming machine profits were collected. For example, the return and payment for July 2022 are due on 20 August 2022. If the due date falls on the weekend or public holiday you can make your payment on the next working day without penalty. If you made a loss or did not operate your gaming machine during the month, you must still file a "nil" return. Losses can not be carried forward because the gaming machine profit can not be less than zero. Completing the IR680 Complete your return via myIR or with the return you have been sent. There's an example of an IR680 on page 9, showing the pre-printed details and the information you need to fill in. Once you've completed it, tear off the bottom (pink) part and send it to us by the due date. Keep the top (white) part for your records GAMING MACHINE DUTY 8 Keep the top part for your records.

If your organisation is registered for GST, you must include this information in your GST return. If you disagree On occasions you may disagree with our views or actions.

For more information read our factsheet If you disagree with an assessment - IR778. 11 If you do not pay the duty If you do not pay your GMD and PGL, we’ll recover the amount from whoever is legally liable for your organisation’s debts. By law, the officers, trustees, other managers or members of an organisation are jointly and severally liable for any GMD and PGL unpaid by the organisation. We can also recover unpaid amounts from a third party who owes you money. This means the third party will make the payments to us instead of to you until the amount is paid. Income tax If you’re licensed to operate gaming machines, all income from gross gambling proceeds is exempt from income tax. To calculate your gross gambling proceeds take your: turnover plusinterest or other investment return on the turnover plusproceeds from the sale of fittings, chattels and gambling equipment purchases from the turnover or investment return lessprizes equalsgross gambling proceeds “If your only source of income is from gross gambling proceeds, you’ll automatically qualify for an exemption from income tax. If this situation applies to you, let us know so we don’t send you any income tax returns. If you receive other income, only the income from gross gambling proceeds will be exempt from income tax. In this case you’ll need to file an income tax return, unless you have an exemption from us.” GAMING MACHINE DUTY 12 GST (goods and services tax) If your taxable supplies (including gaming machine revenue) have exceeded or are expected to exceed $60,000 in any 12-month period, you are required to register for GST.

If your organisation is not registered for GST, but may need to be, read our factsheet GST - do you need to register IR365. GST is paid on gaming machine revenue. Gaming machine revenue for GST purposes is calculated in the same way as gaming machine profit for GMD - see page 6. The Gaming Machine - Monthly Meters plus Adjustments Report should be prepared on a monthly-calendar cycle which coincides with the last day of your taxable periods for GST purposes. This means that the report prepared for the months during your taxable periods can be used to calculate the gaming machine revenue. Problem gambling levy In your GST returns, you may claim back the GST on PGL. We’ll send you a tax invoice so that you have the necessary documentation to do this. We’ll also send you a credit note if we reassess a period that reduces PGL, or a debit note if we increase an earlier assessment. The rules about when you may make claims depend on the GST accounting basis you are registered for. For more information about accounting for GST, see our GST guide - IR375. 13 If you stop operating gaming machines If you are ceasing operations for a few months of the year, you must file “nil” returns for the months that your machines do not operate. If you stop operating permanently. You can send a message through myIR to do this or by letter with your final return and tell us • when you stopped operating • disposal details of the gaming machines If Internal Affairs cancels your licence as an operator or refuses to renew it, you must file a final return by the due date.

Child support Turuki Tamariki ird.govt.nz/childsupport The information in this document was current at the time of publication. Refer to our website for the most up-to-date information. IR198 | July 2023 This factsheet gives an overview of child support. It includes general information for parents, or any person caring for a child who is not their own. What is child support? Child support is paid by parents who do not live with their children, or who share the care of their children with another person. Sometimes, children may be cared for by someone other than parents, such as grandparents, other family members, or Oranga Tamariki—Ministry for Children. In these cases, both parents may pay child support. Child support aims to ensure that: • children are financially supported • both parents take financial responsibility for their children • child support payments are regular and on time. How child support works Parents and carers can make their own arrangements for child support - Inland Revenue does not need to be involved. If parents and carers can agree on an amount of child support, but still want us to be involved, they can register a voluntary agreement. This means we’ll collect the child support and pass it on, at an amount agreed by the carer and liable parent. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/childsupport/types/voluntaryagreement or Registration of voluntary agreement for child support - IR102 form. If parents and carers cannot agree, we’ll use a formula to calculate child support. Either parent, or any non-parent carer who cares for a child 35% or more of the time, can apply for a child support formula assessment. If a carer receives an unsupported child’s benefit from Work and Income, they’ll complete a child support application as part of the benefit application process. Inland Revenue will assess and collect any child support payable. The formula assessment uses the income of both parents and subtracts amounts for personal living costs and any other children in the parent’s care. It also takes into account the care each parent provides for the children. The formula assessment works on the basis that children should receive the amount of financial support they would have if they lived together with both parents. Using the formula, we calculate monthly amounts and advise the: • liable parent how much they need to pay • receiving carer how much they're entitled to receive. We collect payments from the liable parent and pass them on to the: • receiving carer to help with the costs of looking after the child, or • government, if the receiving carer is receiving an unsupported child’s benefit. To qualify for child support, the child must be: • under 18 years of age or 18 years of age and enrolled at and attending a registered school in New Zealand or an overseas school. If a child is 18 and still at school, then child support ends on the 31st of December of the year they turn 18 • a New Zealand citizen or "ordinarily resident" in New Zealand • not married, in a de facto relationship or civil union • not financially independent. That is, not working more than 30 hours a week on average or receiving a benefit or student allowance. ird.govt.nz/childsupport The information in this document was current at the time of publication.

For a parent to be made liable to pay child support, the parent must be: • a New Zealand citizen, or “ordinarily resident” in New Zealand or • the resident of a country that we have a child support agreement with. Note: New Zealand has a child support agreement with Australia. If a child and carer live in Australia and the carer wants to receive child support, they must apply in Australia. Child support is not: • a process to decide who is a parent, or the care and contact arrangements for children. For help with these matters, contact your lawyer, Community Law Centre, local Family Court, or Citizens Advice Bureau • paid direct to children - payments are made to the receiving carer • Working for Families Tax Credits - see Working and raising a family - IR201 How to contact us If you need to contact us, including from overseas, go to ird.govt.nz/contactus Where to find more information If you would like more information about child support, go to ird.govt.nz/childsupport This site offers general child support information.

Family tax credit This payment depends on how much you earn, how many dependent children you have, and any shared care arrangements. You may not qualify for this payment if you receive a Foster Care Allowance, Orphans' Benefit, Unsupported Child's Benefit, parent's allowance or board payments from Oranga Tamariki– Ministry for Children. This is the most you can get each week from 1 April 2024: Number of childrenWeekly rate Eldest child$144.00 Subsequent child$117.00 Work and Income can pay the family tax credit to families receiving a benefit. In-work tax credit The in-work tax credit pays up to $97 a week for families with up to 3 children, and up to an extra $15 weekly for each additional child. This is a payment for families who are normally in paid work. You’ll keep receiving the in-work tax credit payments for up to 2 weeks during an unpaid break from work. For example, changing jobs, leaving employment, or unpaid time such as school holidays. If you or your partner start receiving a main benefit or student allowance, your payments will stop. Go to ird.govt.nz/working-for-families to find out more. 4 Minimum family tax credit If your family income is $35,316 or less a year after tax, you may be able to get the minimum family tax credit. This payment tops up your family’s income to at least $679 a week after tax. To get this payment, at least 1 parent must be working the required hours for salary or wages. A single parent must be working at least 20 hours a week and in a 2-parent family, 1 or both parents must be working at least 30 hours a week between them.

Payment starts at $73 a week, per child, for the first year (up to $3,838 per year) regardless of the family income. For the second and third year of the child’s life the $73 per week is reduced when the family income exceeds $79,000 in each of these years. You can not receive the Best Start and paid parental leave payments at the same time. If you register for both, your Best Start will start after your paid parental leave payments stop.

OFFICE USE ONLY 30 Correspondence indicator Notes to help you complete the Adjust your income IR215 form - 2015 onwards For more information and for assistance with completing the form for 2014 and prior years, go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: adjust your income). 4 Passive income of children Passive income includes interest, dividends, beneficiary income and rents. For a complete list of income types, go to our website (search keywords: passive income of children). If your child/children received more than $500 of passive income during the year, enter the amount over $500 at Question 4. If you share care of a child/children, divide the amount above $500 equally between yourself and the other caregiver(s). Example: Mary is the principal caregiver for two children, Jane and Mark, and receives WfFTC. Jane receives $900 interest and Mark receives $200 interest. Mary will have to add the amount over $500 ($400) of Jane's interest to her family income for WfFTC. Because Mark's interest is under $500, Mary doesn't need to tell us about it. 5 Income of non-resident spouse If your spouse, civil union or de facto partner isn't a New Zealand tax resident, we require their foreign-sourced income to be included as part of your family income for WfFTC. Enter the total amount of their income, in NZ dollars, in Question 5. We may ask you to confirm details of their income. If you need more information about tax residency in New Zealand, please go to our website (search keywords: tax residency). 6 Other payments - monetary payments received to help with household expenses You and your spouse or partner may receive monetary payments from another person or entity to help out with your family's household expenses. If these payments add up to more than $5,000 in a year, you need to tell us. Example: Jill's parents give her $100 a week towards her mortgage payments. The total amount over the year is $5,200. Because it's over $5,000, Jill enters $5,200 at Question 6. If the amount Jill received was $5,000 or less, Jill would leave Question 6 blank. Other payments are extra payments you generally receive from family or friends, to help with mortgage or other household expenses, eg, payments towards groceries, power or phone bills. It’s not your income, which you pay tax on. They can be paid to you or direct to a bank, service provider or agency on your behalf. 7 Retirement savings scheme contributions If a contribution is made to your retirement savings scheme on your behalf from which retirement scheme contribution tax has been withheld and you included that contribution in your tax return, enter the amount at Question 7. This may alter your WfFTC entitlement. 8 Depreciation recovered on sale of building used in businessand/or rental activity If you sold a building in the past year, show the amount of depreciation you've claimed for it in income years before 2004, unless the business income was a loss in the year the depreciation was claimed. Example: In this tax year Ben sold his commercial rental property. He recovered $100,000 depreciation from the sale. Ben claimed $60,000 depreciation in 2003 and earlier tax year's, and $40,000 between 2004 and 2011. He can adjust this years Working for Families income by $60,000 for the depreciation he claimed before 2004. Ben enters $60,000 at Question 8. 9 Non-resident foreign-sourced income If you're a non-resident student loan borrower, but you're considered to be physically present in New Zealand for student loan purposes, we need to know your foreign-sourced income at Question 9. Example: Sarah is a student loan borrower who earned $27,000 working overseas. Because we approved her application to be treated as physically present in New Zealand, Sarah must tell us about her overseas earnings. 10 Distributions from a trust - not beneficiary income If you received a distribution from a trust that wasn't beneficiary income, and you are not the settlor of the trust, it generally counts as income for student loans and WfFTC. Include the distribution at Question 10. Example: Matt is a beneficiary of a family trust that has a cash PIE investment. He receives a $2,000 distribution which he doesn't need to include in his tax return because the trust income was not taxable. Matt will have to include an adjustment for $2,000 for his student loan and WfFTC income by entering $2,000 at Question 10. 11 Employer-provided motor vehicles - when salary is exchanged for private use If you agreed to a lower salary in exchange for private use of an employer-provided motor vehicle, we consider the amount of salary you would have received without this arrangement as income for student loan and WfFTC purposes. Include the amount exchanged at Question 11. Don't include the value if the use of the vehicle is just part of the job. Example: Erin's employer offered her use of the work car and a $50,000 salary or a $58,000 salary and no private use of the work car. Erin chose to have use of the work car instead of the additional $8,000 salary, so she includes this as income for student loans and WfFTC. 12 Vouchers and other short-term charge facilities - provided by your employer If your employer provides a short-term charge facility, eg, a pre-loaded gift card, voucher, charge account or company credit card for your own use, we may consider the amount to be part of your income for student loans and WfFTC. It depends on the total value for the year. You only need to tell us if the total amount of all cards, accounts and vouchers goes over the smaller of the following thresholds: • $1,200 if your salar y or wages are $24,000 or more • 5% of your salar y or wages if you earn less than $24,000 a year. If above the threshold, you'll also need to add the FBT your employer(s) pay on this benefit. += AmountFBTEnter at Box 12 13 Non-locked-in portfolio investment entities (PIE) Enter the amount of: • income attributed from a PIE that gives you ready access to your investment (eg, a cash PIE, on-call PIE, PIE term deposit), or • dividends from listed PIEs, that you haven’t declared in your income tax assessment. Don't include KiwiSaver or any other locked-in super funds. 14 Certain pensions and annuities Enter 50% of the amount of tax-exempt annuities (a fixed figure that provides income) from life insurance policies and/or a pension from a superannuation fund you received in the tax year. Don't include NZ Super paid by Work and Income. 15 Distributions from retirement saving schemes or superannuation schemes Retirement savings schemes If you receive a distribution from a retirement savings scheme before you retire, you need to include it as part of your income for student loans and WfFTC if: • retirement scheme contribution tax was withheld from the contributions to the scheme, and • you w eren't eligible for NZ Super when you received the distribution. Superannuation schemes A distribution from a superannuation scheme is treated as income for student loans and WfFTC if: • the distrib ution wasn't from a KiwiSaver scheme or complying superannuation fund • your emplo yer made contributions in the tax year you received the distribution, or in either of the two previous years. You'll only need to include it if: • the distrib ution wasn't made because you retired, and • you continued to work for the employer for at least one month after you received the distribution. You don't need to include any distribution of contributions that you made for either schemes. 16 Tax-exempt overseas pensions If you receive NZ Super and a tax-exempt overseas pension, include the pension amount as an income adjustment. You don't need to tell us the amount of your overseas pension if you pay all your overseas pension to Work and Income and receive NZ Super in full. 17 Tax-exempt income If you receive salary or wages that are exempt from New Zealand income tax under specific international agreements, we treat this as income for student loans and WfFTC. Go to our website for a list of tax-exempt salary and wages. 18 Income from a retirement savings or superannuation scheme PIE declared in your tax return If you've included income attributed from a PIE, that is a superannuation fund or a retirement savings scheme, in your IR3 return, you can exclude it from your income for student loans and WfFTC by entering the amount at Question 18. 19 Attr ibutable trustee income If you're the settlor of a trust, we may treat some or all of the income the trust receives (that isn't distributed as beneficiary income) as income for calculating student loan repayment obligations and WfFTC entitlements. Include this amount at Question 19. Use the following formula to calculate the amount of trustee income: Trust's income 1 = attributable trustee income Number of settlors If the trust has a controlling interest in a company, you'll also need to include the company's income. ( Trust's shares ) × ( company's 1 total income − dividends ) = company income Company shares Add the company income to the trust's income to determine the attributable trustee income. 20 Attributable fringe benefits If you are a shareholder-employee in a company where you and any associated persons hold 50% or more of the voting interests, the total value of attributable fringe benefits received is treated as income for student loan and WfFTC. Include the value of the attributed fringe benefits and the FBT payable at Question 20. Attributable fringe benefits are employer-provided: • motor v ehicles for private use • low/nil-interest employee loans • subsidised transport (when the employer is in the business of transporting the public) over $1,000 in value • contrib utions to insurance schemes, sickness, accident or death funds over $1,000 in value • any other benefi ts received over $2,000 in value. If you receive fringe benefits but you or your associates (eg, a family trust) aren't shareholder-employees of the company you work for, you don't need to include the fringe benefits in your income. 21 Loss(es) that wer e offset against income from another activity If you have a loss from running a business, making investments or a rental property, we won't include it in the calculation to work out your student loan and WfFTC entitlements/obligations. You only need to tell us the amount of a loss if you have: • made a loss and profi t from two or more unrelated businesses or investment activities, and • enter ed the net amount in only one box on your IR3 return. Example: Angela's IR3 return shows income from her farming business of $60,000 (self-employment) and a loss from renting out commercial buildings of $25,000. If Angela declared the income and loss in separate boxes in her IR3 (eg, self-employment and rents) she doesn't need to tell us. We'll automatically treat the loss as nil. But, if she declared the net amount in one box, eg, self-employment income of $35,000, Angela needs to tell us about the $25,000 loss by entering $25,000 at Question 21. 22 Income equalisation main scheme deposits An y deposit made this income year, by you,into your individual income equalisation main scheme account (the scheme which allows eligible farming, fishing or forestry customers to even fluctuations in income by spreading their gross income from year to year), needs to be added back to your income for student loan and WfFTC if you claimed a deduction for it in your tax return.

Keep a copy for your records. OFFICE USE ONLY 29 Correspondence indicator Notes to help you complete the Adjust your income - IR215 form - 2015 onwards For more information and for assistance with completing the form for 2014 and prior years, go to ird.govt.nz/adjust-income 4 Passive income of children Passive income includes interest, dividends, beneficiary income and rents. For a complete list of income types, go to ird.govt.nz/income-types If your child/ children received more than $500 of passive income during the year, enter the amount over $500 at Question 4. If you share care of a child/children, divide the amount above $500 equally between yourself and the other caregiver(s). Example: Mary is the principal caregiver for two children, Jane and Mark, and receives WfFTC. Jane receives $900 interest and Mark receives $200 interest. Mary will have to add the amount over $500 ($400) of Jane's interest to her family income for WfFTC. Because Mark's interest is under $500, Mary doesn't need to tell us about it. 5 Income of non-resident spouse If your spouse, civil union or de facto partner isn't a New Zealand tax resident, we require their foreign-sourced income to be included as part of your family income for WfFTC. Enter the total amount of their income, in NZ dollars, in Question 5. We may ask you to confirm details of their income. If you need more information about tax residency in New Zealand, please go to ird.govt.nz/tax-residency 6 Other payments - monetary payments received to help with household expenses You and your spouse or partner may receive monetary payments from another person or entity to help out with your family's household expenses. If these payments add up to more than $5,000 in a year, you need to tell us. Example: Jill's parents give her $100 a week towards her mortgage payments. The total amount over the year is $5,200. Because it's over $5,000, Jill enters $5,200 at Question 6. If the amount Jill received was $5,000 or less, Jill would leave Question 6 blank. Other payments are extra payments you generally receive from family or friends, to help with mortgage or other household expenses, eg, payments towards groceries, power or phone bills. It’s not your income, which you pay tax on. They can be paid to you or direct to a bank, service provider or agency on your behalf. 7 Retirement savings scheme contributions If a contribution is made to your retirement savings scheme on your behalf from which retirement scheme contribution tax has been withheld and you included that contribution in your tax return, enter the amount at Question 7. This may alter your WfFTC entitlement. 8 Depreciation recovered on sale of building used in businessand/or rental activity If you sold a building in the past year, show the amount of depreciation you've claimed for it in income years before 2004, unless the business income was a loss in the year the depreciation was claimed. Example: In this tax year Ben sold his commercial rental property. He recovered $100,000 depreciation from the sale. Ben claimed $60,000 depreciation in 2003 and earlier tax year's, and $40,000 between 2004 and 2011. He can adjust this years Working for Families income by $60,000 for the depreciation he claimed before 2004. Ben enters $60,000 at Question 8. 9 Distributions from a trust - not beneficiary income If you received a distribution from a trust that wasn't beneficiary income, and you are not the settlor of the trust, it generally counts as income for student loans and WfFTC. Include the distribution at Question 9. Example: Matt is a beneficiary of a family trust that has a cash PIE investment. He receives a $2,000 distribution which he doesn't need to include in his tax return because the trust income was not taxable. Matt will have to include an adjustment for $2,000 for his student loan and WfFTC income by entering $2,000 at Question 9. 10 Employer-provided motor vehicles - when salary is exchanged for private use If you agreed to a lower salary in exchange for private use of an employer-provided motor vehicle, we consider the amount of salary you would have received without this arrangement as income for student loan and WfFTC purposes. Include the amount exchanged at Question 10. Don't include the value if the use of the vehicle is just part of the job. Example: Erin's employer offered her use of the work car and a $50,000 salary or a $58,000 salary and no private use of the work car. Erin chose to have use of the work car instead of the additional $8,000 salary, so she includes this as income for student loans and WfFTC. 11 Vouchers and other short-term charge facilities - provided by your employer If your employer provides a short-term charge facility, eg, a pre-loaded gift card, voucher, charge account or company credit card for your own use, we may consider the amount to be part of your income for student loans and WfFTC. It depends on the total value for the year. You only need to tell us if the total amount of all cards, accounts and vouchers goes over the smaller of the following thresholds: • $1,200 if your salary or wages are $24,000 or more • 5% of your salary or wages if you earn less than $24,000 a year. If above the threshold, you'll also need to add the FBT your employer(s) pay on this benefit. += AmountFBTEnter at Box 11 12 Non-locked-in portfolio investment entities (PIE) Enter the amount of: • income attributed from a PIE that gives you ready access to your investment (eg, a cash PIE, on-call PIE, PIE term deposit), or • dividends from listed PIEs, that you haven’t declared in your income tax assessment. Don't include KiwiSaver or any other locked-in super funds. 13 Certain pensions and annuities Enter 50% of the amount of tax-exempt annuities (a fixed figure that provides income) from life insurance policies and/or a pension from a superannuation fund you received in the tax year. Don't include NZ Super paid by Work and Income. 14 Distributions from retirement saving schemes or superannuation schemes Retirement savings schemes If you receive a distribution from a retirement savings scheme before you retire, you need to include it as part of your income for student loans and WfFTC if: • retirement scheme contribution tax was withheld from the contributions to the scheme, and • you weren't eligible for NZ Super when you received the distribution. Superannuation schemes A distribution from a superannuation scheme is treated as income for student loans and WfFTC if: • the distribution wasn't from a KiwiSaver scheme or complying superannuation fund • your employer made contributions in the tax year you received the distribution, or in either of the two previous years. You'll only need to include it if: • the distribution wasn't made because you retired, and • you continued to work for the employer for at least one month after you received the distribution. You don't need to include any distribution of contributions that you made for either schemes. 15 Tax-exempt overseas pensions If you receive NZ Super and a tax-exempt overseas pension, include the pension amount as an income adjustment. You don't need to tell us the amount of your overseas pension if you pay all your overseas pension to Work and Income and receive NZ Super in full. 16 Tax-exempt income If you receive salary or wages that are exempt from New Zealand income tax under specific international agreements, we treat this as income for student loans and WfFTC. Go to our website for a list of tax-exempt salary and wages. 17 Income from a retirement savings or superannuation scheme PIE declared in your tax return If you've included income attributed from a PIE, that is a superannuation fund or a retirement savings scheme, in your IR3 return, you can exclude it from your income for student loans and WfFTC by entering the amount at Question 17. 18 Attributable trustee income If you're the settlor of a trust, we may treat some or all of the income the trust receives (that isn't distributed as beneficiary income) as income for calculating student loan repayment obligations and WfFTC entitlements. Include this amount at Question 18. Use the following formula to calculate the amount of trustee income: Trust's income 1 =attributable trustee income Number of settlors If the trust has a controlling interest in a company, you'll also need to include the company's income. ( Trust's shares ) × ( company's 1 total income −dividends ) =company income Company shares Add the company income to the trust's income to determine the attributable trustee income. 19 Attributable fringe benefits If you are a shareholder-employee in a company where you and any associated persons hold 50% or more of the voting interests, the total value of attributable fringe benefits received is treated as income for student loan and WfFTC. Include the value of the attributed fringe benefits and the FBT payable at Question 19. Attributable fringe benefits are employer-provided: • motor vehicles for private use • low/nil-interest employee loans • subsidised transport (when the employer is in the business of transporting the public) over $1,000 in value • contributions to insurance schemes, sickness, accident or death funds over $1,000 in value • any other benefits received over $2,000 in value. If you receive fringe benefits but you or your associates (eg, a family trust) aren't shareholder-employees of the company you work for, you don't need to include the fringe benefits in your income. 20 Loss(es) that were offset against income from another activity If you have a loss from running a business, making investments or a rental property, we won't include it in the calculation to work out your student loan and WfFTC entitlements/obligations. You only need to tell us the amount of a loss if you have: • made a loss and profit from two or more unrelated businesses or investment activities, and • entered the net amount in only one box on your IR3 return. Example: Angela's IR3 return shows income from her farming business of $60,000 (self-employment) and a loss from renting out commercial buildings of $25,000. If Angela declared the income and loss in separate boxes in her IR3 (eg, self-employment and rents) she doesn't need to tell us. We'll automatically treat the loss as nil. But, if she declared the net amount in one box, eg, self-employment income of $35,000, Angela needs to tell us about the $25,000 loss by entering $25,000 at Question 20. 21 Income equalisation main scheme deposits Any deposit made this income year, by you,into your individual income equalisation main scheme account (the scheme which allows eligible farming, fishing or forestry customers to even fluctuations in income by spreading their gross income from year to year), needs to be added back to your income for student loan and WfFTC if you claimed a deduction for it in your tax return. Do this by entering the amount of the deposit at Question 21. 22 Income equalisation main scheme refunds Refunds from your income equalisation main scheme are included as income in your tax return but not included for student loan and WfFTC income. Enter the amount of any refund you received (excluding interest earned on the deposit) at Question 22 and we will reduce your income for student loan and WfFTC. Do not include refunds from the adverse event income equalisation scheme and thinning operations. 23 - 25 Attributed income of a major shareholder in a close company If you're a major shareholder in a close company on the last day of the company's income year, you may need to include company income for student loans and WfFTC. We'll need the following information to calculate the adjustment: Question 23 - company's net total income 1 for the company's income year Question 24 - percentage of shares you held in the company on the last day of the company's income year Question 25 - total dividends paid by the company for the company's income year Note: If you're a major shareholder in more than one close company, you'll need to do separate calculations for each company. 26 - 28 Attributed dependent child/children's income of a major shareholder in a close company If you receive WfFTC, you also have to include the attributed income of any dependent children who have a voting interest in a company (whether you hold any voting interests in that same company or not). Please give us the following information: Question 26 - company's net total income 1 (gross income less expenses) for the company's income year Question 27 - percentage of shares your dependent child/children held in the company on the last day of the company's income year Question 28 - total dividends paid by the company for the company's income year. Note: If you're a major shareholder in more than one close company, you'll need to do separate calculations for each company. 1. The trust's income, company's total income or company's total net income must be adjusted to include the full amount of any refunds or deposits to the main income equalisation scheme in order to reverse its effect.

For a complete list of income types, go to ird.govt.nz/income-types If your child/ children received more than $500 of passive income during the year, enter the amount over $500 at Question 4. If you share care of a child/children, divide the amount above $500 equally between yourself and the other caregiver(s). Example: Mary is the principal caregiver for two children, Jane and Mark, and receives WfFTC. Jane receives $900 interest and Mark receives $200 interest. Mary will have to add the amount over $500 ($400) of Jane's interest to her family income for WfFTC. Because Mark's interest is under $500, Mary doesn't need to tell us about it. 5 Income of non-resident spouse If your spouse, civil union or de facto partner isn't a New Zealand tax resident, we require their foreign-sourced income to be included as part of your family income for WfFTC. Enter the total amount of their income, in NZ dollars, in Question 5. We may ask you to confirm details of their income. If you need more information about tax residency in New Zealand, please go to ird.govt.nz/tax-residency 6 Other payments - monetary payments received to help with household expenses You and your spouse or partner may receive monetary payments from another person or entity to help out with your family's household expenses. If these payments add up to more than $5,000 in a year, you need to tell us. Example: Jill's parents give her $100 a week towards her mortgage payments. The total amount over the year is $5,200. Because it's over $5,000, Jill enters $5,200 at Question 6. If the amount Jill received was $5,000 or less, Jill would leave Question 6 blank. Other payments are extra payments you generally receive from family or friends, to help with mortgage or other household expenses, eg, payments towards groceries, power or phone bills. It’s not your income, which you pay tax on. They can be paid to you or direct to a bank, service provider or agency on your behalf. 7 Retirement savings scheme contributions If a taxed contribution is made to your retirement savings scheme or to Te Ru - nanga o Nga - i Tahu on your behalf, and you included the contribution in your income tax return, enter the amount at Question 7.

The amount cannot exceed the net income from the business or investment activity that had depreciation recovery income. Example: In this tax year Ben sold his commercial rental property. He recovered $100,000 depreciation from the sale. Ben claimed $60,000 depreciation in 2003 and earlier tax years, and $40,000 between 2004 and 2011. He can adjust this years income by $60,000 for the depreciation he claimed before 2004. Ben enters $60,000 at Question 8. This applies to WfFTCs and to student loans, but only applies to a student loan from the 2020-2021 tax year onwards. 9 Distributions from a trust - not beneficiary income If you received a distribution from a trust that wasn't beneficiary income, and you are not the settlor of the trust, it generally counts as income for student loans and WfFTC. Include the distribution at Question 9. Example: Matt is a beneficiary of a family trust that has a cash PIE investment. He receives a $2,000 distribution which he doesn't need to include in his tax return because the trust income was not taxable. Matt will have to include an adjustment for $2,000 for his student loan and WfFTC income by entering $2,000 at Question 9. 10 Employer-provided motor vehicles - when salary is exchanged for private use If you agreed to a lower salary in exchange for private use of an employer-provided motor vehicle, we consider the amount of salary you would have received without this arrangement as income for student loan and WfFTC purposes. Include the amount exchanged at Question 10. Don't include the value if the use of the vehicle is just part of the job. Example: Erin's employer offered her use of the work car and a $50,000 salary or a $58,000 salary and no private use of the work car. Erin chose to have use of the work car instead of the additional $8,000 salary, so she includes this as income for student loans and WfFTC. 11 Vouchers and other short-term charge facilities - provided by your employer If your employer provides a short-term charge facility, eg, a pre-loaded gift card, voucher, charge account or company credit card for your own use, we may consider the amount to be part of your income for student loans and WfFTC. It depends on the total value for the year. You only need to tell us if the total amount of all cards, accounts and vouchers goes over the smaller of the following thresholds: • $1,200 if your salary or wages are $24,000 or more • 5% of your salary or wages if you earn less than $24,000 a year.

Don't include NZ Super paid by Work and Income. 14 Distributions from retirement saving schemes or superannuation schemes Retirement savings schemes If you receive a distribution from a retirement savings scheme before you retire, you need to include it as part of your income for student loans and WfFTC if: • retirement scheme contribution tax was withheld from the contributions to the scheme, and • you weren't eligible for NZ Super when you received the distribution. Superannuation schemes A distribution from a superannuation scheme is treated as income for student loans and WfFTC if: • the distribution wasn't from a KiwiSaver scheme or complying superannuation fund • your employer made contributions in the tax year you received the distribution, or in either of the two previous years. You'll only need to include it if: • the distribution wasn't made because you retired, and • you continued to work for the employer for at least one month after you received the distribution. You don't need to include any distribution of contributions that you made for either schemes. 15 Tax-exempt overseas pensions If you receive NZ Super and a tax-exempt overseas pension, include the pension amount as an income adjustment. You don't need to tell us the amount of your overseas pension if you pay all your overseas pension to Work and Income and receive NZ Super in full. 16 Tax-exempt income If you receive salary or wages that are exempt from New Zealand income tax under specific international agreements, we treat this as income for student loans and WfFTC. Go to our website for a list of tax-exempt salary and wages. 17 Income from a retirement savings or superannuation scheme PIE declared in your tax return For 2019-2020 and previous tax years, if you've included income attributed from a PIE that is locked-in a superannuation fund or retirement savings scheme in your income tax return, you can exclude it from your income for student loans and WfFTC by entering the amount at Question 17. Generally, a locked-in PIE scheme is where you must reach a retirement age before you can access your funds. Most KiwiSaver schemes are locked in. If you are unsure check with your scheme. 18 Attributable trustee income If you're the settlor of a trust, we may treat some or all of the income the trust receives (that isn't distributed as beneficiary income) as income for calculating student loan repayment obligations and WfFTC entitlements. Include this amount at Question 18. Use the following formula to calculate the amount of trustee income: Trust's income 1 =attributable trustee income Number of settlors If the trust has a controlling interest in a company, you'll also need to include the company's income. ( Trust's shares ) × ( company's 1 total income −dividends ) =company income Company shares Add the company income to the trust's income to determine the attributable trustee income. 19 Attributable fringe benefits If you are a shareholder-employee in a company where you and any associated persons hold 50% or more of the voting interests, the total value of attributable fringe benefits received is treated as income for student loan and WfFTC. Include the value of the attributed fringe benefits and the FBT payable at Question 19. Attributable fringe benefits are employer-provided: • motor vehicles for private use • low/nil-interest employee loans • subsidised transport (when the employer is in the business of transporting the public) over $1,000 in value • contributions to insurance schemes, sickness, accident or death funds over $1,000 in value • any other benefits received over $2,000 in value. If you receive fringe benefits but you or your associates (eg, a family trust) aren't shareholder-employees of the company you work for, you don't need to include the fringe benefits in your income. 20 Loss(es) that were offset against income from another activity If you have a loss from running a business, making investments or a rental property, we won't include it in the calculation to work out your student loan and WfFTC entitlements/obligations. You only need to tell us the amount of a loss if you have: • made a loss and profit from two or more unrelated businesses or investment activities, and • entered the net amount in only one box on your IR3 return. Example: Angela's IR3 return shows income from her farming business of $60,000 (self-employment) and a loss from renting out commercial buildings of $25,000. If Angela declared the income and loss in separate boxes in her IR3 (eg, self-employment and rents) she doesn't need to tell us. We'll automatically treat the loss as nil. But, if she declared the net amount in one box, eg, self-employment income of $35,000, Angela needs to tell us about the $25,000 loss by entering $25,000 at Question 20. 21 Income equalisation main scheme deposits Any deposit made this income year, by you,into your individual income equalisation main scheme account (the scheme which allows eligible farming, fishing or forestry customers to even fluctuations in income by spreading their gross income from year to year), needs to be added back to your income for student loan and WfFTC if you claimed a deduction for it in your tax return. Do this by entering the amount of the deposit at Question 21. 22 Income equalisation main scheme refunds Refunds from your income equalisation main scheme are included as income in your tax return but not included for student loan and WfFTC income. Enter the amount of any refund you received (excluding interest earned on the deposit) at Question 22 and we will reduce your income for student loan and WfFTC. Do not include refunds from the adverse event income equalisation scheme and thinning operations. 23 - 25 Attributed income of a major shareholder in a close company If you're a major shareholder in a close company on the last day of the company's income year, you may need to include company income for student loans and WfFTC. We'll need the following information to calculate the adjustment: Question 23 - company's net total income 1 for the company's income year Question 24 - percentage of shares you held in the company on the last day of the company's income year Question 25 - total dividends paid by the company for the company's income year Note: If you're a major shareholder in more than one close company, you'll need to do separate calculations for each company. 26 - 28 Attributed dependent child/children's income of a major shareholder in a close company If you receive WfFTC, you must also include the attributed income of any dependent children who have a voting interest in a company (whether you hold any voting interests in that same company or not). This applies to WfFTCs and to student loans, but only applies to a student loan from the 2020-2021 tax year onwards. Please give us the following information: Question 26 - company's net total income 1 (gross income less expenses) for the company's income year Question 27 - percentage of shares your dependent child/children held in the company on the last day of the company's income year Question 28 - total dividends paid by the company for the company's income year. Note: If you're a major shareholder in more than one close company, you'll need to do separate calculations for each company. 1. The trust's income, company's total income or company's total net income must be adjusted to include the full amount of any refunds or deposits to the main income equalisation scheme in order to reverse its effect.

Keep a copy for your records. OFFICE USE ONLY 29 Correspondence indicator Notes to help you complete the Adjust your income - IR215 4 Passive income of children Passive income includes interest, dividends, beneficiary income and rents. For a complete list of income types, go to ird.govt.nz/income-types If your child/ children received more than $500 of passive income during the year, enter the amount over $500 at Question 4. If you share care of a child/children, divide the amount above $500 equally between yourself and the other caregiver(s). Example: Mary is the principal caregiver for two children, Jane and Mark, and receives WfF. Jane receives $900 interest and Mark receives $200 interest. Mary will have to add the amount over $500 ($400) of Jane’s interest to her family income for WfF. Because Mark’s interest is under $500, Mary doesn’t need to tell us about it. 5 Income of non-resident spouse If your spouse, civil union or de facto partner isn't a New Zealand tax resident, we require their foreign-sourced income to be included as part of your family income for WfF. Enter the total amount of their income, in NZ dollars, in Question 5. We may ask you to confirm details of their income. If you need more information about tax residency in New Zealand, please go to ird.govt.nz/tax-residency 6 Other payments - monetary payments received to help with household expenses You and your spouse or partner may receive monetary payments from another person or entity to help out with your family's household expenses. If these payments add up to more than $5,000 in a year, you need to tell us. Example: Jill’s parents give her $100 a week towards her mortgage payments. The total amount over the year is $5,200. Because it’s over $5,000, Jill enters $5,200 at Question 6. If the amount Jill received was $5,000 or less, Jill would leave Question 6 blank. Other payments are extra payments you generally receive from family or friends, to help with mortgage or other household expenses, eg, payments towards groceries, power or phone bills. It’s not your income, which you pay tax on. They can be paid to you or direct to a bank, service provider or agency on your behalf. 7 Retirement savings scheme contributions If a taxed contribution is made to your retirement savings scheme or to Te Ru - nanga o Nga - i Tahu on your behalf, and you included the contribution in your income tax return, enter the amount at Question 7. This may affect your WfF entitlement, and from 2020-2021 tax year onwards, your student loan repayment obligations. 8 Depreciation recovered on sale of building used in businessand/or rental activity If you sold a building in the past year, show the amount of depreciation you've claimed for it in the 2002-2003 and earlier income years, unless the business income was a loss in the year the depreciation was claimed. The amount cannot exceed the net income from the business or investment activity that had depreciation recovery income. Example: In this tax year Ben sold his commercial rental property. He recovered $100,000 depreciation from the sale. Ben claimed $60,000 depreciation in 2003 and earlier tax years, and $40,000 between 2004 and 2011. He can adjust this years income by $60,000 for the depreciation he claimed before 2004. Ben enters $60,000 at Question 8. This applies to WfFs and to student loans, but only applies to a student loan from the 2020-2021 tax year onwards. 9 Distributions from a trust - not beneficiary income If you received a distribution from a trust that wasn't beneficiary income, and you are not the settlor of the trust, it generally counts as income for student loans and WfF. Include the distribution at Question 9. Example: Matt is a beneficiary of a family trust that has a cash PIE investment. He receives a $2,000 distribution which he doesn’t need to include in his tax return because the trust income was not taxable. Matt will have to include an adjustment for $2,000 for his student loan and WfF income by entering $2,000 at Question 9. 10 Employer-provided motor vehicles - when salary is exchanged for private use If you agreed to a lower salary in exchange for private use of an employer-provided motor vehicle, we consider the amount of salary you would have received without this arrangement as income for student loan and WfF purposes. Include the amount exchanged at Question 10. Don't include the value if the use of the vehicle is just part of the job. Example: Erin’s employer offered her use of the work car and a $50,000 salary or a $58,000 salary and no private use of the work car. Erin chose to have use of the work car instead of the additional $8,000 salary, so she includes this as income for student loans and WfF. 11 Vouchers and other short-term charge facilities - provided by your employer If your employer provides a short-term charge facility, eg, a pre-loaded gift card, voucher, charge account or company credit card for your own use, we may consider the amount to be part of your income for student loans and WfF. It depends on the total value for the year. You only need to tell us if the total amount of all cards, accounts and vouchers goes over the smaller of the following thresholds: • $1,200 if your salary or wages are $24,000 or more • 5% of your salary or wages if you earn less than $24,000 a year. If above the threshold, you'll also need to add the FBT your employer(s) pay on this benefit. += AmountFBTEnter at Box 11 12 Non-locked-in portfolio investment entities (PIE) Enter the amount of: • income attributed from a PIE that gives you ready access to your investment (eg, a cash PIE, on-call PIE, PIE term deposit), or • dividends from listed PIEs, that you haven’t declared in your income tax assessment. Don't include KiwiSaver or any other locked-in super funds. 13 Certain pensions and annuities Enter 50% of the amount of tax-exempt annuities (a fixed figure that provides income) from life insurance policies and/or a pension from a superannuation fund you received in the tax year. Don't include NZ Super paid by Work and Income. 14 Distributions from retirement saving schemes or superannuation schemes Retirement savings schemes If you receive a distribution from a retirement savings scheme before you retire, you need to include it as part of your income for student loans and WfF if: • r etirement scheme contribution tax was withheld from the contributions to the scheme, and • y ou weren't eligible for NZ Super when you received the distribution. Superannuation schemes A distribution from a superannuation scheme is treated as income for student loans and WfF if: • the distr ibution wasn't from a KiwiSaver scheme or complying superannuation fund • your employer made contributions in the tax year you received the distribution, or in either of the two previous years. You'll only need to include it if: • the distribution wasn't made because you retired, and • y ou continued to work for the employer for at least one month after you received the distribution. You don't need to include any distribution of contributions that you made for either schemes. 15 Tax-exempt overseas pensions If you receive NZ Super and a tax-exempt overseas pension, include the pension amount as an income adjustment. You don't need to tell us the amount of your overseas pension if you pay all your overseas pension to Work and Income and receive NZ Super in full. 16 Tax-exempt income If you receive salary or wages that are exempt from New Zealand income tax under specific international agreements, we treat this as income for student loans and WfF. Go to our website for a list of tax-exempt salary and wages. 17 Income from a retirement savings or superannuation scheme PIE declared in your tax return For 2019-2020 and previous tax years, if you've included income attributed from a PIE that is locked-in a superannuation fund or retirement savings scheme in your income tax return, you can exclude it from your income for student loans and WfF by entering the amount at Question 17. Generally, a locked-in PIE scheme is where you must reach a retirement age before you can access your funds. Most KiwiSaver schemes are locked in. If you are unsure check with your scheme. 18 Attributable trustee income If you're the settlor of a trust, we may treat some or all of the income the trust receives (that isn't distributed as beneficiary income) as income for calculating student loan repayment obligations and WfF entitlements. Include this amount at Question 18. Use the following formula to calculate the amount of trustee income: Trust's income 1 = attributable trustee income Number of settlors If the trust has a controlling interest in a company, you'll also need to include the company's income. ( Trust's shares ) × ( company's 1 total income − dividends ) = company income Company shares Add the company income to the trust's income to determine the attributable trustee income. 19 Attributable fringe benefits If you are a shareholder-employee in a company where you and any associated persons hold 50% or more of the voting interests, the total value of attributable fringe benefits received is treated as income for student loan and WfF. Include the value of the attributed fringe benefits and the FBT payable at Question 19. Attributable fringe benefits are employer-provided: • motor vehicles for private use • low/nil-interest employee loans • subsidised transport (when the employer is in the business of transporting the public) over $1,000 in value • contributions to insurance schemes, sickness, accident or death funds over $1,000 in value • any other benefits received over $2,000 in value. If you receive fringe benefits but you or your associates (eg, a family trust) aren't shareholder-employees of the company you work for, you don't need to include the fringe benefits in your income. IR56 taxpayers with an overseas employer From 1 April 2023, if you are: • an IR 56 taxpayer and are a New Zealand-based employee for an overseas employer and • you have received a fringe benefit from your overseas employer and • you have included the value of the fringe benefit as income on your monthly Employment Information (IR348) form, add the total value of the fringe benefit for the year at Question 19 as a negative amount. Example: Joe’s employer pays for their medical insurance, Joe includes the value of the premiums to their monthly income and calculates PAYE on their total monthly income. Joe would show the total value of the fringe benefit for the year as a negative amount at Question 19.. 20 Loss(es) that w ere offset against income from another activity If you have a loss from running a business, making investments or a rental property, we won't include it in the calculation to work out your student loan and WfF entitlements/obligations. You only need to tell us the amount of a loss if you have: • made a loss and profit from two or more unrelated businesses or investment activities, and • ent ered the net amount in only one box on your IR3 return. Example: Angela’s IR3 return shows income from her farming business of $60,000 (self-employment) and a loss from renting out commercial buildings of $25,000. If Angela declared the income and loss in separate boxes in her IR3 (eg, self-employment and rents) she doesn’t need to tell us. We’ll automatically treat the loss as nil. But, if she declared the net amount in one box, eg, self-employment income of $35,000, Angela needs to tell us about the $25,000 loss by entering $25,000 at Question 20. 21 Income equalisation main scheme deposits Any deposit made this income year, by you,into your individual income equalisation main scheme account (the scheme which allows eligible farming, fishing or forestry customers to even fluctuations in income by spreading their gross income from year to year), needs to be added back to your income for student loan and WfF if you claimed a deduction for it in your tax return. Do this by entering the amount of the deposit at Question 21. 22 Income equalisation main sc heme refunds Refunds from your income equalisation main scheme are included as income in your tax return but not included for student loan and WfF income. Enter the amount of any refund you received (excluding interest earned on the deposit) at Question 22 and we will reduce your income for student loan and WfF. Do not include refunds from the adverse event income equalisation scheme and thinning operations. 23 - 25 Attributed income of a major shareholder in a close company If you're a major shareholder in a close company on the last day of the company's income year, you may need to include company income for student loans and WfF. We'll need the following information to calculate the adjustment: Question 23 - compan y's net total income 1 for the company's income year Question 24 - percentage of shares you held in the company on the last day of the company's income year Question 25 - total dividends paid by the company for the company's income year Note: If you're a major shareholder in more than one close company, you'll need to do separate calculations for each company. 26 - 28 At tributed dependent child/children's income of a major shareholder in a close company If you receive WfF, you must also include the attributed income of any dependent children who have a voting interest in a company (whether you hold any voting interests in that same company or not). This applies to WfFs and to student loans, but only applies to a student loan from the 2020-2021 tax year onwards. Please give us the following information: Question 26 - company's net total income 1 (gross income less expenses) for the company's income year Question 27 - percentage of shares your dependent child/children held in the company on the last day of the company's income year Question 28 - t otal dividends paid by the company for the company's income year. Note: If you're a major shareholder in more than one close company, you'll need to do separate calculations for each company. 1. The trust's income, company's total income or company's total net income must be adjusted to include the full amount of any refunds or deposits to the main income equalisation scheme in order to reverse its effect.

OFFICE USE ONLY 29 Correspondence indicator Notes to help you complete the Adjust your income - IR215 4 Passive income of children Passive income includes interest, dividends, beneficiary income and rents. For a complete list of income types, go to ird.govt.nz/income-types If your child/children received more than $500 of passive income during the year, enter the amount over $500 at Question 4. If you share care of a child/children, divide the amount above $500 equally between yourself and the other caregiver(s). Example: Mary is the principal caregiver for two children, Jane and Mark, and receives WfF. Jane receives $900 interest and Mark receives $200 interest. Mary will have to add the amount over $500 ($400) of Jane’s interest to her family income for WfF. Because Mark’s interest is under $500, Mary doesn’t need to tell us about it. 5 Income of non-resident spouse If your spouse, civil union or de facto partner isn't a New Zealand tax resident, we require their foreign-sourced income to be included as part of your family income for WfF. Enter the total amount of their income, in NZ dollars, in Question 5. We may ask you to confirm details of their income. If you need more information about tax residency in New Zealand, please go to ird.govt.nz/tax-residency 6 Other payments - monetary payments received to help with household expenses You and your spouse or partner may receive monetary payments from another person or entity to help out with your family's household expenses. If these payments add up to more than $5,000 in a year, you need to tell us. Example: Jill’s parents give her $100 a week towards her mortgage payments. The total amount over the year is $5,200. Because it’s over $5,000, Jill enters $5,200 at Question 6. If the amount Jill received was $5,000 or less, Jill would leave Question 6 blank. Other payments are extra payments you generally receive from family or friends, to help with mortgage or other household expenses, eg, payments towards groceries, power or phone bills. It’s not your income, which you pay tax on. They can be paid to you or direct to a bank, service provider or agency on your behalf. 7 Retirement savings scheme contributions If a taxed contribution is made to your retirement savings scheme or to Te Ru - nanga o Nga - i Tahu on your behalf, and you included the contribution in your income tax return, enter the amount at Question 7. This may affect your WfF entitlement, and from 2020-2021 tax year onwards, your student loan repayment obligations. 8 Depreciation recovered on sale of building used in businessand/or rental activity If you sold a building in the past year, show the amount of depreciation you've claimed for it in the 2002-2003 and earlier income years, unless the business income was a loss in the year the depreciation was claimed. The amount cannot exceed the net income from the business or investment activity that had depreciation recovery income. Example: In this tax year Ben sold his commercial rental property. He recovered $100,000 depreciation from the sale. Ben claimed $60,000 depreciation in 2003 and earlier tax years, and $40,000 between 2004 and 2011. He can adjust this years income by $60,000 for the depreciation he claimed before 2004. Ben enters $60,000 at Question 8. This applies to WfFs and to student loans, but only applies to a student loan from the 2020-2021 tax year onwards. 9 Distributions from a trust - not beneficiary income If you received a distribution from a trust that wasn't beneficiary income, and you are not the settlor of the trust, it generally counts as income for student loans and WfF. Include the distribution at Question 9. Example: Matt is a beneficiary of a family trust that has a cash PIE investment. He receives a $2,000 distribution which he doesn’t need to include in his tax return because the trust income was not taxable. Matt will have to include an adjustment for $2,000 for his student loan and WfF income by entering $2,000 at Question 9. 10 Employer-provided motor vehicles - when salary is exchanged for private use If you agreed to a lower salary in exchange for private use of an employer-provided motor vehicle, we consider the amount of salary you would have received without this arrangement as income for student loan and WfF purposes. Include the amount exchanged at Question 10. Don't include the value if the use of the vehicle is just part of the job. Example: Erin’s employer offered her use of the work car and a $50,000 salary or a $58,000 salary and no private use of the work car. Erin chose to have use of the work car instead of the additional $8,000 salary, so she includes this as income for student loans and WfF. 11 Vouchers and other short-term charge facilities - provided by your employer If your employer provides a short-term charge facility, eg, a pre-loaded gift card, voucher, charge account or company credit card for your own use, we may consider the amount to be part of your income for student loans and WfF. It depends on the total value for the year. You only need to tell us if the total amount of all cards, accounts and vouchers goes over the smaller of the following thresholds: • $1,200 if your salary or wages are $24,000 or more • 5% of your salary or wages if you earn less than $24,000 a year. If above the threshold, you'll also need to add the FBT your employer(s) pay on this benefit. += AmountFBTEnter at Box 11 12 Non-locked-in portfolio investment entities (PIE) Enter the amount of: • income attributed from a PIE that gives you ready access to your investment (eg, a cash PIE, on-call PIE, PIE term deposit), or • dividends from listed PIEs, that you haven’t declared in your income tax assessment. Don't include KiwiSaver or any other locked-in super funds. 13 Certain pensions and annuities Enter 50% of the amount of tax-exempt annuities (a fixed figure that provides income) from life insurance policies and/or a pension from a superannuation fund you received in the tax year. Don't include NZ Super paid by Work and Income. 14 Distributions from retirement saving schemes or superannuation schemes Retirement savings schemes If you receive a distribution from a retirement savings scheme before you retire, you need to include it as part of your income for student loans and WfF if: • retirement scheme contribution tax was withheld from the contributions to the scheme, and • you weren't eligible for NZ Super when you received the distribution. Superannuation schemes A distribution from a superannuation scheme is treated as income for student loans and WfF if: • the distribution wasn't from a KiwiSaver scheme or complying superannuation fund • your employer made contributions in the tax year you received the distribution, or in either of the two previous years. You'll only need to include it if: • the distribution wasn't made because you retired, and • you continued to work for the employer for at least one month after you received the distribution. You don't need to include any distribution of contributions that you made for either schemes. 15 Tax-exempt overseas pensions If you receive NZ Super and a tax-exempt overseas pension, include the pension amount as an income adjustment. You don't need to tell us the amount of your overseas pension if you pay all your overseas pension to Work and Income and receive NZ Super in full. 16 Tax-exempt income If you receive salary or wages that are exempt from New Zealand income tax under specific international agreements, we treat this as income for student loans and WfF. Go to our website for a list of tax-exempt salary and wages. 17 Income from a retirement savings or superannuation scheme PIE declared in your tax return For 2019-2020 and previous tax years, if you've included income attributed from a PIE that is locked-in a superannuation fund or retirement savings scheme in your income tax return, you can exclude it from your income for student loans and WfF by entering the amount at Question 17. Generally, a locked-in PIE scheme is where you must reach a retirement age before you can access your funds. Most KiwiSaver schemes are locked in. If you are unsure check with your scheme. 18 Attributable trustee income If you're the settlor of a trust, we may treat some or all of the income the trust receives (that isn't distributed as beneficiary income) as income for calculating student loan repayment obligations and WfF entitlements. Include this amount at Question 18. Use the following formula to calculate the amount of trustee income: Trustee’s adjusted net income 1 =attributable trustee income Number of settlors Trustee’s adjusted net income = the amount of income of the trust that hasn’t been distributed to beneficiaries. If the trust has a controlling interest in a company, you'll also need to include the company's income. ( Trust's shares ) × ( company's 1 total income −dividends ) =company income Company shares Add the company income to the trust's income to determine the attributable trustee income. 19 Attributable fringe benefits If you are a shareholder-employee in a company where you and any associated persons hold 50% or more of the voting interests, the total value of attributable fringe benefits received is treated as income for student loan and WfF. Include the value of the attributed fringe benefits and the FBT payable at Question 19. Attributable fringe benefits are employer-provided: • motor vehicles for private use • low/nil-interest employee loans • subsidised transport (when the employer is in the business of transporting the public) over $1,000 in value • contributions to insurance schemes, sickness, accident or death funds over $1,000 in value • any other benefits received over $2,000 in value. If you receive fringe benefits but you or your associates (eg, a family trust) aren't shareholder-employees of the company you work for, you don't need to include the fringe benefits in your income. IR56 taxpayers with an overseas employer From 1 April 2023, if you are: • an IR 56 taxpayer and are a New Zealand-based employee for an overseas employer and • you have received a fringe benefit from your overseas employer and • you have included the value of the fringe benefit as income on your monthly Employment Information (IR348) form, add the total value of the fringe benefit for the year at Question 19 as a negative amount. Example: Joe’s employer pays for their medical insurance, Joe includes the value of the premiums to their monthly income and calculates PAYE on their total monthly income. Joe would show the total value of the fringe benefit for the year as a negative amount at Question 19.. 20 Loss(es) that were offset against income from another activity If you have a loss from running a business, making investments or a rental property, we won't include it in the calculation to work out your student loan and WfF entitlements/obligations. You only need to tell us the amount of a loss if you have: • made a loss and profit from two or more unrelated businesses or investment activities, and • entered the net amount in only one box on your IR3 return. Example: Angela’s IR3 return shows income from her farming business of $60,000 (self-employment) and a loss from renting out commercial buildings of $25,000. If Angela declared the income and loss in separate boxes in her IR3 (eg, self-employment and rents) she doesn’t need to tell us. We’ll automatically treat the loss as nil. But, if she declared the net amount in one box, eg, self-employment income of $35,000, Angela needs to tell us about the $25,000 loss by entering $25,000 at Question 20. 21 Income equalisation main scheme deposits Any deposit made this income year, by you,into your individual income equalisation main scheme account (the scheme which allows eligible farming, fishing or forestry customers to even fluctuations in income by spreading their gross income from year to year), needs to be added back to your income for student loan and WfF if you claimed a deduction for it in your tax return. Do this by entering the amount of the deposit at Question 21. 22 Income equalisation main scheme refunds Refunds from your income equalisation main scheme are included as income in your tax return but not included for student loan and WfF income. Enter the amount of any refund you received (excluding interest earned on the deposit) at Question 22 and we will reduce your income for student loan and WfF. Do not include refunds from the adverse event income equalisation scheme and thinning operations. 23 - 25 Attributed income of a major shareholder in a close company If you're a major shareholder in a close company on the last day of the company's income year, you may need to include company income for student loans and WfF. We'll need the following information to calculate the adjustment: Question 23 - company's net total income 1 for the company's income year Question 24 - percentage of shares you held in the company on the last day of the company's income year Question 25 - total dividends paid by the company for the company's income year Note: If you're a major shareholder in more than one close company, you'll need to do separate calculations for each company. 26 - 28 Attributed dependent child/children's income of a major shareholder in a close company If you receive WfF, you must also include the attributed income of any dependent children who have a voting interest in a company (whether you hold any voting interests in that same company or not). This applies to WfFs and to student loans, but only applies to a student loan from the 2020-2021 tax year onwards. Please give us the following information: Question 26 - company's net total income 1 (gross income less expenses) for the company's income year Question 27 - percentage of shares your dependent child/children held in the company on the last day of the company's income year Question 28 - total dividends paid by the company for the company's income year. Note: If you're a major shareholder in more than one close company, you'll need to do separate calculations for each company. 1. The trustee’s adjusted net income, company's total income or company's total net income must be adjusted to include the full amount of any refunds or deposits to the main income equalisation scheme in order to reverse its effect.

Business Ngā Ūmanga IR235 | April 2020 If you’re GST-registered and pay provisional tax, you may be required to pay your provisional tax at the same time your GST returns are due. GST and provisional tax Space has been provided on your GST return to make provisional tax payments. • If you file monthly or two-monthly GST returns and you haven’t selected the ratio payment option, you’re required to make three provisional tax payments each year. You also have the option of making voluntary provisional tax payments when you file your other GST returns or at any time. • If you file six-monthly GST returns you’re required to make two provisional tax payments. You can also make voluntary payments at any time. GST return and provisional tax payment Your GST return includes a provisional tax section so you can make a combined payment for provisional tax and GST. Transfer GST refund to provisional tax Your GST return allows you to transfer part or all of a GST refund to offset any provisional tax you have to pay. Voluntary and compulsory payments of provisional tax Your GST return indicates whether a compulsory provisional tax payment is due. Voluntary payments can be made at any time. Credit use-of-money may be calculated if your end-of-year tax is different to your provisional tax. For more information see our Provisional tax guide - IR289. Alternative option for calculating provisional tax (ratio option) The ratio option is based on a percentage of your taxable supplies and reflects your cash flow. It’s designed to benefit small to medium sized businesses so you can pay tax when you receive your income or if you have a fluctuating income and turnover. Eligibility criteria To use the ratio option, you need to meet all of the following criteria: • You must have been in business and GST-registered for all of the previous tax year (this must not have been your first year in business) • Your residual income tax\*(RIT) for the preceding year was greater than $5,000 ($2,500 in 2019/20 and earlier years) and up to $150,000 • Your business doesn’t operate as a partnership • Your ratio percentage, once calculated, is between 0% and 100% • You file GST returns monthly or two-monthly. \* End-of-year tax to pay, based on tax payable plus the independent earner tax credit, less any tax credit entitlements, but doesn’t include other tax payments (including provisional tax) you may have paid during the tax year. If you elect to use the ratio option you’ll be required to make six provisional tax instalments. How it works RIT and GST taxable supplies from the previous tax year are used to determine a percentage value or ratio. The ratio is applied to the current GST taxable supplies in each two-month period to determine the amount of provisional tax payable. Ratio calculation Ratio percentage = RIT from previous tax year\* × 100 GST taxable supplies from the previous income year 1 \* Adjustments to calculations are needed because of changes affecting the 2011 and future income years.

RIT figures aren’t available If your previous tax year’s income tax return hasn’t yet been filed you may still be able use the ratio option. In this case, we’d use the figures from the previous tax year to calculate your ratio percentage. Once you file your previous tax year’s return we’ll recalculate your ratio percentage and tell you what it is. Applying to use the ratio option If you’d like to use the ratio option to calculate your provisional tax instalments, please call us on 0800 377 774 or write to us before the start of the tax year in which you want to use the ratio option. Ratio adjustments Your ratio may need to be recalculated if: • you file a later income tax return • your income tax or any of the GST returns used to calculate your ratio percentage are reassessed. Ceasing to use ratio option You can stop using the ratio option at any time during the tax year. If the due date for the first instalment has passed you’ll only be able to use the estimation option (not the standard option) to calculate your provisional tax instalments for the rest of that tax year. You won’t be able to continue using the ratio option if: • you cease your GST registration • any of your GST returns are overdue by 60 days or more • your ratio percentage changes and is no longer between 0% and 100% (we’ll let you know if it’s not) • you change your GST filing frequency to six-monthly • a new income tax assessment results in RIT below $5,000 ($2,500 in 2019/20 and earlier years) or above $150,000 Need to know more?

IR23G July 2024 Why a tailored tax code might suit you The standard tax codes (M, ME, SB, S, SH ST and SA) may not always deduct the right amount of tax. For example, you: • have a second job or other income apart from your main job • receive an overseas pension is taxable in New Zealand • are a beneficiary or receive accident compensation and you also work. A tailored tax code could help you in these situations. You may be heading for a tax refund or bill without even knowing it. Tailored tax rates for WT tax code users The minimum rate of tax you can choose may be too high. For example, you: • have losses to carry forward • receive payments under a labour hire arrangement and want a 0% tailored tax rate (because you cannot apply for a certificate of exemption for these payments). Tailored tax codes do not apply to student loan repayments You can no longer use a tailored tax code to change the amount of your student loan repayment deductions. For more information about working in New Zealand with a student loan go to ird.govt.nz/studentloans Applying for a tailored tax code or tailored tax rate Apply for a Tailored tax code online in myIR by using the Tailored tax application or download the Tailored tax code or tailored tax rate application - IR23BS from ird.govt.nz Apply at the beginning of the tax year, or if your situation changes. Tailored tax codes When we receive your application, we'll calculate the correct tax rate for your situation, to help avoid a large tax refund or bill at the end of the year. The rate may be higher or lower than the current rates. We'll send you a tailored tax code certificate for you to give to your employer. It tells them what tax rate to use. Tailored tax rates When we receive your application, we'll calculate the tax rate for your situation. You'll only need to apply for a tailored tax rate if the rate calculated is going to be lower than the minimum you can choose on the Tax rate notification for contractors - IR330C form. If you're applying for a 0% tailored tax rate because you receive payments under a labour hire arrangement, we will look at your payment and filing history before accepting your application. We'll send you a tailored tax rate certificate for you to give to the person paying you (payer). It tells them what tax rate to use. Tell us if your circumstances change Any changes in your circumstances might affect the amount of tax you should be paying. It’s important to let us know so we can give you a new tailored tax code with the correct tax rate for your current situation. Independent earner tax credit (IETC) If you’re entitled to IETC, your tailored tax code will include this, based on the details on your application form. IETC is a tax credit for individuals who earn between $24,000 and $70,000 and who do not receive: • Working for Families (you or your partner), • an main benefit from Work and Income, • NZ Super, • a Veteran’s Pension, • or an overseas equivalent of any of these. How a tailored tax code or rate works • Your tailored tax code or rate is based on the information you give us. Because your income will be an estimate, we can only work out the exact amount of tax you must pay for the year when you complete your income tax return. • Tailored tax codes are valid for one tax year. We'll automatically send a renewal form for you to re-apply before 20 February each year. • Some tailored tax rates may be issued for up to 5 years. We'll determine the length based on your compliance history. • A tailored tax code or rate takes effect either from 1 April, or from the day we approve it. It cannot be backdated. • A tailored tax code cannot be applied to a main benefit (except for New Zealand Superannuation and Veteran’s Pension). • If we ask you to send back your tailored tax code or rate certificate, you must do this within 7 days. • You must tell us if your circumstances change during the year (for example, your income goes down) or you may end up with a large tax bill at the end of the year.

For more information see our guide Putting your tax returns right - IR280 at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Child support penalties are different. Read our guide Helping you to understand child support - IR100 and see our website ird.govt.nz/ childsupport 4 ird.govt.nz Why paying tax matters Everyone who earns money in New Zealand must pay their share of tax. Here's how the Government spent our taxes in 2016 -17. New Zealand Superannuation $13.7b Education $14b $17.1b Health Social security and welfare $12.7b Other $10.6b $3.5b Finance costs $4.1b Law and order $4.8b Core government services The government uses taxpayers' money to pay for services we all need Penalties and interest 5 Why we charge penalties and interest We realise that sometimes your payments or returns are late for a reason. This is why we have measures in place such as grace periods, instalment arrangements and remission of penalties and (in some cases) interest—so people who normally meet their obligations are not penalised unfairly. We charge penalties and interest consistently. This means everyone who pays, or files late has them added to their bill. We charge interest on late or short paid taxes, and we also pay you interest for not having use of the money. Keep on top of your taxes with these online resources. You can see upcoming due dates on our website at ird.govt.nz/key-dates penalty money Inland Revenue charges when you don't meet your tax obligations interest money we charge on late or short paid tax, or pay you for overpaid tax 6 ird.govt.nz How we calculate the most common penalties The penalties that apply to almost all taxes are: late filing penalties late payment penalties shortfall penalties criminal penalties. How we charge penalties depends on the type of return you should file and how late you pay your tax. The type and amount of penalties we charge depends on the type of return you file, how late you pay your tax and what the errors are. Late filing penalties We charge late filing penalties if you don't file a tax return on time. The penalties are different for each type of return. Even if you think you won't be able to pay on time, it's still best to file your return to avoid the late filing penalty. tax return a form you complete to tell Inland Revenue how much tax you need to pay. There are different returns for the various taxes, eg income tax, GST, PAYE Penalties and interest 7 extension of time more time allowed by Inland Revenue to complete your income tax return Income tax returns We only charge late filing penalties if you complete these returns late: Individual income tax return - IR3 Companies income tax return - IR4. We'll charge a late filing penalty for these reasons. We tell you a return is late and that we'll charge a penalty, and you don't complete the return. You don't give us a valid reason for not completing your return on time and you don't have an extension of time. We give you 30 days' notice before we charge a late filing penalty for an income tax return. If you complete your return within this time we won't charge the penalty. The amount of the late filing penalty depends on your net income. Net incomePenalty Less than $100,000$50 $100,001 to $1 million$250 More than $1 million$500 We'll base the late filing penalty on your income in the previous year. Once you complete the return, we'll adjust the penalty to match your actual income. Residential land withholding tax returns The penalty for completing a Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) return - IR1100 late is $250. net income total income less expenses If you request an extension of time after you've been charged a late filing penalty, you'll still have to pay the penalty 8 ird.govt.nz GST returns The amount of the late filing penalty depends on the accounting basis you use for GST. Accounting basisPenalty Payments$50 Invoice$250 Hybrid$250 We can't give extensions of time for GST returns. You won't get charged a late filing penalty if you've completed all your GST returns on time for the last 12 months. Instead, we'll send you a warning letter. If you have another late return within 12 months, then we'll charge you a late filing penalty. Even if you can't afford the whole payment, we advise you to complete the return on time. Employment information The penalty for filing employment information late is $250. You won't get charged a late filing penalty if you've completed employment information on time for the last 12 months. The first and second times you are late we’ll send a letter to let you know you were late. If you are late a third time within the next 12 months, then we'll charge you a late filing penalty. We can't give an extension of time, so we advise you to complete the return on time. PAYE (pay-as-you-earn) a combination of income tax and ACC earners' levy an employer deducts from an employee's salary or wages and pays to Inland Revenue Employment information information employers complete to show how much money they've paid their employees or contractors, and the deductions they've made each payday GST (goods and services tax) a tax added to the sale price of most goods and services in New Zealand Small employers have total PAYE and ESCT of less than $500,000 a year. Large employers have total PAYE and ESCT of $500,000 or more. Penalties and interest 9 When the late filing penalties are due ReturnPenalty dueExample Income tax (IR3 and IR4 returns) The later of:  30 days from the date of the statement showing the penalty  the due date for the end-of-year tax payment. Ted receives a statement dated 30 September 2018 showing a late filing penalty. His end-of-year tax is due 7 February 2019. The penalty is due on 7 February 2019. GSTOne month after the GST return was due. Judy's GST return was due 28 August 2018. The return was late, and the penalty is due 28 September 2018. Employment information NOTE Only one late filing penalty is charged for a month. 30 days after the end of the month in which the employer is required to deliver their employment income information to the Commissioner. Wiremu, a non-electronic filer of employment information, was due to file 27 May 2020. This is his third late return in 12 months so we charge a penalty. The penalty is due on 30 June 2020. A company's electronically filed employment information was due on 10 July 2020. They missed the filing date for the second time in 12 months so we send them a warning letter. Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) return - IR1100 One month after the IR1100 was due. Mary's IR1100 is due 20 October 2018. The return was completed late so the penalty is due on 20 November 2018. 10 ird.govt.nz Late payment penalties We may charge late payment penalties on overdue payments. We charge the penalties in stages. This means that the longer a payment remains overdue, the more penalties we'll add. The stages are: 1% the day after the due date 4% seven days later 1% each month when the tax to pay remains overdue (on some taxes). We can stop some late payment penalties being added to your account if you set up a plan with us to pay off your tax. For more information on instalment arrangements, see "What to do if your return or payment will be late" (page 25). 1% monthly penalty The 1% monthly penalty is no longer being charged on amounts that remain overdue for: GST - return periods ending 31 March 2017 onwards, Income tax including provisional tax for the 2018 income year onwards, Working for Families Tax Credits assessments for the 2018 income year onwards. The initial penalty of 1% and the further 4% penalty will still be charged on these periods. You’ll continue to have 1% monthly penalties charged on periods that fall outside the above rules and any other unpaid taxes. To find out how we charge penalties for late student loan payments, see page 23. Penalties and interest 11 Late payment grace period We realise that sometimes you simply forget to pay us. A late payment grace period gives you an extra 30 days to pay before we add late payment penalties. The grace period is automatic. If you miss a payment and are entitled to a grace period, we'll send you a letter. You'll qualify for a late payment grace period if you've paid all your taxes on time for the last two years. You'll qualify for a new grace period after another two years of paying on time. If you don't pay the tax due within the grace period, we'll charge late payment penalties from the day after the due date. A late payment grace period suspends penalty charges, but we'll still charge interest. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/penalties Making payments to us is easy. See page 24 for the different ways you can pay. 12 ird.govt.nz Shortfall penalties We calculate penalties on tax shortfalls as a percentage of the tax shortfall. These penalties can be applied to most taxes, including student loans (not to child support). A shortfall penalty can also be charged if you've under- estimated your provisional tax. We charge shortfall penalties based on the level of seriousness of the offence. Each offence is a category defined by law and has an associated percentage. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/penalties Shortfall penalty categoriesStandard % Not taking reasonable care20% Unacceptable tax position20% Gross carelessness40% Adopting an abusive tax position100% Evasion150% Shortfall penalties are usually due 30 days after the date we issue the notice of assessment or statement showing the penalty. tax shortfall a deficit or understatement of tax Penalties and interest 13 Example A company leaves out $10,000 income from their Companies income tax return - IR4. This means they have a tax shortfall of $2,800 (the company tax rate is 28%). We consider this to be a "gross carelessness" error and add a 40% shortfall penalty. Tax shortfall $2,800 40% penalty ($2,800 × 40%) $1,120 The penalty of $1,120 may be reduced if they meet certain criteria (page 14). 14 ird.govt.nz Reductions and increases in shortfall penalties If you realise you've made a mistake in your return and you tell us about it before we discover it, we may reduce the shortfall penalty applied. In some instances, we may cancel the penalty and you won't have to pay it. Telling us about a mistake in your return is called making a voluntary disclosure. Usually, your penalty will be less if you tell us about an error rather than risking us finding it during an audit. We can increase shortfall penalties by 25% if you try to hide or destroy information. Failing to provide information (member of multinational group) A member of a large multinational group may be liable for a penalty of up to $100,000 for failing to provide information or a document within the time required. This may also apply where insufficient information or misleading information is provided. Criminal penalties If you're convicted of breaking tax laws, the courts may charge you criminal penalties. These apply to all taxes. If you act on behalf of someone else (eg as an employee, agent or officer) you can also be charged criminal penalties if you're responsible for them committing an offence. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/penalties For more information about reductions and increases in shortfall penalties go to ird.govt.nz/penalties For more information about voluntary disclosures, see our guide Putting your tax returns right - IR280. Penalties and interest 15 Types of criminal penalties Type of offenceWhat this means Absolute liability offences By law, you need to keep books and documents, eg accounts, relating to your tax affairs for a minimum of 7 years. You also need to be able to provide information on request, including tax invoices Knowledge offencesKnowingly breaking a tax law or obligation Evasion and similar offences Knowingly evading or intending to evade tax. You can be charged for pretending to be another person for tax purposes Offences relating to court orders You can be charged criminal penalties if you don't obey a court order ObstructionPreventing an Inland Revenue officer from carrying out their duties Aiding or abettingHelping someone else to commit an offence From July 2019 a failure to meet a requirement under the common reporting standards can result in a penalty of $300 for each failure. A failure to take reasonable care to meet certain reporting standards can result in penalties up to $100,000. Anyone who fails to provide information to a financial institution can be liable to a penalty of $1,000. These penalties are usually due 30 days from the date of issue of the notice of assessment of the penalty. 16 ird.govt.nz Interest on taxes and penalties Interest is calculated daily. Government sets the interest rates, based on market rates. You can see the current rates at ird.govt.nz/penalties You pay interest to the government if you haven't paid enough tax. This is compensation for not having use of the money and is called debit interest. We pay you interest if you've paid too much tax, to compensate you for not having use of the money. This is credit interest. Interest on provisional tax is charged at the same rates but has separate rules for when we start to pay and charge interest. For more information, see our Provisional tax guide - IR289 or go to ird.govt.nz/provisional-tax Credit interest If you overpay your taxes, we pay you credit interest. The day we start paying credit interest depends on how the credit came about. We stop paying credit interest when the credit is refunded or transferred to another tax account. Penalties and interest 17 Generally, we'll pay credit interest from the later of the day after: your payment was due you make a payment which creates a credit you complete your return. Example Sam doesn't have a tax agent, so his 2018 income tax was due on 7 February 2019. Sam didn't complete his IR3 return until 5 May 2019, but made a payment of $1,500 on 4 February 2019 because he thought he might have tax to pay. His tax bill for the year was only $900, leaving a credit of $600. We start to add credit interest to the $600 from 6 May 2019 because this is the day after he completed his return. 18 ird.govt.nz Interest on GST refunds The date we start calculating credit interest on a GST refund depends on when you complete your return. If you complete it before the due date, we'll start calculating credit interest on the day after the earlier of: the 10th working day after you’ve completed it, or the date the return was due. For GST periods ending 31 March 2018 or earlier, the 10 working day timeframe is 15 working days. If you complete your return on or after the due date, we’ll start calculating credit interest from the day after you complete it. Note Non-resident GST business claimants are not eligible for credit interest on GST refunds. Penalties and interest 19 Debit interest We charge debit interest on outstanding tax (including penalties) of more than $100. Interest is charged from the day after the original due date. Concession for some Working for Families tax credit recipients When calculating a Working for Families tax credit end-of-year entitlement or squaring up Working for Families payments made during the year, it is necessary to determine the family’s income. The requirement to determine both partner’s income can cause timing issues. For example, if one partner has an extension of time in which to file their income tax return, the other partner’s assessment is delayed waiting on their partner’s income details. If the assessment results in a debit, that delay could mean that the partner incurs late payment penalties and interest. To overcome this for the 2020 tax year onwards Inland Revenue can adjust the terminal tax date to provide 30 days to pay any debit amount from the date the assessment is finalised. Interest grace period Because interest is calculated daily, we have a grace period, so you can pay the balance on your notice or statement without receiving any further interest charges. The period starts from the date we issued either: your notice of assessment dated before the due date, or your statement of account dated after the due date. The interest grace period only applies to interest charges. Penalties may still be added within the 30-day period. notice of assessment a bill showing what you owe or what we owe you statement of account a record of your financial transactions with us 20 ird.govt.nz Interest as income or an expense Any interest we pay you is a type of income. This means you need to include the interest received in your tax return. You can claim the interest as an expense in the year you pay it. Example We pay Maria a refund on 24 February 2018. The refund has been increased by credit interest, so she needs to declare it in her 2019 tax return. Penalties and interest 21 How we charge penalties for some taxes Some taxes have different rules to calculate penalties. This section will be useful if you pay provisional tax, employ people or have a student loan. Provisional tax The same late payment penalties that apply to most other taxes apply to provisional tax, but they're not calculated until your return is assessed. Late payment penalties apply to each instalment of provisional tax paid late. The penalties will be added after we've received your income tax return. For more information about late payment penalties on provisional tax, see our Provisional tax guide - IR289. provisional tax income tax paid as instalments during the year 22 ird.govt.nz Employment information Two extra penalties apply to employment information. Non-payment penalties We'll charge you non-payment penalties if you don't pay your PAYE on time, or don't enter into an instalment arrangement with us. You can avoid these penalties by contacting us early. If you pay off your PAYE under an arrangement, you pay fewer late payment penalties and we won't charge you non- payment penalties. When you haven't paid your PAYE on time, we'll remind you about the overdue payment. If you don't pay or arrange to pay in instalments within a month, we'll add a monthly 10% penalty to the unpaid PAYE. The 10% penalty applies every month until you make a full payment or enter into an instalment arrangement. In the month you do this, we reduce the penalty to 5% as long as you keep to the arrangement. instalment arrangement an agreement we make with you to pay your tax bill, either at a later date or by regular payments over time Penalties and interest 23 Non-electronic filing penalties Completing your employment information in myIR saves you time, and ensures we receive your returns by their due date. You must complete your employment information online if your annual PAYE and ESCT deductions are more than $50,000.00. If you don't, and we haven't granted you an exemption, we'll charge you a non-electronic filing penalty. The penalty is the greater of $1 per employee or $250 for each schedule. Student loans We may charge late payment interest on overdue student loan amounts of $334 or more. The amount of late payment interest we charge changes over time. Check the current rates at ird.govt.nz/penalties You're always better off to contact us if you won't be able to pay on time. When you enter into an instalment arrangement we reduce the amount of late payment interest. Regular interest is only charged to your student loan if you're an overseas-based borrower. For more information about student loans go to ird.govt.nz/studentloans ESCT (employer's superannuation contribution tax) tax on an employer's contribution to an employee's superannuation To file your PAYE returns online you need a myIR secure online services account. For more information, go to ird.govt.nz/myir overseas-based borrower a student loan borrower who is away from New Zealand for 184 or more days in a row 24 ird.govt.nz How to make payments You can make payments by: direct debit in myIR credit or debit card at ird.govt.nz/pay internet banking - most New Zealand banks have a pay tax option. When making a payment, include: your IRD number the account type you are paying the period the payment relates to. Find all the details of our payment options at ird.govt.nz/pay Penalties and interest 25 For a full list of our phone numbers, see page 29. Setting up an instalment arrangement is easy. Contact us, send us a secure mail in myIR or submit a proposal online at ird.govt.nz/instalments If you're an employer, paying your PAYE under an arrangement will also stop non-payment penalties from being added. What to do if your return or payment will be late If you know your returns or payments will be late, contact us before the due date. We can work with you to reduce the penalties. Paying off your tax in instalments As long as you make the agreed payments under an instalment arrangement, we stop charging you late payment penalties from the day you set it up. We still charge you interest because this compensates the government for unpaid tax. We'll only charge you the first 1% late payment penalty if you set up a plan before the due date, as long as you keep to it. If you set up an arrangement on or after the due date, we'll still charge you the first 1% and 4% penalties. Monthly late payment penalties are only charged up until the date you set up the arrangement - as long as you keep to it. Paying your tax by an arrangement also means we won't take further actions to collect the money you owe, including extra payments from your wages. An instalment arrangement doesn't automatically include any future taxes you may need to pay. If you get a late payment grace period and contact us about making an instalment arrangement before the grace period ends, late payment penalties will stop as soon as you set up the arrangement. The only difference is that you won't see the penalties added until the grace period has ended. 26 ird.govt.nz You won't be able to make further borrowings through the Student Loan Scheme if you have an overdue amount of $500 or more on your student loan for a year or more. Instalment arrangement for student loan repayments When you enter into an instalment arrangement for overdue student loan payments we'll still charge late payment interest. For every month you make the payments as agreed, we reduce the percentage of late payment interest charged. The reduced rate is 2% less each year than standard late payment interest. Applying for remission of penalties or interest We realise that sometimes you'll have a reason for not making payments or completing your returns on time. In some cases we may consider remitting the penalties and/or interest from your account. We can only do this if you've completed the return and paid any tax due. remission when we reverse the penalties or interest you've been charged Penalties and interest 27 Remission of penalties You can ask us to remit the penalties if the return or payment was late because: circumstances were beyond your control you made a genuine error the situation was a one-off we gave you incorrect advice. You need to tell us the circumstances which led to the penalties being charged, and what steps you've taken to prevent it happening again. Remission of interest We only remit interest in very limited circumstances (eg if we've given you incorrect advice), because it's charged to reimburse the government for unpaid tax. You need to put your request for remission of interest in writing. If we gave you incorrect advice, you'll need to show how this led to interest being charged. We consider each case separately. For more information about our remission policies, see our Standard Practice Statement (SPS) 15/02: Remission of penalties and use-of- money interest. 28 ird.govt.nz Terms we use Employment information Information completed by employers to show how much money they've paid their employees or contractors, and the deductions they've made on each payday.

A grant or subsidy can be a payment made to an individual or organisation to meet some of the expenses in carrying out business activities or in starting up a new business. It can also be a payment made to lower income families to help make childcare more affordable. Some examples are: •job creation incentives such as Flexi-Wage subsidy •new business opportunities such as Flexi-Wage self-employment subsidy •research grants to determine the feasibility of a new type of business •one-off grants for purchasing assets •grant-related suspensory loans - these are interest-free for a specified period, and are then converted to grants if and when the loan conditions are fulfilled •childcare or out-of-school care and recreation (OSCAR) subsidies. Note A gift may be different from a grant or subsidy. Generally, an unconditional gift is a donation or payment made voluntarily to any person or organisation for them to use as they see fit, where there is no benefit to the donor, or to anyone associated with the donor. Example 1 A business gifts $20,000 to a hospice to use as they wish. This is an unconditional gift, because the business doesn’t stipulate how the money is used. Example 2 A business gifts $20,000 to a hospice so the hospice can fix its leaky roof. The hospice can decide how the money is spent, and doesn’t have to do anything for the business in return for the payment. In most cases, this is also an unconditional gift. Example 3 A business gifts $20,000 to a hospice so the hospice can fix its leaky roof. The payment is made with agreement that, if the money isn’t used to fix the roof, the business can ask for the $20,000 back. This isn’t likely to be an unconditional gift, and could be a grant or a loan. 5 www.ird.govt.nz Examples of some unconditional gifts are: •donations •receipts from door-to-door appeals and street collections •bequests •voluntary school fees (but not school activity fees). If you're unsure about the nature of a payment, consult your tax advisor. Who pays a grant or subsidy? Grants and subsidies can be paid out by government departments and local authorities. They can also be paid out by private organisations. Some government departments that provide grants are: •Work and Income •Sport New Zealand •Department of Internal Affairs •Te Puni Kōkiri •local councils •Creative NZ. Some non-government sources that provide grants are: •Power board charitable trusts •local community trusts •Pub charity •local hotel charitable trusts •private charitable trusts. 6 GRANTS AND SUBSIDIES Can anyone receive a grant or subsidy? A grant or subsidy can be paid out to an individual, business or organisation. There are usually criteria or conditions that need to be met before you're eligible for a payment. How is a grant or subsidy taxed? The tax implications of receiving a grant or subsidy can be quite complicated. It can depend on who you received the payment from and what your taxable status is. The following information is a general guide only. You can arrange an appointment with our advisors (page 15) to get further information about your specific circumstances. Government grants and subsidies There are special GST and Income Tax rules for government grants and subsidies paid by the Crown or a public authority. Income tax A business which receives a government grant is not liable to pay income tax on the grant, but the business is not entitled to an income tax deduction for any expenditure which is funded using the grant. GST GST registered persons are generally required to return GST on government grants and subsidies. There are exceptions where the recipient is not liable to return GST eg where grants are used overseas for international development and for the Ministry of Social Development’s COVID-19 wage and leave subsidies. These exceptions are listed in the Goods and Services Tax (Grants and Subsidies) Order 1992. 7 www.ird.govt.nz Non-government grants and subsidies Income tax If you have to pay income tax, the following special tax rules apply to grants and subsidies. Type of payment Liable for income tax Not liable for income tax Grant or subsidy based on income received, forgone or a deficiency ✓ Payment towards an expense incurred in earning gross income (except for government grants) ✓ Payment to offset capital or expenses that don't produce income ✓ Flexi-Wage self-employment subsidy used for private costs, eg groceries ✓ Payment to offset the cost of, or reinstate, a capital asset used in producing gross income ✓\* Any surplus from a grant or subsidy that goes into an organisation's general fund ✓ \* Any claim made for depreciation must be based on the cost of the asset less the value of the grant or subsidy. Example 1 A subsidy received by a farmer from a flood relief trust fund is liable for income tax because it replaces trading stock with cash just as if that stock had been sold in the ordinary course of business. Example 2 A subsidy to restore farm land damaged by floods is treated as a capital receipt because it’s used to reinstate an asset of a capital nature. 8 GRANTS AND SUBSIDIES Note To work out the income tax treatment of a grant or subsidy, each case must be assessed on its own merits. If an organisation receives a specified suspensory loan and repayment is "forgiven", this amount becomes gross income. The amount forgiven is divided equally between the year it's forgiven, and the next two years. Expenses reduced by the amount of the payment The Flexi-Wage self-employment subsidy and Self-Employment Start-up are paid to help get business activities started. The Flexi-Wage self-employment subsidy is a short-term allowance to help with costs while you're getting started. The Self- Employment Start-up is a one-off payment at the start to help with set-up costs, such as buying furniture or the first lot of stock. The subsidy can be used for private or non-business related purposes, but the grant cannot. For tax purposes it's important to know what type of payment was made. Examples 1. Tim receives a Flexi-Wage self-employment subsidy of $150 per week. He’s not registered for GST. Over 12 months this works out at $7,800. Tim uses the subsidy to pay for part of the rent on the shop which includes GST. Total shop rent for 12 months $ 10,400 Less Flexi-Wage self-employment subsidy for 12 months $ 7,800 Rent deductible as an expense for income tax $ 2,600 2. If Tim was registered for GST, both the subsidy and the shop rent paid would be GST inclusive. Both amounts would be reduced by the GST, which would already have been accounted for in the GST return. Total shop rent for 12 months $ 10,400.00 Less GST (× 3 ÷ 23) $ 1,356.52 $ 9,043.48 Flexi-Wage self-employment subsidy $ 7,800.00 Less GST (× 3 ÷ 23) $ 1,017.39 $ 6,782.61 Amount deductible as an expense for income tax $ 2,260.87 9 www.ird.govt.nz Grants used for capital expenditure If you receive a grant for the specific purpose of buying an asset, the grant isn't taxable for income tax purposes. The value of the asset for depreciation purposes will be reduced by the amount of the grant. Examples 1. Lucy isn’t registered for GST and receives a grant of $5,200 at the beginning of the income year. This grant is to help her buy manufacturing equipment. The total cost of the equipment is $10,000. Cost of machinery $ 10,000 Less grant received $ 5,200 Cost for depreciation purposes $ 4,800 12% diminishing value depreciation $ 576 Closing book value $ 4,224 2. If Lucy was registered for GST, the following would apply: Grant received $ 5,200.00 Less GST (× 3 ÷ 23) $ 678.26 Balance of grant $ 4,521.74 Cost of machinery $ 10,000.00 Less GST (× 3 ÷ 23) $ 1,304.35 $ 8,695.65 Deduct balance of grant $ 4,521.74 Cost for depreciation purposes $ 4,173.91 12% diminishing value depreciation $ 500.87 Closing book value $ 3,673.04 10 GRANTS AND SUBSIDIES Part 2 - GST (goods and services tax) Grants and subsidies received from a Crown or public authority are liable for GST if the recipient is, or should be, registered for GST. Note Some grants made to non-profit bodies fall within the meaning of an unconditional gift (page 4), especially if given by charitable trusts. Refer to the explanation of unconditional gifts to see if this is the case. Contact us if you are still not sure. Where the grant is a gift GST won’t have to be returned. An exception is grants intended for overseas use for international development. You'll have to return GST only on the portion of the grant allocated for administration and capacity building in New Zealand. Will you need to register? GST is a tax on most goods and services in New Zealand. It's generally charged and accounted for at a rate of 15%. You or your organisation must register for GST if you are carrying out a taxable activity and any of these conditions are met: •Your total turnover exceeded $60,000 in the last 12-month period. Include any grant or subsidy received and barter transactions made when adding up income and sales to work out total turnover. •Your total turnover (including any grants or subsidies) in the next 12 months is expected to be more than $60,000. •You charge GST in your prices. In this case you must register even if your turnover is less than $60,000. You may not need to register for GST if your turnover exceeded $60,000 in the last 12-month period because you or your organisation received a one-off grant for capital expenditure. Example A marae normally receives koha and a small amount of fund-raising income. This totalled $7,000 in the last 12-month period so it’s not registered for GST. The marae committee will be receiving a one-off grant of $55,000 to replace the marae kitchen building. Because this is capital expenditure the marae doesn’t need to register for GST. 11 www.ird.govt.nz If a similar situation applies to you or your organisation and you're not sure if you should register contact us for more information. If you're required to register for GST, you must apply within 21 days of becoming liable. If the grant you've applied for means your turnover will go over $60,000, register as soon as possible after the grant is confirmed. You may register voluntarily if your income is less than $60,000. You need a myIR Secure Online Services Account to register for GST. Go to www.ird.govt.nz/myIR to find out more. Grants or subsidies for wages If you or your organisation are paid a grant or subsidy for wages, then this will include GST. If you’re registered or liable to be registered for GST you must include it as income in your GST return. Childcare centres, kohanga reo and GST Some parents can apply to Work and Income for a subsidy to help them pay for childcare. Childcare organisations must endorse the application and then the parent must apply to Work and Income for a childcare or OSCAR subsidy. Work and Income direct credits the subsidy money to the childcare organisation on behalf of the parents who are entitled to it. Subsidies direct credited to childcare organisations are not unconditional gifts. Childcare organisations registered or liable for registration for GST, must account for GST in their return when they receive these subsidies from Work and Income. 12 GRANTS AND SUBSIDIES Part 3 - Employer responsibilities If the subsidy you're receiving is a wage subsidy, such as Flexi-Wage subsidy, you must be registered with us as an employer. Once you're registered, you'll receive a new employer's letter which outlines your responsibilities. Some of these are: •You must deduct PAYE from your employees' wages each payday and pay the deductions to us either once or twice a month, depending on the total amount of PAYE you deduct. •You must pay FBT (fringe benefit tax) on any fringe benefits ("perks") you give to your employees. •You must provide KiwiSaver information and make KiwiSaver deductions where required.

Late payment penalties consist of: •initial penalties for paying tax late, and •monthly incremental penalties on any amounts that remain unpaid. If you file your employment information but do not pay the amount calculated, you may also have to pay non-payment penalties. If you have a good history with us, we may contact you before we charge a penalty. Interest charges can also apply to unpaid tax and penalties. Late payment penalties aren't charged on unpaid tax of $100 or less. Note These penalties don’t apply to student loan or child support payments.

We'll look at your payment options which may include an instalment arrangement, depending on your circumstances. Arrangements can be agreed on before or after the due date for payment. There are greater reductions in the penalties charged if the arrangement is made before the due date.

A grant or subsidy can be a payment made to an individual or organisation to meet some of the expenses in carrying out business activities or in starting up a new business. It can also be a payment made to lower income families to help make childcare more affordable. Some examples are: •job creation incentives such as Flexi-Wage subsidy •new business opportunities such as Flexi-Wage self-employment subsidy •research grants to determine the feasibility of a new type of business •one-off grants for purchasing assets •grant-related suspensory loans - these are interest-free for a specified period, and are then converted to grants if and when the loan conditions are fulfilled •childcare or out-of-school care and recreation (OSCAR) subsidies. Note A gift may be different from a grant or subsidy. Generally, an unconditional gift is a donation or payment made voluntarily to any person or organisation for them to use as they see fit, where there is no benefit to the donor, or to anyone associated with the donor. Example 1 A business gifts $20,000 to a hospice to use as they wish. This is an unconditional gift, because the business doesn’t stipulate how the money is used.

DAIRY FARMING GUIDE 4 Type of farm Where possible, a farmer should dissect expenses into claimable (business) and non-claimable (private) expenses. However, some expenses may relate to both business and private purposes. In such cases a practical approach distinguishes between two types of farm. Under this approach the amount of GST that can be claimed will depend upon whether your farm is: • a Type 1 farm - which is a farming business where the value of the farmhouse is 20% or less of the total value of the farm; or • a Type 2 farm - which is a farming business where the value of the farmhouse is more than 20% of the total value of the farm. The value of the farmhouse includes: • the farmhouse itself • any improvements made to the farmhouse • the area immediately surrounding the farmhouse (known as curtilage). A formal valuation or a reasonable estimate of the values of the farmhouse and whole farm are acceptable. For Type 1 farms, 20% of all farmhouse expenses can be claimed as business expenses. Alternatively, GST can be claimed through an actual-use calculation if the business use of the farmhouse is greater than 20%. Type 1 farmers may also claim 100% of the interest costs relating to the farmhouse and 100% of rates costs. For Type 2 farms, farmers who live in the farmhouse can claim expenses on a fair and reasonable basis so that only actual business use of the farmhouse is claimed. GST on farm expenses Dogs You can claim 100% of the GST on all working dog costs such as the purchase price, food, registration, vet bills and kennels. You can't claim GST on dogs purchased from a person who isn't registered for GST. 5 Electricity If you are a Type 1 farmer, you can claim 20% of the GST on your domestic power bill. You can claim 100% of the GST on your milking shed and farm power. If you are a Type 2 farmer, you’ll need to work out the percentage of the power bill relating to the actual business use on a fair and reasonable basis. Farm bike If you own the farm bike and pay all expenses you can claim 100% of the GST on the capital and running costs (petrol, oil and repairs). If you own the farm bike and the farm owner pays all the running costs, you can only claim GST on the capital cost of the bike. If the farm owner provides the bike and you pay all the running costs, you can only claim GST on the running costs. Farm cottages You can't claim GST on expenses relating to your farm cottage (for example, repairs, maintenance, paint/paper, electrical and building work) as they are an exempt supply. Goods taken/purchased for private use You can't claim GST on goods and services purchased for you or your family's private use such as food and clothing. If you purchase livestock as part of your business and then take it for private use, you need to make an adjustment for GST. For example, if you kill a beast for your own use, you must account for 3/23rds of its value in Box 9 of your GST return. Livestock purchased from a non-registered person You can't claim GST on livestock purchased from a person who isn't registered for GST. Primary produce can't be classified as secondhand goods. DAIRY FARMING GUIDE 6 Newspaper If you are a Type 1 farmer you can claim up to 20% of the GST on your newspaper subscription, unless you can substantiate a higher percentage. If you are a Type 2 farmer, you’ll need to work out the percentage relating to the actual business use on a fair and reasonable basis. Phone costs Type 1 and Type 2 farms that operate their business from home may claim 50% of their telephone rental charges, unless they can show that the actual business use of the telephone is greater than 50%. This is the existing practice for other home-based businesses. You can't claim on private toll calls, so it's a good idea to highlight business toll calls on your phone account. If you have a farm cottage, you can claim the GST on any business-related phone calls your employee makes. Note If you have a mobile phone the same conditions apply for claiming GST as above. Shed rubberware and detergent You can claim 100% of the GST on all milking shed-related expenses. Shifting costs - farm to farm You can claim 100% of the GST on the cost of moving your farm stock and machinery from farm to farm. All other expenditure related to the shift is private and not claimable. Wet weather gear and protective clothing You can claim 100% of the GST on wet weather gear and protective clothing, for example, overalls and gumboots. Other clothing, such as jeans, T-shirts etc, are a private expense and not claimable. 7 PAYE deductions Accommodation provided to employee Accommodation provided to an employee is a benefit and therefore taxable. You need to add the value of the benefit to the wages each pay period and deduct PAYE from the total. If a sharemilker's employee lives in a house on the farm owner's property, the value of the accommodation must be included as gross earnings, even though the supply of accommodation is not directly between the employer and employee. Farm cottage To calculate the value of the benefit you need to take into account what is being supplied, for example, if it's a free house, take into account the average market rent in the area, the location and condition of the house. Your home or outside room To calculate the value of the benefit you need to take into account what is being supplied, for example, meals, own room, power and/or phone. Include the value of the accommodation (including free board) in the gross earnings when you complete your Employment Information - IR348. Note Agricultural contractors Agricultural contractors include workers contracted for maintenance, development or any other work on farming or agricultural land. Unless a contractor provides you with a current Certificate of exemption (IR331) you must deduct withholding tax at a rate of 15%. The fact that a person can be registered for GST makes no difference. If the contractor does not have an IR331, they will need to complete a Tax rate notification for contractors (IR330C). You should pay the withholding tax to us by the 20th of the following month, along with any other PAYE. When you are shown an IR331 check that the work the person is doing for you is the same as the work shown on the certificate. For example, if the certificate gives an exemption from modelling income, and you have hired them to bale your hay, the payments you make are not exempt and you're required to deduct withholding tax. DAIRY FARMING GUIDE 8 Casual agricultural employees Casual agricultural employees are people you engage to do casual seasonal agricultural work on a day-to-day basis for up to three months. They are taxed through the PAYE system at a flat rate using the tax code CAE (casual agricultural employee) on the IR330 form. Contract milkers If you take on a contract milker you need to have a written contract in place. You also need to ensure that the contract meets the criteria for the milker to be self-employed. If it doesn't you may find the contract milker is an employee and you're required to deduct PAYE. Relief milkers A relief milker is generally an employee and therefore you're required to deduct PAYE from their wages. You can use the CAE tax code and deduct PAYE at a flat rate. The employee is required to complete an IR330 showing CAE as the tax code. For the rate see the current Weekly and fortnightly PAYE deduction tables (IR340) or the Four weekly and monthly PAYE deduction tables (IR341). If you're not sure whether they are an employee or a self- employed contractor, see our leaflet Self-employed or an employee? (IR336). Income tax When filing your return, instead of sending in your financial records to determine your income tax liability, you can prepare a summary of your income and expenses using the IR3F, a form for farming income and expenses. Maintaining accurate records will reduce the time you and your accountant take to complete your end-of-year accounts. Note 9 Services you may need Need to speak with us?

Charitable organisation An organisation (incorporated or not) that carries out charitable activities or exists exclusively for charitable purposes, which include: • the relief of poverty • the advancement of education • the advancement of religion • other activities that will benefit the community.

Charity A trust, society or institution registered as a charitable entity by Charities Services under the Charities Act 2005. This is not the same as trusts registered with the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment under the Charitable Trust Act 1957. Consideration For GST, consideration includes any amount paid in return for a supply of goods or services. • It does not have to be compulsory. • It does not need to be cash, for example, barter. • It may be a promise to not do something, for example, in return for goods, a creditor may agree not to pursue a debt. • It may be an incentive offered to induce a supply. • It may be paid by someone else, for example, a parent pays for a child’s haircut. It does not include unconditional gifts made to not-for-profit organisations. EDUCATION CENTRES 5 Donation A donation is a gift of money of $5 or more made voluntarily to an education centre, to do good for the centre, and in return for which the giver receives no material benefit or advantage. Donee organisation An organisation that meets the requirements set out in the Income Tax Act 2007. Generally, a donee organisation is one which applies its funds wholly or mainly to charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes in New Zealand. Certain other organisations may also qualify, such as school board of trustees, tertiary education institutes or community housing entities. Individuals, companies and Maori authorities can get tax benefits by making donations to a donee organisation. Not-for-profit organisation A not-for-profit organisation is any society, association or organisation (incorporated or not): • that is not carried on for the profit or gain of any member, and • whose rules do not allow money, property or any other benefit to be distributed to any of its members. Public authority Includes all government departments, agencies and entities, but not: • the Governor-General • members of the Executive Council • ministers of the Crown or members of Parliament. Taxable activity For GST, any activity carried on continuously or regularly that supplies (or intends to supply) goods and services to others for consideration (but not necessarily for a profit), or the activities of any public or local authority is a taxable activity. Taxable activities do not include: • employment as a salary or wage earner • hobby activities • the occasional sale of domestic or private assets • making GST-exempt supplies. ird.govt.nz6 Turnover For GST, turnover is the total gross value of all goods and services supplied, excluding GST. It includes: • goods and services sold or provided in New Zealand • exported goods • services supplied overseas • grants, subsidies and barter arrangements. It does not include: • the sale of stock and assets because of winding down or ceasing business • the sale of plant or assets being replaced • exempt goods and services • unconditional gifts. Unconditional gift For GST, an unconditional gift is a payment made: • voluntarily to any not-for-profit organisations for the not-for-profit organisation to use • where there is no identifiable direct benefit to the giver or the family of the giver. Examples of unconditional gifts are: • donations • receipts from door-to-door appeals and street collections • bequests Subscriptions, income from trading activities and any payments made by the Crown or a public authority are not unconditional gifts. EDUCATION CENTRES 7 Part 1 - Basic tax information What is an education centre? The term ‘education centre’ includes all organisations providing educational services, from universities and schools to day-care centres. Throughout this guide we’ve called them ‘education centres’. Types of education centres • schools operated by a board of trustees bound by the Education and Training Act 2020 • charities • not-for-profit organisations • businesses. Income tax Schools operated by a board of trustees Schools operated by a board of trustees bound by the Education and Training Act 2020 include: • state schools (primary, intermediate, composite or secondary) • state integrated schools • Kura Kaupapa Māori • special schools. These schools are exempt from paying income tax by section CW 38(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section 61 of the Education and Training Act 2020. They do not have to file income tax returns. They may have to pay other taxes, such as GST, PAYE and FBT. Charities Some education centres will be charities registered with Charities Services. A charity registered with Charities Services is called a ‘tax charity’ and is exempt from paying income tax and from having resident withholding tax (RWT) deducted from interest and dividend income. For more information, see page 15. An education centre that is a charity also may be exempt from FBT. There is no exemption from GST or PAYE. ird.govt.nz8 Charitable organisations and not-for-profit organisations Often community-based education centres are operated by organisations that are charitable but are not registered with Charities Services or by not-for-profit organisations. For example, childcare and playcentre-type organisations, kōhanga reo and community associations. If your education centre is not carried on for the profit or gain of any member with rules that do not allow money, property or any other benefit to be distributed to any of its members the centre is only required to file an income tax return if its income is over $1,000. Only the amount over this is taxable. The income tax rates are: • incorporated centres- 28 cents in the dollar • unincorporated centres- 10.5 cents in the dollar on income from $0 to $14,000 - 17.5 cents in the dollar on income from $14,001 to $48,000 - 30 cents in the dollar on income from $48,001 to $70,000 - 33 cents in the dollar on income from $70,000 to $180,000 - 39 cents in the dollar on income above $180,000 The education centres may have to pay other taxes, such as GST, PAYE and FBT. Businesses If your education centre is run to make a profit for its owners, it will be liable for income tax on all profits after expenses, and may also have to pay GST, PAYE, FBT and other taxes. Centres that are run to make a profit must file a set of accounts and one of these returns: • IR3 for a sole trader • IR4 for a company (shareholders must file IR3 returns) • IR6 for a trust • IR7 for a partnership (individual partners must also file IR3 returns) • IR9 for a club or societies. If you’re unsure what type of return you should complete, contact us. For further information on running a business go to ird.govt.nz to read our Smart business - IR320 guide. You can also access other forms and guides mentioned in this booklet from this site. Due dates for provisional tax Education centres that pay income tax are liable for provisional tax if their residual income tax is more than $5,000 for the last year. The due dates for payment of their instalments of provisional tax depend on the centre’s balance date. For more information read our Provisional tax - IR289 guide. EDUCATION CENTRES 9 GST (goods and services tax) You must register your education centre for GST if your turnover (sales from taxable activities): • was over $60,000 for the last 12 months, or • is expected to go over $60,000 for the next 12 months. You can voluntarily register for GST if your turnover is less than $60,000. If you have not already registered for GST and need help deciding, use our guided help – Do I need to register for GST? You can register for GST in myIR. If you’re a GST-registered education centre you must collect GST and pay it to us. You can also claim back any GST on expenses you have as part of your business. To work out your annual turnover, only include income liable for GST. Do not include income not liable for GST or exempt income. For example include income from Ministry of Education grants and subsidies, private tuition fees and state integrated school attendance dues, but not income from donations, koha, and interest. If you are operating more than one education centre, or separate divisions of the same centre, you must add together the turnover of all of them to decide whether you need to register for GST. Separate registration of divisions Any education centre operating more than one school or centre, or separate divisions of the same centre, may be able to register each school, centre or division separately. For more information on GST and registering separate divisions go to ird.govt.nz/gst/registering-for-gst Employing staff If your education centre employs staff, you must register with us as an employer. You can register online in myIR. Go to ird.govt.nz/myIR for more information. You’ll find more information on becoming an employer on our website ird.govt.nz/roles/employers Anyone who is not a contractor and does paid work for your centre is treated as an employee. You must deduct PAYE from any payments these employees receive and pay it to us. If you provide an employee with accommodation rather than money for their work, you must deduct PAYE on the taxable value of the accommodation. If vouchers and stored value cards, for example petrol vouchers, supermarket voucher cards, and Prezzy™ cards, are included in salary or wages PAYE must be deducted from their value. Other benefits provided to supplement wages may be liable for FBT. ird.govt.nz10 Refer to our Employer’s guide - IR335 for further information on: • employer requirements, • PAY E , • hiring self-employed contractors, • ACC, • student loans, • child support, and • employer’s superannuation contributions. FBT (fringe benefit tax) If your education centre provides fringe benefits (perks) to any of your employees, and the centre is not a charity or a charitable organisation, you must pay FBT. Some of the benefits liable for FBT are: • private use of cars • low-interest loans • subsidised transport • goods or services employer contributions to sickness, accident and death benefit funds. FBT exemption for charities and charitable organisations Education centres which are a charity or a charitable organisation (other than public authorities or universities) are generally exempt from paying FBT on any benefits provided to employees while they’re carrying out the organisation’s charitable activities. For example if your employee has the use of your centre’s car to carry out the centre’s charitable work, any private benefit arising is not subject to FBT. However, if your education centre also operates a business which is outside its charitable, benevolent, cultural or philanthropic purposes and provides fringe benefits to any person employed predominantly to carry on that business, FBT might need to be paid on those benefits. For example if such an employee has the use of a centre’s car to carry out the centre’s non-charitable business activities, an amount of FBT must be paid on any private use of the car. This exemption does not apply to short-term charge facilities such as fuel cards or store customer cards provided to employees where the value for the tax year is more than the lesser of 5% of their salary or wages or $1,200. EDUCATION CENTRES 11 Calculating FBT When calculating your education centre’s FBT to pay, you have a choice of FBT rates to use. You can choose to work out the FBT to pay using the alternate rate or a single rate of 63.93% from 1 April 2021. There are also other options for small businesses and companies. Free, subsidised or discounted goods and services provided to an employee are only liable for FBT if the total value is more than $300 per quarter ($1,200 per tax or income year for yearly payers) or the total value of all these types of benefits to all employees is more than $22,500 in the last 4 quarters (or in the tax or income year for yearly payers). GST on fringe benefits If your education centre is registered for GST, GST is payable on the value of any liable fringe benefit provided to an employee. GST is calculated on the benefits in the FBT return that the fringe benefit is included in. For more detailed information on FBT read our Fringe benefit tax guide - IR409. RWT (resident withholding tax) If your education centre has money deposited in a bank or other financial institution, or owns shares in a company, RWT may be deducted from any interest or dividends your centre earns before you receive them. At the end of the year, the centre can claim a credit against their tax liability in its tax return for the RWT deducted. RWT exempt status Your education centre may qualify for RWT exempt status. This means it can receive interest or dividends without having RWT deducted. If your centre is a registered charity, it will have RWT exempt status and its IRD number will be listed on the RWT exemption register. When Charities Services registers or deregisters an organisation as charitable, they inform us. We accept their decision and approve or cancel RWT exempt status. All other organisations must apply using our Application for exemption from resident withholding tax (RWT) on interest and dividends - IR451 form. Complete and send it to us along with any information we ask for. The IRD number of everyone with RWT exempt status is listed on the RWT exemption register on our website at ird.govt.nz/rwt-exemption ird.govt.nz12 Payers of investment income (for example banks) access this register to confirm which of their customers are exempt from having RWT deducted. You may also like to tell anyone paying you interest or dividends about your exemption, so they stop deducting RWT. Unless you’re a charity, you are responsible for telling us if you no longer meet the criteria for an exemption. We will update your status and the register. Dividends and imputation If you’re running your education centre as a company, you’ll have to deduct RWT from any dividends you pay your shareholders. The RWT rate payable on dividends is 33%, but this rate is offset by any imputation credits or foreign dividend payment credits, attached to the dividend. For instance, you only need to deduct 5% RWT from a dividend that is fully imputed at 28:72 (the maximum imputation ratio for any credits that relate to tax paid of 28%). For more information read our guides Resident withholding tax (RWT) on dividends - payer’s guide - IR284 and Imputation - IR274. Our Resident withholding tax on interest (RWT) payer’s guide - IR283 has the information you’ll need if your centre pays interest and deducts RWT. Record keeping You must keep enough records to be able to calculate your education centre’s income, expenses and tax liabilities and to enable us to confirm your accounts if required. Some records you must keep are: • invoices and receipts (taxable supply information if you are GST registered) • debit and credit notes (supply correction information if you are GST registered) • any other necessary documents to confirm your accounts • bank statements • stocktake figures for the end of the financial year • wage records for all employees, including Employer Superannuation Contribution Tax records • interest and dividend payment records. You must keep all records for 7 years, even if you cease operating. All records must be in English or te reo Māori unless you have written approval from us to use another language. EDUCATION CENTRES 13 Donation tax credits or deductions Donation tax credits If your education centre is a donee organisation, people who donate more than $5 to the centre may qualify for a tax credit of 33.33%. The centre will need to provide the giver with a donation receipt which they will need to submit to us to be able to claim the donation tax credit. The receipt issued by the centre will need to clearly state that it is for a donation, show the amount and date of the donation, show the giver’s name, be signed by an authorised person, and show the centre’s IRD number and/or charities number. If the receipt is a replacement, it needs to clearly show the word ‘copy’ or ‘replacement’. The giver can submit their receipt online through their myIR account at any time during the year, or they can send us a Tax credit claim form - IR526. They can submit a donation receipt within 4 years of when the donation was made. A centre does not have to be a charity to be a donee organisation. However, from 1 April 2020 if the centre has only charitable purposes it must register as a charity to obtain donee status. For more on how to get approval as a donee organisation and issue donation receipts read our Charitable and donee organisations - IR255 guide. Donations of trading stock A business can provide trading stock to an approved donee organisation. Where this is in the nature of a donation and not in the usual course of business, it is not treated as income for the business to the extent of the donation or the discounted amount. Ensure you provide a record of receiving the donated trading stock to the business. For more information on donations of trading stock go to ird.govt.nz ird.govt.nz14 Part 2 - Income and expenses Income Education centres can receive many types of income, for example: • grants • subsidies • donations • fees • raffle money • trading profits • proceeds from the sale of assets. The table on page 15 shows what types of income are liable for GST and income tax. Income that is ‘exempt from GST’ is different from income that’s ‘not liable for GST’. This is important when working out your claim for GST credits for goods and services purchased to run your centre. GST-registered centres may claim GST credits on expenses incurred in deriving income that’s either liable or not liable for GST. Your centre cannot claim GST for expenses incurred in deriving income that’s exempt from GST. EDUCATION CENTRES 15 Table of income For more information about this table see the notes on pages 15 to 19. Type of income Liable for GST Not liable for GST Exempt from GST Liable for income tax Not liable for income tax Grants and subsidies Donations and unconditional gifts † Koha † Bequests Voluntary contributions to schools operated by a board of trustees bound by the Education and Training Act 2020 Payments for take-home projects School trips Examination fees Private school fees Attendance dues Payments to kindergartens, early childhood centres, playcentres and kohanga reo University tuition fees Hostel fees Raffles Sale of donated goods and services Sale of purchased goods Trading activities Hall and equipment hire Residential rent Commercial rent Sale of assets and equipment Building and maintenance recoveries Insurance receipts Penalties or fines Textbook deposits Advertising and sponsorship Interest and dividends \* Can be liable in certain situations. \*\* Government grants and subsidies will usually be liable for GST. † Donations and koha may be taxable income, depending on the circumstances of the payment. See our Interpretation statement IS 23/11 Income tax: Income - when gifts are assessable income for more information. ird.govt.nz16 Grants and subsidies Education centres may receive grants and subsidies from the Crown, public authorities and other organisations. The tax treatment of these is covered in our Grants and subsidies - IR249 guide. Donations (unconditional gifts) A donation that is an unconditional gift paid to an education centre is not liable for income tax or GST. They should not be included in your GST calculations. A donation is only an unconditional gift if it is paid voluntarily to any not-for-profit organisation for them to use and the giver does not receive any identifiable direct benefit in return. For example where the giver in return for making the payment is provided with the use of premises or advertising space in an education centre’s newsletter, the payment is not a donation or an unconditional gift. Some grants received by your education centre might be a donation, especially if made by a charitable trust. If you’re not sure if a payment is a donation contact us on 0800 377 774. GST and Koha If your koha is an unconditional gift you do not have to pay GST on it. An unconditional gift is a voluntary payment to a not-for-profit organisation that does not benefit the payer or giver in the form of goods or services. If the koha, such as payments, goods or services are not an unconditional gift they will be liable for GST. Using the unconditional gift rule will let you know whether your koha is liable for GST. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/gst-and-koha Bequests A bequest made to a not-for-profit organisation is treated as an unconditional gift and is not liable for income tax or GST. Voluntary contributions to schools operated by a board of trustees The Education and Training Act 2020 gives New Zealand citizens aged between 5 and 19 the right to free education at any school operated by a board of trustees bound by the Act. Because state education is free and is provided regardless of whether or not any payment is made to their school for that education, any such payment received by these schools is considered a donation and is not liable for income tax. The payments are also not liable for GST. EDUCATION CENTRES 17 Fees paid by international students to attend New Zealand schools are liable for GST and income tax. This is because international students do not have a statutory right to free education in New Zealand and are paying for the education they receive. Voluntary contributions made by parent-teacher associations or similar groups from fundraising activities to school boards of trustees are usually donations. Payments for take-home projects At a school operated by a board of trustees bound by the Education and Training Act 2020, where a student has chosen to buy and take home an item they have made (for example a wooden pencil case made in a Hard Materials class) that is a supply of goods and the payment is liable for GST. While a family is not obliged to buy any item produced at school, the school may ask for a voluntary contribution towards the school’s materials costs. A voluntary contribution to the school’s materials costs is not consideration for GST purposes, and so is not liable for GST. Charges for take-home projects and materials fees paid to education centres that are not schools operated by a board of trustees bound by the Education and Training Act 2020 are liable for GST and income tax. School trips Families might be asked by a school operated by a board of trustees bound by the Education and Training Act 2020 to make a voluntary contribution or payment toward the school’s cost of providing a school trip forming part of its curriculum. Any amount paid is not liable for GST or income tax. This is because students have a statutory right to participate in the school trip regardless of whether the family makes any payment. School trip amounts charged to families with children at other education centres, or where trips are extra-curricular (for example an optional weekend ski trip), are liable for GST and income tax. This is because students must pay the amount to be able to participate in the school trip. Attendance dues Attendance dues paid to state integrated schools are liable for GST and generally, income tax as they are required to be paid for the student to be able to attend the school. Examination fees Where an education centre collects examination fees, the part handed over to another organisation is not liable for GST or income tax. If the centre keeps any portion of the fee, this is liable for GST and income tax. ird.govt.nz18 Private school fees School fees paid to private schools (ie, schools not operated by a board of trustees bound by the Education and Training Act 2020) are liable for GST and income tax, unless the school is income tax exempt. Attendance dues Attendance dues paid to state integrated schools are liable for GST and generally, income tax as they are required to be paid for the student to be able to attend the school. Payments to kindergartens, early childhood centres, playcentres and kōhanga reo Amounts that must be paid for a child to be able to attend a kindergarten, early childhood centre, playcentre or kōhanga reo or to participate in its activities are not donations so are liable for GST and income tax. Voluntary contributions or koha which are donations made to assist a charitable or not-for- profit education centre are not liable for GST and income tax. University tuition fees University students’ tuition fees paid to the university are not donations. This is because if the fees are not paid the students cannot enrol at university. The fees are liable for GST and income tax where the university is not exempt from income tax. Hostel fees Hostels are generally liable for GST, as they come within the definition of a “residential establishment”. The GST to be charged is worked out using a special calculation which you can find in the GST guide - IR375. Hostel fees charged by a centre will also be liable for income tax where the centre is not exempt from income tax. Raffles For a raffle with cash prizes, the amount liable for GST is the total of all ticket sales, less the total amount of all the cash prizes. If purchased goods are used as prizes, all the takings are liable for GST and tax credits can be deducted for the prizes purchased. Where donated prizes are raffled, all takings are GST liable. This is because the purchase of the raffle ticket buys the right to participate in the raffle and not the actual prizes (donated goods are exempt from GST). EDUCATION CENTRES 19 Generally, raffle proceeds are not liable for income tax. The profits will be liable if the proceeds come from outside the centre and the raffle is run like a business, intending to make a profit (the scale and nature of the activity confirm this). Sale of donated goods and services If a not-for-profit organisation has goods or services donated to it and later sells them, it cannot charge GST on the sale. The proceeds are not liable for income tax. If all the goods and services making up the final goods sold by the not-for-profit organisation are donated, the sale is exempt from GST. If the final goods sold are made up of both donated and purchased goods and services, including any wages paid to employees, the sale is liable for GST. Sale of purchased goods Goods purchased and resold to raise funds are liable for GST and income tax. Any organisation can claim GST for any purchases made, as long as they keep taxable supply information such as invoices, receipts or other documents. Trading activities Some education centres may have separate trading activities to supplement their income, for example, running stationery shops, tuckshops, farms and cafeterias. These activities will involve selling goods and/or services and are liable for GST. They’re subject to the normal GST registration rules, but there are some special registration criteria for not-for-profit education centres. The net profit, after the deduction of expenses, from the trading activity is liable for income tax unless the education centre is tax exempt. FBT might be payable on fringe benefits provided to employees in respect of their engagement in the education centre’s trading activities. Hall and equipment hire Money received from your education centre hiring its hall or equipment will be part of the centre’s income for GST and income tax. Residential and commercial rent If an education centre leases out a dwelling as a private home the rent the centre receives is exempt from GST. This means GST is not charged on the rent and the expenses of maintaining the home do not qualify to claim GST. The rent, after the deduction of expenses, is liable for income tax unless the centre is tax exempt. ird.govt.nz20 If an education centre leases out commercial premises the rent is liable for GST. The rent, after the deduction of expenses, is liable for income tax unless the centre is tax exempt. Sale of assets and equipment If an education centre claims GST expenses for assets or equipment, these are treated as part of the centre’s taxable activity, and they will be liable for GST when they are sold unless: • they are used for making exempt supplies, or • an election is made: Up to 31 March 2021 you can elect and repay any GST input credits claimed on the assets or equipment that are not ordinarily part of the centre’s taxable activity. They will then be treated as not being part of the centre’s taxable activity, and no GST will be payable when the assets or equipment are eventually sold or otherwise disposed of. The sale of assets and equipment used in running an education centre is generally not assessable for income tax but would affect any claim made for depreciation of the asset. For more information see our Depreciation - a guide for business - IR260. Building and maintenance recoveries Payments your education centre receives as reimbursements, for example, for the cost of repairing damage to grounds or buildings, are liable for GST. Insurance receipts If your centre receives a payment from a general insurance claim, the proceeds are subject to GST, as the transaction is treated as if the insurance company purchased the asset. Generally, these payments are not liable for income tax, but may affect any claim made for depreciation of the asset. For more information see our Depreciation - a guide for business - IR260. Penalties or fines Education centres may levy or impose penalties or fines for things like overdue library books. These payments are consideration for a service, in this case the extended borrowing, and are liable for GST and income tax. Textbook deposits Refundable deposits paid to an education centre to secure textbooks are not liable for GST or income tax when the deposit is received. If the book is damaged or lost and the centre keeps the deposit, it’s then liable for GST and income tax. EDUCATION CENTRES 21 If the deposit is donated to the centre when the student leaves, it becomes a donation and unconditional gift and is not liable for GST or income tax. Advertising and sponsorship Income received by your education centre from selling advertising space in newsletters, websites or school magazines etc, is liable for GST. There’s a difference between advertising and simply publicly acknowledging a donation you have received. Advertising is a service that benefits the person making the payment and is liable for GST and income tax. A simple acknowledgement does not provide a valuable benefit to the giver. Income from sponsorships is liable for GST if the centre is registered, and liable for income tax if the centre is not exempt. This is because in return for the sponsorship, the education centre advertises the sponsor’s name. This may be by wearing the sponsor’s name on t-shirts, or by using the sponsor’s products. If your centre is receiving advertising or sponsorship income and you’re not sure how to treat it, contact us on 0800 377 774. Interest and dividends Interest and dividends received by your education centre is exempt from GST. Centres cannot claim GST credits for any costs incurred in deriving exempt income. Interest and dividends are liable for income tax. Usually RWT will be deducted from interest and dividends before the centre receives them, unless the centre has RWT exempt status. For more information about RWT exempt status, see page 11. Imputation credits may also be attached to dividends. Expenses Education centres have to pay various costs to earn their income, for example, salaries, wages, allowances, general maintenance and utilities. If your education centre is liable for income tax it can deduct these expenses from its gross income to work out its taxable profit. GST on expenses can only be claimed if they’re incurred in earning income liable for GST. ird.govt.nz22 Payments to school trustees Schools operated by a board of trustees bound by the Education and Training Act 2020 may make payments to the board’s chairperson and to each school board trustee for each board meeting they attend. These payments are honoraria and tax at a flat rate of 33 cents in the dollar should be deducted. Part of these payments will be considered reimbursement of expenses, so tax will not need to be deducted from the following: • chairperson of board of trustees - the first $75 of honoraria per board meeting attended, up to a maximum of $825 a year (11 meetings) • other board members - the first $55 of honoraria per board meeting attended, up to a maximum of $605 a year (11 meetings). School board chairpersons and trustees are self-employed for ACC purposes. Late payment If you do not pay a bill on time, you may have to pay penalties and interest.

IR255 March 2020 Charitable and donee organisations A tax guide for charities, donee organisations and other groups 3 www.ird.govt.nz Introduction Charitable organisations have several tax obligations. If you're involved in administering or setting up a charitable trust, estate, society, association or any other type of charitable organisation, this guide will help you. However, this is only a general guide - for more specific issues, refer to other Inland Revenue publications (listed on page 44) or call us - see page 42. Charities Services registers and monitors charitable organisations and provides education and support to the charitable sector. For more information go to page 10 or go to their website www.charities.govt.nz or call 0508 242 748. In this guide • Part 1 helps you work out what taxes your organisation will have to deal with. • Part 2 explains the exemptions, so you can find out whether your organisation is exempt from income tax. It also tells you about the tax benefits available to people who donate money or property to your organisation. • Part 3 sets out different types of income and explains whether each is liable for income tax or GST (goods and services tax). • Part 4 deals with what happens when a charity is deregistered. • Part 5 Services Inland Revenue provides. The information in this guide is based on current tax laws at the time of printing. 4 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS www.ird.govt.nz Go to our website for information and to use our services and tools. • Log in or register for myIR to manage your tax and entitlements online. • Demonstrations - learn about our services by watching short videos. • Get it done online - complete forms and returns, make payments, give us feedback. • Work it out - use our calculators, worksheets and tools, for example, to check your tax code, find filing and payment dates, calculate your student loan repayment. • Forms and guides - download our forms and guides.

Associated persons These are: • people related by blood, adoption, marriage or de facto relationships • companies with mainly the same shareholders • a partner and a partnership • trusts and their association with trustees, beneficiaries and settlors. The association rules are complex and it is important that you seek professional advice if you think there is any possibility of an association applying to you. Business Any enterprise or activity intended to make a profit is classed as a business. If an organisation runs a business, it must pay tax on all profits after expenses (except certain transactions made with its members). However, if a charity runs a business, it may be exempt from income tax on any profits that it uses for charitable purposes within New Zealand - see page 24. Charitable organisation or charity This is an organisation (incorporated or not) that carries on charitable activities or exists exclusively for charitable purposes. Generally to obtain tax benefits, charities must be registered by the Charities Services. Many organisations consider themselves charitable because of the work they do or because they're registered under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957. As a result, they may also think they're exempt from income tax. However, an organisation is generally only exempt from income tax if it's registered with Charities Services, or if registration with Charities Services is unavailable (e.g. because the entity is a non-resident), has been granted an exemption from Inland Revenue. This exemption doesn't apply to GST or PAYE. The organisation must still account for these. 7 www.ird.govt.nz Charitable purposes These include: • the relief of poverty • the advancement of education • the advancement of religion • activities for the benefit of the community. An organisation's purposes must fall within one of these categories to be charitable. Its activities or aims must be for public purposes and the benefit must be available to a large section of the community. In addition, it must not be carried on for the benefit or profit of any individual. If the beneficiaries are limited by blood ties the charitable purpose can still be met in some circumstances. Charitable purpose of marae A marae has a charitable purpose if: • the physical structure of the marae is on land that is a Mäori reservation, and • the funds of the marae aren't used for a purpose other than the administration and maintenance of the land and of the physical structure of the marae or another charitable purpose. Charities Services (previously known as the Charities Commission) This is part of the Department of Internal Affairs and provides; • a registration and monitoring system for charitable organisations, • collection and processing of Annual Returns , and • support and education to the charitable sector on good governance, and management practise. Community housing entity A trustee, or a company whose activities are mainly the provision of housing, who meet specific criteria and are registered under the Housing Restructuring and Tenancy Matters Act 1992. They may be a registered charity or alternatively contact Inland Revenue to confirm if they qualify under a specific income tax exemption for community housing entities. 8 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Deregistration There are certain tax implications that apply when an organisation ceases to be a registered charity. For the purposes of this booklet, the deregistration rules outlined in part 4 apply to a charity that: • has been removed from the Charities Register by Charities Services, or • voluntarily deregisters, or • no longer meets the criteria for the income tax exemption for business income under section CW 42 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Donee organisation This is an organisation Inland Revenue considers to have met the requirements set out in the Income Tax Act 2007. Generally, a donee organisation is one which applies its funds wholly or mainly to charitable, benevolent, philanthropy or cultural purposes within New Zealand. Certain other organisations may also qualify, such as a school board of trustees, tertiary education institutes or community housing entities. Individuals, companies and Ma ̄ ori authorities can get tax benefits by making gifts of money to a donee organisation - see page 26. Donor A person, company or other organisation that gives money or property to another. Incorporated organisations Organisations registered with the Companies Office of the Ministry of Economic Development are classed as incorporated organisations. For more information about becoming incorporated, see www.societies.govt.nz Non-profit body or Not for Profit organisations A non-profit body is any society, association or organisation (incorporated or not): • that is not carried on for the profit or gain of any member, and • whose rules don't allow money, property or any other benefit to be distributed to any of its members. Organisation This is a general term, which covers all types of societies, institutions, companies, estates, trusts, funds, whether or not they have a charitable nature or are considered tax-exempt. 9 www.ird.govt.nz Payroll giving Payroll giving is a voluntary scheme where employees can make donations from their pay to support approved donee organisations. People who donate through payroll giving receive immediate tax credits relating to the donations they make each payday. Registered charity A trust, society or institution that is registered by Charities Services under the Charities Act. This is not the same as trusts registered with the Ministry of Business Innovation & Employment under the Charitable Trust Act. Residual income tax Residual income tax is the amount payable for the year, after deducting any tax credits from income tax assessed, but before deducting any provisional tax paid. Taxable activity Any activity carried on continuously or regularly that supplies (or intends to supply) goods and services to others for some form of payment (but not necessarily for a profit) is a taxable activity. Businesses, trades and professions are all taxable activities. Charitable organisations of any type can carry on taxable activities. Setting up a business is part of the taxable activity, as is the closing down and sale of a business. Taxable activities do not include: • employment as a salary or wage-earner • hobby activities • the occasional sale of domestic or private assets • making GST-exempt supplies such as residential rent or financial services. Turnover Turnover is the total gross value of all goods and services supplied, excluding GST. It includes: • goods and services sold or provided in New Zealand • exported goods • grants or subsidies • non-monetary items received under barter arrangements. 10 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Charities Act The Charities Act 2005 established a Charities Commission, now known as Charities Services, who provide: • a registration and monitoring system for charitable organisations • support and education for the charitable sector on good governance and management. Charities Services has published A guide to the Charities Act which you can download from www.charities.govt.nz or order a copy by calling 0508 242 748. Charities Services also set up a Charities Register. Registration is voluntary but, unregistered charities aren't eligible for tax exemptions on the grounds of charitable purposes. Charitable organisations can apply for registration online at www.charities.govt.nz or by posting a completed application form, with a copy of their rules, to Charities Services. Send an officer certification form for each officer of the organisation. You can get details about registration and copies of forms from Charities Services at www.charities.govt.nz or by calling 0508 242 748. Turnover for GST purposes doesn't include: • GST-exempt goods and services • unconditional gifts received. See page 15 for the treatment of assets. Unconditional gift An unconditional gift is a donation or payment made voluntarily to any non-profit body, where there's no identifiable direct benefit to the donor or the donor's family. Some unconditional gifts can be: • donations or koha • money from door-to-door appeals and street collections • bequests • voluntary school fees (but not school activity fees). Subscriptions, payments from trading activities and payments made by the Crown or a public authority aren't unconditional gifts for GST purposes. 11 www.ird.govt.nz Part 1 - Basic tax information Whatever type of charitable organisation you're setting up or running, you'll usually have some tax obligations. These may include: • making several tax payments each year - some of these may be for your organisation's own tax liability, others may be on behalf of its employees • filing various return forms each year - these may be for income tax, GST, PAYE and/or FBT • calculating the profit from any business to work out how much tax is due - this is explained in our Smart business (IR320) guide and there is also some information in Part 3 of this guide • keeping certain business records - see page 20 for more information on this. This part of the guide explains all these obligations and gives you other general tax information you need to know. Income tax Charitable organisations are liable for income tax if they are not within the meaning of a “tax charity”. To be a tax charity means the organisation is either: • a registered charity, or • a non-resident charity that has been approved by Inland Revenue, or • a business that is carried on by, or for or for the benefit of a registered charity , for example a company which is fully owned by a tax charity. (From 1 April 2020 the business will need to be a registered charity itself to qualify) A charitable organisation is not exempt for income tax on business income applied for charitable purposes outside New Zealand - see page 30. Other benefits The Income Tax Act 2007 contains specific income tax exemptions for charities. Some of these exemptions give benefits to charitable organisations and some give benefits to people, certain companies, or Mäori authorities who make donations to such organisations.The "Tax benefits" section on page 23 of this guide gives more detail on these main conditions. It also covers other benefits available such as exemption from: • fringe benefit tax (FBT) on certain fringe benefits, and • resident withholding tax (RWT) on interest and dividends. 12 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS The Tax benefits section also covers any criteria and limitations to these exemptions. Your organisation may still be liable for other taxes, such as GST and PAYE. If your organisation isn't entitled to any tax exemptions, it will be liable for income tax on some types of income it earns. Part 3 of this guide will help you work out which types of income are taxable. Income tax rates If a charitable organisation is incorporated under the Incorporated Societies Act 1908 or Companies Act 1993, then it's considered to be a company for income tax purposes. If it doesn't qualify for a tax exemption, its income is taxed at the company rate. Organisations that operate as trusts, including trusts incorporated under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957 and aren't tax-exempt are liable for tax on trustee's income. Our guide Trusts and estates income tax rules (IR288) gives you more information about this. Charitable organisations not incorporated under a specific Act are treated as unincorporated charitable organisations. If such an organisation isn't entitled to a tax exemption, it will be liable for income tax at the same rate as an individual taxpayer. However, it won't qualify for any of the tax credits that individual taxpayers can claim. For more information on individual and PAYE rates go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: income tax rates). If a non-exempt organisation's residual income tax for a financial year is more than $2,500, it may have to pay provisional tax for the following year. For more information on provisional tax, read our guide Provisional tax (IR289). Filing income tax returns Generally, if your organisation is a tax charity, it's exempt from income tax. You don't need to file an income tax return unless we request one or you have income that is not covered by the exemption. You need to be registered by Charities Services to be eligible for an income tax exemption. If your organisation isn’t a tax charity or is a tax charity but receives non-exempt income, it will be required to file a return You must include a copy of the financial accounts with the tax return. You must include a copy of the financial accounts with the tax return. Instead of accounts, you can use our Schedule of business income (IR3B) or Rental income (IR3R) form to work out the gross income and allowable deductions for these activities. We also provide an Accounts information (IR10) form, which you can use instead of sending us a set of accounts. Using an IR10 will speed up the tax return processing time. 13 www.ird.govt.nz Companies must file an IR4 tax return, estates or trusts must file an IR6 tax return, and any other society or association must file an IR 9 tax return. If your organisation doesn't receive a taxpack, you can order one by calling our 0800 self-service numbers - see page 42. If your organisation has a balance date between October and March, you must send your tax return to us by 7 July. For other approved balance dates (see page 22), send us the return by the seventh day of the fourth month after your balance date. If a tax agent completes the return, we may extend the due date. This is because most tax agents have extensions of time for filing their clients' tax returns. GST (goods and services tax) GST is a tax on most goods and services in New Zealand. It's charged and accounted for by GST-registered businesses or organisations, known as taxable activities. They calculate the amount of GST they have charged and pay it to us. They can also claim back the GST they incur as part of their taxable actvity. To check the current GST rate go to www.ird.govt.nz/GST Registering for GST If your charitable organisation runs a taxable activity with an annual turnover (total income before expenses) of $60,000 or more, it must register for GST. You must also register for GST if you think your organisation's turnover for the next 12 months will be over $60,000. Registration is voluntary for organisations with turnover under this figure - see page 13. A taxable activity is any activity continuously or regularly carried on by your charitable organisation that supplies, or intends to supply, goods and services to someone else for a consideration – it doesn’t have to be an activity carried on with the intention of making a profit. To work out turnover, only include income liable for GST (including amounts which would be zero-rated). Don't include any income not liable for or exempt from GST. For example, include income from trading activities (both with members and non- members), subscriptions, grants and subsidies, but exclude income from donations, koha, bequests, residential rent, interest and dividends. You can register for GST online through your myIR Online Services account. To register for a myIR account visit www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword: myIR). Alternatively, you can complete a GST registration (IR360) form. 14 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Registration of branches and divisions Generally, if an organisation operates through separate branches or divisions, they may each register separately for GST. If the total turnover of all the branches or divisions is more than $60,000 your organisation must register for GST. Non-profit bodies (including charitable organisations) may apply to us in writing to treat each branch or division separately, and only register the individual branches with a turnover of more than $60,000. However, branches with a turnover of less than $60,000 may still register voluntarily. To register separately, each branch or division must: • have its own independent accounting system, and • be separately identified by its location or by the different activities it undertakes. Voluntary registration The advantage of voluntary registration is that charitable organisations may get frequent refunds of GST. This may happen when a charity runs a taxable activity and receives income liable for GST, but also receives donations or koha (unconditional gifts), which aren't liable for GST. The charity can claim a GST credit for most of its expenses, but it only pays GST on its taxable activity income. However, charitable organisations need to be aware of the possible disadvantages of voluntary registration. • The organisation must use GST invoices, retain records and file GST returns. • When you stop your registration, you must pay GST on the open (current) market value of any business assets you keep for private use. If you acquired the asset before 1 October 1986, the adjustment would be the lesser of cost price and the open market value. • Accounting for GST becomes difficult if non-liable income is involved, or if some assets are used for exempt purposes and others for business purposes. • If someone within the organisation completes the GST returns, there may be problems if that person's services become unavailable and their experience is lost. For more help You'll find more information on registering branches and divisions separately, or on voluntary registration, in our GST - do you need to register? (IR365) factsheet. 15 www.ird.govt.nz GST and assets Generally, if you’re registered, GST can be claimed on the purchase of a business asset or for expenses relating to that asset. If you do claim GST on an asset or on expenses relating to that asset, you’ll have to pay GST on the sale of the asset or equivalent event such as an insurance pay out. For further information go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword: GST). Employing staff If your organisation employs staff, you must register with us as an employer. You can register online at www.ird.govt.nz "Get it done online" or complete an Employer registration (IR334) form. Your tax obligations as an employer are as follows: • Ask new employees to fill in a Tax code declaration (IR330), which will tell you the tax code to use and the rate for deducting tax from their wages. If any employees don't fill in an IR330, you must deduct tax from their wages at the non-notified rate of 45% (not including employees' ACC earners' levy). • Ask new contractors who receive schedular payments to fill in a Tax rate notification for contractors (IR330C), this tells you the rate of tax to deduct from their schedular payments. If any contractors don't provide you with an IR330C, you must deduct tax from their schedular payments at the non-notified rate. This rate is 20% for non-resident contractor companies, and 45% for all other contractors. You'll need to fill out a New employee details (IR346) form for each new employee and send it to us either: • before their first pay day; or • with the Employment information (IR348) form that includes their first pay. You’ll need their name, KiwiSaver status, IRD number, tax code and contact details. Include their date of birth if they have provided you with this information. After you submit your first Employment information (IR348), this information will be automatically shown on your subsequent IR348 forms. 16 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS • Deduct PAYE from your employees' wages, and pay it to us either once or twice a month, depending on the total amount of wages paid. PAYE includes the ACC earners' levy to cover the cost of employees' non-work injuries. • Complete an Employment information (IR348) form with details of the required deductions for each employee. You can file your IR348 electronically through myIR. • Pay fringe benefit tax (FBT) on any fringe benefits (perks) you give your employees - see page 17. • Deduct child support payments and student loan repayments from employees' wages if required. • Automatically enrol new employees who are eligible to join KiwiSaver and deduct their KiwiSaver contributions from their pay. • If you're making KiwiSaver employee deductions or employer contributions you need to send these to us with the PAYE. • Pay employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) on any employer cash contributions made to a superannuation scheme. For more information on your obligations as an employer, see the Employer's guide (IR335). Employees and contractors If any members of your organisation carry out paid work, they're treated as employees. PAYE must be deducted from the payments they receive. If the organisation gives board and lodging rather than money to any employees for their work, you must work out the gross value of the benefit given to them, calculate PAYE based on this amount and pay it to us - see the "Allowances" section in the Employer's guide (IR335). Other benefits paid to replace wages may be liable for FBT - see page 17. PAYE deducted from your employees' wages is does not belong to your organisation, it must not be used for anything other than payment to us. If a self-employed contractor does a job for the organisation, this generally doesn't make the organisation an employer. However, if the job is one of those listed on the back of the Tax rate notification for contractors (IR330C), you must deduct tax and pay this to us. You must also ask the contractor to complete the IR330C. If they've completed the IR330C and have chosen their own tax rate on page 1, deduct tax at that rate. Note: there are minimum tax rates that apply, refer to the Employer's guide (IR335). If they've completed the IR330C and haven't chosen a tax rate, use the 17 www.ird.govt.nz standard rate listed on the back of the IR330C. If the contractor shows you a current Certificate of exemption (IR331) or is a company (not in the agricultural industry), you don't need to deduct tax. A COE can't apply to any payments made under a labour hire arrangement by a labour hire business. If the type of work done isn't listed on the IR330C, you don't need to deduct tax as the contractor is responsible for paying the tax. Some workers call themselves self-employed contractors or something similar, so their employers won't deduct PAYE. If, as the employer, the organisation has control over the work done, including what the person does and how, and where it's done, the worker is almost certainly an employee and is liable for PAYE. It's illegal to treat a true employee as self-employed to avoid deducting tax. If you're not sure whether a worker is a true employee, read Part 1 of the Employer's guide (IR335) and our leaflet, Self-employed or an employee? (IR336). Employer's superannuation cash contribution (employer contribution) An employer contribution is money paid by the employer to a superannuation fund, for the benefit of their employees. If your employees ask you to make deductions from their wages and pay them to a superannuation scheme, these are not employer contributions. Any employer contribution an employer makes to a superannuation fund for the benefit of an employee is liable for tax. There are several options for taxing these contributions - see the Employer's guide (IR335) for more information. A "superannuation fund" is a scheme that has been registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. For more detailed information about superannuation fund contributions, refer to the Employer's guide (IR335). FBT (fringe benefit tax) Charitable organisations are generally exempt from paying FBT on any benefits provided to employees while they're carrying out the organisation's charitable activities. For example, if an employee has the use of a car while carrying out charitable work for the organisation, any private benefit arising isn't subject to FBT. The exemption doesn't apply to any short-term charge facilities provided to employees of your charitable organisation above a certain threshold. This includes vouchers and store value cards, eg, petrol and supermarket voucher cards, Prezzy™ cards. For more information see Part 4 of our Fringe benefit tax guide (IR409). 18 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS However, if your organisation operates a business which is outside its charitable, benevolent, cultural or philanthropic purposes and provides fringe benefits to any person employed in that business, FBT must be paid on those benefits. For example, if that business provides a car as part of a salary package, for use with its business activities, FBT must be paid on any private benefit. GST on fringe benefits If an organisation is registered for both GST and FBT, it must make an adjustment for GST in its FBT returns for fringe benefits provided (unless the benefits are GST-exempt or zero-rated). See Part 8 of our Fringe benefit tax guide (IR409) for more information. Entertainment expenses If your organisation is not fully income tax exempt, only 50% of entertainment expenses that aren't subject to FBT are deductible for income tax purposes. For more information, read our Entertainment expenses (IR268) guide. RWT (resident withholding tax) Charitable organisations registered with Charities Services are eligible for RWT exempt status. This means if your charitable organisation has money deposited in a bank or other financial institution, or has shares in a company, your organisation can receive interest or dividends without having RWT deducted. When Charities Services registers or deregisters an organisation as charitable, they inform us. We accept their decision and approve or cancel RWT exempt status. The IRD number of everyone with RWT exempt status is listed on the RWT exemption register on our website at ird.govt.nz/rwt-exemption Payers of investment income (eg banks) access this register to confirm which of their customers are exempt from having RWT deducted. You may also like to tell anyone paying you interest or dividends about your exemption, so they stop deducting RWT. For more help Our RWT on interest - payer's guide (IR283) has the information you'll need if your organisation pays interest and deducts RWT. 19 www.ird.govt.nz NRWT (non-resident withholding tax) If your organisation pays interest, dividends or royalties to a non-resident, this is called non-resident passive income and your organisation must deduct NRWT. For more information on NRWT go to www.ird.govt.nz/nrwt or read our NRWT – payer’s guide (IR291). You can also contact our Non-resident Centre if you want to know more about the New Zealand tax residency rules for deducting and paying NRWT: Email nonres@ird.govt.nz Phone 03 951 2020 For more help These guides will help if you have questions about residency or NRWT: • New Zealand tax residence (IR292) • Non-resident withholding tax - payer's guide (IR291) • Visitor's tax guide (IR294). 20 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS General information Record keeping You must keep sufficient records to calculate the income, expenses and GST liability of your charitable organisation, and to enable us to confirm your accounts if necessary. The records you need to keep are: • receipt and payment account books • bank statements • invoices (including GST tax invoices) • receipts • any other necessary documents to confirm entries in your accounts • stocktake figures for the end of the financial year • wage records for all employees, including KiwiSaver records • interest and dividend payment records. For GST you don't need to hold a tax invoice for items costing less than $50 but you do need to maintain a record of such payments. For income tax, you should have invoices for all expenses, whatever the amount. Note You must hold all records for seven years, even if you cease operating (except for incorporated organisations that have been wound up and dissolved). We can also extend the period you must keep records for if we intend to audit or investigate your organisation. If this is the case, we'll write and tell you what records to keep. All your records must be in English, unless we give you written approval to use another language. Any charitable or donee organisation (see pages 6 and 7) must also keep a record of: • the sources of any donations made to it, and • how its funds have been used, within New Zealand or overseas. If we request it to, the organisation should be able to fill in a tax return and identify the source and end use of all its funds. It's important to keep all this information as we routinely audit these records. 21 www.ird.govt.nz If you file your tax returns electronically, you must keep a paper copy of the return (and supporting records) for seven years. Note You can read more about audits on our website at www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword: audits). IRD numbers No matter what type of charitable organisation you're running, it will need an IRD number. You may also use that IRD number for GST, PAYE, FBT or RWT purposes. You’ll need an IRD number for Charities Services when applying for charitable registration. To get an IRD number, you'll need to send us a completed IRD number application - non-individual (IR596) form. If you're incorporating a new company online through the Companies Office website, you can apply for an IRD number at the same time. Or, you can complete the IR596 form online, print, sign and send it to us. You'll need to provide a photocopy of one of the following: • certificate of incorporation • deed of trust • certificate of registration. You must also supply the names, addresses and personal IRD numbers of each shareholder, director, trustee or executive office holder. Balance dates For most taxpayers, the accounting year ends on 31 March - the balance date. If you want a balance date for your organisation other than 31 March, you must apply to us in writing, stating your reasons. We usually only approve a change if there are sound business reasons for doing so, or if your business activity is in an industry where there is a recognised balance date other than 31 March. Due dates Some organisations may have to file returns and make payments to us for several tax types. To keep track of the due dates for payments and returns, use the calculator on www.ird.govt.nz or our Tax due date calendar (IR328). 22 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS 23 www.ird.govt.nz Part 2 - Tax benefits Tax legislation benefits charities by allowing them income tax exemptions. It also allows a tax credit or deduction for donations by individuals, companies or Mäori authorities to donee organisations. Note that a charity may also be a donee organisation but will need to register with Charity Services to be one. If an organisation with charitable purposes is on Inland Revenue’s approved donee list, but is not registered with Charities Services, it will need to register by 1 April 2020 to retain its donee status. This part of the guide explains how these benefits work and the conditions an organisation must meet to get a particular benefit. Charities To qualify for an exemption from income tax, trustees of a trust must derive income for charitable purposes, and societies or institutions must be established and maintained exclusively for charitable purposes. A charitable purpose is where the rules of an organisation clearly state that its purposes are for one or more of the following: • the relief of poverty • the advancement of education • the advancement of religion • any other matters that are beneficial to the community. The organisation's aims must also be for a public purpose except where they are for the relief of poverty. The benefit must be available to a large part of the community and the activities must not result in the private benefit or profit of any individual. You'll find further information about charitable purposes on the Charities Services website at www.charities.govt.nz 24 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Income tax for charities Non-business (investment) income Registered charities are exempt from income tax on non-business income such as interest, dividends and rents. They may use the non-business income for charitable purposes in and outside New Zealand and still keep the income tax exemption. Business income The portion of a registered charity's business income which is used for charitable purposes in New Zealand is exempt from income tax. If an organisation uses its business income for charitable purposes outside New Zealand as well, only the New Zealand part is exempt. Business income won't be exempt if anyone connected with the charitable organisation: • receives or can receive any type of benefit or income from the organisation, and • can determine or influence the nature or amount of any benefit they receive. Page 29 has more details about the limitations to this exemption. These exemptions only apply to the charitable organisation's income. They don't apply to any other earned income passed on to a charitable organisation for charitable purposes. The people or organisation who earned the income must pay tax on it. However, the gifting of this income may qualify for a donation tax credit or deduction - see page 27. Income derived from a business carried on by, or for, or for the benefit of a charitable organisation is exempt from income tax. From 1 April 2020 to qualify for or retain this exemption the business will need to register with Charities Services in its own right. It will no longer be sufficient that the income is for the benefit of a registered charitable organisation. Non-resident charities Non-resident charities that only carry out charitable purposes outside New Zealand may not be able to be registered with Charities Services because they: • are not established in New Zealand, and • do not have a strong connection with New Zealand. In these circumstances we may be able to approve an income tax exemption for non- business income if the entity meets certain criteria. 25 www.ird.govt.nz You can find out more about the criteria and the application process at www.ird.govt.nz (search term: non resident charity). Non-resident charities with business income used to carry out charitable purposes in New Zealand must be registered with Charities Services to be eligible for an income tax exemption on that income. This exemption covers both business and non-business income used for charitable purposes in New Zealand, but not business income applied overseas - see above and page 33. Charitable estates The executor or administrator of a deceased person's estate may derive income from any money or assets left to charitable organisations while the will is being finalised. If the organisation benefiting from the will is entitled to an income tax exemption, the income derived while the funds are held awaiting finalisation is also exempt. This exemption only covers the income derived from the money or assets of the estate that have been left to the charity. The estate must still pay tax on any income it earns from other assets or money. If the trustees want to confirm their tax exemption they need to send us, during that intervening period, a copy of the deceased's will and the following details: • details of any charity that will receive gifts under the will and the amount they will receive • the rights of the various beneficiaries under the will • the net value (after debts and liabilities) of the estate available to be distributed to the beneficiaries • the shares and the prospective shares of the beneficiaries in the income and assets of the estate. Gifts to charities Gift duty was repealed for gifts made after 1 October 2011. If your organisation needs information on the tax implications for gifts made before this date, go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: duties and levies). 26 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Donee organisations When an organisation is considered a donee organisation for tax purposes, any gifts of money it receives from individuals, Ma ̄ori authorities and certain companies, qualify for tax advantages. You will need to apply to Inland Revenue for approval to become a donee organisation. See page 26 for more information on these tax benefits. An organisation doesn't have to be a registered charity to be eligible for donee organisation status. However, from 1 April 2020 if the organisation has only charitable purposes it must register as a charity to obtain donee status. A donee organisation must be a New Zealand society, institution, association, organisation, trust or fund. Its funds must be applied wholly or mainly to charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes in New Zealand. This means that the organisation's aims or purposes should be carried out in New Zealand, even if this results in paying money outside New Zealand to achieve these purposes. Inland Revenue administers the “wholly or mainly” requirement on a “safe harbour” basis of “75% or more”. This means Inland Revenue will generally accept that an organisation meeting or exceeding the safe harbour percentage of 75% has wholly or mainly applied funds to specified purposes within New Zealand. This applies to and from the 2019/20 income year. For more information, see our Interpretation Statement IS 18/05 – Income tax – donee organisations and its accompanying fact sheet on applying the “safe harbour” approach. These can be found at www.ird.govt.nz/technical-tax/interpretations/ The safe harbour percentage is relevant only if the organisation applies funds to purposes that are not specified purposes within New Zealand. Cultural purposes include dramatic, theatrical, operatic, ballet, choral or musical purposes. Benevolent and philanthropic purposes basically mean doing good for other people. This includes organisations that aren't charitable in the strict legal sense, but are popularly seen as charitable, for example, organisations whose proceeds or funds are used to benefit all or a large part of the public. Another condition is that the organisation must not be carried on for the private benefit of any member or an associate of any member. Charities that apply the principal part or all of their funds outside New Zealand must be approved for donee organisation status by Parliament. Approval is limited to organisations whose funds are mainly used for: • the relief of poverty, hunger, sickness or the results of war or natural disaster • the economy of developing countries (as recognised by the United Nations) • raising the educational standards of a developing country. 27 www.ird.govt.nz Inland Revenue considers these applications and makes a recommendation to government. Organisations that are approved are listed in the Income Tax Act. A donee organisation is still liable for income tax on any taxable income it earns from sources outside its own membership if it has no other income tax exemption. There are government guidelines for organisations seeking charitable donee status for their overseas activities. For information on the guidelines go to www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: overseas donee status). Donation tax credit or deduction Gifts of money by individuals Individuals who give cash donations of $5 or more to donee organisations may claim a tax credit of one-third (33.33%) of the total of all donations, up to the amount of their taxable income. To qualify for this tax credit: • the gift must be made in money - gifts of goods or property don't qualify • the gift can't be made under the will of a deceased person • each gift must be $5 or more. However, gifts can still qualify for a tax credit if an arrangement is in place to make a gift of under $5 through regular instalments throughout the year, and the total at the end of the year is $5 or more (eg, if you give $1 each week to your church, making the total contribution for the year $52). Where an employer offers payroll giving, they must make sure all donations are passed to the requested donee organisations. This must be done by the PAYE payment due date closest to the end of the two months from the last day of the pay period when the donation was deducted from their employee's wage. When receipts are issued by the donee organisation they should be in the employer's name and state the donation was made under the payroll giving scheme. The employee doesn't receive a receipt from the donee as they receive a tax credit reducing their PAYE at the time the donation was deducted from their wages. 28 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Gifts of money by certain companies A company (including an unlisted close company), can claim a donation deduction for cash donations it makes to donee organisations. A "close company" is one that has five or fewer shareholders. The maximum donation deduction that can be claimed is limited to the company's net income (ie, income, less expenses, but before the donation deduction is deducted). For more on tax credits on gifts and donations go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: tax credits). Gift of money by Mäori authorities A Mäori authority may claim a deduction against its net income for cash donations it makes to a Mäori association or a donee organisation. The maximum deduction allowed is limited by the Mäori authority's net income (ie, income less expenses, but before the donation deduction is deducted). Receipts Please provide the donor with a receipt that contains: 1. An official stamp or letterhead and the full name of the organisation. Where the local organisation is part of a larger group or organisation, please provide clear reference to this on the receipt. For example, “Relief of Poverty Foundation, Wellington Branch”. 2. The following identifiers for the organisation: a) the DIA-Charities Services registration number, and b) its IRD number 3. A clear statement that the amount received is a donation. Exclude membership subscriptions or fees, purchases of goods or services and raffle tickets as they do not qualify for donation tax credits. 4. The full name of the donor and their address if held 5. The full amount and date of the donation (or if there were regular payments throughout the year you may show the total amount for the income year ending 31 March) 6. The full name, designation (e.g. Treasurer, Secretary), and signature of an authorised person 7. A receipt number, unique to each receipt. 29 www.ird.govt.nz Make sure the organisation: • keeps copies of all receipts issued for seven years. We may wish to inspect or verify issued receipts • does not use correction fluid on or cross out details and write corrections on receipts. Just cancel the incorrect receipt, ensure the donor’s incorrect copy is returned and noted as cancelled in the organisation’s records. Then redo a correct receipt for the donor and your records. • Treasurers and officers should not authorise or sign their own receipts or those relating to their immediate family. • Keep the contact details of authorised persons that oversee donations, such as the secretary or treasurer, up-to-date, as we may wish to contact them to verify receipts. To update Inland Revenue, you may use the form Appoint an Executive Office Holder to act on your behalf (IR401). Eligibility for exemption or donee organisation status Charities registered with Charities Services You don't need to apply to Inland Revenue to confirm your income tax-exempt status. When you register as a charity, as long as they have your IRD number, Charities Services will pass on the details to us so you won't need to contact us separately. In most cases, charities with non-business income only, which are registered with Charities Services, will be eligible for the exemptions. Registered charities carrying out a business will need to consider some limitations and exceptions to the exemption, (summarised on page 29-33), and self-determine their tax position. These details will also show if you're applying for donee organisation status. We'll decide about your status based on this information, and advise you in writing. This is a valuable document for your organisation so keep a copy in a safe place. For more information on tax exemption go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: charitable organisations) 30 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Not registered with Charities Services From 1 April 2020 all organisations with charitable purposes will need to be registered with Charities Services to be considered for donee status. If your organisations has benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes but not charitable purposes, and you want us to consider you as a donee organisation, send us: • an up-to-date, signed copy of your rules, constitution, trust deed or other founding document • a copy of your certificate of incorporation (if incorporated) • a letter requesting donee status • details of how the organisation has been (or will be) operating. We'll consider your application and let you know in writing. The criteria that we look at for donee status is summarised on the following pages. Inland Revenue's criteria There are some specific requirements for your organisation to have donee organisation status and for charities claiming the income tax exemption on business income. In addition to Inland Revenue's rules, your governing document needs to contain certain rules and clauses to register as a charity. For information about the registration criteria go to Charities Services website www.charities.govt.nz or call 0508 242 748. Personal benefits A donee organisation's funds can't be used to provide personal benefit to its members, trustees or associates. Sometimes the aims or powers may allow benefits to members, but they may only benefit to a limited extent from their membership. Some acceptable benefits are newsletters that don't require a subscription, voting rights to appoint officers of the organisation and any benefit also available to the general public. If any member can receive more than these benefits, the organisation can't be considered as a donee organisation. Also, if a member can in any way influence the amount of any benefit they receive, the organisation won't qualify as a donee organisation. 31 www.ird.govt.nz The organisation may pay members for their services, as long as the payments are reasonable, not more than normal commercial rates and for services actually provided. A member may also be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred on the organisation's behalf and earn interest on money lent to the organisation (provided the loan is at a normal commercial rate). If an organisation's rules allow unrestricted benefits to members, a clause preventing this must be added before we'll grant donee organisation status. An example of such a clause is: "(1) All income, benefit, or advantage must be used to advance the charitable purposes of the organisation (2) No member of the organisation, or anyone associated with a member, is allowed to take part in, or influence any decision made by the organisation in respect of payments to, or on behalf of, the member or associated person of any income, benefit, or advantage. (3) Any payments made must be for goods or services that advance the charitable purpose and must be reasonable and relative to payments that would be made between unrelated parties (4) The provisions and effect of this clause shall not be removed from this document and shall be included and implied in any document replacing this document." Altering the rules An organisation may change its rules, constitution or trust deed through a rule alteration clause. To qualify as a donee organisation, this must be worded so any clauses dealing with purposes, benefit to members and winding up can't be changed so that they would affect the requirements for donee organisation status. If the rule alteration clause isn't restricted, we won't grant donee organisation status. The following is a suitable restriction (proviso) for a rule alteration clause: "No addition to or alteration or removal of the rules shall be approved if it detracts from or alters the nature of the organisation." If the organisation is a registered charity or intending to register it won't need a proviso (as above) because all alterations must be sent to Charities Services to comply with the Charities Act. 32 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Purposes limited to New Zealand An organisation seeking donee organisation status must be a society, association, or trust that applies its funds wholly or mainly in New Zealand to promote charitable, benevolent, philanthropic and cultural purposes. If your organisation applies funds for purposes both within and outside New Zealand we advise you to record these separately in your accounts. Any funds applied overseas won't qualify for a tax credit or deduction unless your organisation has been approved as a donee organisation. Some organisations (such as overseas charities) apply all or most of their general funds outside New Zealand. If the organisation sets up a separate fund for use in New Zealand it may qualify as a donee organisation. Winding up If an organisation's rules or constitution allows it to be wound up, the winding-up clause must prevent the funds or assets from passing to a private purpose. This means the rules for a donee organisation must have a clause stating that, on winding up, the income and assets will be held for charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes in New Zealand. When a donee organisation is wound up, any remaining income and assets must be distributed to an organisation that carries on activities wholly or mainly in New Zealand. The organisation receiving the distribution may be either a donee organisation or a charity. However, if the donee organisation is a registered charity the clause must state that, on winding up, the income and assets must be used for charitable purposes in New Zealand. 33 www.ird.govt.nz Business activity Only the business income of a registered charity used for charitable purposes in New Zealand is exempt from tax. Any business income used overseas is liable for income tax. It will also be liable if anyone connected to the organisation: • receives or can receive any type of benefit or income from the organisation, and • can determine or influence the nature or amount of any benefit they receive. However, there are two situations when an organisation may pay someone connected with it (or provide other benefits) without losing its exemption. If the person: • is reimbursed on a reasonable basis for expenses incurred on behalf of the organisation • lends money to the organisation, it may pay interest at normal commercial rates. A person who provides services to the organisation as part of their professional practice can't influence or determine the nature or amount of any benefit they receive. The Public Trustee, the Mäori Trustee and any trustee company are deemed to be carrying on business as a professional public practice. A person is considered connected to a charitable organisation carrying on a business if they are: • the settlor or trustee of a trust • a shareholder or director of a company • a settlor or trustee of a trust who is a shareholder of the company • an associated person of any of these people. There are two further examples where an exemption doesn't apply. • If someone transfers an asset to a trust but retains an interest in the asset, they're considered to be a settlor of the trust and to be gaining a benefit. • If a person connected to the organisation transfers an asset to the organisation but retains an interest in the asset. If the organisation uses the asset to earn rental income, the person will be considered to be receiving a benefit since they still have an interest in the asset. 34 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Part 3 - Income Charitable organisations can receive many types of income, including subscriptions, grants, subsidies, donations or koha, fees, raffle money, trading profits and proceeds from selling assets. Some grants made to non-profit bodies fall within the meaning of an unconditional gift or donation (see page 10) especially if given by charitable trusts. These aren't liable for GST. If you're not sure please contact us to discuss. The table on page 35 shows whether the different types of income are liable for: • income tax (for organisations not entitled to an exemption), and • GST (for those organisations registered for GST). You'll notice that income "exempt from GST" is different from income that's "not liable for GST". This is important when working out your claim for GST input tax credits on goods and services bought to run your organisation. GST-registered non-profit bodies (including charities) may claim input tax credits on expenses incurred in deriving income that's either liable or not liable for GST, but not in deriving income that is exempt from GST. Example A GST-registered charitable organisation receives income from: a government grantliable for GST trading activitiesliable for GST donationsnot liable for GST renting a residential property exempt from GST The charitable organisation can claim a GST input tax credit for all the expenses except those incurred in deriving the rent, which is exempt from GST. Income exempt from GST includes: • income from financial services, including interest from banks and dividends from public companies • proceeds made by a non-profit body from selling goods and services that were donated to it • rent received from residential accommodation. 35 www.ird.govt.nz Table of income types Liable for income tax if no tax exemption applies  Not liable for income tax Liable for GST Not liable for GST Exempt from GST Subscriptions  Donations  Koha  †  Bequests  Grants  Unconditional gifts  Subsidies  \* Suspensory loans  Trading activities  Raffles or housie proceeds  \* Admission fees  Affiliation fees  Sale of donated goods or services  \* Sale of purchased goods  Sale of assets or equipment  Insurance receipts   \* Hall or equipment hire  Rent received (residential)  Rent received (commercial)  Penalty payments (fines)  Advertising or sponsorship  Interest or dividends  Gaming machines  \* Liable in certain situations † The tax treatment of koha depends on what it is.

There are some limitations to this. See pages 24 and 29-33 for more information. 36 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Part 4 - Charity deregistration There are a number of different reasons a charity may be deregistered. The reason will determine the date of deregistration and the tax treatment of the charity from this date. A charity can be deregistered from the Charities Register by: • voluntary deregistration or • Charities Services deregisters it. From 6 April 2016 the tax treatment that applies to a deregistered charity also applies to non-registered charities that stop meeting the specific exemption in section CW 42(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 for business income. For more information on the tax treatment of charities that deregister or charities that stop meeting the business income tax exemption go to www.ird.govt.nz/charitable-organisations Voluntary deregistration A voluntary deregistration is when the charity requests Charities Services to remove them from their register. This can occur when either the charity has: • ceased and is winding up, or • not ceased but no longer operates as a charitable organisation. From 14 April 2014, a charity's voluntary deregistration date will be the day it's removed from the charities register. Deregistered by Charities Services Charities Services will deregister a charity which has failed to comply with the Charities Act 2005. From 1 April 2015 the date of deregistration will be based on the type of non-compliance that occurred as follows: If the charity...the date of deregistration will be... never acted in accordance with its constitution backdated to the start date stopped acting in accordance with its constitution from the date of the change didn't file an annual return.from the date Charities Services removes it from the register. 37 www.ird.govt.nz Court proceedings/appeals If the charity is involved in court proceedings or appealing a decision to deregister it for any of the above reasons, it will be deregistered on the date when all court proceedings or appeals are finished or exhausted. Entities not registered with Charities Services From 6 April 2016 the deregistration tax rules also apply to a non-registered Charity that stops meeting the specific exemption in section CW 42(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 for their business income. Because the deregistration date doesn't apply to these entities, the references to "date of deregistration" below need to be read as the date the charity no longer meets the requirements for an income tax exemption. Tax treatment The charity will have one year from the date of deregistration to dispose of or transfer any assets (including accumulated income) less liabilities for charitable purposes or as set out in its constitution. Otherwise, income tax will be payable one year from the date of deregistration on the net assets which the charity doesn’t dispose of or transfer within that time. From the 1 April 2019 small charities with net assets of $10,000 or less will not be subject to this deregistration tax. Charities with over $10,000 net assets will be subject to tax on the total value of the net assets (including the initial $10,000). There are certain adjustments to exclude certain assets. For example the charity can make an adjustment for any assets, other than money, donated to the charity while it was registered. You make the adjustment by: • taking the entity’s assets (less liabilities) on the end date, • less: – assets disposed of or transferred for charitable purposes within one year of the registration end date. – the value of any assets, other than money, donated to the charity while it was registered, • Record the resulting value of assets in the entity’s income tax return for the period that includes the day one year after the charity was deregistered (or stopped meeting the criteria for its charitable income tax exemption). 38 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Example: $10,000 and under net assets Charity One’s date of deregistration is 1 July 2019. Its balance sheet at 1 July 2019 is shown below. AssetsLiabilities Cash $ 50Loan $ 200 Inventory $ 500Organisations Equity $ 350 The income calculation will be: • Assets $550 less liabilities $200 equals net assets of $350 As deregistration is after 1 April 2019 and net assets are not more than $10,000 no income arises. Example: Assets over $10,000 Charity D’s date of deregistration is 1 July 2019. It’s balance sheet at 1 July 2019 is shown below. AssetsLiabilities Cash $ 10,500Loan $ 200 Inventory $ 500 Equity Land (donated) $ 3,000Organisations equity $ 13,150 One year later no assets have been disposed of or transferred. The income calculation will be: • assets $13,350 less $200 liabilities equals $13,150 • less the value of the donated land ($3,000) = $10,150. Charity D will include $10,150 as income for tax purposes 39 www.ird.govt.nz How to calculate the value of an asset or financial arrangement Example: Depreciable property Charity A registered as a charitable entity in 2013. That same year, it bought office furniture for $50,000 (GST-exclusive) during the first month of the 2013 tax year. In 2018, Charities Services deregistered it because it hadn't complied with its constitution since registering. Charity A still owned the office furniture at the date of deregistration so it must file an income tax return for each year starting from the 2013 year. The value of the cost of premises, plant and equipment at the "date of cessation" must be depreciated, under the general tax rules, for each year it is used in Charity A's business. Using the depreciation rate of 19.2%, the cost of office furniture for each year from 2013 to the present day is: Year201320142015201620172018 Opening value ($)50,00040,40032,64326,37621,31217,220 Depreciation 9,600 7,757 6,267 5,064 4,092 3,306 Year-end balance ($) 40,40032,64326,37621,31217,22013,914 Charity A's assets are worth $50,000 and it applies depreciation of $9,600 in its 2013 income tax return. 40 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Example: Financial arrangement Charity A lent $100,000 to B in 2013. The loan was repayable on demand and the annual interest rate was 10% (compounding). No loan repayments were made. Charity A must account for this loan under the financial arrangement rules in each of the years it had ceased to meet the requirements of being a charity. It must also calculate an opening value using this formula: Consideration paid to person + expenditure - consideration paid by person - income Consideration paid to person is the amount paid to the person before the date the charity ceased. Expenditure is the amount incurred under the financial arrangement rules before the date the charity ceased. Consideration paid by the person is the amount repaid before the date the charity ceased. Income is the amount that would have been derived under the financial arrangement rules before the date the charity ceased. Charity A calculates the loan as follows: Year201320142015201620172018 Opening value ($) 100,000110,000121,000133,100146,410161,051 Interest ($)10,00011,00012,10013,31014,64116,105 Year-end balance ($) 110,000121,000133,100146,410161,051177,156 In 2013 the opening value would be $100,000 and the closing value would be $110,000. Charity A accounts for $10,000 accrued interest income in its 2013 income tax return. 41 www.ird.govt.nz FBT When the deregistered charity is no longer eligible for the FBT exemption, the FBT rules will apply from the date of deregistration as explained earlier. A charity that has deregistered voluntarily will lose their FBT exemption from the date it's removed from the charities register. It will be liable for FBT for the return period from this date onwards. A charity that didn't comply with their constitution will lose its FBT exemption from the date of non-compliance and FBT will apply for the return period from this date. Community housing entity Where a community housing entity no longer meets the requirements of being a charity and is deregistered from the charities register, it may be able to apply for an income tax exemption.

IR255 December 2021 Charitable and donee organisations A tax guide for charities, donee organisations and other groups 3 ird.govt.nz Introduction Charitable organisations have several tax obligations. If you're involved in administering or setting up a charitable trust, estate, society, association or any other type of charitable organisation, this guide will help you. However, this is only a general guide - for more specific issues, refer to other Inland Revenue publications (listed on page 43) or call us - see page 41. Charities Services registers and monitors charitable organisations and provides education and support to the charitable sector. For more information go to page 10 or go to their website charities.govt.nz or call 0508 242 748. In this guide • Part 1 helps you work out what taxes your organisation will have to deal with. • Part 2 explains the exemptions, so you can find out whether your organisation is exempt from income tax. It also tells you about the tax benefits available to people who donate money or property to your organisation. • Part 3 sets out different types of income and explains whether each is liable for income tax or GST (goods and services tax). • Part 4 deals with what happens when a charity is deregistered. • Part 5 Services Inland Revenue provides. The information in this guide is based on current tax laws at the time of printing. 4 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS ird.govt.nz Go to our website for information and to use our services and tools. • Log in or register for myIR - manage your tax and entitlements online. • Calculators and tools - use our calculators, worksheets and tools, for example, to check your tax code, find filing and payment dates, calculate your student loan repayment. • Forms and guides - download our forms and guides.

Associated persons These are: • people related by blood, adoption, marriage or de facto relationships • companies with mainly the same shareholders • a partner and a partnership • trusts and their association with trustees, beneficiaries and settlors. The association rules are complex and it is important that you seek professional advice if you think there is any possibility of an association applying to you. Business Any enterprise or activity intended to make a profit is classed as a business. If an organisation runs a business, it must pay tax on all profits after expenses (except certain transactions made with its members). However, if a charity runs a business, it may be exempt from income tax on any profits that it uses for charitable purposes within New Zealand - see page 23. Charitable organisation or charity This is an organisation (incorporated or not) that carries on charitable activities or exists exclusively for charitable purposes. Generally to obtain tax benefits, charities must be registered by the Charities Services. Many organisations consider themselves charitable because of the work they do or because they're registered under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957. As a result, they may also think they're exempt from income tax. However, an organisation is generally only exempt from income tax if it's registered with Charities Services, or if registration with Charities Services is unavailable (for example, because the entity is a non-resident), has been granted an exemption from Inland Revenue. This exemption does not apply to GST or PAYE. The organisation must still account for these. 7 ird.govt.nz Charitable purposes These include: • the relief of poverty • the advancement of education • the advancement of religion • activities for the benefit of the community. An organisation's purposes must fall within one of these categories to be charitable. Its activities or aims must be for public purposes and the benefit must be available to a large section of the community. In addition, it must not be carried on for the benefit or profit of any individual. If the beneficiaries are limited by blood ties the charitable purpose can still be met in some circumstances. Charitable purpose of marae A marae has a charitable purpose if: • the physical structure of the marae is on land that is a Mäori reservation, and • the funds of the marae are not used for a purpose other than the administration and maintenance of the land and of the physical structure of the marae or another charitable purpose. Charities Services (previously known as the Charities Commission) This is part of the Department of Internal Affairs and provides; • a registration and monitoring system for charitable organisations, • collection and processing of Annual Returns, and • support and education to the charitable sector on good governance, and management practice. Community housing entity A trustee, or a company whose activities are mainly the provision of housing, who meet specific criteria and are registered under the Housing Restructuring and Tenancy Matters Act 1992. They may be a registered charity or alternatively contact Inland Revenue to confirm if they qualify under a specific income tax exemption for community housing entities. 8 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Deregistration There are certain tax implications that apply when an organisation ceases to be a registered charity. For the purposes of this booklet, the deregistration rules outlined in part 4 apply to a charity that: • has been removed from the Charities Register by Charities Services, or • voluntarily deregisters, or • no longer meets the criteria for the income tax exemption for business income under section CW 42 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Donee organisation This is an organisation Inland Revenue considers having met the requirements set out in the Income Tax Act 2007. Generally, a donee organisation is one which applies its funds wholly or mainly to charitable, benevolent, philanthropy or cultural purposes within New Zealand. Certain other organisations may also qualify, such as a school board of trustees, tertiary education institutes or community housing entities. Individuals, companies and Ma ̄ ori authorities can get tax benefits by making gifts of money to a donee organisation - see page 25. Donor A person, company or other organisation that gives money or property to another. Incorporated organisations Organisations registered with the Companies Office of the Ministry of Economic Development are classed as incorporated organisations. For more information about becoming incorporated, see societies.govt.nz Non-profit body or Not for Profit organisations A non-profit body is any society, association or organisation (incorporated or not): • that is not carried on for the profit or gain of any member, and • whose rules do not allow money, property or any other benefit to be distributed to any of its members. Organisation This is a general term, which covers all types of societies, institutions, companies, estates, trusts, funds, whether or not they have a charitable nature or are considered tax-exempt. 9 ird.govt.nz Payroll giving Payroll giving is a voluntary scheme where employees can make donations from their pay to support approved donee organisations. People who donate through payroll giving receive immediate tax credits relating to the donations they make each payday. Registered charity A trust, society or institution that is registered by Charities Services under the Charities Act. This is not the same as trusts registered with the Ministry of Business Innovation & Employment under the Charitable Trust Act. Residual income tax Residual income tax is the amount payable for the year, after deducting any tax credits from income tax assessed, but before deducting any provisional tax paid. Taxable activity Any activity carried on continuously or regularly that supplies (or intends to supply) goods and services to others for some form of payment (but not necessarily for a profit) is a taxable activity. Businesses, trades and professions are all taxable activities. Charitable organisations of any type can carry on taxable activities. Setting up a business is part of the taxable activity, as is the closing down and sale of a business. Taxable activities do not include: • employment as a salary or wage-earner • hobby activities • the occasional sale of domestic or private assets • making GST-exempt supplies such as residential rent or financial services. Turnover Turnover is the total gross value of all goods and services supplied, excluding GST. It includes: • goods and services sold or provided in New Zealand • exported goods • grants or subsidies • non-monetary items received under barter arrangements. 10 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Charities Act The Charities Act 2005 established a Charities Commission, now known as Charities Services, who provide: • a registration and monitoring system for charitable organisations • support and education for the charitable sector on good governance and management. Charities Services has published A guide to the Charities Act, which you can download from charities.govt.nz or order a copy by calling 0508 242 748. Charities Services also set up a Charities Register. Registration is voluntary but, unregistered charities are not eligible for tax exemptions on the grounds of charitable purposes. Charitable organisations can apply for registration online at charities.govt.nz or by posting a completed application form, with a copy of their rules, to Charities Services. Send an officer certification form for each officer of the organisation. You can get details about registration and copies of forms from Charities Services at charities.govt.nz or by calling 0508 242 748. Turnover for GST purposes does not include: • GST-exempt goods and services • unconditional gifts received. See page 15 for the treatment of assets. Unconditional gift An unconditional gift is a donation or payment made voluntarily to any non-profit body, where there's no identifiable direct benefit to the donor or the donor's family. Some unconditional gifts can be: • donations or koha • money from door-to-door appeals and street collections • bequests • voluntary school fees (but not school activity fees). Subscriptions, payments from trading activities and payments made by the Crown or a public authority are not unconditional gifts for GST purposes. 11 ird.govt.nz Part 1 - Basic tax information Whatever type of charitable organisation you're setting up or running, you'll usually have some tax obligations. These may include: • making several tax payments each year - some of these may be for your organisation's own tax liability, others may be on behalf of its employees • filing various return forms each year - these may be for income tax, GST, PAYE and/or FBT • calculating the profit from any business to work out how much tax is due - this is explained in our Smart business - IR320 guide and there is also some information in Part 3 of this guide • keeping certain business records - see page 20 for more information on this. This part of the guide explains all these obligations and gives you other general tax information you need to know. Income tax Charitable organisations are liable for income tax if they are not within the meaning of a “tax charity”. To be a tax charity means the organisation is either: • a registered charity, or • a non-resident charity that has been approved by Inland Revenue, or • a business that is carried on by, or for the benefit of a registered charity, for example a company which is fully owned by a tax charity. (From 1 April 2020 the business will need to be a registered charity itself to qualify) A charitable organisation is not exempt for income tax on business income applied for charitable purposes outside New Zealand - see page 29. Other benefits The Income Tax Act 2007 contains specific income tax exemptions for charities. Some of these exemptions give benefits to charitable organisations and some give benefits to people, certain companies, or Mäori authorities who make donations to such organisations. The "Tax benefits" section on page 23 of this guide gives more detail on these main conditions. It also covers other benefits available such as exemption from: • FBT (fringe benefit tax) on certain fringe benefits, and • RWT (resident withholding tax) on interest and dividends. 12 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS The Tax benefits section also covers any criteria and limitations to these exemptions. Your organisation may still be liable for other taxes, such as GST and PAYE. If your organisation is not entitled to any tax exemptions, it will be liable for income tax on some types of income it earns. Part 3 of this guide will help you work out which types of income are taxable. Income tax rates If a charitable organisation is incorporated under the Incorporated Societies Act 1908 or Companies Act 1993, then it's considered to be a company for income tax purposes. If it does not qualify for a tax exemption, its income is taxed at the company rate. Organisations that operate as trusts, including trusts incorporated under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957 and are not tax-exempt are liable for tax on trustee's income. Our guide Trusts and estates income tax rules - IR288 gives you more information about this. Charitable organisations not incorporated under a specific Act are treated as unincorporated charitable organisations. If such an organisation is not entitled to a tax exemption, it will be liable for income tax at the same rate as an individual taxpayer. However, it will not qualify for any of the tax credits that individual taxpayers can claim. For more information on individual and PAYE rates go to ird.govt.nz/tax-rates If a non-exempt organisation's residual income tax for a financial year is more than $5,000, it may have to pay provisional tax for the following year. For more information on provisional tax, read our guide Provisional tax - IR289 Filing income tax returns Generally, if your organisation is a tax charity, it's exempt from income tax. You do not need to file an income tax return unless we request one or you have income that is not covered by the exemption. You need to be registered by Charities Services to be eligible for an income tax exemption. If your organisation is not a tax charity or is a tax charity but receives non-exempt income, it will be required to file a return You must include a copy of the financial accounts with the tax return. You must include a copy of the financial accounts with the tax return. Instead of accounts, you can use our Schedule of business income - IR3B or Rental income schedule - IR3R form to work out the gross income and allowable deductions for these activities. We also provide an Financial statements summary - IR10 form, which you can use instead of sending us a set of accounts. Using an IR10 will speed up the tax return processing time. 13 ird.govt.nz Companies must file an IR4 tax return, estates or trusts must file an IR6 tax return, and any other society or association must file an IR 9 tax return. If your organisation does not receive a taxpack, you can order one by calling our 0800 self-service numbers - see page 41. If your organisation has a balance date between October and March, you must send your tax return to us by 7 July. For other approved balance dates (see page 21), send us the return by the seventh day of the fourth month after your balance date. If a tax agent completes the return, we may extend the due date. This is because most tax agents have extensions of time for filing their clients' tax returns. GST (goods and services tax) GST is a tax on most goods and services in New Zealand. It's charged and accounted for by GST-registered businesses or organisations, known as taxable activities. They calculate the amount of GST they have charged and pay it to us. They can also claim back the GST they incur as part of their taxable activity. To check the current GST rate go to ird.govt.nz/gst Registering for GST If your charitable organisation runs a taxable activity with an annual turnover (total income before expenses) of $60,000 or more, it must register for GST. You must also register for GST if you think your organisation's turnover for the next 12 months will be over $60,000. Registration is voluntary for organisations with turnover under this figure. A taxable activity is any activity continuously or regularly carried on by your charitable organisation that supplies, or intends to supply, goods and services to someone else for a consideration – it does not have to be an activity carried on with the intention of making a profit. To work out turnover, only include income liable for GST (including amounts which would be zero-rated). Do not include any income not liable for or exempt from GST. For example, include income from trading activities (both with members and non- members), subscriptions, grants and subsidies, but exclude income from donations, koha, bequests, residential rent, interest and dividends. You can register for GST online through myIR secure online services. To register for a myIR account visit ird.govt.nz/myir 14 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Registration of branches and divisions Generally, if an organisation operates through separate branches or divisions, they may each register separately for GST. If the total turnover of all the branches or divisions is more than $60,000 your organisation must register for GST. Non-profit bodies (including charitable organisations) may apply to us in writing to treat each branch or division separately, and only register the individual branches with a turnover of more than $60,000. However, branches with a turnover of less than $60,000 may still register voluntarily. To register separately, each branch or division must: • have its own independent accounting system, and • be separately identified by its location or by the different activities it undertakes. Voluntary registration The advantage of voluntary registration is that charitable organisations may get frequent refunds of GST. This may happen when a charity runs a taxable activity and receives income liable for GST, but also receives donations or koha (unconditional gifts), which are not liable for GST. The charity can claim a GST credit for most of its expenses, but it only pays GST on its taxable activity income. However, charitable organisations need to be aware of the possible disadvantages of voluntary registration. • The organisation must use GST invoices, retain records and file GST returns. • When you stop your registration, you must pay GST on the open (current) market value of any business assets you keep for private use. If you acquired the asset before 1 October 1986, the adjustment would be the lesser of cost price and the open market value. • Accounting for GST becomes difficult if non-liable income is involved, or if some assets are used for exempt purposes and others for business purposes. • If someone within the organisation completes the GST returns, there may be problems if that person's services become unavailable and their experience is lost. For more help You'll find more information on registering branches and divisions separately, or on voluntary registration, in our GST - do you need to register? - IR365 factsheet. 15 ird.govt.nz GST and assets Generally, if you’re registered, GST can be claimed on the purchase of a business asset or for expenses relating to that asset. If you do claim GST on an asset or on expenses relating to that asset, you’ll have to pay GST on the sale of the asset or equivalent event such as an insurance pay out. For further information go to ird.govt.nz/gst Employing staff If your organisation employs staff, you must register with us as an employer. You can register online at ird.govt.nz/myir or complete an Employer registration - IR334 form. Your tax obligations as an employer are as follows: • Ask new employees to fill in a Tax code declaration - IR330, which will tell you the tax code to use and the rate for deducting tax from their wages. If any employees do not fill in an IR330, you must deduct tax from their wages at the non-notified rate of 45% (not including employees' ACC earners' levy). • Ask new contractors who receive schedular payments to fill in a Tax rate notification for contractors - IR330C, this tells you the rate of tax to deduct from their schedular payments. If any contractors do not provide you with an IR330C, you must deduct tax from their schedular payments at the non-notified rate. This rate is 20% for non-resident contractor companies, and 45% for all other contractors. You'll need to fill out a New employee details - IR346 form for each new employee and send it to us either: • before their first pay day; or • with the Employment information - IR348 form that includes their first pay. You’ll need their name, KiwiSaver status, IRD number, tax code and contact details. Include their date of birth if they have provided you with this information. After you submit your first Employment information - IR348, this information will be automatically shown on your subsequent IR348 forms. 16 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS • Deduct PAYE from your employees' wages, and pay it to us either once or twice a month, depending on the total amount of wages paid. PAYE includes the ACC earners' levy to cover the cost of employees' non-work injuries. • Complete an Employment information - IR348 form with details of the required deductions for each employee. You can file your IR348 electronically through myIR. • Pay fringe benefit tax (FBT) on any fringe benefits (perks) you give your employees - see page 17. • Deduct child support payments and student loan repayments from employees' wages if required. • Automatically enrol new employees who are eligible to join KiwiSaver and deduct their KiwiSaver contributions from their pay. • If you're making KiwiSaver employee deductions or employer contributions you need to send these to us with the PAYE. • Pay employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) on any employer cash contributions made to a superannuation scheme. For more information on your obligations as an employer, see the Employer's guide - IR335 Employees and contractors If any members of your organisation carry out paid work, they're treated as employees. PAYE must be deducted from the payments they receive. If the organisation gives board and lodging rather than money to any employees for their work, generally you must work out the gross value of the benefit given to them, calculate PAYE based on this amount and pay it to us - see the "Allowances" section in the Employer's guide - IR335 Other benefits paid to replace wages may be liable for FBT - see page 17. An exception to this is for certain benefits received by members of religious orders - see page 29 for more information. PAYE deducted from your employees' wages does not belong to your organisation, it must not be used for anything other than payment to us. If a self-employed contractor does a job for the organisation, this generally does not make the organisation an employer. However, if the job is one of those listed on the back of the Tax rate notification for contractors - IR330C, you must deduct tax and pay this to us. You must also ask the contractor to complete the IR330C. If they've completed the IR330C and have chosen their own tax rate on page 1, deduct tax at that rate. Note: there are minimum tax rates that apply, refer to the Employer's 17 ird.govt.nz guide - IR335 If they've completed the IR330C and have not chosen a tax rate, use the standard rate listed on the back of the IR330C. If the contractor shows you a current Certificate of exemption - IR331 or is a company (not in the agricultural industry), you do not need to deduct tax. A certificate of exemption can not apply to any payments made under a labour hire arrangement by a labour hire business. If the type of work done is not listed on the IR330C, you do not need to deduct tax as the contractor is responsible for paying the tax. Some workers call themselves self-employed contractors or something similar, so their employers will not deduct PAYE. If, as the employer, the organisation has control over the work done, including what the person does and how, and where it's done, the worker is almost certainly an employee and is liable for PAYE. It's illegal to treat a true employee as self-employed to avoid deducting tax. If you're not sure whether a worker is a true employee, read Part 1 of the Employer's guide - IR335 and our leaflet, Self-employed or an employee? - IR336 Employer's superannuation cash contribution (employer contribution) An employer contribution is money paid by the employer to a superannuation fund, for the benefit of their employees. If your employees ask you to make deductions from their wages and pay them to a superannuation scheme, these are not employer contributions. Any employer contribution an employer makes to a superannuation fund for the benefit of an employee is liable for tax. There are several options for taxing these contributions - see the Employer's guide - IR335 for more information. A "superannuation fund" is a scheme that has been registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. For more detailed information about superannuation fund contributions, refer to the Employer's guide - IR335 FBT (fringe benefit tax) Charitable organisations are generally exempt from paying FBT on any benefits provided to employees while they're carrying out the organisation's charitable activities. For example, if an employee has the use of a car while carrying out charitable work for the organisation, any private benefit arising is not subject to FBT. The exemption does not apply to any short-term charge facilities provided to employees of your charitable organisation above a certain threshold. This includes vouchers and store value cards, for example, petrol and supermarket voucher cards, 18 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Prezzy™ cards. For more information see Part 4 of our Fringe benefit tax guide - IR409 However, if your organisation operates a business which is outside its charitable, benevolent, cultural or philanthropic purposes and provides fringe benefits to any person employed in that business, FBT must be paid on those benefits. For example, if that business provides a car as part of a salary package, for use with its business activities, FBT must be paid on any private benefit. GST on fringe benefits If an organisation is registered for both GST and FBT, it must make an adjustment for GST in its FBT returns for fringe benefits provided (unless the benefits are GST-exempt or zero-rated). See Part 8 of our Fringe benefit tax guide - IR409 for more information. Entertainment expenses If your organisation is not fully income tax exempt, only 50% of entertainment expenses that are not subject to FBT are deductible for income tax purposes. For more information, read our Entertainment expenses - IR268 guide. RWT (resident withholding tax) Charitable organisations registered with Charities Services are eligible for RWT exempt status. This means if your charitable organisation has money deposited in a bank or other financial institution, or has shares in a company, your organisation can receive interest or dividends without having RWT deducted. When Charities Services registers or deregisters an organisation as charitable, they inform us. We accept their decision and approve or cancel RWT exempt status. The IRD number of everyone with RWT exempt status is listed on the RWT exemption register on our website at ird.govt.nz/rwt-exemption Payers of investment income (for example, banks) access this register to confirm which of their customers are exempt from having RWT deducted. You may also like to tell anyone paying you interest or dividends about your exemption, so they stop deducting RWT. For more help Our Resident withholding tax on interest (RWT) payer's guide - IR283 has the information you'll need if your organisation pays interest and deducts RWT. 19 ird.govt.nz NRWT (non-resident withholding tax) If your organisation pays interest, dividends or royalties to a non-resident, this is called non-resident passive income and your organisation must deduct NRWT. For more information on NRWT go to ird.govt.nz/nrwt or read our NRWT – payer’s guide - IR291 You can also contact our Non-resident Centre if you want to know more about the New Zealand tax residency rules for deducting and paying NRWT: Email nonres@ird.govt.nz Phone 03 951 2020 For more help These guides will help if you have questions about residency or NRWT: • New Zealand tax residence - IR292 • NRWT - payer's guide - IR291 • Visitor's tax guide - IR294 20 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS General information Record keeping You must keep sufficient records to calculate the income, expenses and GST liability of your charitable organisation, and to enable us to confirm your accounts if necessary. The records you need to keep are: • receipt and payment account books • bank statements • invoices (including GST tax invoices) • receipts • any other necessary documents to confirm entries in your accounts • stock take figures for the end of the financial year • wage records for all employees, including KiwiSaver records • interest and dividend payment records. For GST you do not need to hold a tax invoice for items costing less than $50 but you do need to maintain a record of such payments. For income tax, you should have invoices for all expenses, whatever the amount. Note You must hold all records for seven years, even if you cease operating (except for incorporated organisations that have been wound up and dissolved). We can also extend the period you must keep records for if we intend to audit or investigate your organisation. If this is the case, we'll write and tell you what records to keep. All your records must be in English, unless we give you written approval to use another language. Any charitable or donee organisation (see pages 6 to 8) must also keep a record of: • the sources of any donations made to it, and • how its funds have been used, within New Zealand or overseas. If we request it to, the organisation should be able to fill in a tax return and identify the source and end use of all its funds. It's important to keep all this information as we routinely audit these records. 21 ird.govt.nz If you file your tax returns electronically, you must keep a paper copy of the return (and supporting records) for seven years. Note You can read more about audits on our website at ird.govt.nz/audits IRD numbers No matter what type of charitable organisation you're running, it will need an IRD number. You may also use that IRD number for GST, PAYE, FBT or RWT purposes. You’ll need an IRD number for Charities Services when applying for charitable registration. To get an IRD number, you'll need to send us a completed IRD number application - resident non-individual - IR596 form. If you're incorporating a new company online through the Companies Office website, you can apply for an IRD number at the same time. Or, you can complete the IR596 form online, print, sign and send it to us. You'll need to provide a photocopy of one of the following: • certificate of incorporation • deed of trust • certificate of registration. You must also supply the names, addresses and personal IRD numbers of each shareholder, director, trustee or executive office holder. Balance dates For most taxpayers, the accounting year ends on 31 March - the balance date. If you want a balance date for your organisation other than 31 March, you must apply to us in writing, stating your reasons. We usually only approve a change if there are sound business reasons for doing so, or if your business activity is in an industry where there is a recognised balance date other than 31 March. Due dates Some organisations may have to file returns and make payments to us for several tax types. To keep track of the due dates for payments and returns, use the calculator on ird.govt.nz or our Tax due date calendar - IR328 22 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Part 2 - Tax benefits Tax legislation benefits charities by allowing them income tax exemptions. It also allows a tax credit or deduction for donations by individuals, companies or Mäori authorities to donee organisations. Note that a charity may also be a donee organisation but will need to register with Charity Services to be one. If an organisation with charitable purposes is on Inland Revenue’s approved donee list, but is not registered with Charities Services, it will need to register by 1 April 2020 to retain its donee status. This part of the guide explains how these benefits work and the conditions an organisation must meet to get a particular benefit. Charities To qualify for an exemption from income tax, trustees of a trust must derive income for charitable purposes, and societies or institutions must be established and maintained exclusively for charitable purposes. A charitable purpose is where the rules of an organisation clearly state that its purposes are for one or more of the following: • the relief of poverty • the advancement of education • the advancement of religion • any other matters that are beneficial to the community. The organisation's aims must also be for a public purpose except where they are for the relief of poverty. The benefit must be available to a large part of the community and the activities must not result in the private benefit or profit of any individual. You'll find further information about charitable purposes on the Charities Services website at charities.govt.nz 23 ird.govt.nz Income tax for charities Non-business (investment) income Registered charities are exempt from income tax on non-business income such as interest, dividends and rents. They may use the non-business income for charitable purposes in and outside New Zealand and still keep the income tax exemption. Business income The portion of a registered charity's business income which is used for charitable purposes in New Zealand is exempt from income tax. If an organisation uses its business income for charitable purposes outside New Zealand as well, only the New Zealand part is exempt. Business income will not be exempt if anyone connected with the charitable organisation: • receives or can receive any type of benefit or income from the organisation, and • can determine or influence the nature or amount of any benefit they receive. Page 28 has more details about the limitations to this exemption. These exemptions only apply to the charitable organisation's income. They do not apply to any other earned income passed on to a charitable organisation for charitable purposes. The people or organisation who earned the income must pay tax on it. However, the gifting of this income may qualify for a donation tax credit or deduction - see page 26. Income derived from a business carried on by, or for, or for the benefit of a charitable organisation is exempt from income tax. From 1 April 2020 to qualify for or retain this exemption the business will need to register with Charities Services in its own right. It will no longer be sufficient that the income is for the benefit of a registered charitable organisation. Non-resident charities Non-resident charities that only carry out charitable purposes outside New Zealand may not be able to be registered with Charities Services because they: • are not established in New Zealand, and • do not have a strong connection with New Zealand. In these circumstances we may be able to approve an income tax exemption for non- business income if the entity meets certain criteria. 24 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS You can find out more about the criteria and the application process at ird.govt.nz/non-resident-charities Non-resident charities with business income used to carry out charitable purposes in New Zealand must be registered with Charities Services to be eligible for an income tax exemption on that income. This exemption covers both business and non-business income used for charitable purposes in New Zealand, but not business income applied overseas. Charitable estates The executor or administrator of a deceased person's estate may derive income from any money or assets left to charitable organisations while the will is being finalised. If the organisation benefiting from the will is entitled to an income tax exemption, the income derived while the funds are held awaiting finalisation is also exempt. This exemption only covers the income derived from the money or assets of the estate that have been left to the charity. The estate must still pay tax on any income it earns from other assets or money. If the trustees want to confirm their tax exemption they need to send us, during that intervening period, a copy of the deceased's will and the following details: • details of any charity that will receive gifts under the will and the amount they will receive • the rights of the various beneficiaries under the will • the net value (after debts and liabilities) of the estate available to be distributed to the beneficiaries • the shares and the prospective shares of the beneficiaries in the income and assets of the estate. Gifts to charities Gift duty was repealed for gifts made after 1 October 2011. If your organisation needs information on the tax implications for gifts made before this date, then you can contact us for further information. 25 ird.govt.nz Donee organisations When an organisation is considered a donee organisation for tax purposes, any gifts of money it receives from individuals, Ma ̄ ori authorities and certain companies, qualify for tax advantages. You will need to apply to Inland Revenue for approval to become a donee organisation. See pages 26 and 27 for more information on these tax benefits. An organisation does not have to be a registered charity to be eligible for donee organisation status. However, from 1 April 2020 if the organisation has only charitable purposes it must register as a charity to obtain donee status. A donee organisation must be a New Zealand society, institution, association, organisation, trust or fund. Its funds must be applied wholly or mainly to charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes in New Zealand. This means that the organisation's aims or purposes should be carried out in New Zealand, even if this results in paying money outside New Zealand to achieve these purposes. Inland Revenue administers the “wholly or mainly” requirement on a “safe harbour” basis of “75% or more”. This means Inland Revenue will generally accept that an organisation meeting or exceeding the safe harbour percentage of 75% has wholly or mainly applied funds to specified purposes within New Zealand. This applies to and from the 2019/20 income year. For more information, see our Interpretation Statement IS 18/05 – Income tax – donee organisations and its accompanying fact sheet on applying the “safe harbour” approach. These can be found at taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/safe-harbour The safe harbour percentage is relevant only if the organisation applies funds to purposes that are not specified purposes within New Zealand. Cultural purposes include dramatic, theatrical, operatic, ballet, choral or musical purposes. Benevolent and philanthropic purposes basically mean doing good for other people. This includes organisations that are not charitable in the strict legal sense, but are popularly seen as charitable, for example, organisations whose proceeds or funds are used to benefit all or a large part of the public. Another condition is that the organisation must not be carried on for the private benefit of any member or an associate of any member. Charities that apply the principal part or all of their funds outside New Zealand must be approved for donee organisation status by Parliament. Approval is limited to organisations whose funds are mainly used for: • the relief of poverty, hunger, sickness or the results of war or natural disaster • the economy of developing countries (as recognised by the United Nations) 26 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS • raising the educational standards of a developing country. Inland Revenue considers these applications and makes a recommendation to government. Organisations that are approved are listed in the Income Tax Act. A donee organisation is still liable for income tax on any taxable income it earns from sources outside its own membership if it has no other income tax exemption. There are government guidelines for organisations seeking charitable donee status for their overseas activities. For information on the guidelines go to ird.govt.nz/overseas-donee-status Donation tax credit or deduction Gifts of money by individuals Individuals who give cash donations of $5 or more to donee organisations may claim a tax credit of one-third (33.33%) of the total of all donations, up to the amount of their taxable income. To qualify for this tax credit: • the gift must be made in money - gifts of goods or property do not qualify • the gift can not be made under the will of a deceased person • each gift must be $5 or more. However, gifts can still qualify for a tax credit if an arrangement is in place to make a gift of under $5 through regular instalments throughout the year, and the total at the end of the year is $5 or more (for example, if you give $1 each week to your church, making the total contribution for the year $52). Where an employer offers payroll giving, they must make sure all donations are passed to the requested donee organisations. This must be done by the PAYE payment due date closest to the end of the two months from the last day of the pay period when the donation was deducted from their employee's wage. When receipts are issued by the donee organisation they should be in the employer's name and state the donation was made under the payroll giving scheme. The employee does not receive a receipt from the donee as they receive a tax credit reducing their PAYE at the time the donation was deducted from their wages. 27 ird.govt.nz Gifts of money by certain companies A company (including an unlisted close company), can claim a donation deduction for cash donations it makes to donee organisations. A "close company" is one that has five or fewer shareholders. The maximum donation deduction that can be claimed is limited to the company's net income (that is, income, less expenses, but before the donation deduction is deducted). For more on tax credits on gifts and donations go to ird.govt.nz/donations Gift of money by Mäori authorities A Mäori authority may claim a deduction against its net income for cash donations it makes to a Mäori association or a donee organisation. The maximum deduction allowed is limited by the Mäori authority's net income (that is, income less expenses, but before the donation deduction is deducted). Receipts Please provide the donor with a receipt that contains: 1. An official stamp or letterhead and the full name of the organisation. Where the local organisation is part of a larger group or organisation, please provide clear reference to this on the receipt. For example, “Relief of Poverty Foundation, Wellington Branch”. 2. The following identifiers for the organisation: a) the DIA-Charities Services registration number, and b) its IRD number 3. A clear statement that the amount received is a donation. Exclude membership subscriptions or fees, purchases of goods or services and raffle tickets as they do not qualify for donation tax credits. 4. The full name of the donor and their address if held 5. The full amount and date of the donation (or if there were regular payments throughout the year you may show the total amount for the income year ending 31 March) 6. The full name, designation (for example, Treasurer, Secretary), and signature of an authorised person 7. A receipt number, unique to each receipt. 28 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Make sure the organisation: • keeps copies of all receipts issued for seven years. We may wish to inspect or verify issued receipts • does not use correction fluid on or cross out details and write corrections on receipts. Just cancel the incorrect receipt, ensure the donor’s incorrect copy is returned and noted as cancelled in the organisation’s records. Then redo a correct receipt for the donor and your records. • Treasurers and officers should not authorise or sign their own receipts or those relating to their immediate family. • Keep the contact details of authorised persons that oversee donations, such as the secretary or treasurer, up-to-date, as we may wish to contact them to verify receipts. To update Inland Revenue, you may use the form Appoint an Executive Office Holder to act on your behalf - IR401 Eligibility for exemption or donee organisation status Charities registered with Charities Services You do not need to apply to Inland Revenue to confirm your income tax-exempt status. When you register as a charity, as long as they have your IRD number, Charities Services will pass on the details to us so you will not need to contact us separately. In most cases, charities with non-business income only, which are registered with Charities Services, will be eligible for the exemptions. Registered charities carrying out a business will need to consider some limitations and exceptions to the exemption, (summarised on pages 28-31), and self-determine their tax position. These details will also show if you're applying for donee organisation status. We'll decide about your status based on this information, and advise you in writing. This is a valuable document for your organisation so keep a copy in a safe place. For more information on tax exemption go to ird.govt.nz/charity-services 29 ird.govt.nz Basic necessities for members of religious organisations If certain conditions are met, a member of a religious society or order can be provided with board, lodging and/or basic personal necessities, and receive these tax exempt. This only applies when the member is unpaid, their only occupation is service in that religious society or order, and it is the nature of the service that members are not paid or rewarded for their work. For more information on this tax exemption, go to ird.govt.nz/exempt-income- religious-organisations Not registered with Charities Services From 1 April 2020 all organisations with charitable purposes will need to be registered with Charities Services to be considered for donee status. If your organisations has benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes but not charitable purposes, and you want us to consider you as a donee organisation, send us: • an up-to-date, signed copy of your rules, constitution, trust deed or other founding document • a copy of your certificate of incorporation (if incorporated) • a letter requesting donee status • details of how the organisation has been (or will be) operating. We'll consider your application and let you know in writing. The criteria that we  look at for donee status is summarised on the following pages. Inland Revenue's criteria There are some specific requirements for your organisation to have donee organisation status and for charities claiming the income tax exemption on business income. In addition to Inland Revenue's rules, your governing document needs to contain certain rules and clauses to register as a charity. For information about the registration criteria go to Charities Services website charities.govt.nz or call 0508 242 748. Personal benefits A donee organisation's funds can not be used to provide personal benefit to its members, trustees or associates. Sometimes the aims or powers may allow benefits to members, but they may only benefit to a limited extent from their membership. Some acceptable benefits are 30 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS newsletters that do not require a subscription, voting rights to appoint officers of the organisation and any benefit also available to the general public. If any member can receive more than these benefits, the organisation can not be considered as a donee organisation. Also, if a member can in any way influence the amount of any benefit they receive, the organisation will not qualify as a donee organisation. The organisation may pay members for their services, as long as the payments are reasonable, not more than normal commercial rates and for services actually provided. A member may also be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred on the organisation's behalf and earn interest on money lent to the organisation (provided the loan is at a normal commercial rate). If an organisation's rules allow unrestricted benefits to members, a clause preventing this must be added before we'll grant donee organisation status. An example of such a clause is: "(1) All income, benefit, or advantage must be used to advance the charitable purposes of the organisation (2) No member of the organisation, or anyone associated with a member, is allowed to take part in, or influence any decision made by the organisation in respect of payments to, or on behalf of, the member or associated person of any income, benefit, or advantage. (3) Any payments made must be for goods or services that advance the charitable purpose and must be reasonable and relative to payments that would be made between unrelated parties (4) The provisions and effect of this clause shall not be removed from this document and shall be included and implied in any document replacing this document." Altering the rules An organisation may change its rules, constitution or trust deed through a rule alteration clause. To qualify as a donee organisation, this must be worded so any clauses dealing with purposes, benefit to members and winding up can not be changed so that they would affect the requirements for donee organisation status. If the rule alteration clause is not restricted, we will not grant donee organisation status. The following is a suitable restriction (proviso) for a rule alteration clause: 31 ird.govt.nz "No addition to or alteration or removal of the rules shall be approved if it detracts from or alters the nature of the organisation." If the organisation is a registered charity or intending to register it will not need a proviso (as above) because all alterations must be sent to Charities Services to comply with the Charities Act. Purposes limited to New Zealand An organisation seeking donee organisation status must be a society, association, or trust that applies its funds wholly or mainly in New Zealand to promote charitable, benevolent, philanthropic and cultural purposes. If your organisation applies funds for purposes both within and outside New Zealand we advise you to record these separately in your accounts. Any funds applied overseas will not qualify for a tax credit or deduction unless your organisation has been approved as a donee organisation. Some organisations (such as overseas charities) apply all or most of their general funds outside New Zealand. If the organisation sets up a separate fund for use in New Zealand it may qualify as a donee organisation. Winding up If an organisation's rules or constitution allows it to be wound up, the winding-up clause must prevent the funds or assets from passing to a private purpose. This means the rules for a donee organisation must have a clause stating that, on winding up, the income and assets will be held for charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes in New Zealand. When a donee organisation is wound up, any remaining income and assets must be distributed to an organisation that carries on activities wholly or mainly in New Zealand. The organisation receiving the distribution may be either a donee organisation or a charity. However, if the donee organisation is a registered charity the clause must state that, on winding up, the income and assets must be used for charitable purposes in New Zealand. 32 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Business activity Only the business income of a registered charity used for charitable purposes in New Zealand is exempt from tax. Any business income used overseas is liable for income tax. It will also be liable if anyone connected to the organisation: • receives or can receive any type of benefit or income from the organisation, and • can determine or influence the nature or amount of any benefit they receive. However, there are two situations when an organisation may pay someone connected with it (or provide other benefits) without losing its exemption. If the person: • is reimbursed on a reasonable basis for expenses incurred on behalf of the organisation • lends money to the organisation, it may pay interest at normal commercial rates. A person who provides services to the organisation as part of their professional practice can not influence or determine the nature or amount of any benefit they receive. The Public Trustee, the Mäori Trustee and any trustee company are deemed to be carrying on business as a professional public practice. A person is considered connected to a charitable organisation carrying on a business if they are: • the settlor or trustee of a trust • a shareholder or director of a company • a settlor or trustee of a trust who is a shareholder of the company • an associated person of any of these people. There are two further examples where an exemption does not apply. • If someone transfers an asset to a trust but retains an interest in the asset, they're considered to be a settlor of the trust and to be gaining a benefit. • If a person connected to the organisation transfers an asset to the organisation but retains an interest in the asset. If the organisation uses the asset to earn rental income, the person will be considered to be receiving a benefit since they still have an interest in the asset. 33 ird.govt.nz Part 3 - Income Charitable organisations can receive many types of income, including subscriptions, grants, subsidies, donations or koha, fees, raffle money, trading profits and proceeds from selling assets. Some grants made to non-profit bodies fall within the meaning of an unconditional gift or donation (see page 10) especially if given by charitable trusts. These are not liable for GST. If you're not sure please contact us to discuss. The table on page 35 shows whether the different types of income are liable for: • income tax (for organisations not entitled to an exemption), and • GST (for those organisations registered for GST). You'll notice that income "exempt from GST" is different from income that's "not liable for GST". This is important when working out your claim for GST input tax credits on goods and services bought to run your organisation. GST-registered non-profit bodies (including charities) may claim input tax credits on expenses incurred in deriving income that's either liable or not liable for GST, but not in deriving income that is exempt from GST. Example A GST-registered charitable organisation receives income from: a government grantliable for GST trading activitiesliable for GST donationsnot liable for GST renting a residential property exempt from GST The charitable organisation can claim a GST input tax credit for all the expenses except those incurred in deriving the rent, which is exempt from GST. Income exempt from GST includes: • income from financial services, including interest from banks and dividends from public companies • proceeds made by a non-profit body from selling goods and services that were donated to it • rent received from residential accommodation. 34 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Table of income types Liable for income tax if no tax exemption applies  Not liable for income tax Liable for GST Not liable for GST Exempt from GST Subscriptions  Donations  Koha  †  Bequests  Grants  Unconditional gifts  Subsidies  \* Suspensory loans  Trading activities  Raffles or housie proceeds  \* Admission fees  Affiliation fees  Sale of donated goods or services  \* Sale of purchased goods  Sale of assets or equipment  Insurance receipts   \* Hall or equipment hire  Rent received (residential)  Rent received (commercial)  Penalty payments (fines)  Advertising or sponsorship  Interest or dividends  Gaming machines  \* Liable in certain situations † The tax treatment of koha depends on what it is. See our factsheet Payments and gifts in the Ma - ori community - IR278  Registered charities are generally exempt from income tax for both business and non-business income. There are some limitations to this. See pages 23 and 28-32 for more information. 35 ird.govt.nz Part 4 - Charity deregistration There are a number of different reasons a charity may be deregistered. The reason will determine the date of deregistration and the tax treatment of the charity from this date. A charity can be deregistered from the Charities Register by: • voluntary deregistration or • Charities Services deregisters it. From 6 April 2016 the tax treatment that applies to a deregistered charity also applies to non-registered charities that stop meeting the specific exemption in section CW 42(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 for business income. For more information on the tax treatment of charities that deregister or charities that stop meeting the business income tax exemption go to ird.govt.nz/charitable-organisations Voluntary deregistration A voluntary deregistration is when the charity requests Charities Services to remove them from their register. This can occur when either the charity has: • ceased and is winding up, or • not ceased but no longer operates as a charitable organisation. From 14 April 2014, a charity's voluntary deregistration date will be the day it's removed from the charities register. Deregistered by Charities Services Charities Services will deregister a charity which has failed to comply with the Charities Act 2005. From 1 April 2015 the date of deregistration will be based on the type of non-compliance that occurred as follows: If the charity...the date of deregistration will be... never acted in accordance with its constitution backdated to the start date stopped acting in accordance with its constitution from the date of the change did not file an annual return.from the date Charities Services removes it from the register. 36 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Court proceedings/appeals If the charity is involved in court proceedings or appealing a decision to deregister it for any of the above reasons, it will be deregistered on the date when all court proceedings or appeals are finished or exhausted. Entities not registered with Charities Services From 6 April 2016 the deregistration tax rules also apply to a non-registered Charity that stops meeting the specific exemption in section CW 42(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 for their business income. Because the deregistration date does not apply to these entities, the references to "date of deregistration" below need to be read as the date the charity no longer meets the requirements for an income tax exemption. Tax treatment The charity will have one year from the date of deregistration to dispose of or transfer any assets (including accumulated income) less liabilities for charitable purposes or as set out in its constitution. Otherwise, income tax will be payable one year from the date of deregistration on the net assets which the charity does not dispose of or transfer within that time. From the 1 April 2019 small charities with net assets of $10,000 or less will not be subject to this deregistration tax. Charities with over $10,000 net assets will be subject to tax on the total value of the net assets (including the initial $10,000). There are certain adjustments to exclude certain assets. For example the charity can make an adjustment for any assets, other than money, donated to the charity while it was registered. You make the adjustment by: • taking the entity’s assets (less liabilities) on the end date, • less: – assets disposed of or transferred for charitable purposes within one year of the registration end date. – the value of any assets, other than money, donated to the charity while it was registered, • Record the resulting value of assets in the entity’s income tax return for the period that includes the day one year after the charity was deregistered (or stopped meeting the criteria for its charitable income tax exemption). 37 ird.govt.nz Example: $10,000 and under net assets Charity One’s date of deregistration is 1 July 2019. Its balance sheet at 1 July 2019 is shown below. AssetsLiabilities Cash $ 50Loan $ 200 Inventory $ 500Organisations Equity $ 350 The income calculation will be: • Assets $550 less liabilities $200 equals net assets of $350 As deregistration is after 1 April 2019 and net assets are not more than $10,000 no income arises. Example: Assets over $10,000 Charity D’s date of deregistration is 1 July 2019. It’s balance sheet at 1 July 2019 is shown below. AssetsLiabilities Cash $ 10,500Loan $ 200 Inventory $ 500 Equity Land (donated) $ 3,000Organisations equity $ 13,150 One year later no assets have been disposed of or transferred. The income calculation will be: • assets $13,350 less $200 liabilities equals $13,150 • less the value of the donated land ($3,000) = $10,150. Charity D will include $10,150 as income for tax purposes 38 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS How to calculate the value of an asset or financial arrangement Example: Depreciable property Charity A registered as a charitable entity in 2013. That same year, it bought office furniture for $50,000 (GST-exclusive) during the first month of the 2013 tax year. In 2018, Charities Services deregistered it because it hadn't complied with its constitution since registering. Charity A still owned the office furniture at the date of deregistration so it must file an income tax return for each year starting from the 2013 year. The value of the cost of premises, plant and equipment at the "date of cessation" must be depreciated, under the general tax rules, for each year it is used in Charity A's business. Using the depreciation rate of 19.2%, the cost of office furniture for each year from 2013 to the present day is: Year201320142015201620172018 Opening value ($)50,00040,40032,64326,37621,31217,220 Depreciation 9,600 7,757 6,267 5,064 4,092 3,306 Year-end balance ($) 40,40032,64326,37621,31217,22013,914 Charity A's assets are worth $50,000 and it applies depreciation of $9,600 in its 2013 income tax return. 39 ird.govt.nz Example: Financial arrangement Charity A lent $100,000 to B in 2013. The loan was repayable on demand and the annual interest rate was 10% (compounding). No loan repayments were made. Charity A must account for this loan under the financial arrangement rules in each of the years it had ceased to meet the requirements of being a charity. It must also calculate an opening value using this formula: Consideration paid to person + expenditure - consideration paid by person - income Consideration paid to person is the amount paid to the person before the date the charity ceased. Expenditure is the amount incurred under the financial arrangement rules before the date the charity ceased. Consideration paid by the person is the amount repaid before the date the charity ceased. Income is the amount that would have been derived under the financial arrangement rules before the date the charity ceased. Charity A calculates the loan as follows: Year201320142015201620172018 Opening value ($) 100,000110,000121,000133,100146,410161,051 Interest ($)10,00011,00012,10013,31014,64116,105 Year-end balance ($) 110,000121,000133,100146,410161,051177,156 In 2013 the opening value would be $100,000 and the closing value would be $110,000. Charity A accounts for $10,000 accrued interest income in its 2013 income tax return. 40 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS FBT When the deregistered charity is no longer eligible for the FBT exemption, the FBT rules will apply from the date of deregistration as explained earlier. A charity that has deregistered voluntarily will lose their FBT exemption from the date it's removed from the charities register. It will be liable for FBT for the return period from this date onwards. A charity that did not comply with their constitution will lose its FBT exemption from the date of non-compliance and FBT will apply for the return period from this date. Community housing entity Where a community housing entity no longer meets the requirements of being a charity and is deregistered from the charities register, it may be able to apply for an income tax exemption.

IR255 October 2022 Charitable and donee organisations A tax guide for charities, donee organisations and other groups 3 ird.govt.nz Introduction Charitable organisations have several tax obligations. If you're involved in administering or setting up a charitable trust, estate, society, association or any other type of charitable organisation, this guide will help you. However, this is only a general guide - for more specific issues, refer to other Inland Revenue publications (listed on page 43) or call us - see page 41. Charities Services registers and monitors charitable organisations and provides education and support to the charitable sector. For more information go to page 10 or go to their website charities.govt.nz or call 0508 242 748. In this guide • Part 1 helps you work out what taxes your organisation will have to deal with. • Part 2 explains the exemptions, so you can find out whether your organisation is exempt from income tax. It also tells you about the tax benefits available to people who donate money or property to your organisation. • Part 3 sets out different types of income and explains whether each is liable for income tax or GST (goods and services tax). • Part 4 deals with what happens when a charity is deregistered. • Part 5 Services Inland Revenue provides. The information in this guide is based on current tax laws at the time of printing. 4 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS ird.govt.nz Go to our website for information and to use our services and tools. • Log in or register for myIR - manage your tax and entitlements online. • Calculators and tools - use our calculators, worksheets and tools, for example, to check your tax code, find filing and payment dates, calculate your student loan repayment. • Forms and guides - download our forms and guides.

Associated persons These are: • people related by blood, adoption, marriage or de facto relationships • companies with mainly the same shareholders • a partner and a partnership • trusts and their association with trustees, beneficiaries and settlors. The association rules are complex and it is important that you seek professional advice if you think there is any possibility of an association applying to you. Business Any enterprise or activity intended to make a profit is classed as a business. If an organisation runs a business, it must pay tax on all profits after expenses (except certain transactions made with its members). However, if a charity runs a business, it may be exempt from income tax on any profits that it uses for charitable purposes within New Zealand - see page 23. Charitable organisation or charity This is an organisation (incorporated or not) that carries on charitable activities or exists exclusively for charitable purposes. Generally to obtain tax benefits, charities must be registered by the Charities Services. Many organisations consider themselves charitable because of the work they do or because they're registered under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957. As a result, they may also think they're exempt from income tax. However, an organisation is generally only exempt from income tax if it's registered with Charities Services, or if registration with Charities Services is unavailable (for example, because the entity is a non-resident), has been granted an exemption from Inland Revenue. This exemption does not apply to GST or PAYE. The organisation must still account for these. 7 ird.govt.nz Charitable purposes These include: • the relief of poverty • the advancement of education • the advancement of religion • activities for the benefit of the community. An organisation's purposes must fall within one of these categories to be charitable. Its activities or aims must be for public purposes and the benefit must be available to a large section of the community. In addition, it must not be carried on for the benefit or profit of any individual. If the beneficiaries are limited by blood ties the charitable purpose can still be met in some circumstances. Charitable purpose of marae A marae has a charitable purpose if: • the physical structure of the marae is on land that is a Mäori reservation, and • the funds of the marae are not used for a purpose other than the administration and maintenance of the land and of the physical structure of the marae or another charitable purpose. Charities Services (previously known as the Charities Commission) This is part of the Department of Internal Affairs and provides; • a registration and monitoring system for charitable organisations, • collection and processing of Annual Returns, and • support and education to the charitable sector on good governance, and management practice. Community housing entity A trustee, or a company whose activities are mainly the provision of housing, who meet specific criteria and are registered under the Housing Restructuring and Tenancy Matters Act 1992. They may be a registered charity or alternatively contact Inland Revenue to confirm if they qualify under a specific income tax exemption for community housing entities. 8 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Deregistration There are certain tax implications that apply when an organisation ceases to be a registered charity. For the purposes of this booklet, the deregistration rules outlined in part 4 apply to a charity that: • has been removed from the Charities Register by Charities Services, or • voluntarily deregisters, or • no longer meets the criteria for the income tax exemption for business income under section CW 42 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Donee organisation This is an organisation Inland Revenue considers having met the requirements set out in the Income Tax Act 2007. Generally, a donee organisation is one which applies its funds wholly or mainly to charitable, benevolent, philanthropy or cultural purposes within New Zealand. Certain other organisations may also qualify, such as a school board of trustees, tertiary education institutes or community housing entities. Individuals, companies and Ma ̄ ori authorities can get tax benefits by making gifts of money to a donee organisation - see page 25. Donor A person, company or other organisation that gives money or property to another. Incorporated organisations Organisations registered with the Companies Office of the Ministry of Economic Development are classed as incorporated organisations. For more information about becoming incorporated, see societies.govt.nz Non-profit body or Not for Profit organisations A non-profit body is any society, association or organisation (incorporated or not): • that is not carried on for the profit or gain of any member, and • whose rules do not allow money, property or any other benefit to be distributed to any of its members. Organisation This is a general term, which covers all types of societies, institutions, companies, estates, trusts, funds, whether or not they have a charitable nature or are considered tax-exempt. 9 ird.govt.nz Payroll giving Payroll giving is a voluntary scheme where employees can make donations from their pay to support approved donee organisations. People who donate through payroll giving receive immediate tax credits relating to the donations they make each payday. Registered charity A trust, society or institution that is registered by Charities Services under the Charities Act. This is not the same as trusts registered with the Ministry of Business Innovation & Employment under the Charitable Trust Act. Residual income tax Residual income tax is the amount payable for the year, after deducting any tax credits from income tax assessed, but before deducting any provisional tax paid. Taxable activity Any activity carried on continuously or regularly that supplies (or intends to supply) goods and services to others for some form of payment (but not necessarily for a profit) is a taxable activity. Businesses, trades and professions are all taxable activities. Charitable organisations of any type can carry on taxable activities. Setting up a business is part of the taxable activity, as is the closing down and sale of a business. Taxable activities do not include: • employment as a salary or wage-earner • hobby activities • the occasional sale of domestic or private assets • making GST-exempt supplies such as residential rent or financial services. Turnover Turnover is the total gross value of all goods and services supplied, excluding GST. It includes: • goods and services sold or provided in New Zealand • exported goods • grants or subsidies • non-monetary items received under barter arrangements. 10 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Charities Act The Charities Act 2005 established a Charities Commission, now known as Charities Services, who provide: • a registration and monitoring system for charitable organisations • support and education for the charitable sector on good governance and management. Charities Services has published A guide to the Charities Act, which you can download from charities.govt.nz or order a copy by calling 0508 242 748. Charities Services also set up a Charities Register. Registration is voluntary but, unregistered charities are not eligible for tax exemptions on the grounds of charitable purposes. Charitable organisations can apply for registration online at charities.govt.nz or by posting a completed application form, with a copy of their rules, to Charities Services. Send an officer certification form for each officer of the organisation. You can get details about registration and copies of forms from Charities Services at charities.govt.nz or by calling 0508 242 748. Turnover for GST purposes does not include: • GST-exempt goods and services • unconditional gifts received. See page 15 for the treatment of assets. Unconditional gift An unconditional gift is a donation or payment made voluntarily to any non-profit body, where there's no identifiable direct benefit to the donor or the donor's family. Some unconditional gifts can be: • donations or koha • money from door-to-door appeals and street collections • bequests • voluntary school fees (but not school activity fees). Subscriptions, payments from trading activities and payments made by the Crown or a public authority are not unconditional gifts for GST purposes. 11 ird.govt.nz Part 1 - Basic tax information Whatever type of charitable organisation you're setting up or running, you'll usually have some tax obligations. These may include: • making several tax payments each year - some of these may be for your organisation's own tax liability, others may be on behalf of its employees • filing various return forms each year - these may be for income tax, GST, PAYE and/or FBT • calculating the profit from any business to work out how much tax is due - this is explained in our Smart business - IR320 guide and there is also some information in Part 3 of this guide • keeping certain business records - see page 20 for more information on this. This part of the guide explains all these obligations and gives you other general tax information you need to know. Income tax Charitable organisations are liable for income tax if they are not within the meaning of a “tax charity”. To be a tax charity means the organisation is either: • a registered charity, or • a non-resident charity that has been approved by Inland Revenue, or • a business that is carried on by, or for the benefit of a registered charity, for example a company which is fully owned by a tax charity. (From 1 April 2020 the business will need to be a registered charity itself to qualify) A charitable organisation is not exempt for income tax on business income applied for charitable purposes outside New Zealand - see page 28. Other benefits The Income Tax Act 2007 contains specific income tax exemptions for charities. Some of these exemptions give benefits to charitable organisations and some give benefits to people, certain companies, or Mäori authorities who make donations to such organisations. The "Tax benefits" section on page 22 of this guide gives more detail on these main conditions. It also covers other benefits available such as exemption from: • FBT (fringe benefit tax) on certain fringe benefits, and • RWT (resident withholding tax) on interest and dividends. 12 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS The Tax benefits section also covers any criteria and limitations to these exemptions. Your organisation may still be liable for other taxes, such as GST and PAYE. If your organisation is not entitled to any tax exemptions, it will be liable for income tax on some types of income it earns. Part 3 of this guide will help you work out which types of income are taxable. Income tax rates If a charitable organisation is incorporated under the Incorporated Societies Act 1908 or Companies Act 1993, then it's considered to be a company for income tax purposes. If it does not qualify for a tax exemption, its income is taxed at the company rate. Organisations that operate as trusts, including trusts incorporated under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957 and are not tax-exempt are liable for tax on trustee's income. Our guide Trusts and estates income tax rules - IR288 gives you more information about this. Charitable organisations not incorporated under a specific Act are treated as unincorporated charitable organisations. If such an organisation is not entitled to a tax exemption, it will be liable for income tax at the same rate as an individual taxpayer. However, it will not qualify for any of the tax credits that individual taxpayers can claim. For more information on individual and PAYE rates go to ird.govt.nz/tax-rates If a non-exempt organisation's residual income tax for a financial year is more than $5,000, it may have to pay provisional tax for the following year. For more information on provisional tax, read our guide Provisional tax - IR289 Filing income tax returns Generally, if your organisation is a tax charity, it's exempt from income tax. You do not need to file an income tax return unless we request one or you have income that is not covered by the exemption. You need to be registered by Charities Services to be eligible for an income tax exemption. If your organisation is not a tax charity or is a tax charity but receives non-exempt income, it will be required to file a return You must include a copy of the financial accounts with the tax return. You must include a copy of the financial accounts with the tax return. Instead of accounts, you can use our Schedule of business income - IR3B or Rental income - IR3R form to work out the gross income and allowable deductions for these activities. We also provide an Financial statements summary - IR10 form, which you can use instead of sending us a set of accounts. Using an IR10 will speed up the tax return processing time. 13 ird.govt.nz Companies must file an IR4 tax return, estates or trusts must file an IR6 tax return, and any other society or association must file an IR 9 tax return. If your organisation does not receive a taxpack, you can order one by calling our 0800 self-service numbers - see page 41. If your organisation has a balance date between October and March, you must send your tax return to us by 7 July. For other approved balance dates (see page 21), send us the return by the seventh day of the fourth month after your balance date. If a tax agent completes the return, we may extend the due date. This is because most tax agents have extensions of time for filing their clients' tax returns. GST (goods and services tax) GST is a tax on most goods and services in New Zealand. It's charged and accounted for by GST-registered businesses or organisations, known as taxable activities. They calculate the amount of GST they have charged and pay it to us. They can also claim back the GST they incur as part of their taxable activity. To check the current GST rate go to ird.govt.nz/gst Registering for GST If your charitable organisation runs a taxable activity with an annual turnover (total income before expenses) of $60,000 or more, it must register for GST. You must also register for GST if you think your organisation's turnover for the next 12 months will be over $60,000. Registration is voluntary for organisations with turnover under this figure. A taxable activity is any activity continuously or regularly carried on by your charitable organisation that supplies, or intends to supply, goods and services to someone else for a consideration – it does not have to be an activity carried on with the intention of making a profit. To work out turnover, only include income liable for GST (including amounts which would be zero-rated). Do not include any income not liable for or exempt from GST. For example, include income from trading activities (both with members and non- members), subscriptions, grants and subsidies, but exclude income from donations, koha, bequests, residential rent, interest and dividends. You can register for GST online through myIR secure online services. To register for a myIR account visit ird.govt.nz/myir 14 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Registration of branches and divisions Generally, if an organisation operates through separate branches or divisions, they may each register separately for GST. If the total turnover of all the branches or divisions is more than $60,000 your organisation must register for GST. Non-profit bodies (including charitable organisations) may apply to us in writing to treat each branch or division separately, and only register the individual branches with a turnover of more than $60,000. However, branches with a turnover of less than $60,000 may still register voluntarily. To register separately, each branch or division must: • have its own independent accounting system, and • be separately identified by its location or by the different activities it undertakes. Voluntary registration The advantage of voluntary registration is that charitable organisations may get frequent refunds of GST. This may happen when a charity runs a taxable activity and receives income liable for GST, but also receives donations or koha (unconditional gifts), which are not liable for GST. The charity can claim a GST credit for most of its expenses, but it only pays GST on its taxable activity income. However, charitable organisations need to be aware of the possible disadvantages of voluntary registration. • The organisation must use GST invoices, retain records and file GST returns. • When you stop your registration, you must pay GST on the open (current) market value of any business assets you keep for private use. If you acquired the asset before 1 October 1986, the adjustment would be the lesser of cost price and the open market value. • Accounting for GST becomes difficult if non-liable income is involved, or if some assets are used for exempt purposes and others for business purposes. • If someone within the organisation completes the GST returns, there may be problems if that person's services become unavailable and their experience is lost. For more help You'll find more information on registering branches and divisions separately, or on voluntary registration, in our GST - do you need to register? - IR365 factsheet. 15 ird.govt.nz GST and assets Generally, if you’re registered, GST can be claimed on the purchase of a business asset or for expenses relating to that asset. If you do claim GST on an asset or on expenses relating to that asset, you’ll have to pay GST on the sale of the asset or equivalent event such as an insurance pay out. For further information go to ird.govt.nz/gst Employing staff If your organisation employs staff, you must register with us as an employer. You can register online at ird.govt.nz/myir or complete an Employer registration - IR334 form. Your tax obligations as an employer are as follows: • Ask new employees to fill in a Tax code declaration - IR330, which will tell you the tax code to use and the rate for deducting tax from their wages. If any employees do not fill in an IR330, you must deduct tax from their wages at the non-notified rate of 45% (not including employees' ACC earners' levy). • Ask new contractors who receive schedular payments to fill in a Tax rate notification for contractors - IR330C, this tells you the rate of tax to deduct from their schedular payments. If any contractors do not provide you with an IR330C, you must deduct tax from their schedular payments at the non-notified rate. This rate is 20% for non-resident contractor companies, and 45% for all other contractors. You'll need to fill out a New employee details - IR346 form for each new employee and send it to us either: • before their first pay day; or • with the Employment information - IR348 form that includes their first pay. You’ll need their name, KiwiSaver status, IRD number, tax code and contact details. Include their date of birth if they have provided you with this information. After you submit your first Employment information - IR348, this information will be automatically shown on your subsequent IR348 forms. 16 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS • Deduct PAYE from your employees' wages, and pay it to us either once or twice a month, depending on the total amount of wages paid. PAYE includes the ACC earners' levy to cover the cost of employees' non-work injuries. • Complete an Employment information - IR348 form with details of the required deductions for each employee. You can file your IR348 electronically through myIR. • Pay fringe benefit tax (FBT) on any fringe benefits (perks) you give your employees - see page 17. • Deduct child support payments and student loan repayments from employees' wages if required. • Automatically enrol new employees who are eligible to join KiwiSaver and deduct their KiwiSaver contributions from their pay. • If you're making KiwiSaver employee deductions or employer contributions you need to send these to us with the PAYE. • Pay employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) on any employer cash contributions made to a superannuation scheme. For more information on your obligations as an employer, see the Employer's guide - IR335 Employees and contractors If any members of your organisation carry out paid work, they're treated as employees. PAYE must be deducted from the payments they receive. If the organisation gives board and lodging rather than money to any employees for their work, generally you must work out the gross value of the benefit given to them, calculate PAYE based on this amount and pay it to us - see the "Allowances" section in the Employer's guide - IR335 Other benefits paid to replace wages may be liable for FBT - see page 17. An exception to this is for certain benefits received by members of religious orders - see page 29 for more information. PAYE deducted from your employees' wages does not belong to your organisation, it must not be used for anything other than payment to us. If a self-employed contractor does a job for the organisation, this generally does not make the organisation an employer. However, if the job is one of those listed on the back of the Tax rate notification for contractors - IR330C, you must deduct tax and pay this to us. You must also ask the contractor to complete the IR330C. If they've completed the IR330C and have chosen their own tax rate on page 1, deduct tax at that rate. Note: there are minimum tax rates that apply, refer to the Employer's guide 17 ird.govt.nz - IR335 If they've completed the IR330C and have not chosen a tax rate, use the standard rate listed on the back of the IR330C. If the contractor shows you a current Certificate of exemption or is a company (not in the agricultural industry), you do not need to deduct tax. A certificate of exemption can not apply to any payments made under a labour hire arrangement by a labour hire business. If the type of work done is not listed on the IR330C, you do not need to deduct tax as the contractor is responsible for paying the tax. Some workers call themselves self-employed contractors or something similar, so their employers will not deduct PAYE. If, as the employer, the organisation has control over the work done, including what the person does and how, and where it's done, the worker is almost certainly an employee and is liable for PAYE. It's illegal to treat a true employee as self-employed to avoid deducting tax. If you're not sure whether a worker is a true employee, read Part 1 of the Employer's guide - IR335 and our leaflet, Self-employed or an employee? - IR336 Employer's superannuation cash contribution (employer contribution) An employer contribution is money paid by the employer to a superannuation fund, for the benefit of their employees. If your employees ask you to make deductions from their wages and pay them to a superannuation scheme, these are not employer contributions. Any employer contribution an employer makes to a superannuation fund for the benefit of an employee is liable for tax. There are several options for taxing these contributions - see the Employer's guide - IR335 for more information. A "superannuation fund" is a scheme that has been registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. For more detailed information about superannuation fund contributions, refer to the Employer's guide - IR335 FBT (fringe benefit tax) Charitable organisations are generally exempt from paying FBT on any benefits provided to employees while they're carrying out the organisation's charitable activities. For example, if an employee has the use of a car while carrying out charitable work for the organisation, any private benefit arising is not subject to FBT. The exemption does not apply to any short-term charge facilities provided to employees of your charitable organisation above a certain threshold. This includes vouchers and store value cards, for example, petrol and supermarket voucher cards, 18 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Prezzy™ cards. For more information see Part 4 of our Fringe benefit tax guide - IR409 However, if your organisation operates a business which is outside its charitable, benevolent, cultural or philanthropic purposes and provides fringe benefits to any person employed in that business, FBT must be paid on those benefits. For example, if that business provides a car as part of a salary package, for use with its business activities, FBT must be paid on any private benefit. GST on fringe benefits If an organisation is registered for both GST and FBT, it must make an adjustment for GST in its FBT returns for fringe benefits provided (unless the benefits are GST-exempt or zero-rated). See Part 8 of our Fringe benefit tax guide - IR409 for more information. Entertainment expenses If your organisation is not fully income tax exempt, only 50% of entertainment expenses that are not subject to FBT are deductible for income tax purposes. For more information, read our Entertainment expenses - IR268 guide. RWT (resident withholding tax) Charitable organisations registered with Charities Services are eligible for RWT exempt status. This means if your charitable organisation has money deposited in a bank or other financial institution, or has shares in a company, your organisation can receive interest or dividends without having RWT deducted. When Charities Services registers or deregisters an organisation as charitable, they inform us. We accept their decision and approve or cancel RWT exempt status. The IRD number of everyone with RWT exempt status is listed on the RWT exemption register on our website at ird.govt.nz/rwt-exemption Payers of investment income (for example, banks) access this register to confirm which of their customers are exempt from having RWT deducted. You may also like to tell anyone paying you interest or dividends about your exemption, so they stop deducting RWT. For more help Our Resident withholding tax on interest (RWT) payer's guide - IR283 has the information you'll need if your organisation pays interest and deducts RWT. 19 ird.govt.nz NRWT (non-resident withholding tax) If your organisation pays interest, dividends or royalties to a non-resident, this is called non-resident passive income and your organisation must deduct NRWT. For more information on NRWT go to ird.govt.nz/nrwt or read our NRWT – payer’s guide - IR291 You can also contact our Non-resident Centre if you want to know more about the New Zealand tax residency rules for deducting and paying NRWT: Email nonres@ird.govt.nz Phone 03 951 2020 For more help These guides will help if you have questions about residency or NRWT: • New Zealand tax residence - IR292 • NRWT - payer's guide - IR291 • Visitor's tax guide - IR294 20 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS General information Record keeping You must keep sufficient records to calculate the income, expenses and GST liability of your charitable organisation, and to enable us to confirm your accounts if necessary. The records you need to keep are: • receipt and payment account books • bank statements • invoices (including GST tax invoices) • receipts • any other necessary documents to confirm entries in your accounts • stock take figures for the end of the financial year • wage records for all employees, including KiwiSaver records • interest and dividend payment records. For GST you do not need to hold a tax invoice for items costing less than $50 but you do need to maintain a record of such payments. For income tax, you should have invoices for all expenses, whatever the amount. Note You must hold all records for seven years, even if you cease operating (except for incorporated organisations that have been wound up and dissolved). We can also extend the period you must keep records for if we intend to audit or investigate your organisation. If this is the case, we'll write and tell you what records to keep. All your records must be in English, unless we give you written approval to use another language. Any charitable or donee organisation (see pages 6 to 8) must also keep a record of: • the sources of any donations made to it, and • how its funds have been used, within New Zealand or overseas. If we request it to, the organisation should be able to fill in a tax return and identify the source and end use of all its funds. It's important to keep all this information as we routinely audit these records. 21 ird.govt.nz If you file your tax returns electronically, you must keep a paper copy of the return (and supporting records) for seven years. Note You can read more about audits on our website at ird.govt.nz/audits IRD numbers No matter what type of charitable organisation you're running, it will need an IRD number. You may also use that IRD number for GST, PAYE, FBT or RWT purposes. You’ll need an IRD number for Charities Services when applying for charitable registration. To get an IRD number, you'll need to send us a completed IRD number application - resident non-individual - IR596 form. If you're incorporating a new company online through the Companies Office website, you can apply for an IRD number at the same time. Or, you can complete the IR596 form online, print, sign and send it to us. You'll need to provide a photocopy of one of the following: • certificate of incorporation • deed of trust • certificate of registration. You must also supply the names, addresses and personal IRD numbers of each shareholder, director, trustee or executive office holder. Balance dates For most taxpayers, the accounting year ends on 31 March - the balance date. If you want a balance date for your organisation other than 31 March, you must apply to us in writing, stating your reasons. We usually only approve a change if there are sound business reasons for doing so, or if your business activity is in an industry where there is a recognised balance date other than 31 March. Due dates Some organisations may have to file returns and make payments to us for several tax types. To keep track of the due dates for payments and returns, use the calculator on ird.govt.nz or our Tax due date calendar - IR328 22 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Part 2 - Tax benefits Tax legislation benefits charities by allowing them income tax exemptions. It also allows a tax credit or deduction for donations by individuals, companies or Mäori authorities to donee organisations. Note that a charity may also be a donee organisation but will need to register with Charity Services to be one. If an organisation with charitable purposes is on Inland Revenue’s approved donee list, but is not registered with Charities Services, it will need to register by 1 April 2020 to retain its donee status. This part of the guide explains how these benefits work and the conditions an organisation must meet to get a particular benefit. Charities To qualify for an exemption from income tax, trustees of a trust must derive income for charitable purposes, and societies or institutions must be established and maintained exclusively for charitable purposes. A charitable purpose is where the rules of an organisation clearly state that its purposes are for one or more of the following: • the relief of poverty • the advancement of education • the advancement of religion • any other matters that are beneficial to the community. The organisation's aims must also be for a public purpose except where they are for the relief of poverty. The benefit must be available to a large part of the community and the activities must not result in the private benefit or profit of any individual. You'll find further information about charitable purposes on the Charities Services website at charities.govt.nz 23 ird.govt.nz Income tax for charities Non-business (investment) income Registered charities are exempt from income tax on non-business income such as interest, dividends and rents. They may use the non-business income for charitable purposes in and outside New Zealand and still keep the income tax exemption. Business income The portion of a registered charity's business income which is used for charitable purposes in New Zealand is exempt from income tax. If an organisation uses its business income for charitable purposes outside New Zealand as well, only the New Zealand part is exempt. Business income will not be exempt if anyone connected with the charitable organisation: • receives or can receive any type of benefit or income from the organisation, and • can determine or influence the nature or amount of any benefit they receive. Page 28 has more details about the limitations to this exemption. These exemptions only apply to the charitable organisation's income. They do not apply to any other earned income passed on to a charitable organisation for charitable purposes. The people or organisation who earned the income must pay tax on it. However, the gifting of this income may qualify for a donation tax credit or deduction - see page 26. Income derived from a business carried on by, or for, or for the benefit of a charitable organisation is exempt from income tax. From 1 April 2020 to qualify for or retain this exemption the business will need to register with Charities Services in its own right. It will no longer be sufficient that the income is for the benefit of a registered charitable organisation. Non-resident charities Non-resident charities that only carry out charitable purposes outside New Zealand may not be able to be registered with Charities Services because they: • are not established in New Zealand, and • do not have a strong connection with New Zealand. In these circumstances we may be able to approve an income tax exemption for non- business income if the entity meets certain criteria. 24 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS You can find out more about the criteria and the application process at ird.govt.nz/non-resident-charities Non-resident charities with business income used to carry out charitable purposes in New Zealand must be registered with Charities Services to be eligible for an income tax exemption on that income. This exemption covers both business and non-business income used for charitable purposes in New Zealand, but not business income applied overseas. Charitable estates The executor or administrator of a deceased person's estate may derive income from any money or assets left to charitable organisations while the will is being finalised. If the organisation benefiting from the will is entitled to an income tax exemption, the income derived while the funds are held awaiting finalisation is also exempt. This exemption only covers the income derived from the money or assets of the estate that have been left to the charity. The estate must still pay tax on any income it earns from other assets or money. If the trustees want to confirm their tax exemption they need to send us, during that intervening period, a copy of the deceased's will and the following details: • details of any charity that will receive gifts under the will and the amount they will receive • the rights of the various beneficiaries under the will • the net value (after debts and liabilities) of the estate available to be distributed to the beneficiaries • the shares and the prospective shares of the beneficiaries in the income and assets of the estate. Gifts to charities Gift duty was repealed for gifts made after 1 October 2011. If your organisation needs information on the tax implications for gifts made before this date, then you can contact us for further information. 25 ird.govt.nz Donee organisations When an organisation is considered a donee organisation for tax purposes, any gifts of money it receives from individuals, Ma ̄ ori authorities and certain companies, qualify for tax advantages. You will need to apply to Inland Revenue for approval to become a donee organisation. See pages 26 and 27 for more information on these tax benefits. An organisation does not have to be a registered charity to be eligible for donee organisation status. However, from 1 April 2020 if the organisation has only charitable purposes it must register as a charity to obtain donee status. A donee organisation must be a New Zealand society, institution, association, organisation, trust or fund. Its funds must be applied wholly or mainly to charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes in New Zealand. This means that the organisation's aims or purposes should be carried out in New Zealand, even if this results in paying money outside New Zealand to achieve these purposes. Inland Revenue administers the “wholly or mainly” requirement on a “safe harbour” basis of “75% or more”. This means Inland Revenue will generally accept that an organisation meeting or exceeding the safe harbour percentage of 75% has wholly or mainly applied funds to specified purposes within New Zealand. This applies to and from the 2019/20 income year. For more information, see our Interpretation Statement IS 18/05 Income tax – donee organisations and its accompanying fact sheet on applying the 'safe harbour' approach. These can be found at taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/safe-harbour The safe harbour percentage is relevant only if the organisation applies funds to purposes that are not specified purposes within New Zealand. Cultural purposes include dramatic, theatrical, operatic, ballet, choral or musical purposes. Benevolent and philanthropic purposes basically mean doing good for other people. This includes organisations that are not charitable in the strict legal sense, but are popularly seen as charitable, for example, organisations whose proceeds or funds are used to benefit all or a large part of the public. Another condition is that the organisation must not be carried on for the private benefit of any member or an associate of any member. Charities that apply the principal part or all of their funds outside New Zealand must be approved for donee organisation status by Parliament. Approval is limited to organisations whose funds are mainly used for: • the relief of poverty, hunger, sickness or the results of war or natural disaster • the economy of developing countries (as recognised by the United Nations) 26 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS • raising the educational standards of a developing country. Inland Revenue considers these applications and makes a recommendation to government. Organisations that are approved are listed in the Income Tax Act. A donee organisation is still liable for income tax on any taxable income it earns from sources outside its own membership if it has no other income tax exemption. There are government guidelines for organisations seeking charitable donee status for their overseas activities. For information on the guidelines go to ird.govt.nz/overseas-donee-status Donation tax credit or deduction Gifts of money by individuals Individuals who give cash donations of $5 or more to donee organisations may claim a tax credit of one-third (33.33%) of the total of all donations, up to the amount of their taxable income. To qualify for this tax credit: • the gift must be made in money - gifts of goods or property do not qualify • the gift can not be made under the will of a deceased person • each gift must be $5 or more. However, gifts can still qualify for a tax credit if an arrangement is in place to make a gift of under $5 through regular instalments throughout the year, and the total at the end of the year is $5 or more (for example, if you give $1 each week to your church, making the total contribution for the year $52). Where an employer offers payroll giving, they must make sure all donations are passed to the requested donee organisations. This must be done by the PAYE payment due date closest to the end of the two months from the last day of the pay period when the donation was deducted from their employee's wage. When receipts are issued by the donee organisation they should be in the employer's name and state the donation was made under the payroll giving scheme. The employee does not receive a receipt from the donee as they receive a tax credit reducing their PAYE at the time the donation was deducted from their wages. 27 ird.govt.nz Gifts of money by certain companies A company (including an unlisted close company), can claim a donation deduction for cash donations it makes to donee organisations. A "close company" is one that has five or fewer shareholders. The maximum donation deduction that can be claimed is limited to the company's net income (that is, income, less expenses, but before the donation deduction is deducted). For more on tax credits on gifts and donations go to ird.govt.nz/donations Gift of money by Mäori authorities A Mäori authority may claim a deduction against its net income for cash donations it makes to a Mäori association or a donee organisation. The maximum deduction allowed is limited by the Mäori authority's net income (that is, income less expenses, but before the donation deduction is deducted). Receipts Please provide the donor with a receipt that contains: 1. An official stamp or letterhead and the full name of the organisation. Where the local organisation is part of a larger group or organisation, please provide clear reference to this on the receipt. For example, “Relief of Poverty Foundation, Wellington Branch”. 2. The following identifiers for the organisation: a) the DIA-Charities Services registration number, and b) its IRD number 3. A clear statement that the amount received is a donation. Exclude membership subscriptions or fees, purchases of goods or services and raffle tickets as they do not qualify for donation tax credits. 4. The full name of the donor and their address if held 5. The full amount and date of the donation (or if there were regular payments throughout the year you may show the total amount for the income year ending 31 March) 6. The full name, designation (for example, Treasurer, Secretary), and signature of an authorised person 7. A receipt number, unique to each receipt. 28 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Make sure the organisation: • keeps copies of all receipts issued for seven years. We may wish to inspect or verify issued receipts • does not use correction fluid on or cross out details and write corrections on receipts. Just cancel the incorrect receipt, ensure the donor’s incorrect copy is returned and noted as cancelled in the organisation’s records. Then redo a correct receipt for the donor and your records. • Treasurers and officers should not authorise or sign their own receipts or those relating to their immediate family. • Keep the contact details of authorised persons that oversee donations, such as the secretary or treasurer, up-to-date, as we may wish to contact them to verify receipts. To update Inland Revenue, you may use the form Appoint an Executive Office Holder to act on your behalf - IR401 Eligibility for exemption or donee organisation status Charities registered with Charities Services You do not need to apply to Inland Revenue to confirm your income tax-exempt status. When you register as a charity, as long as they have your IRD number, Charities Services will pass on the details to us so you will not need to contact us separately. In most cases, charities with non-business income only, which are registered with Charities Services, will be eligible for the exemptions. Registered charities carrying out a business will need to consider some limitations and exceptions to the exemption, (summarised on pages 28-31), and self-determine their tax position. These details will also show if you're applying for donee organisation status. We'll decide about your status based on this information, and advise you in writing. This is a valuable document for your organisation so keep a copy in a safe place. For more information on tax exemption go to ird.govt.nz/charity-services 29 ird.govt.nz Basic necessities for members of religious organisations If certain conditions are met, a member of a religious society or order can be provided with board, lodging and/or basic personal necessities, and receive these tax exempt. This only applies when the member is unpaid, their only occupation is service in that religious society or order, and it is the nature of the service that members are not paid or rewarded for their work. For more information on this tax exemption, go to ird.govt.nz/exempt-income- religious-organisations Not registered with Charities Services From 1 April 2020 all organisations with charitable purposes will need to be registered with Charities Services to be considered for donee status. If your organisations has benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes but not charitable purposes, and you want us to consider you as a donee organisation, send us: • an up-to-date, signed copy of your rules, constitution, trust deed or other founding document • a copy of your certificate of incorporation (if incorporated) • a letter requesting donee status • details of how the organisation has been (or will be) operating. We'll consider your application and let you know in writing. The criteria that we  look at for donee status is summarised on the following pages. Inland Revenue's criteria There are some specific requirements for your organisation to have donee organisation status and for charities claiming the income tax exemption on business income. In addition to Inland Revenue's rules, your governing document needs to contain certain rules and clauses to register as a charity. For information about the registration criteria go to Charities Services website charities.govt.nz or call 0508 242 748. Personal benefits A donee organisation's funds can not be used to provide personal benefit to its members, trustees or associates. Sometimes the aims or powers may allow benefits to members, but they may only benefit to a limited extent from their membership. Some acceptable benefits are newsletters that do not require a subscription, voting rights to appoint officers of the organisation and any benefit also available to the general public. 30 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS If any member can receive more than these benefits, the organisation can not be considered as a donee organisation. Also, if a member can in any way influence the amount of any benefit they receive, the organisation will not qualify as a donee organisation. The organisation may pay members for their services, as long as the payments are reasonable, not more than normal commercial rates and for services actually provided. A member may also be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred on the organisation's behalf and earn interest on money lent to the organisation (provided the loan is at a normal commercial rate). If an organisation's rules allow unrestricted benefits to members, a clause preventing this must be added before we'll grant donee organisation status. An example of such a clause is: "(1) All income, benefit, or advantage must be used to advance the charitable purposes of the organisation (2) No member of the organisation, or anyone associated with a member, is allowed to take part in, or influence any decision made by the organisation in respect of payments to, or on behalf of, the member or associated person of any income, benefit, or advantage. (3) Any payments made must be for goods or services that advance the charitable purpose and must be reasonable and relative to payments that would be made between unrelated parties (4) The provisions and effect of this clause shall not be removed from this document and shall be included and implied in any document replacing this document." Altering the rules An organisation may change its rules, constitution or trust deed through a rule alteration clause. To qualify as a donee organisation, this must be worded so any clauses dealing with purposes, benefit to members and winding up can not be changed so that they would affect the requirements for donee organisation status. If the rule alteration clause is not restricted, we will not grant donee organisation status. The following is a suitable restriction (proviso) for a rule alteration clause: "No addition to or alteration or removal of the rules shall be approved if it detracts from or alters the nature of the organisation." 31 ird.govt.nz If the organisation is a registered charity or intending to register it will not need a proviso (as above) because all alterations must be sent to Charities Services to comply with the Charities Act. Purposes limited to New Zealand An organisation seeking donee organisation status must be a society, association, or trust that applies its funds wholly or mainly in New Zealand to promote charitable, benevolent, philanthropic and cultural purposes. If your organisation applies funds for purposes both within and outside New Zealand we advise you to record these separately in your accounts. Any funds applied overseas will not qualify for a tax credit or deduction unless your organisation has been approved as a donee organisation. Some organisations (such as overseas charities) apply all or most of their general funds outside New Zealand. If the organisation sets up a separate fund for use in New Zealand it may qualify as a donee organisation. Winding up If an organisation's rules or constitution allows it to be wound up, the winding-up clause must prevent the funds or assets from passing to a private purpose. This means the rules for a donee organisation must have a clause stating that, on winding up, the income and assets will be held for charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes in New Zealand. When a donee organisation is wound up, any remaining income and assets must be distributed to an organisation that carries on activities wholly or mainly in New Zealand. The organisation receiving the distribution may be either a donee organisation or a charity. However, if the donee organisation is a registered charity the clause must state that, on winding up, the income and assets must be used for charitable purposes in New Zealand. 32 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Business activity Only the business income of a registered charity used for charitable purposes in New Zealand is exempt from tax. Any business income used overseas is liable for income tax. It will also be liable if anyone connected to the organisation: • receives or can receive any type of benefit or income from the organisation, and • can determine or influence the nature or amount of any benefit they receive. However, there are two situations when an organisation may pay someone connected with it (or provide other benefits) without losing its exemption. If the person: • is reimbursed on a reasonable basis for expenses incurred on behalf of the organisation • lends money to the organisation, it may pay interest at normal commercial rates. A person who provides services to the organisation as part of their professional practice can not influence or determine the nature or amount of any benefit they receive. The Public Trustee, the Mäori Trustee and any trustee company are deemed to be carrying on business as a professional public practice. A person is considered connected to a charitable organisation carrying on a business if they are: • the settlor or trustee of a trust • a shareholder or director of a company • a settlor or trustee of a trust who is a shareholder of the company • an associated person of any of these people. There are two further examples where an exemption does not apply. • If someone transfers an asset to a trust but retains an interest in the asset, they're considered to be a settlor of the trust and to be gaining a benefit. • If a person connected to the organisation transfers an asset to the organisation but retains an interest in the asset. If the organisation uses the asset to earn rental income, the person will be considered to be receiving a benefit since they still have an interest in the asset. 33 ird.govt.nz Part 3 - Income Charitable organisations can receive many types of income, including subscriptions, grants, subsidies, donations or koha, fees, raffle money, trading profits and proceeds from selling assets. Some grants made to non-profit bodies fall within the meaning of an unconditional gift or donation (see page 10) especially if given by charitable trusts. These are not liable for GST. If you're not sure please contact us to discuss. The table on page 35 shows whether the different types of income are liable for: • income tax (for organisations not entitled to an exemption), and • GST (for those organisations registered for GST). You'll notice that income "exempt from GST" is different from income that's "not liable for GST". This is important when working out your claim for GST input tax credits on goods and services bought to run your organisation. GST-registered non-profit bodies (including charities) may claim input tax credits on expenses incurred in deriving income that's either liable or not liable for GST, but not in deriving income that is exempt from GST. Example A GST-registered charitable organisation receives income from: a government grantliable for GST trading activitiesliable for GST donationsnot liable for GST renting a residential property exempt from GST The charitable organisation can claim a GST input tax credit for all the expenses except those incurred in deriving the rent, which is exempt from GST. Income exempt from GST includes: • income from financial services, including interest from banks and dividends from public companies • proceeds made by a non-profit body from selling goods and services that were donated to it • rent received from residential accommodation. 34 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Table of income types Liable for income tax if no tax exemption applies  Not liable for income tax Liable for GST Not liable for GST Exempt from GST Subscriptions  Donations  Koha  †  Bequests  Grants  Unconditional gifts  Subsidies \* Suspensory loans  Trading activities  Raffles or housie proceeds \* Admission fees  Affiliation fees  Sale of donated goods or services \* Sale of purchased goods  Sale of assets or equipment  Insurance receipts  \* Hall or equipment hire  Rent received (residential)  Rent received (commercial)  Penalty payments (fines)  Advertising or sponsorship  Interest or dividends  Gaming machines  \* Liable in certain situations † The tax treatment of koha depends on what it is.

There are some limitations to this. See pages 23 and 28-32 for more information. 35 ird.govt.nz Part 4 - Charity deregistration There are a number of different reasons a charity may be deregistered. The reason will determine the date of deregistration and the tax treatment of the charity from this date. A charity can be deregistered from the Charities Register by: • voluntary deregistration or • Charities Services deregisters it. From 6 April 2016 the tax treatment that applies to a deregistered charity also applies to non-registered charities that stop meeting the specific exemption in section CW 42(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 for business income. For more information on the tax treatment of charities that deregister or charities that stop meeting the business income tax exemption go to ird.govt.nz/charitable-organisations Voluntary deregistration A voluntary deregistration is when the charity requests Charities Services to remove them from their register. This can occur when either the charity has: • ceased and is winding up, or • not ceased but no longer operates as a charitable organisation. From 14 April 2014, a charity's voluntary deregistration date will be the day it's removed from the charities register. Deregistered by Charities Services Charities Services will deregister a charity which has failed to comply with the Charities Act 2005. From 1 April 2015 the date of deregistration will be based on the type of non-compliance that occurred as follows: If the charity...the date of deregistration will be... never acted in accordance with its constitution backdated to the start date stopped acting in accordance with its constitution from the date of the change did not file an annual return.from the date Charities Services removes it from the register. 36 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Court proceedings/appeals If the charity is involved in court proceedings or appealing a decision to deregister it for any of the above reasons, it will be deregistered on the date when all court proceedings or appeals are finished or exhausted. Entities not registered with Charities Services From 6 April 2016 the deregistration tax rules also apply to a non-registered Charity that stops meeting the specific exemption in section CW 42(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 for their business income. Because the deregistration date does not apply to these entities, the references to "date of deregistration" below need to be read as the date the charity no longer meets the requirements for an income tax exemption. Tax treatment The charity will have one year from the date of deregistration to dispose of or transfer any assets (including accumulated income) less liabilities for charitable purposes or as set out in its constitution. Otherwise, income tax will be payable one year from the date of deregistration on the net assets which the charity does not dispose of or transfer within that time. From the 1 April 2019 small charities with net assets of $10,000 or less will not be subject to this deregistration tax. Charities with over $10,000 net assets will be subject to tax on the total value of the net assets (including the initial $10,000). There are certain adjustments to exclude certain assets. For example the charity can make an adjustment for any assets, other than money, donated to the charity while it was registered. You make the adjustment by: • taking the entity’s assets (less liabilities) on the end date, • less: – assets disposed of or transferred for charitable purposes within one year of the registration end date. – the value of any assets, other than money, donated to the charity while it was registered, • Record the resulting value of assets in the entity’s income tax return for the period that includes the day one year after the charity was deregistered (or stopped meeting the criteria for its charitable income tax exemption). 37 ird.govt.nz Example: $10,000 and under net assets Charity One’s date of deregistration is 1 July 2019. Its balance sheet at 1 July 2019 is shown below. AssetsLiabilities Cash $ 50Loan $ 200 Inventory $ 500Organisations Equity $ 350 The income calculation will be: • Assets $550 less liabilities $200 equals net assets of $350 As deregistration is after 1 April 2019 and net assets are not more than $10,000 no income arises. Example: Assets over $10,000 Charity D’s date of deregistration is 1 July 2019. It’s balance sheet at 1 July 2019 is shown below. AssetsLiabilities Cash $ 10,500Loan $ 200 Inventory $ 500 Equity Land (donated) $ 3,000Organisations equity $ 13,150 One year later no assets have been disposed of or transferred. The income calculation will be: • assets $14,000 less $200 liabilities equals $13,800 • less the value of the (donated) land 3,000 = $10,800. The de-registered Charity D will include $10,800 as income for tax purposes. 38 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS How to calculate the value of an asset or financial arrangement Example: Depreciable property Charity A registered as a charitable entity in 2013. That same year, it bought office furniture for $50,000 (GST-exclusive) during the first month of the 2013 tax year. In 2018, Charities Services deregistered it because it hadn't complied with its constitution since registering. Charity A still owned the office furniture at the date of deregistration so it must file an income tax return for each year starting from the 2013 year. The value of the cost of premises, plant and equipment at the "date of cessation" must be depreciated, under the general tax rules, for each year it is used in Charity A's business. Using the depreciation rate of 19.2%, the cost of office furniture for each year from 2013 to the present day is: Year201320142015201620172018 Opening value ($)50,00040,40032,64326,37621,31217,220 Depreciation 9,600 7,757 6,267 5,064 4,092 3,306 Year-end balance ($) 40,40032,64326,37621,31217,22013,914 Charity A's assets are worth $50,000 and it applies depreciation of $9,600 in its 2013 income tax return. 39 ird.govt.nz Example: Financial arrangement Charity A lent $100,000 to B in 2013. The loan was repayable on demand and the annual interest rate was 10% (compounding). No loan repayments were made. Charity A must account for this loan under the financial arrangement rules in each of the years it had ceased to meet the requirements of being a charity. It must also calculate an opening value using this formula: Consideration paid to person + expenditure - consideration paid by person - income Consideration paid to person is the amount paid to the person before the date the charity ceased. Expenditure is the amount incurred under the financial arrangement rules before the date the charity ceased. Consideration paid by the person is the amount repaid before the date the charity ceased. Income is the amount that would have been derived under the financial arrangement rules before the date the charity ceased. Charity A calculates the loan as follows: Year201320142015201620172018 Opening value ($) 100,000110,000121,000133,100146,410161,051 Interest ($)10,00011,00012,10013,31014,64116,105 Year-end balance ($) 110,000121,000133,100146,410161,051177,156 In 2013 the opening value would be $100,000 and the closing value would be $110,000. Charity A accounts for $10,000 accrued interest income in its 2013 income tax return. 40 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS FBT When the deregistered charity is no longer eligible for the FBT exemption, the FBT rules will apply from the date of deregistration as explained earlier. A charity that has deregistered voluntarily will lose their FBT exemption from the date it's removed from the charities register. It will be liable for FBT for the return period from this date onwards. A charity that did not comply with their constitution will lose its FBT exemption from the date of non-compliance and FBT will apply for the return period from this date. Community housing entity Where a community housing entity no longer meets the requirements of being a charity and is deregistered from the charities register, it may be able to apply for an income tax exemption.

Associated persons These are: • people related by blood, adoption, marriage or de facto relationships • companies with mainly the same shareholders • a partner and a partnership • trusts and their association with trustees, beneficiaries and settlors. The association rules are complex and it is important to seek professional advice if there is any possibility of an association applying to you. Business Any enterprise or activity intended to make a profit is classed as a business. If an organisation runs a business, it must pay tax on all profits after expenses (except certain transactions made with its members). However, if a charity runs a business, it may be exempt from income tax on any profits that it uses for charitable purposes within New Zealand - see page 23. Charitable organisation or charity This is an organisation (incorporated or not) that carries on charitable activities or exists exclusively for charitable purposes. Generally, to obtain tax benefits, charities must be registered by the Charities Services. Many organisations consider themselves charitable because of the work they do or because they're registered under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957. As a result, they may also think they're exempt from income tax. However, an organisation is generally only exempt from income tax if it's registered with Charities Services, or if registration with Charities Services is unavailable (for example, because the entity is a non-resident), has been granted an exemption from Inland Revenue. This exemption does not apply to GST or PAYE. The organisation must still account for these. 7 ird.govt.nz Charitable purposes These include: • the relief of poverty • the advancement of education • the advancement of religion • activities for the benefit of the community. An organisation's purposes must fall within one of these categories to be charitable. Its activities or aims must be for public purposes and the benefit must be available to a large section of the community. In addition, it must not be carried on for the benefit or profit of any individual. If the beneficiaries are limited by blood ties the charitable purpose can still be met in some circumstances. Charitable purpose of marae A marae has a charitable purpose if: • the physical structure of the marae is on land that is a Mäori reservation, and • the funds of the marae are not used for a purpose other than the administration and maintenance of the land and of the physical structure of the marae or another charitable purpose. Charities Services (previously known as the Charities Commission) This is part of the Department of Internal Affairs and provides; • a registration and monitoring system for charitable organisations, • collection and processing of Annual Returns, and • support and education to the charitable sector on good governance, and management practice. Community housing entity A trustee, or a company whose activities are mainly the provision of housing, who meet specific criteria and are registered under the Housing Restructuring and Tenancy Matters Act 1992. They may be a registered charity or alternatively contact Inland Revenue to confirm if they qualify under a specific income tax exemption for community housing entities. 8 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Deregistration There are certain tax implications that apply when an organisation ceases to be a registered charity. For the purposes of this booklet, the deregistration rules outlined in part 4 apply to a charity that: • has been removed from the Charities Register by Charities Services, or • voluntarily deregisters, or • no longer meets the criteria for the income tax exemption for business income under section CW 42 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Donee organisation This is an organisation Inland Revenue considers having met the requirements set out in the Income Tax Act 2007. Generally, a donee organisation is one which applies its funds wholly or mainly to charitable, benevolent, philanthropy or cultural purposes within New Zealand. Certain other organisations may also qualify, such as a school board of trustees, tertiary education institutes or community housing entities. Individuals, companies and Ma ̄ ori authorities can get tax benefits by making gifts of money to a donee organisation - see page 25. Donor A person, company or other organisation that gives money or property to another. Incorporated organisations Organisations registered with the Companies Office of the Ministry of Economic Development are classed as incorporated organisations. For more information about becoming incorporated, see societies.govt.nz Non-profit body or Not-for-profit organisation A non-profit body is any society, association or organisation (incorporated or not): • that is not carried on for the profit or gain of any member, and • whose rules do not allow money, property or any other benefit to be distributed to any of its members. Organisation This is a general term, which covers all types of societies, institutions, companies, estates, trusts, funds, whether or not they have a charitable nature or are considered tax-exempt. 9 ird.govt.nz Payroll giving Payroll giving is a voluntary scheme where employees can make donations from their pay to support approved donee organisations. People who donate through payroll giving receive immediate tax credits relating to the donations they make each payday. Registered charity A trust, society or institution that is registered by Charities Services under the Charities Act. This is not the same as trusts registered with the Ministry of Business Innovation & Employment under the Charitable Trust Act. Residual income tax Residual income tax is the amount payable for the year, after deducting any tax credits from income tax assessed, but before deducting any provisional tax paid. Taxable activity Any activity carried on continuously or regularly that supplies (or intends to supply) goods and services to others for some form of payment (but not necessarily for a profit) is a taxable activity. Businesses, trades and professions are all taxable activities. Charitable organisations of any type can carry on taxable activities. Setting up a business is part of the taxable activity, as is the closing down and sale of a business. Taxable activities do not include: • employment as a salary or wage-earner • hobby activities • the occasional sale of domestic or private assets • making GST-exempt supplies such as residential rent or financial services. Turnover Turnover is the total gross value of all goods and services supplied, excluding GST. It includes: • goods and services sold or provided in New Zealand • exported goods • grants or subsidies • non-monetary items received under barter arrangements. 10 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Charities Act The Charities Act 2005 established a Charities Commission, now known as Charities Services, who provide: • a registration and monitoring system for charitable organisations • support and education for the charitable sector on good governance and management. Charities Services has published A guide to the Charities Act, which you can download from charities.govt.nz or order a copy by calling 0508 242 748. Charities Services also set up a Charities Register. Registration is voluntary but, unregistered charities are not eligible for tax exemptions on the grounds of charitable purposes. Charitable organisations can apply for registration online at charities.govt.nz or by posting a completed application form, with a copy of their rules, to Charities Services. Send an officer certification form for each officer of the organisation. You can get details about registration and copies of forms from Charities Services at charities.govt.nz or by calling 0508 242 748. Turnover for GST purposes does not include: • GST-exempt goods and services • unconditional gifts received. See page 15 for the treatment of assets. Unconditional gift An unconditional gift is a donation or payment made voluntarily to any not-for- profit organisation, where there's no identifiable direct benefit to the donor or the donor's family. Some unconditional gifts can be: • donations or koha • money from door-to-door appeals and street collections • bequests • voluntary school fees (but not school activity fees). Subscriptions, payments from trading activities and payments made by the Crown or a public authority are not unconditional gifts for GST purposes. 11 ird.govt.nz Part 1 - Basic tax information Whatever type of charitable organisation you're setting up or running, you'll usually have some tax obligations. These may include: • making several tax payments each year - some of these may be for your organisation's own tax liability, others may be on behalf of its employees • filing various return forms each year - these may be for income tax, GST, PAYE and/or FBT • calculating the profit from any business to work out how much tax is due - this is explained in our Smart business - IR320 guide and there is also some information in Part 3 of this guide • keeping certain business records - see page 20 for more information on this. This part of the guide explains all these obligations and gives you other general tax information you need to know. Income tax Charitable organisations are liable for income tax if they are not within the meaning of a 'tax charity'. To be a tax charity means the organisation is either: • a registered charity, or • a non-resident charity that has been approved by Inland Revenue, or • a business carried on by, or for the benefit of a registered charity, for example a company which is fully owned by a tax charity. The business needs to be a registered charity to qualify. A charitable organisation is not exempt for income tax on business income applied for charitable purposes outside New Zealand - see page 28. Other benefits The Income Tax Act 2007 contains specific income tax exemptions for charities. Some of these exemptions give benefits to charitable organisations and some give benefits to people, certain companies, or Mäori authorities who make donations to such organisations. The 'Tax benefits' section on page 22 of this guide gives more detail on these main conditions. It also covers other benefits available such as exemption from: • FBT (fringe benefit tax) on certain fringe benefits, and • RWT (resident withholding tax) on interest and dividends. 12 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS The Tax benefits section also covers any criteria and limitations to these exemptions. Your organisation may still be liable for other taxes, such as GST and PAYE. If your organisation is not entitled to any tax exemptions, it will be liable for income tax on some types of income it earns. Part 3 of this guide will help you work out which types of income are taxable. Income tax rates If a charitable organisation is incorporated under the Incorporated Societies Act 1908 or Companies Act 1993, then it's considered to be a company for income tax purposes. If it does not qualify for a tax exemption, its income is taxed at the company rate. Organisations that operate as trusts, including trusts incorporated under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957 and are not tax-exempt are liable for tax on trustee's income. Our guide Trusts and estates income tax rules - IR288 gives you more information about this. Charitable organisations not incorporated under a specific Act are treated as unincorporated charitable organisations. If such an organisation is not entitled to a tax exemption, it will be liable for income tax at the same rate as an individual taxpayer. However, it will not qualify for any of the tax credits that individual taxpayers can claim. For more information on individual and PAYE rates go to ird.govt.nz/tax-rates If a non-exempt organisation's residual income tax for a financial year is more than $5,000, it may have to pay provisional tax for the following year. For more information on provisional tax, read our guide Provisional tax - IR289 Filing income tax returns Generally, if your organisation is a tax charity, it's exempt from income tax. You do not need to file an income tax return unless we request one or you have income not covered by the exemption. You need to be registered by Charities Services to be eligible for an income tax exemption. If your organisation is not a tax charity or is a tax charity but receives non-exempt income, it will be required to file a return You must include a copy of the financial accounts or you can use our Schedule of business income - IR3B or Rental income - IR3R form to work out the gross income and allowable deductions for these activities. We also provide a Financial statements summary - IR10 form, which you can use instead a set of accounts. 13 ird.govt.nz Companies must file an IR4 tax return, estates or trusts must file an IR6 tax return, and any other society or association must file an IR 9 tax return. Returns can be filed along with your financial accounts (including IR3B, IR3R and IR10) in myIR. If your organisation has a balance date between October and March, you must file your tax return to us by 7 July. For other approved balance dates (see page 21), file the return by the 7th day of the 4th month after your balance date. If a tax agent completes the return, we may extend the due date. This is because most tax agents have extensions of time for filing their clients' tax returns. GST (goods and services tax) GST is a 15% tax on the supply (sale) of most goods and services in New Zealand, most goods imported into New Zealand and some specified imported services. Supplying or making a supply is your taxable activity. Important GST changes ‘Tax invoice’ requirements replaced by ‘taxable supply information’ From 1 April 2023, the requirement to use tax invoices has been replaced by a more general requirement to provide and keep certain records known as taxable supply information. Taxable supply information refers to a minimum set of information buyers and sellers need to keep as evidence of a transaction. The taxable supply information required depends on the value and the type of supply and no longer needs to be in a single physical document, such as a tax invoice. Your transaction records, accounting systems and contractual documents may, in combination, contain all the information you need to support the figures in your GST returns. For more information about taxable supply information go to ird.govt.nz/gst or the GST guide - IR375. ‘Debit note’ and ‘credit note’ replaced by ‘supply correction information’ From 1 April 2023, debit and credit notes used to correct previously issued tax invoices, have been replaced with supply correction information. 14 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Supply correction information must be provided when the taxable supply information (for example, invoice) included an incorrect amount of GST, or when the seller has included an incorrect amount in their GST return for a taxable supply they have made. For more information about supply correction information go to ird.govt.nz/gst or the GST guide - IR375. Registering for GST You must register for GST if your income from your taxable activities (turnover), including certain imported services you receive: • was over $60,000 for the last 12 months, or • is expected to go over $60,000 for the next 12 months. You can voluntarily register for GST if your turnover is less than $60,000. If you have not already registered for GST and need help deciding, use our guided help – Do I need to register for GST? If you’re a GST-registered you must collect GST and pay it to us. You can also claim back any GST on expenses you have as part of your business. A taxable activity is any activity continuously or regularly carried on by your charitable organisation that supplies, or intends to supply, goods and services to someone else for a consideration – it does not have to be an activity carried on with the intention of making a profit. To work out turnover, only include income liable for GST (including amounts which would be zero-rated). Do not include any income not liable for or exempt from GST. For example, include income from trading activities (both with members and non- members), subscriptions, grants and subsidies, but exclude income from donations, koha, bequests, residential rent, interest and dividends. You can register for GST online. To register for a myIR account visit ird.govt.nz/myir Registration of branches and divisions Generally, if an organisation operates through separate branches or divisions, they may each register separately for GST. If the total turnover of all the branches or divisions is more than $60,000 your organisation must register for GST. 15 ird.govt.nz Not-for-profit organisations (including charitable organisations) may apply to us in writing to treat each branch or division separately, and only register the individual branches with a turnover of more than $60,000. However, branches with a turnover of less than $60,000 may still register voluntarily. To register separately, each branch or division must: • have its own independent accounting system, and • be separately identified by its location or by the different activities it undertakes. Voluntary registration You can voluntarily register for GST if your turnover is less than $60,000. The advantage of voluntary registration is that charitable organisations may get frequent refunds of GST. This may happen when a charity runs a taxable activity and receives income liable for GST, but also receives donations or koha (unconditional gifts), which are not liable for GST. The charity can claim a GST credit for most of its expenses, but it only pays GST on its taxable activity income. However, charitable organisations need to be aware of the possible disadvantages of voluntary registration. • The organisation must provide and retain taxable supply information and file GST returns. • When you stop your registration, you must pay GST on the open (current) market value of any business assets you keep for private use. If you acquired the asset before 1 October 1986, the adjustment would be the lesser of cost price and the open market value. • Accounting for GST becomes difficult if non-liable income is involved, or if some assets are used for exempt purposes and others for business purposes. • If someone within the organisation completes the GST returns, there may be problems if that person's services become unavailable and their experience is lost. For more help You'll find more information on registering branches and divisions separately, or on voluntary registration, go to ird.govt.nz/register-for-gst-voluntarily GST and assets Generally, if you’re registered, GST can be claimed on the purchase of a business asset or for expenses relating to that asset. 16 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS If you do claim GST on an asset or on expenses relating to that asset, you’ll have to pay GST on the sale of the asset or equivalent event such as an insurance pay out. For further information go to ird.govt.nz/gst Employing staff If your organisation employs staff, you must register as an employer. You can register online at ird.govt.nz/myir Your tax obligations as an employer are: • Ask new employees to fill in a Tax code declaration - IR330, which will tell you the tax code to use and the rate for deducting tax from their wages. If any employees do not fill in an IR330, you must deduct tax from their wages at the non-notified rate of 45% (not including employees' ACC earners' levy). • Ask new contractors who receive schedular payments to fill in a Tax rate notification for contractors - IR330C, this tells you the rate of tax to deduct from their schedular payments. If any contractors do not provide you with an IR330C, you must deduct tax from their schedular payments at the non-notified rate. This rate is 20% for non-resident contractor companies, and 45% for all other contractors. You'll need to fill out a New employee details - IR346 form for each new employee and send it to us either: • before their first pay day; or • with the Employment information - IR348 form that includes their first pay. You’ll need their name, KiwiSaver status, IRD number, tax code and contact details. Include their date of birth if they have provided you with this information. After you submit your first Employment information - IR348, this information will be automatically shown on your subsequent IR348 forms. • Deduct PAYE from your employees' wages, and pay it to us either once or twice a month, depending on the total amount of wages paid. PAYE includes the ACC earners' levy to cover the cost of employees' non-work injuries. • Complete an Employment information - IR348 form with details of the required deductions for each employee. You can file your IR348 electronically through myIR. • Pay fringe benefit tax (FBT) on any fringe benefits (perks) you give your employees - see page 18. 17 ird.govt.nz • Deduct child support payments and student loan repayments from employees' wages if required. • Automatically enrol new employees who are eligible to join KiwiSaver and deduct their KiwiSaver contributions from their pay. • If you're making KiwiSaver employee deductions or employer contributions you need to send these to us with the PAYE. • Pay employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) on any employer cash contributions made to a superannuation scheme. For more information on your obligations as an employer, see the Employer's guide - IR335 Employees and contractors If members in your organisation carry out paid work, they're treated as employees. PAYE must be deducted from the payments they receive. If your organisation gives board and lodging rather than money to any employees for their work, generally you must work out the gross value of the benefit given to them, calculate PAYE based on this amount and pay it to us - see the 'Allowances' section in the Employer's guide - IR335 Other benefits paid to replace wages may be liable for FBT - see page 17. An exception to this is for certain benefits received by members of religious orders - see page 29 for more information. PAYE deducted from your employees' wages does not belong to your organisation, it must not be used for anything other than payment to us. If a self-employed contractor does a job for the organisation, this generally does not make the organisation an employer. However, if the job is one of those listed on the back of the Tax rate notification for contractors - IR330C, you must deduct tax and pay this to us. You must also ask the contractor to complete the IR330C. If they've completed the IR330C and have chosen their own tax rate on page 1, deduct tax at that rate. Note: there are minimum tax rates that apply, refer to the Employer's guide - IR335 If they've completed the IR330C and have not chosen a tax rate, use the standard rate listed on the back of the IR330C. If the contractor shows you a current Certificate of exemption or is a company (not in the agricultural industry), you do not need to deduct tax. A certificate of exemption cannot apply to any payments made under a labour hire arrangement by a labour hire business. If the type of work done is not listed on the IR330C, you do not need to deduct tax as the contractor is responsible for paying the tax. 18 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Some workers call themselves self-employed contractors or something similar, so their employers will not deduct PAYE. If, as the employer, the organisation has control over the work done, including what the person does and how, and where it's done, the worker is almost certainly an employee and is liable for PAYE. It's illegal to treat a true employee as self-employed to avoid deducting tax. If you're not sure whether a worker is a true employee, read Part 1 of the Employer's guide - IR335 and our leaflet, Self-employed or an employee? - IR336 Employer's superannuation cash contribution (employer contribution) An employer contribution is money paid by the employer to a superannuation fund, for the benefit of their employees. If your employees ask you to make deductions from their wages and pay them to a superannuation scheme, these are not employer contributions. Any employer contribution an employer makes to a superannuation fund for the benefit of an employee is liable for tax. There are several options for taxing these contributions - see the Employer's guide - IR335 for more information. A 'superannuation fund' is a scheme that has been registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. For more detailed information about superannuation fund contributions, refer to the Employer's guide - IR335 FBT (fringe benefit tax) Charitable organisations are generally exempt from paying FBT on any benefits provided to employees while they're carrying out the organisation's charitable activities. For example, if an employee has the use of a car while carrying out charitable work for the organisation, any private benefit arising is not subject to FBT. The exemption does not apply to any short-term charge facilities provided to employees of your charitable organisation above a certain threshold. This includes vouchers and store value cards, for example, petrol and supermarket voucher cards, Prezzy™ cards. For more information see Part 4 of our Fringe benefit tax guide - IR409 However, if your organisation operates a business which is outside its charitable, benevolent, cultural or philanthropic purposes and provides fringe benefits to any person employed in that business, FBT must be paid on those benefits. For example, if that business provides a car as part of a salary package, for use with its business activities, FBT must be paid on any private benefit. 19 ird.govt.nz GST on fringe benefits If an organisation is registered for both GST and FBT, it must make an adjustment for GST in its FBT returns for fringe benefits provided (unless the benefits are GST-exempt or zero-rated). See Part 8 of our Fringe benefit tax guide - IR409 for more information. Entertainment expenses If your organisation is not fully income tax exempt, only 50% of entertainment expenses that are not subject to FBT are deductible for income tax purposes. For more information, read our Entertainment expenses - IR268 guide. RWT (resident withholding tax) Charitable organisations registered with Charities Services are eligible for RWT exempt status. This means if your charitable organisation has money deposited in a bank or other financial institution, or has shares in a company, your organisation can receive interest or dividends without having RWT deducted. When Charities Services registers or deregisters an organisation as charitable, they inform us. We accept their decision and approve or cancel RWT exempt status. The IRD number of everyone with RWT exempt status is listed on the RWT exemption register on our website at ird.govt.nz/rwt-exemption Payers of investment income (for example, banks) access this register to confirm which of their customers are exempt from having RWT deducted. You may also like to tell anyone paying you interest or dividends about your exemption, so they stop deducting RWT. For more help Our Resident withholding tax on interest (RWT) payer's guide - IR283 has the information you'll need if your organisation pays interest and deducts RWT. NRWT (non-resident withholding tax) If your organisation pays interest, dividends, or royalties to a non-resident, this is called non-resident passive income and your organisation must deduct NRWT. For more information on NRWT go to ird.govt.nz/nrwt You can also contact our Non-resident Centre if you want to know more about the New Zealand tax residency rules for deducting and paying NRWT. 20 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS For more help These guides will help if you have questions about residency or NRWT: • New Zealand tax residence - IR292 • NRWT - payer's guide - IR291 • Visitor's tax guide - IR294 General information Record keeping You must keep enough records to be able to calculate your organisation’s income, expenses, and tax liabilities and to enable us to confirm your accounts if required. Some records you must keep are: • invoices and receipts (taxable supply information if you are GST registered) • debit and credit notes (supply correction information if you are GST registered) • any other necessary documents to confirm your accounts • bank statements • stocktake figures for the end of the financial year • wage records for all employees, including Employer Superannuation Contribution Tax records • interest and dividend payment records. You must keep all records for 7 years, even if you cease operating (except for incorporated organisations that have been wound up and dissolved). All records must be in English or Mäori unless you have written approval from us to use another language. If you’re a charitable or donee organisation (see pages 6 to 8) you must also keep a record of: • the sources of any donations made to it, and • how funds have been used, within New Zealand or overseas. If we request it, you should be able to fill in a tax return for your organisation and identify the source and end use of all its funds. It's important to keep all this information as we routinely audit these records. You can read more about audits on our website at ird.govt.nz/audits 21 ird.govt.nz IRD numbers No matter what type of charitable organisation you're running, it will need an IRD number. The IRD number for GST, PAYE, FBT or RWT purposes. You’ll need your IRD number is also used for Charities Services when applying for charitable registration. To get an IRD number, you'll need to send us a completed IRD number application - resident non-individual - IR596 form. If you're incorporating a new company online through the Companies Office website, you can apply for an IRD number at the same time. Or, you can complete the IR596 form online, print, sign and send it to us. You'll need to provide a photocopy of one of the following: • certificate of incorporation • deed of trust • certificate of registration. You must also supply the names, addresses and personal IRD numbers of each shareholder, director, trustee, or executive office holder. Balance dates For most customers, the accounting year ends on 31 March - the balance date. If you require a different balance date for your organisation other than 31 March, you must apply to us in writing, stating your reasons. We usually only approve a change if there are sound business reasons for doing so, or if your business activity is in an industry where there is a recognised balance date other than 31 March. Due dates Some organisations may have to file returns and make payments to us for several tax types. To keep track of the due dates for payments and returns, use the calculator on ird.govt.nz or our Tax due date calendar - IR328 22 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Part 2 - Tax benefits Tax legislation benefits charities by allowing them income tax exemptions. It also allows a tax credit or deduction for donations by individuals, companies or Mäori authorities to donee organisations. Note that a charity may also be a donee organisation but will need to register with Charity Services to be one. If an organisation with charitable purposes is on Inland Revenue’s approved donee list, but is not registered with Charities Services, it will need to register by 1 April 2020 to retain its donee status. This part of the guide explains how these benefits work and the conditions an organisation must meet to get a particular benefit. Charities To qualify for an exemption from income tax, trustees of a trust must derive income for charitable purposes, and societies or institutions must be established and maintained exclusively for charitable purposes. A charitable purpose is where the rules of an organisation clearly state that its purposes are for one or more of the following: • the relief of poverty • the advancement of education • the advancement of religion • any other matters that are beneficial to the community. The organisation's aims must also be for a public purpose except where they are for the relief of poverty. The benefit must be available to a large part of the community and the activities must not result in the private benefit or profit of any individual. You'll find further information about charitable purposes on the Charities Services website at charities.govt.nz 23 ird.govt.nz Income tax for charities Non-business (investment) income Registered charities are exempt from income tax on non-business income such as interest, dividends and rents. They may use the non-business income for charitable purposes in and outside New Zealand and still keep the income tax exemption. Business income The portion of a registered charity's business income which is used for charitable purposes in New Zealand is exempt from income tax. If an organisation uses its business income for charitable purposes outside New Zealand as well, only the New Zealand part is exempt. Business income will not be exempt if anyone connected with the charitable organisation: • receives or can receive any type of benefit or income from the organisation, and • can determine or influence the nature or amount of any benefit they receive. Page 28 has more details about the limitations to this exemption. These exemptions only apply to the charitable organisation's income. They do not apply to any other earned income passed on to a charitable organisation for charitable purposes. The people or organisation who earned the income must pay tax on it. However, the gifting of this income may qualify for a donation tax credit or deduction - see page 26. Income derived from a business carried on by, or for, or for the benefit of a charitable organisation is exempt from income tax. From 1 April 2020 to qualify for or retain this exemption the business will need to register with Charities Services in its own right. It will no longer be sufficient that the income is for the benefit of a registered charitable organisation. Non-resident charities Non-resident charities that only carry out charitable purposes outside New Zealand may not be able to be registered with Charities Services because they: • are not established in New Zealand, and • do not have a strong connection with New Zealand. In these circumstances we may be able to approve an income tax exemption for non- business income if the entity meets certain criteria. 24 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS You can find out more about the criteria and the application process at ird.govt.nz/non-resident-charities Non-resident charities with business income used to carry out charitable purposes in New Zealand must be registered with Charities Services to be eligible for an income tax exemption on that income. This exemption covers both business and non-business income used for charitable purposes in New Zealand, but not business income applied overseas. Charitable estates The executor or administrator of a deceased person's estate may derive income from any money or assets left to charitable organisations while the will is being finalised. If the organisation benefiting from the will is entitled to an income tax exemption, the income derived while the funds are held awaiting finalisation is also exempt. This exemption only covers the income derived from the money or assets of the estate that have been left to the charity. The estate must still pay tax on any income it earns from other assets or money. If the trustees want to confirm their tax exemption they need to send us, during that intervening period, a copy of the deceased's will and the following details: • details of any charity that will receive gifts under the will and the amount they will receive • the rights of the various beneficiaries under the will • the net value (after debts and liabilities) of the estate available to be distributed to the beneficiaries • the shares and the prospective shares of the beneficiaries in the income and assets of the estate. Gifts to charities Gift duty was repealed for gifts made after 1 October 2011. If your organisation needs information on the tax implications for gifts made before this date, then you can contact us for further information. 25 ird.govt.nz Donee organisations When an organisation is considered a donee organisation for tax purposes, any gifts of money it receives from individuals, Ma ̄ ori authorities and certain companies, qualify for tax advantages. You will need to apply to Inland Revenue for approval to become a donee organisation. See pages 26 and 27 for more information on these tax benefits. An organisation does not have to be a registered charity to be eligible for donee organisation status. However, from 1 April 2020 if the organisation has only charitable purposes it must register as a charity to obtain donee status. A donee organisation must be a New Zealand society, institution, association, organisation, trust or fund. Its funds must be applied wholly or mainly to charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes in New Zealand. This means that the organisation's aims or purposes should be carried out in New Zealand, even if this results in paying money outside New Zealand to achieve these purposes. Inland Revenue administers the 'wholly or mainly' requirement on a 'safe harbour' basis of '75% or more'. This means Inland Revenue will generally accept that an organisation meeting or exceeding the safe harbour percentage of 75% has wholly or mainly applied funds to specified purposes within New Zealand. This applies to and from the 2019/20 income year. For more information, see our Interpretation Statement IS 18/05 Income tax – donee organisations and its accompanying fact sheet on applying the 'safe harbour' approach. These can be found at taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/safe-harbour The safe harbour percentage is relevant only if the organisation applies funds to purposes that are not specified purposes within New Zealand. Cultural purposes include dramatic, theatrical, operatic, ballet, choral or musical purposes. Benevolent and philanthropic purposes basically mean doing good for other people. This includes organisations that are not charitable in the strict legal sense, but are popularly seen as charitable, for example, organisations whose proceeds or funds are used to benefit all or a large part of the public. Another condition is that the organisation must not be carried on for the private benefit of any member or an associate of any member. Charities that apply the principal part or all of their funds outside New Zealand must be approved for donee organisation status by Parliament. Approval is limited to organisations whose funds are mainly used for: • the relief of poverty, hunger, sickness or the results of war or natural disaster • the economy of developing countries (as recognised by the United Nations) • raising the educational standards of a developing country. 26 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Inland Revenue considers these applications and makes a recommendation to government. Organisations that are approved are listed in the Income Tax Act. A donee organisation is still liable for income tax on any taxable income it earns from sources outside its own membership if it has no other income tax exemption. There are government guidelines for organisations seeking charitable donee status for their overseas activities. For information on the guidelines go to ird.govt.nz/overseas-donee-status Donation tax credit or deduction Gifts of money by individuals Individuals who give cash donations of $5 or more to donee organisations may claim a tax credit of one-third (33.33%) of the total of all donations, up to the amount of their taxable income. To qualify for this tax credit: • the gift must be made in money - gifts of goods or property do not qualify • the gift cannot be made under the will of a deceased person • each gift must be $5 or more. However, gifts can still qualify for a tax credit if an arrangement is in place to make a gift of under $5 through regular instalments throughout the year, and the total at the end of the year is $5 or more (for example, if you give $1 each week to your church, making the total contribution for the year $52). Where an employer offers payroll giving, they must make sure all donations are passed to the requested donee organisations. This must be done by the PAYE payment due date closest to the end of the two months from the last day of the pay period when the donation was deducted from their employee's wage. When receipts are issued by the donee organisation they should be in the employer's name and state the donation was made under the payroll giving scheme. The employee does not receive a receipt from the donee as they receive a tax credit reducing their PAYE at the time the donation was deducted from their wages. 27 ird.govt.nz Gifts of money by certain companies A company (including an unlisted close company), can claim a donation deduction for cash donations it makes to donee organisations. A 'close company' is one that has five or fewer shareholders. The maximum donation deduction that can be claimed is limited to the company's net income (that is, income, less expenses, but before the donation deduction is deducted). For more on tax credits on gifts and donations go to ird.govt.nz/donations Gift of money by Māāori aauthorities A Mäori authority may claim a deduction against its net income for cash donations it makes to a Mäori association or a donee organisation. The maximum deduction allowed is limited by the Mäori authority's net income (that is, income less expenses, but before the donation deduction is deducted). Receipts Please provide the donor with a receipt that contains: 1. An official stamp or letterhead and the full name of the organisation. Where the local organisation is part of a larger group or organisation, please provide clear reference to this on the receipt. For example, 'Relief of Poverty Foundation, Wellington Branch'. 2. The following identifiers for the organisation: a) the DIA-Charities Services registration number, and b) its IRD number 3. A clear statement that the amount received is a donation. Exclude membership subscriptions or fees, purchases of goods or services and raffle tickets as they do not qualify for donation tax credits. 4. The full name of the donor and their address if held 5. The full amount and date of the donation (or if there were regular payments throughout the year you may show the total amount for the income year ending 31 March) 6. The full name, designation (for example, Treasurer, Secretary), and signature of an authorised person 7. A receipt number, unique to each receipt. 28 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Make sure the organisation: • keeps copies of all receipts issued for seven years. We may wish to inspect or verify issued receipts • does not use correction fluid on or cross out details and write corrections on receipts. Just cancel the incorrect receipt, ensure the donor’s incorrect copy is returned and noted as cancelled in the organisation’s records. Then redo a correct receipt for the donor and your records. • Treasurers and officers should not authorise or sign their own receipts or those relating to their immediate family. • Keep the contact details of authorised persons that oversee donations, such as the secretary or treasurer, up-to-date, as we may wish to contact them to verify receipts. To update Inland Revenue, you may use the form Appoint an Executive Office Holder to act on your behalf - IR401 Eligibility for exemption or donee organisation status Charities registered with Charities Services You do not need to apply to Inland Revenue to confirm your income tax-exempt status. When you register as a charity, as long as they have your IRD number, Charities Services will pass on the details to us so you will not need to contact us separately. In most cases, charities with non-business income only, which are registered with Charities Services, will be eligible for the exemptions. Registered charities carrying out a business will need to consider some limitations and exceptions to the exemption, (summarised on pages 28-31), and self-determine their tax position. These details will also show if you're applying for donee organisation status. We'll decide about your status based on this information, and advise you in writing. This is a valuable document for your organisation so keep a copy in a safe place. For more information on tax exemption go to ird.govt.nz/charity-services 29 ird.govt.nz Basic necessities for members of religious organisations If certain conditions are met, a member of a religious society or order can be provided with board, lodging and/or basic personal necessities, and receive these tax exempt. This only applies when the member is unpaid, their only occupation is service in that religious society or order, and it is the nature of the service that members are not paid or rewarded for their work. For more information on this tax exemption, go to ird.govt.nz/exempt-income- religious-organisations Not registered with Charities Services From 1 April 2020 all organisations with charitable purposes will need to be registered with Charities Services to be considered for donee status. If your organisations has benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes but not charitable purposes, and you want us to consider you as a donee organisation, send us: • an up-to-date, signed copy of your rules, constitution, trust deed or other founding document • a copy of your certificate of incorporation (if incorporated) • a letter requesting donee status • details of how the organisation has been (or will be) operating. We'll consider your application and let you know in writing. The criteria that we  look at for donee status is summarised on the following pages. Inland Revenue's criteria There are some specific requirements for your organisation to have donee organisation status and for charities claiming the income tax exemption on business income. In addition to Inland Revenue's rules, your governing document needs to contain certain rules and clauses to register as a charity. For information about the registration criteria go to Charities Services website charities.govt.nz or call 0508 242 748. Personal benefits A donee organisation's funds cannot be used to provide personal benefit to its members, trustees or associates. Sometimes the aims or powers may allow benefits to members, but they may only benefit to a limited extent from their membership. Some acceptable benefits are newsletters that do not require a subscription, voting rights to appoint officers of the organisation and any benefit also available to the general public. 30 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS If any member can receive more than these benefits, the organisation cannot be considered as a donee organisation. Also, if a member can in any way influence the amount of any benefit they receive, the organisation will not qualify as a donee organisation. The organisation may pay members for their services, as long as the payments are reasonable, not more than normal commercial rates and for services actually provided. A member may also be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred on the organisation's behalf and earn interest on money lent to the organisation (provided the loan is at a normal commercial rate). If an organisation's rules allow unrestricted benefits to members, a clause preventing this must be added before we'll grant donee organisation status. An example of such a clause is: "(1) All income, benefit, or advantage must be used to advance the charitable purposes of the organisation (2) No member of the organisation, or anyone associated with a member, is allowed to take part in, or influence any decision made by the organisation in respect of payments to, or on behalf of, the member or associated person of any income, benefit, or advantage. (3) Any payments made must be for goods or services that advance the charitable purpose and must be reasonable and relative to payments that would be made between unrelated parties (4) The provisions and effect of this clause shall not be removed from this document and shall be included and implied in any document replacing this document." Altering the rules An organisation may change its rules, constitution or trust deed through a rule alteration clause. To qualify as a donee organisation, this must be worded so any clauses dealing with purposes, benefit to members and winding up cannot be changed so that they would affect the requirements for donee organisation status. If the rule alteration clause is not restricted, we will not grant donee organisation status. The following is a suitable restriction (proviso) for a rule alteration clause: 'No addition to or alteration or removal of the rules shall be approved if it detracts from or alters the nature of the organisation'. 31 ird.govt.nz If the organisation is a registered charity or intending to register it will not need a proviso (as above) because all alterations must be sent to Charities Services to comply with the Charities Act. Purposes limited to New Zealand An organisation seeking donee organisation status must be a society, association, or trust that applies its funds wholly or mainly in New Zealand to promote charitable, benevolent, philanthropic and cultural purposes. If your organisation applies funds for purposes both within and outside New Zealand we advise you to record these separately in your accounts. Any funds applied overseas will not qualify for a tax credit or deduction unless your organisation has been approved as a donee organisation. Some organisations (such as overseas charities) apply all or most of their general funds outside New Zealand. If the organisation sets up a separate fund for use in New Zealand it may qualify as a donee organisation. Winding up If an organisation's rules or constitution allows it to be wound up, the winding-up clause must prevent the funds or assets from passing to a private purpose. This means the rules for a donee organisation must have a clause stating that, on winding up, the income and assets will be held for charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes in New Zealand. When a donee organisation is wound up, any remaining income and assets must be distributed to an organisation that carries on activities wholly or mainly in New Zealand. The organisation receiving the distribution may be either a donee organisation or a charity. However, if the donee organisation is a registered charity the clause must state that, on winding up, the income and assets must be used for charitable purposes in New Zealand. 32 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Business activity Only the business income of a registered charity used for charitable purposes in New Zealand is exempt from tax. Any business income used overseas is liable for income tax. It will also be liable if anyone connected to the organisation: • receives or can receive any type of benefit or income from the organisation, and • can determine or influence the nature or amount of any benefit they receive. However, there are two situations when an organisation may pay someone connected with it (or provide other benefits) without losing its exemption. If the person: • is reimbursed on a reasonable basis for expenses incurred on behalf of the organisation • lends money to the organisation, it may pay interest at normal commercial rates. A person who provides services to the organisation as part of their professional practice cannot influence or determine the nature or amount of any benefit they receive. The Public Trustee, the Mäori Trustee and any trustee company are deemed to be carrying on business as a professional public practice. A person is considered connected to a charitable organisation carrying on a business if they are: • the settlor or trustee of a trust • a shareholder or director of a company • a settlor or trustee of a trust who is a shareholder of the company • an associated person of any of these people. There are two further examples where an exemption does not apply. • If someone transfers an asset to a trust but retains an interest in the asset, they're considered to be a settlor of the trust and to be gaining a benefit. • If a person connected to the organisation transfers an asset to the organisation but retains an interest in the asset. If the organisation uses the asset to earn rental income, the person will be considered to be receiving a benefit since they still have an interest in the asset. 33 ird.govt.nz Part 3 - Income Charitable organisations can receive many types of income, including subscriptions, grants, subsidies, donations or koha, fees, raffle money, trading profits and proceeds from selling assets. Some grants made to not-for-profit organisations fall within the meaning of an unconditional gift or donation (see page 10) especially if given by charitable trusts. These are not liable for GST. If you're not sure please contact us to discuss. The table on page 35 shows whether the different types of income are liable for: • income tax (for organisations not entitled to an exemption), and • GST (for those organisations registered for GST). You'll notice that income 'exempt from GST' is different from income that's 'not liable for GST'. This is important when working out your claim for GST input tax credits on goods and services bought to run your organisation. GST-registered not-for-profit organisations (including charities) may claim input tax credits on expenses incurred in deriving income that's either liable or not liable for GST, but not in deriving income that is exempt from GST. Example A GST-registered charitable organisation receives income from: a government grantliable for GST trading activitiesliable for GST donationsnot liable for GST renting a residential property exempt from GST The charitable organisation can claim a GST input tax credit for all the expenses except those incurred in deriving the rent, which is exempt from GST. Income exempt from GST includes: • income from financial services, including interest from banks and dividends from public companies • proceeds made by a not-for-profit organisation from selling goods and services that were donated to it • rent received from residential accommodation. 34 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Table of income types Liable for income tax if no tax exemption applies  Not liable for income tax Liable for GST Not liable for GST Exempt from GST Subscriptions  Donations  Koha  †  Bequests  Grants  Unconditional gifts  Subsidies  \* Suspensory loans  Trading activities  Raffles or housie proceeds  \* Admission fees  Affiliation fees  Sale of donated goods or services  \* Sale of purchased goods  Sale of assets or equipment  Insurance receipts   \* Hall or equipment hire  Rent received (residential)  Rent received (commercial)  Penalty payments (fines)  Advertising or sponsorship  Interest or dividends  Gaming machines  \* Liable in certain situations † The tax treatment of koha depends on what it is.

There are some limitations to this. See pages 23 and 28-32 for more information. 35 ird.govt.nz Part 4 - Charity deregistration There are a number of different reasons a charity may be deregistered. The reason will determine the date of deregistration and the tax treatment of the charity from this date. A charity can be deregistered from the Charities Register by: • voluntary deregistration or • Charities Services deregisters it. From 6 April 2016 the tax treatment that applies to a deregistered charity also applies to non-registered charities that stop meeting the specific exemption in section CW 42(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 for business income. For more information on the tax treatment of charities that deregister or charities that stop meeting the business income tax exemption go to ird.govt.nz/charitable-organisations Voluntary deregistration A voluntary deregistration is when the charity requests Charities Services to remove them from their register. This can occur when either the charity has: • ceased and is winding up, or • not ceased but no longer operates as a charitable organisation. From 14 April 2014, a charity's voluntary deregistration date will be the day it's removed from the charities register. Deregistered by Charities Services Charities Services will deregister a charity which has failed to comply with the Charities Act 2005. From 1 April 2015 the date of deregistration will be based on the type of non-compliance that occurred as follows: If the charity...the date of deregistration will be... never acted in accordance with its constitution backdated to the start date stopped acting in accordance with its constitution from the date of the change did not file an annual return.from the date Charities Services removes it from the register. 36 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Court proceedings/appeals If the charity is involved in court proceedings or appealing a decision to deregister it for any of the above reasons, it will be deregistered on the date when all court proceedings or appeals are finished or exhausted. Entities not registered with Charities Services From 6 April 2016 the deregistration tax rules also apply to a non-registered Charity that stops meeting the specific exemption in section CW 42(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 for their business income. Because the deregistration date does not apply to these entities, the references to 'date of deregistration' below need to be read as the date the charity no longer meets the requirements for an income tax exemption. Tax treatment The charity will have one year from the date of deregistration to dispose of or transfer any assets (including accumulated income) less liabilities for charitable purposes or as set out in its constitution. Otherwise, income tax will be payable one year from the date of deregistration on the net assets which the charity does not dispose of or transfer within that time. From the 1 April 2019 small charities with net assets of $10,000 or less will not be subject to this deregistration tax. Charities with over $10,000 net assets will be subject to tax on the total value of the net assets (including the initial $10,000). There are certain adjustments to exclude certain assets. For example the charity can make an adjustment for any assets, other than money, donated to the charity while it was registered. You make the adjustment by: • taking the entity’s assets (less liabilities) on the end date, • less: – assets disposed of or transferred for charitable purposes within one year of the registration end date. – the value of any assets, other than money, donated to the charity while it was registered, • Record the resulting value of assets in the entity’s income tax return for the period that includes the day one year after the charity was deregistered (or stopped meeting the criteria for its charitable income tax exemption). 37 ird.govt.nz Example: $10,000 and under net assets Charity One’s date of deregistration is 1 July 2019. Its balance sheet at 1 July 2019 is shown below. AssetsLiabilities Cash $ 50Loan $ 200 Inventory $ 500Organisations Equity $ 350 The income calculation will be: • Assets $550 less liabilities $200 equals net assets of $350 As deregistration is after 1 April 2019 and net assets are not more than $10,000 no income arises. Example: Assets over $10,000 Charity D’s date of deregistration is 1 July 2019. It’s balance sheet at 1 July 2019 is shown below. AssetsLiabilities Cash $ 10,500Loan $ 200 Inventory $ 500 Equity Land (donated) $ 3,000Organisations equity $ 13,150 One year later no assets have been disposed of or transferred. The income calculation will be: • assets $14,000 less $200 liabilities equals $13,800 • less the value of the (donated) land 3,000 = $10,800. The de-registered Charity D will include $10,800 as income for tax purposes. 38 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS How to calculate the value of an asset or financial arrangement Example: Depreciable property Charity A registered as a charitable entity in 2013. That same year, it bought office furniture for $50,000 (GST-exclusive) during the first month of the 2013 tax year. In 2018, Charities Services deregistered it because it has not complied with its constitution since registering. Charity A still owned the office furniture at the date of deregistration so it must file an income tax return for each year starting from the 2013 year. The value of the cost of premises, plant and equipment at the 'date of cessation' must be depreciated, under the general tax rules, for each year it is used in Charity A's business. Using the depreciation rate of 19.2%, the cost of office furniture for each year from 2013 to the present day is: Year201320142015201620172018 Opening value ($)50,00040,40032,64326,37621,31217,220 Depreciation 9,600 7,757 6,267 5,064 4,092 3,306 Year-end balance ($) 40,40032,64326,37621,31217,22013,914 Charity A's assets are worth $50,000 and it applies depreciation of $9,600 in its 2013 income tax return. 39 ird.govt.nz Example: Financial arrangement Charity A lent $100,000 to B in 2013. The loan was repayable on demand and the annual interest rate was 10% (compounding). No loan repayments were made. Charity A must account for this loan under the financial arrangement rules in each of the years it had ceased to meet the requirements of being a charity. It must also calculate an opening value using this formula: Consideration paid to person + expenditure - consideration paid by person - income Consideration paid to person is the amount paid to the person before the date the charity ceased. Expenditure is the amount incurred under the financial arrangement rules before the date the charity ceased. Consideration paid by the person is the amount repaid before the date the charity ceased. Income is the amount that would have been derived under the financial arrangement rules before the date the charity ceased. Charity A calculates the loan as follows: Year201320142015201620172018 Opening value ($) 100,000110,000121,000133,100146,410161,051 Interest ($)10,00011,00012,10013,31014,64116,105 Year-end balance ($) 110,000121,000133,100146,410161,051177,156 In 2013 the opening value would be $100,000 and the closing value would be $110,000. Charity A accounts for $10,000 accrued interest income in its 2013 income tax return. 40 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS FBT When the deregistered charity is no longer eligible for the FBT exemption, the FBT rules will apply from the date of deregistration as explained earlier. A charity that has deregistered voluntarily will lose their FBT exemption from the date it's removed from the charities register. It will be liable for FBT for the return period from this date onwards. A charity that did not comply with their constitution will lose its FBT exemption from the date of non-compliance and FBT will apply for the return period from this date. Community housing entity Where a community housing entity no longer meets the requirements of being a charity and is deregistered from the charities register, it may be able to apply for an income tax exemption.
