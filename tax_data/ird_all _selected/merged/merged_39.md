Page 1 21 December 2007 Special report from the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue Research and development tax credit legislation Legislation introducing a tax credit for eligible research and development activities has been enacted. The R&D legislation appears only in the Income Tax Act 2007 (as it comes into effect from the 2008-09 income year) and the Tax Administration Act 1994. As the R&D provisions in the Taxation (Business Taxation and Remedial Matters) Act 2007 have been rewritten and restructured, this report is intended to provide assistance to potential claimants and their advisors in understanding the scheme of the new legislation. A more detailed account will be released in a Taxation Information Bulletin to be published in 2008. Draft guidelines on the R&D tax credit have also been released by Inland Revenue for consultation. These can be found at http://www.ird.govt.nz/public-consultation/. Introduction New tax rules provide a tax credit for New Zealand businesses that perform R&D on their own behalf, or that commission others to perform R&D for them, provided the R&D is performed predominantly in New Zealand. The definition of R&D is in line with that in comparable jurisdictions where it has proved to be sustainable. It applies not just to white-coat research but to the development of new or improved products or processes in a variety of industries. R&D expenditure that is eligible for the credit includes the cost of employee remuneration, training and travel of employees conducting R&D, depreciation of tangible property, consumables, certain overheads and payments to entities conducting R&D on behalf of the claimant. The credit applies at the rate of 15 percent of eligible expenditure in a year. It is claimed in the annual income tax return, offsetting the tax liability of the claimant. Surplus credits are refundable. This means that businesses that have a tax loss or have only tax-exempt income receive the credits in cash. Page 2 Background The government first raised the option of introducing an R&D tax credit in the Business Tax Review discussion document, released in July 2006. This was followed by an issues paper in November 2006 which proposed general eligibility criteria, a definition of R&D and a list of eligible expenditure. The government announced the introduction of the credit as part of the Business Tax Reform package in Budget 2007. R&D tax incentives are common overseas. The rationale for them is that there is under- investment by businesses in R&D because the investing firm does not capture all of the benefits of the investment. There are likely to be spill-over benefits to New Zealand when businesses invest in R&D and providing an R&D tax credit will encourage firms to invest more in R&D. There is a body of international evidence that suggests that tax incentives have been effective at encouraging business R&D. Key features Eligibility for the credit (sections LH 1 to LH 3 and LH 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007) To be eligible, a claimant must be in business in New Zealand. Non-residents must be in business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment in New Zealand. The expenditure for which a claim is made must relate to that business or an intended business of the claimant. An exception to the requirement to be in business exists for industry research co-operatives which have special rules. Crown Research Institutes, tertiary institutions, and District Health Boards, their associates and entities under the control of any combination of them, are not eligible for the credit. R&D performed by a business in partnership with such an entity is also not eligible. Claimants must bear the financial risk associated with the R&D project, have control over the work and effectively own the project results. When R&D is outsourced, this distinguishes the person who commissions the R&D (who is eligible for the credit) from the person who merely performs the R&D on behalf of someone else. The performer is not eligible for the credit, and the incentive is provided to the party making R&D investment decisions. The claimant must also spend at least $20,000 of eligible expenditure in the year a claim is made unless the R&D services are purchased from an unassociated listed research provider. These are entities that perform research for others on a commercial basis. The business must conduct R&D activities as these are defined in section LH 7. They must be systematic, investigative and experimental activities that either seek to advance science or technology through the resolution of scientific or technological uncertainty or that involve an appreciable element of novelty. In either case the activities must be directed at acquiring new knowledge or creating new or improved products or processes. These are “SIE” R&D activities. Certain activities are excluded, as they are in other jurisdictions, generally to delineate more clearly the boundary between innovative and routine activity. Page 3 Activities that support SIE activities, but that are not systematic, investigative and experimental in themselves, are eligible if they are wholly or mainly for the purpose of the SIE activities, and are required for, and integral to, them. Rate of credit (section LH 4) The credit applies at the rate of 15 percent of eligible expenditure. Eligible expenditure (section LH 3(1)(e), LH 5, LH 6, LH 8, Schedule 21) Expenditure is eligible only if it is of a type listed in Schedule 21 Part A and not listed in Part B. The expenditure must also generally be deductible in the year it is incurred, although there are exceptions from this requirement for certain expenditure. Eligible expenditure includes the cost of employee remuneration, training and travel; depreciation of tangible assets used in conducting R&D; certain overhead costs; consumables and payments to third parties for R&D performed on behalf of the claimant. Ineligible expenditure is listed in Schedule 21 Part B. The main items are interest; loss on sale or write-off of depreciable property; the cost of acquiring core technology (technology used as a basis for further R&D); expenditure funded from a government grant or the required co-funding; expenditure on intangible assets and professional fees in determining eligibility. Expenditure on R&D done overseas is not eligible unless it part of a project based in New Zealand and is 10 percent or less of the eligible expenditure incurred on the project in New Zealand. Cap on internal software development (sections LH 9 to LH 13, LH 17) There is a cap of $3 million on eligible expenditure where the R&D activity is “internal software development”. Internal software development includes the development of software without the main purpose of sale to non-associates, as well as the development of software which is used in administration of the claimant’s business or to provide its customers with services other than the use of its computer technology or software. The cap applies whether the activity is an “SIE” activity or a support activity. The level of the cap can be increased by the Minister of Finance when it is in the national interest. Claimants under common control that undertake internal software development will be required to calculate their expenditure as a group and to allocate the cap between members. Administrative procedures (sections OB 4(3)(eb), OB 7C, OK 2(3)(cb), OK 4B, OP 5(2)(bb), OP 7(3)(fb), OP 11B Income Tax Act 2007; sections 3(1), 22(2) and (7), 33A(2), 43A(2), 68D and 68E, 91AAP, 91C(4), 108(1B), 108B(3)(d), 113(1), 113D, 141(7C) and (7D) Tax Administration Act 1994) Businesses will claim the tax credit in an income tax return. They will work out their liability for tax in the normal way, and then subtract the amount of the credit. Where the amount of the credit exceeds the tax liability, the balance is used to reduce other tax liabilities, or is refundable in cash. Page 4 The credit will reduce residual income tax, which will reduce provisional tax liability, allowing businesses that pay provisional tax to receive the benefit of the credit closer to the time they incur R&D expenditure. This reduction will be immediate for people who estimate provisional tax, but delayed for people who use the “uplift” method for calculating provisional tax. Companies and Māori authorities will receive a credit in their imputation credit accounts for an income tax liability that is satisfied by way of the credit. To be eligible for the credit, a business must provide – in addition to the income tax return – a detailed statement of R&D activities and expenditure. This is collected for administrative, including evaluation, purposes. From a date to be appointed by the Governor-General by Order in Council (but no later than 1 April 2010), a potential claimant will be able to apply to the Commissioner to determine whether an activity is R&D, whether a person is eligible for the credit, and whether expenditure is eligible for the credit. Binding rulings are not available on these matters. There are a number of other minor and consequential amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 relating to the new tax credit. Application date The credit will apply from the 2008–09 income year. Detailed analysis Unless otherwise indicated, examples assume a standard income year and section references are to the Income Tax Act 2007. Who can claim the credit (section LH 1) In business in New Zealand (subsection (1)) To be eligible, a claimant must carry on business in New Zealand. Non-residents must carry on business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment. This requires activities to be a profession, trade, manufacture or undertaking with an intention to make a pecuniary profit. All types of New Zealand businesses are eligible, whether incorporated or not, including businesses that earn only exempt income. In the case of partnerships, the business test is applied at the partnership level, rather than to individual partners. (See discussion below on section LH 3(3)(a)). An exception exists for industry research co-operatives which do not need to be in business. However, there is a requirement that the members of the co-operative be in business. That requirement is discussed further below in relation to section LH 3 and other requirements in relation to the co-operatives are discussed below in relation to section LH 16. Page 5 Crown Research Institutes, tertiary institutions and District Health Boards (subsection (2)) Crown Research Institutes, tertiary institutions, and District Health Boards and their associates, and entities controlled by any combination of those entities, are not eligible for the credit. These entities are defined in section YA 1 through cross-references to their enabling Acts. Crown Research Institutes are defined in section 12 of the Crown Research Institutes Act 1992. A tertiary institution is a body established under section 162 of the Education Act 1989. A District Health Board is a board established under section 19 of the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Act 2000. Association is determined using the 1988 version provisions (section YB 20(2)(ob)). However, the tripartite test does not apply for the purpose of determining who is associated under section LH 1(2) (section YB 4(3B)). R&D performed by a person in partnership with one of these entities is also not eligible, see discussion below on section LH 3(2). Example ACo is 25 percent owned by a Crown Research Institute, 26 percent owned by a trust whose beneficiary is a tertiary institution, and 49 percent is owned by a private firm BCo. ACo is not an eligible person. BCo purchases 5 percent of the shares from the trust and thereby takes a controlling share in ACo which it later sells to a tertiary institution. ACo is an eligible person for the period that BCo has a controlling interest. Entitlement to the credit (section LH 2) Section LH 2(2) provides for the tax credit and section LH 2(1) sets out the broad requirements for entitlement to the credit. To claim the credit, a claimant must, for a year or part-year: • be an eligible person under section LH 1(1) – that is, carry on business in New Zealand; • meet the requirements in section LH 3 – in essence, do R&D related to the business, have the requisite control of the R&D project and effective ownership of the results and incur eligible expenditure or depreciation on the R&D that is tax deductible in the year; • perform the R&D activities on its own behalf and not on behalf of another person; • incur $20,000 or more (or a pro-rated amount) of eligible expenditure or depreciation unless the R&D is outsourced to an unassociated listed research provider; • file a detailed R&D statement in relation to that year by a due date (new section 68D or 68E of the Tax Administration Act 1994). Page 6 The amount of the credit is set out in section LH 4 at 15 percent of “eligible expenditure”. Minimum expenditure threshold (subsections (3) and (4)) A claimant must have eligible expenditure (as calculated under section LH 4) of at least $20,000 to qualify for the credit. This is pro-rated when a person is eligible under section LH 1(1) for part of a year only (for example, when the person carries on business for part of a year only). An exception to the minimum threshold exists if the R&D services are outsourced to an unassociated listed research provider. If a provider is delisted, payments under an arrangement entered into when the provider was still listed are not subject to the minimum threshold. The claimant and the provider must not have been associated at the time the arrangement was entered into. This is to ensure that the claimant will not be subject to the minimum threshold if the provider is delisted subsequent to the parties agreeing on the arrangement for services. The requirements to be a listed research provider are set out in section LH 15. Example In 2010, ACo incurs $10,000 of eligible expenditure on R&D performed inhouse. This is not eligible for the credit. In 2010, BCo spends $10,000 contracting an unassociated listed research provider to do its R&D. The part of the $10,000 that is eligible expenditure will not be subject to the minimum threshold. In 2010, CCo spends $100,000 on eligible expenditure undertaking its own R&D. This expenditure exceeds the minimum threshold. Expenditure treated as incurred in a year (subsection (5)) Expenditure that is deductible in a year but added back as income under the timing rules in Part CH at the end of the year is not eligible for the credit in that year. It becomes eligible for the credit in a subsequent year when it ceases to be added back. Because the expenditure is not actually incurred in that subsequent year, it needs to be treated as incurred in that year to satisfy the provisions listed. This applies to the opening value of trading stock, unexpired amounts of expenditure under section DB 50 and unpaid employment income under section DB 51. It applies also to overseas eligible expenditure that is incurred in one year and is eligible for the credit in a subsequent year (subsection (5)(d)). Page 7 Treatment of credits (subsection (6)) The credit is applied to satisfy a claimant’s tax liability for as far as the credit extends. Surplus credits are applied, in turn, to satisfy an income tax or provisional tax liability that is payable in relation to other years, or any amount due and payable under an Inland Revenue Act (such as GST, or PAYE). Any excess credits are refunded. Eligibility requirements (section LH 3) In order to claim the credit, the claimant must satisfy the following requirements which are listed in subsection (1). R&D must be related to the business of the claimant (paragraph (a)) A claimant must perform on its own behalf, or have another person perform on its behalf, R&D related to the business of the claimant or an intended business of the claimant. This means that there must be a connection or link between the R&D activity and the general area of the claimant’s business. This requirement will generally be satisfied when the results of the activity (if successful) would have a direct and beneficial application in the claimant’s business. Similarly, the requirement would be satisfied if the activity results in an extension of that business. To show that the R&D relates to an intended business of the claimant, the claimant must have a reasonable expectation, at the time that the activity is carried out, to exploit the results commercially in an extension of its business or in a new business if the R&D is successful. In the case of industry research co-operatives the R&D must be related to the business of an industry member. The requirements on industry research co-operatives and industry members are discussed below in relation to section LH 16. Claimants must bear the risk, have control over the project and effectively own the results (paragraph (b) to (d)) Claimants must be able to show that they control the research and development activities, bear the financial risk associated with the project, and effectively own the project results. The tests in section LH 3(1)(b) to (d) are intended to ensure that the tax credit goes to the party making R&D investment decisions – that is, the party deciding what R&D should be undertaken to enhance its business activity. If R&D activities are subcontracted, the rules act to prevent double dipping. The credit goes to the party commissioning the R&D, and someone who performs the R&D on behalf of the other person is not eligible. In some cases, no one will be eligible to claim a tax credit for the R&D activity, even when it is carried out in New Zealand, because it is being carried out on behalf of an ineligible person. Page 8 Parties to an unincorporated joint venture, or partners of a partnership (if the partnership consists of only eligible partners), can apply these tests as though the joint venture or partnership performed the R&D activity as an entity in its own right. See the discussion below on sections LH 3(3) and (4). Controlling the R&D activity Claimants must have control of the R&D activity. This means that they have the ability to: • determine the R&D activities to be undertaken; • decide on major changes of direction; • stop an unproductive line of research; • follow up on an unexpected result; and • terminate the activities or project. The control requirements can still be met if the R&D activity is contracted out to a provider who is responsible for the day-to-day management of the work. The commissioner of the research will be eligible for the credit as long as it meets the control requirements above. This may mean that the claimant exercises that control at the beginning of an arrangement and is bound by it for the duration of the work. For example, a provider may only undertake a programme of work if the party commissioning it agrees to bind itself to finance the whole programme. In these situations the claimant is not considered to have given away control, but made choices in the contract in advance. Even then, the claimant should be entitled to check that the programme is being carried out and require the researcher to act according to the arrangement. If a business contracts another entity to carry out the R&D activity on its behalf, and that entity subcontracts that work to a third party, the R&D activity is still done on behalf of the original commissioning business, not on behalf of the intermediary contractor. It is possible to exercise control decisions before a project begins. For example, parties could agree what R&D will be undertaken before the work begins and what criteria should be used to determine whether a line of research is unproductive and should be terminated. Where a major researcher determines a programme of research and actively seeks industry participants to fund the work, it may still be possible for the industry participants to meet the control requirements. While the researcher may have independently formulated the R&D programme and control day-to-day management, it is subject to the agreement between the industry participants and the researcher. Essentially, the industry participants exercise joint control when they choose to participate and enter into the arrangement to fund the work programme. Page 9 A business’s owners have the ultimate ability to control the activity by exercising their proprietary rights, but this does not undermine the demonstration of control of the activities by the business. Financial risk The claimant must bear the financial risk of the R&D activity. If the R&D activity is outsourced, the claimant can be taken to be bearing the financial risk if it is required to pay for the activity to be carried out, regardless of the outcome of the activity. On the other hand, if a party receives payment for carrying out R&D regardless of the outcome of the activity, then it is unlikely to be bearing the financial risk in relation to those funds. “At risk” contracting is where the contractor works on the basis that its fee is not payable unless it succeeds. In this situation, the party contracting out the work would not be eligible for the tax credit. The contractor may be eligible for the tax credit if it meets the eligibility requirements in its own right. Businesses may want to reduce the financial risk of undertaking the R&D by finding another party to contribute to financing of the work. If they enter into an agreement to fund eligible R&D activity with another person, they may be eligible for the tax credit for their share of the expenditure. They are required to bear the financial risk in relation to their expenditure, not for all of the expenditure on the work. The application of funds from donations to carry out R&D activities does not in itself mean that the claimant is not bearing the financial risk of carrying out the R&D activity. An expectation that the funds be applied for a particular purpose is not in itself fatal to the claim by the recipient that it bears the financial risk of doing the R&D. Effective ownership of results Effective ownership of the results of the R&D activity means that the claimant must have the ability to exploit the results for gain without further fee or payment. That is, the claimant must have gained the right to use the results of the activity in its business without incurring further costs. It does not require the claimant to formally own the intellectual property or results arising out of the project. While ownership can be shared, the claimant must retain sufficient rights to have reasonable commercial use of the results, commensurate with its contribution to the work. Effectively owning the results does not require the claimant to own the intellectual property. Intellectual property such as copyright, a patent, or a registered design, may not be available to protect the results. It is also possible to have all the advantages of ownership without actually owning the intellectual property. The claimant may have the right to use a patent, to require the patent to be licensed, to restrict or direct further development based on the patent, all without further fee or payment, and not be the formal holder of the patent. Page 10 Some rights of ownership may be given to others without denying the effective ownership of the results. For example, a business having R&D carried out on its behalf might completely control commercial use of the results of that R&D (including further development of those results for commercial purposes), but allow the researcher exclusive scientific publication rights. Similarly, actual use of particular results may only be possible in limited ways or for limited purposes, which means limited rights can amount to full effective ownership. For example, exclusive rights of commercial use and development for only a few years might amount to full ownership in a particularly fast-changing area. A share in ownership of overall results may also amount to acceptable ownership. For example, if a business does R&D that builds on existing research results belonging to another person, the business may take a share of the overall results. The interest must match its contribution to the overall research. If the R&D activity does not result in a product or patent, but results in new knowledge (perhaps published in a scientific paper), one way this requirement could be satisfied is if the business has been granted a preferential right to use the results of the activity. A preferential right could be access to unpublished results, or early access to results. Subsequent sale of the results does not change the effective ownership of the results at the time the eligible R&D was conducted. However, R&D carried out under an agreement that required the disposal of results or commercial rights for inadequate return will suggest less than effective ownership of the results. It is possible that the R&D activity is unsuccessful and there are no exploitable results from it. This does not mean that the claimant does not effectively own the results of the activity. Deductible expenditure or depreciation loss (paragraph (e)) The claimant must incur expenditure or depreciation that is of a type listed in Schedule 21 Part A and not of a type listed in Part B. It must also be deductible in the year in which it is incurred. There are exceptions to the deductibility requirement for expenditure in deriving tax-exempt income, certain capital expenditure referred to in section LH 5(4) and deferred expenditure referred to in section LH 5(5). For tax-exempt income, the requirement is that the expenditure or depreciation would be deductible if the person derived income other than tax-exempt income. Partnership with entities excluded under section LH 1(2) (subsection 2) R&D activities done in partnership with an entity referred to in section LH 1(2) are not eligible for a tax credit. Section LH 1(2) excludes anyone who is: • a Crown Research Institute, a tertiary institution, or a district health board; • associated with a Crown Research Institute, a tertiary institution, or a district health board; or • controlled by one or more of the entities referred to above. Page 11 This is to prevent partnership structures being used to circumvent the requirements for eligibility. Partnerships (subsection 3) Paragraph (a) makes it possible for the business tests and the minimum threshold to be applied at the partnership level even though individual partners will be claiming the tax credit in relation to R&D activities carried out on behalf of the partners. The requirements for claimants to be in business in New Zealand (section LH 1(1)(a)), for their R&D activity to be related to either that business or an intended new business (subsection (1)(a)(i)), and the minimum threshold for eligible expenditure can be applied at a partnership level, with the partnership treated as the entity performing the R&D activities. Partners in a partnership will be taken to have met these requirements if the partnership (treated as the entity carrying out the R&D activities) would meet those requirements. Paragraph (b) allows partnerships consisting of only eligible partners to apply the requirements to control the R&D activity, bear the financial risk of undertaking the work, and effectively own the results of the activity at the partnership level. If the partnership, treated as an entity performing the R&D activities, would meet those requirements, the partners in the partnership will be treated as meeting those requirements. Partners in partnership with ineligible partners (such as those excluded under section LH 1(2)) must meet the control, risk, and ownership requirements in their own right. This is also to prevent partnership structures being used to circumvent the requirements for eligibility. The government will review these rules once the Limited Partnership Bill is enacted. Joint ventures (subsection 4) Subsection 4 allows parties performing R&D as part of an unincorporated joint venture to apply the requirements to control the R&D activity, bear the financial risk of undertaking the work, and effectively own the results of the activity at the joint venture level. If the joint venture, treated as an entity performing the R&D activities, would meet those requirements, then the parties to the joint venture will be treated as meeting those requirements. While the financial risk can be shared between the parties, each party can only claim the tax credit in relation to their share of the expenditure for which they bear the financial risk. Page 12 Parties may establish a company in which they are shareholders to carry out R&D activities (incorporated joint venture). For the company to claim the credit it will need to show the R&D activities have been carried out on its own behalf and not on behalf of its shareholders. The company will be required to meet the requirements to control the activity, bear the financial risk of doing the work, and own the results. The fact that the shareholders may expect an indirect benefit through dividends does not mean the company is carrying out R&D activities on their behalf. Amount of tax credit (section LH 4) The amount of the tax credit is 15 percent of “eligible expenditure”. This is the amount of expenditure or depreciation that is listed in Schedule 21 Part A, not excluded under Part B, and deductible in the year after making adjustments as required under sections LH 5 and LH 6. Adjustments in calculating “eligible expenditure” (section LH 5) Expenditure added back under timing rules (subsection (2)) Expenditure that is added back as income under subpart CH for tax purposes generally is also added back for the purpose of calculating the credit. This applies also to expenditure that would be added back under that subpart if the R&D expenditure was not deferred under section EJ 23 or if the claimant did not derive only exempt income. Example 1 In March 2009, ACo incurs $100,000 of eligible expenditure on R&D services to be provided by a Crown Research Institute. The services have not been performed by the end of ACo’s income year. The amount of the unexpired portion calculated under section EA 3 is therefore $100,000, which is income of ACo in the 2008-09 year under section CH 2. The amount that is eligible for the credit in that year is therefore $0 ($100,000 deductible eligible expenditure less $100,000 added back as income). The $100,000 becomes deductible in the 2009-10 income year. The services are provided in May 2009 so there is no unexpired portion added back as income. The $100,000 is therefore eligible for the credit in the 2009-10 income year. Example 2 BCo is owned by B, who is a shareholder/employee of the company. B is engaged as an employee in conducting R&D. In March 2009, BCo accrues a liability for B’s salary but has not paid it out by the last date for filing its return of income as provided in section EA 4(3). The salary is therefore added back as income under section CH 3(2) and is not eligible for the credit in the 2008-09 year. The salary is paid out in the 2009-10 year and therefore becomes eligible for the credit in that year. Under section LH 3(3), there is an exception to the requirement to add back certain expenditure for the purposes of calculating the amount eligible for the credit. This is for stock to which CH 1 applies if it is feedstock under clause 8 of Schedule 21 Part A that has been processed or transformed in the R&D. If expenditure on stock has been incurred but the stock has not yet been processed or transformed in the R&D activities, the adjustment applies. Page 13 Example In February 2009, ACo buys or manufactures $100,000 of trading stock which it intends to process or transform in R&D. It is still on hand and has not been processed or transformed in the R&D activity at March 31 2009. The value of the closing stock is therefore added back as income in the 2008-09 year. This add back also applies for the purpose of calculating the credit. The opening value of the stock ($100,000) is then deducted in the 2009-10 year. In April 2009 the trading stock is processed or transformed in the R&D activity. The stock is still on hand at 31 March 2010 but there is no add back of the value of the stock for the purposes of the credit. Under clause 8 Schedule 21 Part A, if the market value of the stock is $30,000 only $70,000 will be eligible for the credit and it will be eligible in the 2009-10 year. Certain capital expenditure (subsection (4)) An exception to the rule that expenditure be deductible in the year it is incurred is provided for certain capital expenditure that is not deductible under section DB 34. The intention is that the rule applies to expenditure that would be deductible but for the capital limitation. Eligible capital expenditure incurred in seeking to create or improve a depreciable intangible asset that is developed as the object of the R&D activities attracts the credit when it is incurred. Example 1 ACo has $100,000 R&D salary expenditure in developing software which is intangible depreciable property. The expenditure falls into three categories. Some is revenue expenditure and some is expenditure that is expensed for accounting and is immediately deductible for tax under section DB 34. Both those categories of expenditure therefore satisfy section LH 3(1)(e) and the credit applies in the year the expenditure is incurred. The third category is development expenditure that is capitalised for tax and accounting. Section LH 5(4) applies to this and it attracts the credit in the year in which it is incurred. Capital expenditure incurred in seeking to construct or improve a depreciable tangible asset that is developed as the object of the R&D activities (such as a trial model or preliminary version) attracts the credit when it is incurred only when its sole intended use is in the R&D process of that business. Example In the 2008-09 year, ACo incurs eligible salary and materials costs in constructing a preliminary version of a product that it intends to add to its range of trading stock. The sole purpose of the prototype is its use in the R&D process in developing a model for the trading stock. It treats these costs as capital costs for accounting and tax. The expenditure attracts the credit in that year. Depreciation on facilitative assets used in the construction of the prototype also attract the credit in that year. Page 14 Capital expenditure in seeking to construct or improve a trial model or prototype that is not solely to be used in the R&D process does not attract the credit as it is incurred and is discussed in the section on depreciation of assets used in R&D (Schedule 21 Part A clause 2). Deduction deferred under section EJ 23 (subsection (5)) Eligible expenditure is calculated as if deferral of a deduction under section EJ 23 were not allowed. If a business elects to defer a deduction for R&D expenditure under section EJ 23, the expenditure is therefore eligible for the credit in the year in which the expenditure is incurred, and not the year in which the deduction is taken. For the purposes of calculating the credit, the expenditure is still subject to the add-back rules in subpart CH (by virtue of the words “or would apply” in section LH 5(2)). Example 1 ACo is owned by A, who is a shareholder/employee of the company. A is engaged as an employee in conducting R&D. In March 2009, ACo pays a salary to A but elects to defer a deduction for this expenditure under section EJ 23. The expenditure is eligible for the credit in the 2008-09 year. Example 2 BCo is owned by B, who is a shareholder/employee of the company. B is engaged as an employee in conducting R&D. In March 2009, BCo accrues a liability for B’s salary but has not paid it out by the last date for filing its return of income as provided in section EA 4(3). BCo elects to defer a deduction for the expenditure under section EJ 23. For the purposes of calculating the credit only, there is an assumed add-back of the salary under section CH 3(2) and the salary is not eligible for the credit in the 2008-09 year. Expenditure on overseas R&D (section LH 6) Expenditure on R&D activities carried out overseas is not eligible for the tax credit unless it is part of a project based in New Zealand and meets the definition of overseas eligible expenditure. Subsection (1) excludes expenditure or an amount of depreciation loss on R&D performed overseas unless it is part of a research and development project. “Research and development project” is defined in subsection 4, see discussion below. Subsection (2) excludes expenditure or an amount of depreciation loss on R&D performed outside New Zealand as part of a research and development project, unless it is overseas eligible expenditure. A “research and development project” is defined in subsection (4) and means a process; (a) consisting of co-ordinated research and development activities controlled by the business; and (b) having start and finish dates; and (c) undertaken collectively to achieve a specified objective within constraints of time, cost and other resources; and Page 15 (d) for which the business bears the financial risk and effectively owns the results, if any; and (e) for which the business incurs on research and development activities performed in New Zealand more than half of the total amount of expenditure and depreciation loss that would be eligible expenditure under section LH 4 in the absence of subsection (2). For an R&D project to exist more than half of the expenditure that would be eligible under section LH 4 must be incurred on R&D activities performed in New Zealand. If that is not the case, then the expenditure incurred on activities performed outside New Zealand will not be eligible for the credit. However, the expenditure incurred in New Zealand will still be eligible. “Overseas eligible expenditure” is defined in subsection (5). The expenditure must be: • expenditure that would be eligible under section LH 4 (in the absence of a restriction on overseas R&D); and • incurred on R&D performed outside New Zealand in or after the 2008-09 income year; and • limited to 10 percent of the total eligible expenditure incurred in New Zealand in or after the 2008-09 year as part of the same research and development project. The 10 percent rule applies over the life of the project. Therefore eligible expenditure incurred on R&D activities performed overseas can be carried forward until sufficient local eligible expenditure is incurred on the same project. Similarly, the eligible overseas expenditure can be incurred in years subsequent to years in which the eligible local expenditure is incurred. “New Zealand” is defined in section YA 1. Example 1 Company A performs eligible R&D activities. The activities are carried out over three years, starting in the 2008-09 income year. Some of the activity is carried out in New Zealand, and some is done in Australia. In the first year, the company spends $100,000 on eligible expenditure in New Zealand and $15,000 on eligible expenditure in Australia. The company is entitled to claim the tax credit in relation to $110,000 of expenditure. This is made up of $100,000 of local expenditure + $10,000 Australian expenditure. The remaining $5,000 of Australian expenditure has to be carried forward until there is sufficient eligible local expenditure to claim the credit. In the second year of the project the company spends $100,000 on eligible expenditure in New Zealand and $2,000 on eligible expenditure in Australia. The company is entitled to claim the tax credit in relation to $107,000 of expenditure, made up of $100,000 local expenditure + $5,000 Australian expenditure carried forward from the previous year + $2,000 Australian expenditure from the current year. In the third year, the company has no eligible expenditure in New Zealand and $40,000 of eligible expenditure in Australia. The company is entitled to claim the tax credit in relation to $3,000 of expenditure, made up of $3,000 of Australian expenditure, for which sufficient local expenditure was incurred in the prior year and the resulting entitlement carried over to this year. Page 16 Example 2 Company B performs R&D activities which are carried out over three years, starting in the 2007-08 income year. Some of the activity is carried out in New Zealand, and some is done in Brazil. In the 2007-08 year, the company spends $100,000 in New Zealand and $15,000 in Brazil. The company is not entitled to claim the tax credit in relation to any of expenditure because the R&D is done before the credit is in effect. In the second year the company spends $100,000 on eligible expenditure in New Zealand and $15,000 on eligible expenditure in Brazil on the same R&D project. The company is entitled to claim the tax credit for $110,000 of expenditure, made up of $100,000 local expenditure + $10,000 Brazilian expenditure. In the third year, the company spends $20,000 on eligible expenditure in New Zealand and $200,000 (unexpectedly) on eligible expenditure on the same project in Brazil. The company is entitled to claim the tax credit in relation to the $20,000 of New Zealand expenditure for that year. However, the project no longer comes within the definition of an R&D project (because more eligible expenditure has being incurred in Brazil than in New Zealand in or after the 2008-09 income year) and therefore the company must revise its tax credit claim for the previous year and pay back the credit for the Brazilian expenditure incurred in that year. Definition of R&D activities (section LH 7) Only research and development activities as defined in section LH 7 are eligible for the tax credit. The definitions of “research” and “development” in section DB 35, which apply to allow tax deductibility to follow accounting treatment, remain and are updated. As the tax treatment is so closely linked to accounting, the accounting definitions have been retained for that purpose only and are not relevant for the credit. Research and development activities are: (a) systematic, investigative and experimental activities that are performed for the purposes of acquiring new knowledge or creating new or improved materials, products, devices, processes or services and that • are intended to advance science or technology through the resolution of scientific or technological uncertainty, or • involve an appreciable element of novelty; (b) other activities that are wholly or mainly for the purpose of, required for, and integral to, the carrying on of the activities in paragraph (a). The definition is not limited to basic research and is expected to apply to a wide range of development activities in a variety of industries. However, routine business activities directed at improving efficiency that do not seek to advance science or technology, or that do not involve an appreciable element of novelty, are not eligible. Page 17 The definition draws on elements of the R&D definitions in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada and Australia. It is most similar to the Australian definition, which has advantages for businesses operating on both sides of the Tasman and also for Inland Revenue, which will be required to implement the credit within a short timeframe. In particular, it is expected that application of the “appreciable element of novelty” limb would draw on Australian experience. Activities described in paragraph (a) are “SIE” activities and activities in paragraph (b) are support activities. This is relevant in relation to the excluded activities in Schedule 21 Part C. The creation of new or improved production equipment and machinery would be included in paragraph (a) as new or improved products. R&D need not be successful to qualify for the credit. There is legislative clarification of the meaning of some of the terms used in the definition. Further elaboration on the definition will be in guidelines. There will be consultation in developing guidelines. Systematic, investigative and experimental activities (subsection (2)) Claimants will need to demonstrate that the R&D process followed a planned, logical progression of work involving hypothesis, experiment, observation and evaluation. Scientific or technological uncertainty (subsection (3)) This exists when knowledge of whether something is scientifically or technologically possible, or how to achieve it in practice, is not publicly available or deducible by a competent professional working in the field. This definition, and the definition of “technology”, are derived from the United Kingdom R&D definition. Novelty (subsection (4)) For activities to be “novel” there needs to be some development of the technology or a new use of existing technology. To establish whether something is new, it should be compared with what is already available in the public arena on a reasonably accessible world-wide basis at the time in that technology. The “appreciable element of novelty” limb is drawn from the Australian R&D definition and the statutory clarification discussed in the paragraph above is based on the explanation of that term in the Australian R&D Guide (Part B page 16). The provisions should be very similar in scope. In particular, “appreciable” means meaningful or significant in the context of the activities undertaken. Technology (subsection (5)) For the purposes of the R&D definition, technology is the practical application of scientific principles and knowledge. Page 18 Simultaneous R&D Under the definition, R&D can be done: • by two firms simultaneously and independently doing the same innovative work; • when work has already been done but this is not public knowledge because it is a trade secret, and another firm repeats the work. Improvements to existing products/processes Incremental development and improvements to existing products or processes can qualify as R&D. However, the improvement that is sought would have to be one that involved an appreciable element of novelty or attempted to advance science or technology. It therefore should be more than routine upgrading. Support activities (paragraph (b) of R&D definition) Supporting activities that are wholly or mainly for the purpose of, required for, and integral to the carrying on of SIE activities referred to in paragraph (a), but which in themselves are not systematic, investigative and experimental, are eligible R&D. Support activities are eligible only if there is an SIE activity, though the support activities need not occur in the same income year as the SIE activity. The requirement that activities be wholly or mainly for the purpose of SIE R&D is intended to exclude the following types of activity: • Construction of an asset with an innovative component when the main purpose of construction is sale of the asset or use of the asset for commercial purposes. • Activities carried out simultaneously for routine business purposes and R&D where R&D is not the main purpose. So, for example, if a business collects data mainly for its routine business operations but also uses it as an input to R&D it is not an eligible support activity. Example 1 ACo is a boat building company that designs innovative components for its boats. It develops a new type of keel which advances boat building technology and is R&D. The keel is to be tested on a boat it is building for a customer. Construction of the boat is not a qualifying support activity as the boat is not built mainly for R&D. It is built mainly for sale to a customer. This means that none of the construction costs are eligible for the credit. Example 2 BCo is a developer constructing an apartment complex on reclaimed land. It has commissioned an engineering firm to design a new type of base to provide maximum protection in the event of an earthquake. Construction of the building is not an eligible support activity as the main purpose of construction is use in BCo’s business. None of the construction costs are eligible for the credit. Page 19 “Required for” means that the supporting activity must be only to the degree necessary to support the project. For example, if a drilling company is developing an innovative piece of drilling equipment that can be adequately tested using computer simulation, drilling is not “required for” the SIE R&D activity. If drilling is required to test the equipment, only drilling that is the minimum necessary qualifies. “Integral to” means that such activities must be part of an R&D project (rather than indirect supporting activities such as cleaning and administration, which are dealt with as expenditure on overheads). Examples of support activities that could be eligible are scientific or technological planning activities, mathematical analysis or modelling used to analyse the results of the experiments and routine data collection. Activities excluded from “SIE” activities (Schedule 21 Part C) Certain activities are routinely excluded from R&D tax incentives. This can be because governments do not wish to incentivise a particular activity through an R&D tax concession, or to remove uncertainty over whether a particular activity could be considered R&D, or to clarify the boundary between development and post- development activity, or innovative and routine work. The activities listed below are excluded from being SIE activities in paragraph (a) of the R&D definition: • prospecting, exploring or drilling for minerals, petroleum, natural gas or geothermal reserves; • research in social sciences, arts or humanities; • market research, market testing or market development, or sales promotion (including consumer surveys); • quality control or routine testing of materials, products, devices, processes or services; • the making of cosmetic or stylistic changes to materials, products, devices, processes or services; • routine collection of information; • commercial, legal and administrative aspects of patenting, licensing or other activities; • activities involved in complying with statutory requirements or standards; • management studies or efficiency surveys; • the reproduction of a commercial product or process by a physical examination of an existing system or from plans, blueprints, detailed specifications or publicly available information; and • pre-production activities, such as demonstration of commercial viability, tooling- up and trial runs. Page 20 The exclusions are similar to those in Australia. As in Australia, these activities are excluded from being SIE activities only – they may still be support activities within paragraph (b) of the definition. For example, routine data collection will not be eligible as an SIE activity but can qualify as a support activity. Prospecting, exploring or drilling for minerals, petroleum, natural gas or geothermal energy (clause 1) It is possible to have R&D in extractive industries – for example, R&D to develop new exploration techniques, but the exploration in itself is not R&D. Drilling can be a supporting activity if it is wholly or mainly for the purpose of, required for and integral to the development of a new exploration technique or new equipment – for example, testing of new drilling equipment. Research in social sciences, arts or humanities (clause 2) Research in these disciplines is excluded in each of the jurisdictions considered in the development of the R&D definition. The focus of R&D tax incentives is on extending business scientific and technological know-how rather than promoting research in these areas which are funded by other means. The exclusion covers, for example, research in economics, classics, languages, literature, music, philosophy, history, religion, and visual and performing arts. Examples of activities excluded under this head would be the study of the historical development of a language or the role of the family in society, or writing a novel or screenplay. If a business is developing an innovative product and the development process satisfies the criteria in the definition in section LH 7, the development is not excluded simply because the product is used in the arts or humanities. For example, if a business develops computer software for use in the film industry in a process that satisfies the criteria in the definition, the software development is not excluded under this paragraph. Similarly, if a business develops and manufactures innovative ceramic glazes, the development is not excluded under this paragraph because glazes are used in the visual arts. As with the other exclusions, this research is excluded from being an SIE activity only. Where research in these fields is required for development of a new product or process, the research can be an eligible support activity. For example, if research into human behaviour is required for the development of an innovative product, the research can be an eligible R&D support activity. Market research, market testing or market development, or sales promotion (including consumer surveys) (clause 3) Conducting of market research is excluded. However, it can be a supporting activity when the research is wholly or mainly for the purpose of, required for and integral to development of a product or process. Page 21 Example ACo is developing a new can opener for use by those with arthritic hands. It has two options for handle design and selects a group to test both trial models to determine which handle is more easily manipulated. This market testing is eligible as a support activity. Quality control or routine testing of materials, products, devices, processes or services (clause 4) Quality control in itself is excluded as a SIE activity. However, the development of new or improved methods of quality control testing can be eligible R&D. Quality control may also be a supporting activity – for example, in the development of a new manufacturing process, checking that the products in a trial run meet the desired quality. Making cosmetic or stylistic changes to materials, products, devices, processes or services (clause 5) Changes that are purely cosmetic or stylistic (such as changes to colour or pattern) are excluded from being an SIE activity. For example, this would include design changes for fabrics and wallpapers. However, work to create a desired cosmetic or aesthetic effect through the application of science or technology can advance the science or technology and be R&D. Also, cosmetic or stylistic changes that meet the requirements in paragraph (b) of the R&D definition can be a supporting activity. For example, if a firm is improving a product it manufactures in a way that falls within the definition of an SIE activity, work on required associated stylistic changes can be eligible R&D. Commercial, legal and administrative aspects of patenting, licensing or other activities (clause 7) This is post-R&D work which is very unlikely, even in the absence of the exclusion, to qualify as an SIE activity. It is also unlikely to be a supporting activity because patenting or licensing would seldom be wholly or mainly for the purpose of, or required for, an SIE activity. Activities involved in complying with statutory requirements or standards (clause 8) This exclusion targets routine testing and analysis of materials, products and processes to check that they comply with statutory requirements or standards. It does not apply to development of new technologies to comply with standards. Activities involved in developing, rather than complying with, standards is also not excluded. Checking that new products meet relevant standards can be an eligible R&D support activity. Management studies or efficiency surveys (clause 9) This includes studies relating to inventory control (such as Just-in-Time), work practices, industrial relations and feasibility analysis, and time and motion studies. The exclusion also covers industry research – for example, where a company carries out a survey into a particular industry’s characteristics and future needs. Page 22 These studies or surveys can be a supporting activity. For example, if a manufacturer’s improvement to a process is R&D, a monitored test to determine how efficient the new process is would be eligible as a supporting activity. The reproduction of a commercial product or process by a physical examination of an existing system or from plans, blueprints, detailed specifications or publicly available information (clause 10) No R&D is involved in simply reproducing an existing product or process from the plans or publicly available information, and this is excluded as an SIE activity. Pre-production activities, such as demonstration of commercial viability, tooling-up and trial runs (clause 11) This paragraph is intended to clarify the boundary between R&D and post-R&D pre- production activities. Activities either satisfy the definition of SIE activities in paragraph (a) of the R&D definition or fall within the exclusion. If activities that satisfy the definition of R&D in paragraph (a) arise during a pre-production process, they will be eligible regardless of the exclusion. However, most pre-production activity is unlikely to be eligible as SIE R&D. Trial runs could be eligible as a qualifying supporting activity, as could tooling up (for example, to test a new manufacturing process). It is unlikely that demonstration of commercial viability satisfies the test to be a supporting activity. Eligible expenditure (Schedule 21 Part A) Only the following expenditure is eligible for the credit: • salaries and other remuneration of employees conducting R&D; • depreciation of tangible assets used in conducting R&D; • costs of staff training, recruitment, relocation and travel incurred directly as a result of R&D; • the cost of materials incorporated into prototypes; • certain overheads that relate to administration, human resources, repairs and maintenance, cleaning and security, • rates, utilities, insurance and leasing of buildings, plant and equipment; • the cost of items consumed, and the net cost of items processed or transformed, in R&D activities; and • payments to an entity or person for R&D services performed on behalf of the claimant. Page 23 Salary and other remuneration of employees conducting R&D (clause 1) Salary, wages, allowances, bonuses, commissions, extra salary, overtime, fringe benefits, holiday pay and long-service pay paid to an employee who is conducting SIE or supporting R&D activities are eligible for the credit. Superannuation contributions, fringe benefit tax, specified superannuation contribution withholding tax and insurances paid in respect of such employees are also eligible. If an employee works part-time on R&D, the credit only applies to remuneration in relation to that portion of the employee’s time that is spent on R&D. Depreciation of tangible property (clause 2)) Annual depreciation on tangible property used in conducting R&D is eligible (depreciation on intangible property is excluded under Part B clause 15). The credit is available to the extent the property is used in conducting R&D (the excess above this is excluded under Part B clause 5). Depreciation attracts the credit in two circumstances: • For “facilitative” assets that are used in the R&D process but that are not the object of the R&D; • For certain “end-result” assets that are the object of the R&D and that are used in the R&D process (for example, for testing, analysis and data recording). Example – facilitative assets ACo has a computer that is used 20 percent of the time on R&D, and 20 percent on other activities. For the remaining 60 percent of the time it is idle (evenings, weekends, holidays). The credit may be claimed in relation to 50 percent of the annual depreciation deduction. End result assets Paragraphs (b) and (c) relate to depreciable tangible assets that are developed as the object of the R&D activities and that are to be used in the business other than in the R&D process. Expenditure on developing these assets does not attract the credit when it is incurred. Rather, the credit may be able to be claimed in relation to depreciation on such an asset while it is being used in the R&D process (for example, for testing) provided construction of the asset is an eligible R&D activity. This requires that either the construction itself is an SIE activity (a sufficiently innovative construction technique) or that it is a support activity (mainly for the purpose of, required for, and integral to the SIE activity). Page 24 Example ACo is a utility company experimenting with a new material for underground pipes. It constructs a small area of the network for testing before rolling out the pipes in the region. Assume that the construction of that part of the network is an eligible support activity (that is, that it is mainly for the purpose of, is required for and integral to, the SIE R&D). The pipes supply gas to the neighbourhood and will remain in place following the test if they are satisfactory. The salary and materials inputs into construction of the pipe network are not eligible for the credit when they are incurred, but depreciation on the network may be eligible while it is being tested. Construction of an asset that is mainly for non-R&D commercial purposes is not eligible for the credit at all. The credit does not apply to depreciation of an end-result asset if the expenditure incurred in its development would be eligible for the credit as it is incurred. No clawback or loss on sale To minimise compliance costs, there is no clawback of credits on disposal of assets for more than their tax book value. When an asset is sold to an associate for more than its book value, the price above the vendor’s book value does not attract the credit in the hands of the associated purchaser (Part B clause 6). Generally, any loss on sale or write-off of depreciable property also does not attract the credit. However, there is an exception in relation to certain end-result assets that are a failure and written off. The exclusion in relation to loss on sale is discussed further below under “ineligible expenditure” (Schedule 21 Part B clause 2). Pooled property The credit does not apply to depreciable assets in a tax depreciation pool unless the pool consists solely of R&D assets used wholly in conducting R&D. Depreciation of asset by business with tax exempt income Special rules are provided in section LH 14 to calculate the amount of depreciation loss in relation to tax exempt entities. Employee training, recruitment, relocation and travel (clause 3) The cost of training, recruitment, relocation and travel of employees is eligible when it is incurred directly as a result of R&D activities. Materials incorporated into prototype products and plant (clause 4) The cost of materials incorporated into a trial model or preliminary version of a product or plant is eligible for the credit. Page 25 Overhead costs (clauses 5 and 6 and section LH 8) Certain listed expenditure on overheads is eligible for the credit. Apportionment is required when overheads are only in part incurred directly in respect of R&D activities. If the overheads relate to administration of internal business activities, the human resources section of a business, repairs and maintenance, or cleaning and security, then employee remuneration, consumables and payments to contractors for services are eligible. Rates, utilities (including telecommunications) and insurance and the cost of leasing buildings, plant and equipment are also eligible. Overheads must be incurred directly in respect of R&D activities. So, for example, while a part of a cleaner’s salary will be eligible if he cleans the R&D laboratory, and a part of the secretary’s salary will be eligible if she supports R&D personnel, the cleaning of the secretary’s office is not eligible. There is a regulatory power to exclude overheads that are too remotely connected with the R&D. The broad intention is that overheads not eligible for the 125 percent concession in Australia will be excluded in New Zealand. Examples are directors’ fees, entertainment expenses and canteen and recreational facilities. Remuneration of employees performing SIE or support R&D activities are eligible under clause 1, not clause 5. Support activities must be integral to – that is, part of – SIE activities. This would include, for example, the salary of a technician collecting data used in experiments. Human resources personnel, cleaners and security officers generally do not perform activities that would be part of the R&D project so their remuneration will be eligible (if at all) as overheads under clause 5. This clause does not include depreciation deductions, which may only be claimed under clause 2. Example ACo has an R&D division with employees engaged full time in R&D. The human resources officer spends on average 10 percent of her time attending to issues relating to that division. These are considered to be directly in respect of R&D activities and 10 percent of her remuneration is eligible. ACo employs a cleaner who spends 10 percent of her time cleaning the R&D division. Again, this is considered to be directly in respect of R&D activities and 10 percent of her remuneration is eligible. However, the cleaning of the human resource officer’s office is not directly in respect of R&D activities. Items consumed in R&D activities (clause 7) Items consumed in the R&D process are eligible for the credit. This would include, for example, laboratory chemicals and stationery. Page 26 Net cost of items processed or transformed in R&D process (clause 8) For items that are processed or transformed during R&D activities, only the net expenditure is eligible – that is, the excess of the cost of the items which are the subject of processing or transformation, over the value of the output. The value of the output is the sale proceeds when the products are sold in an arm’s-length transaction and, when they are not, the market value of the products. The provision applies to the acquisition or production of raw materials or products that are “put through” an R&D process. This will most often be trading stock and would include the catching of fish put through an experimental fish processing plant, milk processed into powder in an experimental drying process, sheep shorn or cows milked in an experimental process and timber acquired and cut using a novel technique. It encompasses the manufacture or acquisition of a product that does not change during the R&D process or changes in a manner that is not visible. Payments to a person for R&D services (clause 9) When part or all of an R&D project is outsourced, a payment to the person or entity conducting the R&D is eligible. The performer of the R&D does not get a credit. (It will fail the requirement to control the project, bear the risk and effectively own the results.) When the R&D is outsourced to an associate, some of the payment is likely to be ineligible under Part B clause 3. The payment must relate only to the R&D conducted by the third party. If the payment is for multiple items (such as R&D services and marketing), costs must be separately identified. The provision applies to payments for both SIE and supporting activities and covers the costs of engaging independent contractors, agency workers and temporary staff to work on R&D. In order to be eligible for the credit, expenditure must be listed in Schedule 21 Part A and not listed in Schedule 21 Part B. The intention is that generally expenditure in Part B is ineligible whether it is incurred by the claimant in doing its R&D inhouse or where the R&D is contracted out to a third party. So, for example, if a Crown Research Institute, performing contract R&D for an eligible business, arranges for the work to be subcontracted overseas, the expenditure limit in relation to overseas R&D still applies. The same principle applies to internal software development. The wording of certain restrictions – for example, section LH 6 (for R&D done overseas) and Part B clause 9 (internal software development) – achieves this already. However, it is not so clear in relation to other clauses in Part B. The government will review this at the earliest opportunity. Business should not be able to avoid rules relating to excluded expenditure by outsourcing R&D. Page 27 Ineligible expenditure (Schedule 21 Part B) The following expenditure is ineligible: • interest; • loss on sale or write-off of depreciable assets (except in one situation); • profits on R&D services and property provided by an associate; • amounts in excess of market value for leasing property of an associate; • depreciation attributable to the time an asset is not used in R&D; • certain depreciation deductions on assets acquired from an associate; • the cost of feedstock other than the net cost referred to in Part A clause 8 • the cost of acquiring core technology (technology used as a basis for further R&D); • in-house software development costs exceeding $3 million (unless the cap is increased by Ministerial waiver); • expenditure funded from a government grant or any required co-funding; • donations; • professional fees in determining whether the person, activities or expenditure are eligible; • the cost of acquiring intangible assets; and • expenditure of an industry research co-operative funded by an ineligible person. Some of this expenditure (for example, professional fees and donations) would not be eligible in any event, as it would not fall within the list of eligible expenditure in Part A. It is inserted to make the provisions as clear as possible, and for avoidance of doubt. Interest (clause 1) Expenditure incurred under a financial arrangement – essentially, interest – in financing R&D activities is not eligible. Depreciation loss on disposal or write-off of assets (clause 2) To reduce compliance costs, there is no clawback of credits when depreciable property used in R&D is sold for more than its adjusted tax value. There is generally a corresponding restriction in relation to a loss on disposal of depreciable assets and the write-off when depreciable items are no longer used (sections EE 11(3) to (5) and EE 39). No credit is available in relation to this loss or write-off. Example ACo purchases an asset for $1 million which is used wholly in R&D for three years. Credits are claimed in relation to that depreciation. The adjusted tax value at the time of sale is $700,000. The asset is sold for $650,000. No credit is available for that $50,000 loss. Page 28 End-result assets to be used for commercial purposes As noted earlier, the cost of assets that are the object of the R&D (such as prototypes) do not attract the credit when they are incurred unless their sole intended use is in R&D. If they are to be used in commercial activity, either simultaneously or subsequently to their R&D use, and if the construction of the asset is an R&D activity, the credit may be claimed in relation to depreciation on the asset for the time it is used in R&D. If the asset is a failure and is written off, the credit can be claimed for the balance of the costs provided the conditions in Part B clause 2 paragraphs (a) to (c) and Part A clause 2 are met. In particular, the asset must be wholly or mainly used in the R&D activities and not used after they end, and development costs must not be eligible for the credit in the year they are incurred. Example ACo is an energy distribution company that is developing an innovative household meter. It instals the meters in 100 households before installing them more widely and plans a monitoring and testing programme over two months. Construction and installation of the test meters is an eligible support activity as the meters are mainly constructed and installed for the SIE R&D activities, and are required for and integral to them. However, if they are satisfactory, they will be left in place and used in ACo’s normal business operations. The expenditure in constructing and installing the meters is treated by ACo as capital expenditure for tax and accounting. The materials and labour in constructing the meters are therefore not eligible for the credit as they are incurred. However, depreciation on the meters attracts the credit during the testing period. One month after the trial begins, ACo finds that the meters are unsuitable. It removes and scraps them. The balance of the construction and installation cost of the meters are eligible for the credit at that stage. R&D services and property purchased from an associate (clause 3) When R&D is outsourced to an associate of the claimant, or property used in R&D is acquired from an associate, the credit cannot be claimed for any profit margin of the associate in supplying the services or property. The credit is payable on the lesser of the amount paid to the associate (eligible under Part A clause 9) and the eligible expenditure of the associate incurred in a third-party transaction. Example ACo contracts its sister company BCo to perform R&D services. BCo obtains all the services and property used to perform the R&D from third parties unassociated with the company (for example, employees and contractors). Unassociated T Co provides core technology to BCo to enable BCo to perform the services. BCo spends $30,000 on the core technology and incurs $50,000 eligible expenditure on performing the R&D services (salary of employees and depreciation on equipment). BCo charges ACo $100,000 for the services. ACo may claim the credit only on $50,000. Page 29 Property leased from an associate (clause 4) When property is leased directly or indirectly from an associate at more than market value, the excess over market value is not eligible for the credit. Depreciation in excess of time asset used in R&D (clause 5) This is the apportionment rule for depreciation on assets used in performing R&D. See the explanation of Part A clause 2. Depreciation deduction on property purchased from associate (clause 6) Because there is no clawback of credits when depreciable property used in R&D is sold for more than its tax book value, a rule is required to prevent associated entities claiming credits twice for depreciation. Clause 6 therefore provides that when depreciable property is sold to an associate for a price in excess of the vendor’s tax book value, the excess over the vendor’s tax book value does not attract the credit in the hands of the purchaser. This rule is required even if the sale price is less than the vendor’s cost (that is, it is required even though there are restrictions on the associated purchaser’s ability to deduct depreciation under section EE 40). Example ACo sells computer equipment used in its R&D to associated BCo for its market value of $1300. The equipment cost $2000 and has a tax book value of $1000. The $300 is not eligible for the credit in the hands of BCo. Feedstock expenditure in excess of net expenditure (clause 7) This excludes all feedstock expenditure in excess of the net expenditure allowed under Part A clause 8. Core technology (clause 8) Core technology is technology which is used as a basis for further R&D. It may be intellectual property or a tangible asset such as a prototype. Core technology that is acquired or leased from another person is ineligible for the credit. The definition is in substance the same as it is in Australia. Cap on certain in-house software development (clause 9) This is discussed under sections LH 9 to LH 13 and LH 17 at the end of this report. Grants and required co-funding (clauses 10, 11, 12) Expenditure funded by a grant from a public authority or local authority or from funds required as a condition of the grant (co-funding) by the public or local authority is ineligible for the tax credit. This is because the R&D project is already subsidised by government. Page 30 The rule applies when the co-funding is required from the recipient of the grant or from another party. “Public authority” and “local authority” are defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Example 1 ACo receives an R&D grant of $50,000 from the Foundation for Research Science and Technology. As a condition of the grant, ACo is required to contribute $100,000 of its own funds towards the project. The $150,000 is used to pay for R&D salaries and to purchase items consumed in the R&D. None of it is eligible expenditure. Also as a condition of the grant to ACo, BCo is required to fund $20,000 of salary expenditure on another R&D activity. A tax credit is not available to BCo for its expenditure of $20,000. Example 2 CCo receives a grant of $40,000 from a local authority for R&D activities. The total expenditure on the activity by CCo will be $120,000 consisting of $90,000 for the purchase of core technology and $30,000 of salary expenditure. The local authority has not stipulated that CCo should apply the funds to the purchase of core technology or to paying salaries. CCo can therefore apply the grant to the purchase of core technology and claim a tax credit in relation to the salary expenditure. Donations (clause 13) Making donations towards the R&D of others is not eligible. In Australia, making of donations is excluded as an activity. Professional fees in determining eligibility (clause 14) Fees paid to accountants, lawyers, scientists and others in determining whether claimants, activities and expenditure are eligible and calculating the amount of the claim are not eligible for the credit. Cost of acquiring intangible assets (clause 15) The credit is not available for the cost of purchasing, leasing or obtaining the right to use intangible assets. The expenditure on intangibles can be by way of royalties or a lump sum capital cost. The extent to which they can be included in eligible expenditure requires careful consideration as such assets tend to be the focus of tax avoidance schemes. This policy work will be done once the R&D credit is in effect. Example ACo acquires a licence to use software in its R&D process. Depreciation on, or licence fees for, the software are not eligible. Page 31 The paragraph does not exclude the cost of creating intangible assets from R&D. Certain expenditure of an industry research co-operative (clause 16) Clause 16 provides that expenditure of an industry research co-operative that is sourced from funds contributed by a person who does not have a business in New Zealand or who is ineligible under section LH 1(2) is not eligible expenditure of the co-operative. This is to prevent co-operatives being used to circumvent the requirements for eligibility. Industry research co-operatives are discussed in more detail in relation to section LH 16. Listed research providers (section LH 15) Section LH 15 sets out the requirements to be listed with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue as a research provider and the administrative rules for listing. Payments to an unassociated listed research provider are not subject to the minimum threshold of $20,000 of eligible expenditure each year. However, the payment must be for eligible expenditure (as calculated under section LH 4) If a provider is delisted, payments under an arrangement entered into when the provider was still listed are not subject to the minimum threshold. See discussion above on section LH 2(3) and (4). To be listed, a person must give notice to the Commissioner that it has the capability to perform contracted R&D, has R&D facilities in New Zealand, and undertakes to meet the continuing requirements set out in subsection (3). The continuing requirements are that the provider will charge fees on commercial terms, be available to undertake work on behalf of unrelated parties, and will maintain records to show that it satisfies the requirements to be listed and to show the amounts derived and incurred in carrying out R&D on behalf of others. Inland Revenue will check the first two requirements and list the research provider if it is satisfied they are met. Listing does not constitute an endorsement of the provider. It means the research provider has satisfied Inland Revenue it has the capability to undertake R&D for others and has facilities in New Zealand. The list will be publicly available on the Inland Revenue website from 1 April 2008. The provider is listed until it seeks to be removed from the list or is delisted by the Commissioner. Either party must give notice to the other and subsections (6) and (7) set out the dates on which the delisting takes effect. The Commissioner may refuse to list a person who has been delisted in the past if the Commissioner considers that the person does not meet the start-up requirements or will not meet the continuing requirements on listed research providers. No challenge is available to the Commissioner’s decision to delist a provider. Page 32 Industry research co-operatives (section LH 16) Industry research co-operatives fall into two categories. They can be organisations, generally in the primary sector, that collect levies from those in an industry and apply them to various purposes including R&D. Outside of the primary sector, they may be co-operatives set up within an industry that receive contributions for various activities including R&D. These organisations are unlikely to be in business, but the R&D they either conduct or commission on behalf of businesses in the relevant industry is eligible for the credit. Those in business in the industry and making payments to the co-operative will not be eligible for the credit in relation to those levies or contributions. Industry research co- operatives are therefore not required to be in business (see discussion above on section LH 1(1)(b)). The exemption does not flow through to entities controlled by the co- operative. The co-operative must be undertaking or commissioning R&D mainly on behalf of its members who: • must be New Zealand businesses (either as residents or through a fixed establishment in New Zealand); • would meet the requirements in LH 2 if they carried out or commissioned the R&D and if the minimum threshold did not apply; and • contribute to the financing of the R&D activity. Also, the R&D activities must relate to the businesses of those who make contributions or pay levies (see discussion above on section LH 2(2)(a)(ii)). Expenditure of an industry research co-operative that is sourced from funds contributed by a person who is not eligible is not eligible expenditure of the co-operative. This is to prevent co-operatives being used to circumvent the requirements for eligibility. See discussion above on ineligible expenditure schedule 21, part B, clause 16. Depreciation base for tax-exempt entities (section LH 14) R&D tax credits are potentially available to most entities undertaking an R&D activity, including charities and not-for-profit entities which have only exempt income. The normal rules for calculating depreciation loss are ineffective for entities which generate only exempt income from an asset. Section LH 14 provides rules to calculate the amount of depreciation loss these entities can claim a credit for. When an entity conducting or commissioning R&D has not previously been allowed a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss for an asset because it derives only exempt income, it is treated as acquiring the asset on the first day of the 2008–09 income year for market value, or on the actual date of acquisition at cost, whichever is the later. Page 33 These entities are then considered, solely for the purposes of calculating the amount of depreciation loss for the purposes of the credit, to have had deductions for depreciation in every year since acquisition. This does not allow the entity to actually claim a deduction for depreciation loss, but does lead to the correct amount of depreciation loss to use in calculating the amount of R&D tax credit. Example A, a charitable society, undertakes R&D in 2010–11. A Digital Serial Analyser, purchased new in 2007, is mainly used in the R&D activity and the resulting depreciation loss would be deductible if A derived assessable income. A’s income year runs from 1 April to 31 March, and an independent valuation of the analyser on 1 April 2008 puts its market value at $35,000. For the purposes of calculating the depreciation loss which is eligible for the credit in 2010–11, A assumes the analyser was purchased on 1 April for $35,000. The applicable depreciation rate for the analyser is 26.4 percent (diminishing value rate for an oscilloscope with 20 percent loading). A is treated as being allowed a deduction for depreciation loss in each of the 2008–09, 2009–10, and 2010–11 income years, being the completed income years following deemed acquisition. Therefore, the assumed amounts of depreciation loss and adjusted tax values (ATV) in each year are: Income year ATV at beginning of year Depreciation loss 2008–09 Cost = $35,000 26.4% x $35,000 = $9,240 2009–10 $35,000 – $9,240 = $25,760 26.4% x $25,760 = $6,800 2010–11 $25,760 – $6,800 = $18,960 26.4% x $18,960 = $5,005 In the 2010–11 income year A can claim a tax credit for $5,005 of eligible depreciation loss. If the Digital Serial Analyser, instead of being purchased new in 2007, was previously used in New Zealand, the applicable depreciation rate for the analyser would be 22 percent (diminishing value rate for an oscilloscope without 20 percent loading). R&D tax credits and imputation accounts (sections OB 4(3)(eb), OB 7C, OK 2(3)(cb), OK 4B, OP 5(2)(bb), OP 7(3)(fb), OP 11B) In other jurisdictions, such as Australia, tax credits to companies are “clawed back” when paid out as dividends. The New Zealand credit has been designed to reduce such “clawback”. If an entity has an imputation credit account or a Māori authority credit account, an R&D tax credit will lead to a credit to that account. A refund of R&D tax credit (including a transfer of the surplus credit to satisfy most other liabilities under an Inland Revenue Act) will lead to a debit. The result is that the entity receives an imputation credit for the income tax liability satisfied by way of the credit. The credit is equal to the amount of the R&D tax credit (sections OB 7C, OK 4B, OP 11B), and the debit is equal to the amount of the refund. The credit arises on the day the relevant income tax return is received by Inland Revenue. Page 34 Examples: Tax credit leads to credits and debits to imputation credit account 1. Company A receives a tax credit of $10,000 for expenditure incurred in its 2008–09 income year, reducing its tax-to-pay to $100,000. Company A’s income tax return for the 2008–09 year is received by Inland Revenue on 1 June 2009. On 1 June 2009, there is a credit to A’s imputation credit account of $10,000. 2. Company B receives a tax credit of $10,000 for expenditure incurred in its 2008–09 income year, pushing it from tax-to-pay of $5,000 to a tax refund of $5,000. Company B’s income tax return for the 2008–09 year is received by Inland Revenue on 1 March 2010. B receives a cash refund of $5,000, being the amount of the surplus refundable tax credit, on 1 April 2010. On 1 March 2010, there is a credit to B’s imputation credit account of $10,000. On 1 April 2010, there is a debit to B’s imputation credit account of $5,000. To prevent more than one imputation credit arising because of an R&D tax credit, there is no credit for income tax paid by an R&D tax credit (sections OB 4(3)(eb), OK 2(3)(cb) and OP 7(3)(fb)). In addition, where a consolidated imputation group has a credit to its imputation credit account for an R&D tax credit, the same credit does not arise in the accounts of any of the members of the group (section OP 5(2)(bb)). Claiming the credit Businesses will claim the tax credit in an income tax return. The claimant will work out the liability for tax in the normal way, and then subtract the amount of the credit. If the amount of the credit exceeds the tax liability the balance is used to reduce other tax liabilities, or is refundable in cash. The tax will reduce residual income tax, which will reduce provisional tax liability, allowing taxpayers to receive the benefit of the credit closer to the time the related eligible expenditure is incurred. This reduction will be immediate for people who estimate provisional tax, but delayed for people who use the “uplift” method for calculating provisional tax. To be eligible for the credit, the claimant must provide – in addition to the income tax return – a detailed statement of R&D activities and expenditure, containing essential information for administrative purposes, by a due date. Example: Claiming the tax credit In 2010, Company A has assessable income of $200,000 and allowable deductions of $170,000, $100,000 of which is eligible expenditure on R&D. A claims an R&D tax credit of $15,000 and files a detailed statement by the due date. Assessable income $200,000 Less Deductions $170,000 Net income $30,000 Tax liability (@ 30%) $9,000 Less R&D tax credit $15,000 Tax to pay $0 Refund of surplus credit $6,000 Addendum Credit to imputation credit account $15,000 (on date return is received) Debit to imputation credit account $6,000 (on date refund is paid) Page 35 Requirement for a detailed supporting statement (section LH 2(1)(d) Income Tax Act 2007; sections 68D and 68E Tax Administration Act 1994) A business claiming a tax credit in an income tax return is required to file electronically a detailed supporting statement. The detailed statement contains essential information to be used for audit, forecasting, statistical and evaluation purposes. If a business is a member of an internal software development group, the detailed statement must be filed by a nominated member of the group on behalf of all group members. A partnership may elect to file the detailed statement, in relation to the partnership’s R&D activities, on behalf of all the partners, for convenience. A partnership which elects to file a statement on behalf of all the partners, and does internal software development, is not an internal software development group merely because it makes this election. Alternatively, if the partnership does not make this election, partners must separately file their own detailed statements, including their share of the partnership’s eligible expenses and tax credit. The statement must be filed by the due date. If a statement is filed late, there will be no tax credit for the year and there could be use-of-money-interest and penalties to pay. 1 Because businesses and their agents need sufficient time to prepare the statement, the statement is never required to be filed before the due date for the associated income tax return. The due date for the detailed statement for an individual is 30 days after the due date for the business’s income tax return (including any extensions of time). The due date for an internal software development group is 30 days after the latest income tax return due date of any of the group’s members. The due date for a partnership which elects to file a statement for all the members of the partnership is 30 days after the latest income tax return due date of any of the partners. Example: Due date for filing a detailed statement A’s income year runs from 1 April to 31 March. B and C have income years which run from 1 November to 31 October. A, B and C are members of an internal software development group and have amounts eligible for a tax credit. B and C have a tax agent who is granted an extension of time, until 31 March 2020, to file B and C’s 2018–19 income tax returns. A’s internal accountant files its income tax return. A must file its 2018–19 income tax return by 7 July 2019. B and C have until 31 March 2020. The group’s detailed statement must therefore be furnished by 30 April 2020. 1 There may be an exception in one situation: when a group return is filed on time but is incorrect because of a simple oversight, the Commissioner has discretion to grant an extension of time to file a corrected version. This exception was created to avoid the situation in which a group accidentally omits a member from its group return, causing the other members of the group to lose entitlement to their credits. It is not intended that the exception would be used in other situations. Page 36 It is possible that a business will be required to file (or have filed on its behalf by a group or partnership) more than one detailed statement for an income year. Special rules for 2008-09 and 2009-10 years In the early years of the R&D tax credit, it is recognised that some businesses will still be coming to grips with the requirements of the new rules. Some additional flexibility has been provided for businesses which do not initially file a claim for an R&D tax credit, enabling them in some cases to file their detailed statements at a later date. In the 2008-09 and 2009-10 years, if a business has not claimed an amount of R&D tax credit in the relevant income tax return, the due date for the detailed statement for an individual is two years after the due date for the income tax return. If none of the members of an internal software development group have claimed an amount of R&D tax credit in the relevant income tax returns, the due date for the group’s detailed statement is two years after the latest due date for filing an income tax return for any of the group members. If none of the partners in a partnership electing to file a detailed statement on behalf of all partners has claimed an amount of R&D tax credit in the relevant income tax returns, the due date for the partnership’s detailed statement is two years after the latest due date for filing an income tax statement of any of the partners. If a business (or any member of an internal software development group or any partner) has claimed an amount of R&D tax credit in the relevant income tax return, the special rules for 2008-09 and 2009-10 do not apply. A detailed statement must be filed by the normal due dates. Provisional tax (section YA 1 Income Tax Act 2007; section 3(1) Tax Administration Act 1994 – definition of residual income tax) The R&D tax credit reduces residual income tax. Taxpayers therefore have the option of reducing their provisional tax payments in anticipation of an R&D credit at the end of the year. Example: estimating provisional tax including tax credit Company A expects to have a tax liability of $100,000 for the 2008–09 income year (before credits). A also expects to receive a credit of $40,000, so estimates its RIT to be $60,000. A furnishes this estimate to Inland Revenue and thereby elects to use the estimated provisional tax method. On each provisional tax instalment date, A pays provisional tax payments of $20,000. Changes to the disputes and reassessment rules Time limit for notice of proposed adjustment (section 3(1) Tax Administration Act 1994 – definition of response period) Because claimants and their agents will require time to prepare and check their claims for tax credits, the time for reassessing the amount claimed has been extended from the standard four months. Page 37 In the case of a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) relating solely to an amount of R&D tax credit, the time limits within which the claimant can issue the NOPA are: • For a business that is neither a member of an internal software development group nor a partner in a partnership electing to apply section 68E of the Tax Administration Act 1994, one year following the date the income tax return is received by Inland Revenue. • For a business that is a member of an internal software development group or a partner in a partnership electing to apply section 68E of the Tax Administration Act 1994, from the date the business’s income tax return is received by Inland Revenue, up until one year after the due date for the group’s detailed statement of R&D activities. Example: Claimant issues NOPA within the new response period Company A is in the process of internally auditing its R&D expenditure. On 15 March 2020, A’s agent files A’s 2018–19 income tax return and files a detailed statement of R&D activities, claiming a $50,000 tax credit. Inland Revenue receives the tax return on 17 March. When A completes its audit, A discovers that it was actually entitled to a tax credit of $60,000 and issues a notice of proposed adjustment relating solely to the R&D tax credit. As long as Inland Revenue receives the notice of proposed adjustment by 16 March 2021 the disputes process will begin and, subject to the outcome of the process, A could receive the additional $10,000 credit. If the notice of proposed adjustment is received after 16 March 2021, the notice will not be effective. Issuing a NOPA solely for an amount of R&D tax credit does not allow the business to reopen any other aspect of the income tax return. Special rules for 2008-09 and 2009-10 years In parallel with the extension of time to file a detailed statement in some cases during the early years of the credit, the time periods for issuing a NOPA relating solely to an R&D tax credit are also extended. For the 2008-09 and 2009-10 income years, the time periods within which a NOPA relating solely to an amount of R&D tax credit may be issued are: • For a business that is neither a member of an internal software development group nor a partner in a partnership electing to apply section 68E of the Tax Administration Act 1994, two years following the date the income tax return is received by Inland Revenue. • For a business that is a member of an internal software development group or a partner in a partnership electing to apply section 68E of the Tax Administration Act 1994, from the date the business’s income tax return is received by Inland Revenue, up until two years after the due date for the group’s detailed statement of R&D activities. Page 38 Time limit for Commissioner’s reassessment (sections 108(1B), 113D Tax Administration Act 1994) Overseas experience suggests that when businesses are given long periods to reconsider their original claims, practitioners have incentives to trawl through past years’ accounts and identify R&D expenditure that the business was unaware was R&D. This practice of “grave-digging” is at odds with the intent of the R&D tax credit policy, which is that the credit should provide an incentive to undertake R&D. If credits are being given for R&D which the business was unaware it was undertaking, it is clear that the credit has not provided any incentive. To prevent “grave-digging”, the Commissioner will not be allowed to reassess an amount of R&D credit upwards if one year has passed since the end of the tax year in which the original income tax return was filed. Example: Claimant requests amendment after more than a year Company A claims a $50,000 credit for R&D undertaken in the 2018–19 year, by filing an income tax return on 6 June 2019. The return is filed in the 2019–20 tax year, which ends on 31 March 2020. On 1 June 2021, A discovers that it was actually entitled to a $60,000 credit for R&D and asks the Commissioner to amend the amount originally self-assessed. However, Inland Revenue may not amend the amount to $60,000 after 31 March 2021. There is an exception to the new rule. When the claimant has issued a NOPA on its claim for an R&D credit within the response period for doing so, the Commissioner has the normal period to reassess the amount of credit, allowing time for disputes procedures to be completed. In no case, however, may the Commissioner increase the amount of the R&D tax credit by more than the adjustment proposed in the NOPA which arrived within the original response period. Example: Claimant requests amendment after more than a year, having issued a NOPA Company A claims a $50,000 credit for R&D undertaken in the 2018–19 year, by filing an income tax return on 6 June 2019. The return is filed in the 2019–20 tax year, which ends on 31 March 2020. On 1 June 2020, A discovers that it was actually entitled to a $60,000 credit for R&D and issues a notice of proposed adjustment. The notice is issued within the response period (one year following the date the tax return was received), so the disputes process begins. The disputes process is concluded on 30 August 2021, and Inland Revenue agrees the credit should be $60,000. Normally, Inland Revenue would be unable to reassess the amount of the credit, since the date for doing so (31 March 2021) has passed. However, because the claimant had issued a NOPA relating to the amount of the R&D tax credit, Inland Revenue will reassess the amount to $60,000. Page 39 Example: Claimant requests amendment after more than a year, having issued multiple NOPAs Company A claims a $50,000 credit for R&D undertaken in the 2018–19 year, by filing an income tax return on 6 June 2019. The return is filed in the 2019–20 tax year, which ends on 31 March 2020. On 1 June 2020, A discovers that it was actually entitled to a $60,000 credit for R&D and issues a notice of proposed adjustment. The notice is issued within the response period (one year following the date the tax return was received), so the disputes process begins. On 20 August 2020, A issues another NOPA, revising up the credit again to $70,000. The disputes process relating to the first NOPA is concluded on 30 August 2021, and Inland Revenue agrees the credit should be $60,000. Because the claimant issued a NOPA relating to the amount of the R&D tax credit within the response period, Inland Revenue will reassess amount to $60,000. The second NOPA is ineffective because it was issued outside the relevant response period, being the first year after the income tax return was originally filed. Inland Revenue is unable to reassess the tax credit amount above $60,000. Special rules for 2008-09 and 2009-10 years For R&D tax credits arising in the 2008-09 and 2009-10 years, the Commissioner will not be allowed to reassess an amount of R&D credit upwards if two years have passed since the end of the tax year in which the original income tax return was filed. This is in line with the extensions, in some circumstances, for filing detailed statements or issuing a NOPA relating solely to an amount of R&D tax credit. Determinations (sections 91AAP, 91C(4) Tax Administration Act 1994) Businesses that are uncertain about their eligibility for the tax credit will be able to apply for a determination of whether: • they meet the eligibility criteria in Section LH 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007; • their expenditure or depreciation loss meets the requirements of the definition of eligible expenditure in Section LH 4; and • their activity meets the requirements of the definition of research and development activities in Section LH 7. Businesses will not be able to obtain binding rulings about these matters. There will be regulations to prescribe how businesses should apply for a determination on these matters. The determinations will be binding on the Commissioner, from the date the determination is signed by the Commissioner, but not binding on the person who applies for the determination. When there is an amendment to or repeal of the law relevant to the determination, and it would detrimentally affect the business to continue relying on the determination, the determination does not have to be relied on. Page 40 Where the applicant has misrepresented or omitted facts relevant to the determination, whether intentionally or not, the determination is no longer binding and cannot be relied upon. Inland Revenue may withdraw the determination by notice, at which point it can no longer be relied upon. There is an exception, however – when the business is already undertaking an activity in reliance on the determination, and was doing so before the notice of withdrawal, the business can continue to rely on the determination as originally set down for the activity. A determination may not be disputed or challenged. The ability to apply for a determination will not be available immediately. The provision allowing for determinations will come into force by Order in Council, not later than 1 April 2010. Record-keeping (sections 22(2) and 22(7) Tax Administration Act 1994) Claimants must keep sufficient records to support their claim for an R&D tax credit. For a business, general record-keeping requirements are laid out in detail in section 22(1). An entity which does not derive assessable income is expected to keep records of a similar standard to support its claim for a tax credit. In addition, all entities claiming a tax credit will be expected to keep a wider range of records than specified in section 22(1). For example, non-accounting documents such as project plans or test-reports might be required to provide evidence of a systematic, investigative and experimental approach to an activity. Listed research providers must keep additional records to show that they meet the requirements of section LH 15(2) and (3) of the Income Tax Act 2007, and to show the amounts derived and incurred by them in performing research and development activities on behalf of other persons. No exemption from filing an annual return of income (sections 33A(2) and 43A(2) Tax Administration Act 1994) A business that has a tax credit under section LH 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 must file a return of income for the year the credit relates to. The exemption from filing in section 33A does not apply to a person who claims the tax credit. A non-active company which has a tax credit under section LH 2 ceases to be a non- active company and must file an income tax return. Use-of-money interest and penalties (section 141(7C) Tax Administration Act 1994) Use-of-money interest and penalties generally apply to amounts of tax credit as they would apply to other amounts of tax. Page 41 However, there is an exception to the normal shortfall penalty rules, applying only to internal software development groups. Where the members of an internal software development group reallocate the credits for internal software development undertaken by the group, there will not be a shortfall as long as the reallocations are offsetting. This recognises that group members who file a tax return early might not yet know the internal software development expenditure of other group members. Example: reallocation of credits for internal software development (no shortfall) Company A and Company B, standard balance date companies, are members of an internal software development group from 1 October 2008 to 31 March 2009. The following expenditure is undertaken: • Company A spends $1 million on internal software development in the period from 1 April 2008 to 30 September 2008, and $2 million on internal software development in the period from 1 October 2008 to 31 March 2009. Company A also spends $6 million on other R&D over the year. • Company B spends $0.5 million on internal software development in the period from 1 April 2008 to 30 September 2008, and $1.5 million on internal software development in the period from 1 October 2008 to 31 March 2009. Company B also spends $4 million on other R&D over the year. Company A files its tax return on 1 May 2009, claiming a tax credit for $8,495,890 of R&D expenditure ($1 million of internal software development expenditure before it was part of the group, $1,495,890 of internal software development expenditure afterwards, and $6 million for other R&D expenditure). This gives a total credit of $1,274,383. Company B files its tax return on 1 July 2009, claiming a tax credit for $4.5 million of R&D (internal software development expenditure of $0.5 million incurred before it was part of the group, and $4 million of other R&D expenditure). This gives a total tax credit of $675,000. Company B would also like to claim for internal software development expenditure incurred while in the group, but is aware that the group’s expenditure cap has been reached. Company B negotiates with Company A. Company A files a notice of proposed adjustment and reduces its claims for tax credits by $90,000 (relating to eligible expenditure on internal software development of $600,000). Company B files a notice of proposed adjustment and increases its claim for tax credits by $90,000. The Commissioner makes both adjustments. Because $90,000 is less than the credits Company A received for internal software development expenditure incurred while in the group, and because Company B is entitled to more than $90,000 of credits for internal development expenditure incurred while in the group, Company A has no tax shortfall. The provision only applies where there is reallocation of credits for internal software development expenditure incurred while in the group. It allows neither reallocation of any credits for expenditure incurred outside the group, nor reallocation of any credits for expenditure which is not on internal software development. The business that is allocated a greater amount of credits must also have sufficient eligible expenditure relating to internal software development undertaken while in the group to justify those credits. Page 42 Refunds of surplus credits not subject to GST (section 6 Goods and Services Tax (Grants and Subsidies Order) 1992) A refund of surplus tax credits under section LH 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 is not subject to GST. Cap on internal-use software expenditure eligible for a credit (sections LH 9 to LH 13, LH 17) A maximum of $3 million of internal software development expenditure will be eligible for an R&D tax credit in any year. Where businesses undertaking internal software development are under common control, they form an internal software development group and must count their expenditure on such development towards a single $3 million cap. In exceptional cases the level of the cap may be increased by the Minister of Finance for an individual or an internal software development group if certain conditions, essentially relating to national interest, are met. In other jurisdictions, claims for R&D incentives relating to internal software development have been problematic. In Australia, the 125 percent and 175 percent deductibility R&D tax incentives are not available for software developed for solely internal use. The New Zealand credit allows claims for internal software development, but caps these claims to limit the fiscal risk of abuse. The cap does not affect a business’s entitlement to credits for expenditure that does not relate to internal software development. Outline of the sections Section LH 9 adjusts the eligible expenditure on internal software development a business can claim a credit for. Subsection (1) determines when a business is eligible for a credit for internal software development and therefore has to apply LH 9. Subsection (2) determines which other sections to use in adjusting the eligible expenditure. Section LH 10 adjusts eligible expenditure on internal software development for periods when the business is not a member of an internal software development group. Section LH 11 adjusts eligible expenditure on internal software development for periods when the business is a member of an internal software development group in which all members have the same income year. Section LH 12 adjusts eligible expenditure on internal software development for periods when the business is a member of an internal software development group in which not all members have the same income year. Page 43 Section LH 13 sets the maximum annual eligible expenditure on internal software development, and provides for Ministerial discretion to increase the maximum in certain circumstances. Section LH 17 defines the terms “associated internal software developer”, “internal software development”, “internal software development controller” and “internal software development group”. Internal software development In section LH 17, “internal software development” is defined as a research and development activity of developing software that: • does not have as its main purpose sale, rent, license, hire or lease to two or more people who are not associated with the developer or with each other; or • has as a purpose the use of the software in the internal administration of the business activities of the developer (such as payroll, bookkeeping or personnel management) or of an associate; or • has as a purpose the provision of services to customers of the developer or an associate, if the main reason those customers use the services is to obtain services other than the use of the developer’s (or associate’s) computer technology or software (such as if they use the services to obtain accounting, consulting or banking services). There is an exception to the definition – software which is an integral part of an electrical or mechanical device for which the software is developed is not internal software development if the electrical or mechanical device is developed mainly for sale, rent, lease or license to customers as part of the developer’s business. Software developed as a supporting activity, as well software developed as an SIE activity, is subject to the cap. Examples: definition of internal software development (main purpose of sale) 1. Company B is undertaking R&D to develop software which it will use internally. The cap applies, because Company B is developing the software with no purpose of sale. Company B may not claim credits in any year for more than $3 million of its software development expenditure. 2. Company C is undertaking R&D to develop software which it will sell to Company D, its parent. The cap applies, because Company C is developing the software with a purpose of sale only to an associate. 3. Company E is undertaking R&D to develop software which it will use internally. The board members of Company E have also discussed the possibility of sale of the software to other large companies that are not competitors, to recoup some development costs. The board members have instructed a staff member to investigate the potential market for the software and to ensure that the software is easily customised. The developers have been advised that they need to build some flexibility into the design of the software. The cap applies, because Company E has a purpose of sale of the software, but does not have a main purpose of sale of the software. The purpose of sale is ancillary to the purpose of internal use. Page 44 4. Company F is undertaking R&D to develop software which it will sell to utility companies. It has signed contracts with three companies to supply the software and it is actively marketing to other interested parties. F will not be using the software in the internal administration of its business. None of these companies is connected in any way to Company F or to each other. In this case, the cap is unlikely to apply, since the main purpose of development is sale to multiple non-associates. Examples: definition of internal software development (internal use or use to provide services) 1. Company G is undertaking R&D to develop software which it will sell to utility companies. It has signed contracts with eight companies to supply the software and it is actively marketing to other interested parties. G’s parent company will also be using the software to bill its customers. The cap applies, since there is a purpose of using the software in the internal administration of the business activities of an associate of G. 2. Company H is undertaking R&D to develop software to integrate a new enterprise resource planning package with its legacy information systems. Once it has done this, it intends to sell an integration package to other companies with the same legacy systems. The cap applies even though there is a purpose of sale of the software, because there is another purpose of using the software in the internal administration of the business. 3. Company J, a management consultant, is undertaking R&D to develop software that will allow its clients to view all work they have commissioned and all past communications between the client and J. The software will run on J’s web server. A portion of clients’ fees implicitly entitles them to authenticated access to a web site controlled by the software. The cap applies – clients are using the service mainly to obtain management consulting services they have commissioned, and not mainly to obtain the use of J’s computer technology or software. 4. Company K, a telecommunications company, is undertaking R&D to develop software which will allow its customers to independently configure account settings, and add and remove lines and services. K plans to charge customers a license fee for using the software. The cap applies because the software will be used by K’s customers mainly to obtain a telephone service, and not mainly to obtain the use of K’s computer technology or software. 5. Company L, a bank, is undertaking R&D to develop web-banking software. L plans to charge its customers a license fee for using the software. The cap applies because the software will be used by L’s customers mainly to obtain a banking service, and not mainly to obtain the use of L’s computer technology or software. 6. Company M, a bank, is undertaking R&D to develop a computer game which simulates financial markets. The game is to be played on-line, and will run on the bank’s servers. M plans to license access to the game to schools, and will not use the R&D for any other purpose. The cap is not likely to apply in this case, since schools which buy an access license are doing so primarily to obtain the use of the software and not to obtain another (e.g. banking) service. Examples: definition of internal software development (exception where integral to hardware) 1. Company N develops a stand-alone video recorder for sale. Software is developed to run inside the recorder and remove offensive language or images from incoming video as it is recorded. Assume the software development meets the definition of R&D. The software is written specifically for the video recorder and the video recorder cannot operate without it. The video recorder is developed for sale to the public. The software is integral to the recorder, and the recorder is developed for sale to customers as part of N’s business, so the cap does not apply. Page 45 2. Company P develops software to be used for conducting cash transfers between its customers over the Internet. P also buys computer hardware and modifies it to prevent physical tampering. The software will run on the tamper-proof hardware, which will be administered by P’s customer at its own premises. P intends to mass-produce the modified hardware and sell it to non-competitors who can use it to run their own security-sensitive applications. The software is not integral to the modified hardware and will not be supplied as part of the hardware when sold to external customers. It could also, with minor modifications, be run on other hardware. The software is subject to the cap, because it is not integral to the modified hardware and is not developed with the main purpose of sale. Internal software groups (section LH 17) To prevent multiplication of caps through the use of subsidiaries or other controlled entities, businesses that undertake internal software development are required to group themselves with other developers under the same control, and the expenditure of the entire group counts towards a single cap. Each business undertaking internal software development (a “developer”) has an internal software development controller (a “controller”). The controller is the person, or group of people, who have ultimate control over the developer. In simple cases, the developer and the controller might be the same person. The intent is to ensure that the ultimate controller is identified, rather than any intermediate entity in a chain of controlling entities. The test for control of an entity by a person is that the person has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity to obtain benefits from its activities. The test is based on the definition of “control” in New Zealand International Accounting Standard 27 (Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements), so if two people would be required to consolidate for financial reporting purposes, it is highly likely that they would be under common control. When a business has the same controller as other businesses, those businesses are members of an internal software development group (a “group”). A business is a member for as long as its controller does not change, provided that there is at least one other business with the same controller at the same time. A business can be a member of no group for all or part of the year, one group for all or part of the year, and more than one group over the course of a year. 2 2 The legislation refers to the expenditure of members of an internal software development group for income years corresponding to a tax year (LH 11(5)(a) and 12(4)(a)). This includes only expenditure for the period the businesses are members of the group, since any other expenditure is no longer expenditure of a “member”. Page 46 Examples: mechanics of internal software development groups • ACo, BCo and CCo have the same internal software development controller (implying they undertake internal software development) and are therefore members of an internal software development group. ACo stops doing internal software development. Therefore, ACo no longer has an internal software development controller, and ACo is not a member of the group any longer. The group continues to exist, however, with BCo and CCo as members. • DCo, ECo and FCo have the same internal software development controller and are therefore members of an internal software development group. DCo and ECo stop doing internal software development. Therefore, DCo and ECo no longer have an internal software development controller, and are not members of the group any longer. FCo no longer has any other person having the same internal software development controller, so the group ceases to exist. • GCo and HCo both have the same, single shareholder, Carol. GCo undertakes internal software development, and Carol is GCo’s internal software development controller. HCo does not undertake internal software development. HCo begins internal software development. Therefore, GCo and HCo are now the members of an internal software group. • JCo and KCo are the members of an internal software development group, X, controlled by Mrs X. LCo and MCo are the members of another internal software development group, Y, controlled by Mr Y. Mr Y sells LCo and MCo to Mrs X. Group Y ceases to exist, and LCo and MCo become members of Group X. • At the beginning of the year, NCo, OCo and PCo have the same internal software development controller and are therefore in an internal software development group, Z. OCo is sold to a non- associate in the middle of the year. QCo is purchased by PCo in the last quarter of the year. NCo, OCo, PCo and QCo are all members of Z at some time over the course of the year. NCo and PCo are members for the entire year, OCo is a member for the first half of the year and QCo is a member for the last quarter of the year. Allocation of the cap (sections LH 10 to LH 13) When not a member of any group (section LH 10) For the period a developer is not a member of any internal software development group, the developer will have eligible expenditure on internal software development. The eligible expenditure on internal software development for which a credit may be claimed is capped. The cap is $3 million for a full year. If the period for which the business is not a member of any group is not a year, then the formula in paragraph LH 10(1)(b) prorates the $3 million on a daily basis. Example: credit for internal software development when not in a group ACo undertakes internal software development. For the first 73 days of the year, ACo is not under common control with any other developer. However, on 13 June 2008, BCo – also a developer – purchases 100 percent of ACo. For the purposes of claiming a credit, ACo adjusts down its eligible expenditure on internal software development, for the period it was not in any group, to a maximum of $3 million x 73 ÷ 365 = $600,000. If ACo’s eligible expenditure for the period in the absence of LH 10 is $300,000, ACo will be able to claim a credit for $300,000. If ACo’s actual eligible expenditure for the period in the absence of LH 10 is $700,000, ACo will only be able to claim a credit for $600,000. Page 47 Allocation when a member of a group (sections LH 11 and 12) For the period that a business is a member of an internal software development group, it is not entitled to any credits for eligible expenditure relating to internal software development, but might be entitled to a share of credits for the combined eligible expenditure of group members. The entitlement to credits for a share of the combined eligible expenditure of group members depends on the nature of the group, but in no case can a group allocate more than $3 million across all its members for a full year. The group members are free to decide the exact allocation, subject to the restrictions described below. An overriding requirement in all cases is that no member may have eligible expenditure relating to internal software development which is greater than the eligible expenditure that business would have had, during the period of membership, in the absence of sections LH 9 to LH 13. Note that in the special case where a business leaves a group and one member or no-one is left in the group, the group ceases to exist. In that case, the business leaving and the business remaining (if any) will have their entitlement to credits determined on the basis of part-year membership. Members of a group with identical income years (section LH 11) If all the members of the group have the same income year (same length of year and same balance date), a member can have eligible expenditure allocated to it and claim a credit. The maximum eligible expenditure relating to internal software development that is available to be allocated to all group members is $3 million for a full year, and this amount is required to be pro-rated on a daily basis where the period for which the member is in the group is less than a full year. Members of a group with non-identical income years (section LH 12) If any member, X, of the group has an income year which differs from the income year of another member, X will only be able to receive an amount of credit if X has been a member of the group for X’s entire income year. The maximum eligible expenditure relating to internal software development that is available to be allocated across all group members is $3 million for a full year. Examples: allocation of the cap • ACo and BCo are members of an internal software development group. ACo and BCo have the same (standard) income years, and are members of the group for the entire year. ACo would have eligible expenditure relating to internal software development expenditure of $2.2 million for the year, in the absence of sections LH 9 to LH 13. BCo would have eligible expenditure of $1.5 million. ACo and BCo may share credits for eligible expenditure of $3 million. The allocation may be made as the parties see fit, as long as ACo receives credits for no more than $2.2 million and BCo receives credits for no more than $1.5 million. Page 48 • CCo and DCo, which have standard income years, are not members of any internal software group, but are under common control. CCo and DCo begin internal software development on 1 July 2008. Therefore, they are the members of an internal software development group from 1 July. The group exists for 274 days of the income year (1 July 2008 to 31 March 2009), and CCo and DCo are members for this entire period. CCo would have eligible expenditure relating to internal software development of $4 million in the absence of sections LH 9 to 13. DCo would have eligible expenditure of $5 million. CCo and DCo can share credits for eligible expenditure of $3 million x 274 ÷ 365 = $2,252,054 (see subsection LH 11(5)). This can be shared in any way. • ECo and FCo are members of an internal software development group. ECo and FCo have the same (standard) income years, and are members of the group for the entire year. ECo would have eligible expenditure relating to internal software development of $2.2 million for the year, in the absence of sections LH 9 to 13. FCo would have eligible expenditure of $1.5 million. GCo, an internal software developer with a standard income year, is bought by FCo on 1 July 2008, so is a member of the group for 274 days of the year. In the absence of sections LH 9 to 13, GCo would have eligible expenditure relating to internal software development of $1 million for the first 91 days of the year, and $3 million for the other 274 days. GCo calculates that the group can allocate up to $3 million x 274 ÷ 365 = $2,252,054 to it for the period it is a member (according to section LH 11). ECo and FCo calculate that the group can allocate up to $3 million to the pair for the full-year period they are members (again according to section 11). Assume GCo has received a credit for the full $2,252,054 available for the period it was a member. Then of the $3 million of eligible expenditure allocable to the group over the (full-year) period of ECo and FCo’s membership, $747,946 is left for distribution to ECo and FCo. This distribution may be made as the pair see fit. GCo is also entitled to a credit for $3 million x 91 ÷ 365 = $747,945 for eligible expenditure relating to internal software development incurred during its time outside the group. • HCo and ICo are members of an internal software development group. HCo and ICo have the same (standard) income years, and are members of the group for the entire year. HCo would have eligible expenditure relating to internal software development of $2.2 million for the year, in the absence of sections LH 9 to 13. ICo would have eligible expenditure of $1.5 million. JCo, an internal software developer with an income year ending 31 December 2008, is bought by ICo on 1 July 2008, so is also a member of the group for 184 days of its income year. In the absence of sections LH 9 to 13, JCo would have eligible expenditure relating to internal software development of $2 million for the first 181 days of the year and $2 million for the other 184 days. HCo and ICo share credits for an eligible amount of $3 million (according to subsections LH 12(3) and (4)). The allocation may be made as the parties see fit, as long as HCo receives no more than $2.2 million and ICo receives no more than $1.5 million. JCo receives no credit for the internal software expenditure incurred while a member of the group, because it is a member for less than its full income year (see subsection LH 12(2)). JCo is, however, entitled to a credit for $3 million x 181 ÷ 365 = $1,487,671 for the eligible expenditure relating to internal software development incurred during its time outside the group (section LH 10). • KCo and LCo are members of an internal software development group. KCo has an income year ending 31 March and LCo has an income year ending 30 April. KCo would have eligible expenditure relating to internal software development of $2.2 million for the year, in the absence of sections LH 9 to 13. LCo would have eligible expenditure of $1.5 million. KCo is liquidated on 30 November 2008, and the group ceases to exist on this date. KCo and LCo are members of the group for only part of their 2008–09 income years and have different income years, so receive no credit relating to internal software development expenditure incurred while members of the group. LCo is entitled to credits for such expenditure incurred after the group dissolves, according to the formula in LH 10. Level of the cap (section LH 13) The level of the cap is $3 million for a year. This is the level for an individual and for an internal software development group. Page 49 The $3 million cap is not expected to be binding on many claimants, but if expenditure does exceed the cap, in exceptional cases a different level of the cap may be determined for an individual or an internal software development group, for a period, by notice in the New Zealand Gazette. The increase of the cap may be granted on application to the Minister of Finance if the Minister considers that three requirements, broadly relating to national interest, are met. The three requirements are based on similar requirements for obtaining government- provided incentives in Australia and New Zealand, and are: • That the internal software development will be exploited mainly for the benefit of the New Zealand economy. In practice, the Minister might look at whether the profits or gains resulting from the exploitation of a particular result of an R&D activity are commensurate with the amount expended in the carrying on of that activity in New Zealand. This would involve consideration of the value of the result of the activity, the profits or gains to non-residents accruing directly from the exploitation of the result of the activity, the amounts expended in the carrying on of the activity inside and outside New Zealand respectively, and any other relevant matters. • That New Zealand will derive a substantial net benefit from intended completion of the internal software development. In practice, the Minister might look at whether the R&D would generate substantial net economic benefits for New Zealand, such as increased gross domestic product, gross national product and employment, or substantial positive publicity (such as defining New Zealand as a world-leader in a particular area). • That the person (or in the case of the cap being increased for an internal software development group, the internal software development controller) has a commitment to retain the value of their business in New Zealand. In practice, the Minister might look at whether the entity is majority-owned by New Zealand residents, or whether the entity habitually reinvests a high proportion of earnings in its New Zealand operations. An increase in the level of the cap under section LH 13 does not automatically entitle a person or internal software group to an amount of R&D tax credit. All the other requirements in the legislation, such as the requirement that the activity meet the legislated definition of R&D, must still be met. The Minister of Finance may impose conditions on a determination to increase the level of the cap, and the determination will not apply unless those conditions are met.

Govt counters stapled stock revenue loss
========================================

The government announced today that it will update the law on stapled stock instruments with debt components to prevent a loss to the revenue base from their use. Forthcoming amendments to the Income Tax Act will ensure that when a debt instrument that would normally give rise to tax deductions is stapled to a share it will be treated as equity for tax purposes. Once enacted, the change will be effective from today. For more information see the [media statement](/news/2008/2008-02-25-govt-counters-stapled-stock-revenue-loss#statement)

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Govt to counter stapled securities revenue loss

Cabinet today agreed to amend the law on certain types of stapled securities to bring the tax rules up-to-date with developments in financial products and to prevent a serious loss to the revenue base from the use of those instruments, Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne said today.

"Stapled stock instruments are relatively common overseas but until recently have not been used much in New Zealand, and our tax rules have yet to catch up," they said.

"The issue arises from the fact that by using stapled stock instruments with debt components, companies can pay tax-deductible interest to shareholders as a substitute for dividends. The issue becomes particularly acute if the instruments are issued to foreign investors in New Zealand companies.

"If those instruments were to become common in New Zealand the amount of debt deductions against our tax base could increase significantly.

"The government will therefore amend the Income Tax Act to ensure that when a debt instrument that would normally give rise to tax deductions is stapled to a share it will be treated as equity for tax purposes – meaning that no deductions for interest payments will be available.

"The change will be included in the next available taxation bill and, once enacted, will apply to stapled stock issued or stapled on or after today. Securities that have already been issued will not be affected by the legislative change.

"Today's announcement is being made without prior consultation with interested parties because it is a matter of urgency, since some companies may be contemplating the issue of the type of stapled stock in question. An early announcement of what will be legislated for gives certainty of future tax treatment to companies and shareholders alike.

"Before legislation is introduced, tax policy officials will consult with interested parties on the details of the proposed changes," the ministers said.

### Questions and answers on stapled securities announcement

**1\. What is the tax problem with stapled stock that consists of a debt attached to a share?**

The government is concerned about companies' ability to pay deductible interest to shareholders as a substitute for dividends by using certain stapled stock instruments. The stapled stock in question is a hybrid instrument which consists of debt attached to a share. These instruments can be regarded as perfect substitutes for equity. At present, the debt component of these instruments is treated as debt for tax purposes, and the interest is deductible. This has the potential to significantly erode the New Zealand tax base, particularly when the instruments are issued to non-residents. Treating these instruments in part as a debt instrument is also inconsistent with their treatment for commercial purposes, including accounting and regulatory purposes.

Current tax rules do not provide enough protection against the potential revenue loss posed by these instruments. Furthermore, the commercial constraints that operate to moderate the level of gearing are effectively removed with these instruments. That is because what is debt for New Zealand tax purposes is equity for accounting and other purposes, meaning that tax debt could be much higher than what commercial constraints would normally allow.

**2\. What does the change involve?**

The tax rules have to be modernised to keep pace with what is evolving in the financial products world.

The legislative change will require that when a debt instrument for which an interest deduction would normally be allowed is stapled to a share it will be treated as equity for tax purposes.

Changes in the borderline between debt and equity for one purpose can have unintended effects on other areas of the tax system. As part of the technical development of the rules, the consequences for the imputation and thin capitalisation tax rules will need to be examined.

The change will apply to stapled stock issued or stapled on or after today. The government will consult on the technical development of the new rules following the announcement. The changes will be included in the next available tax bill.

**3\. Why the urgency to change the law?**

The risk to tax revenue must be dealt with as a matter of urgency, since the government is aware that there is growing interest in using these instruments in the New Zealand market following on from their international popularity.

**4\. Is this a radical change in direction?**

The proposed legislative amendment is not intended to be a radical change to the current tax rules, but instead a change at the margin, given that current tax rules already treat interest as dividends for some broadly similar instruments. New Zealand tax rules around the debt/equity boundary generally follow the legal form of the instrument concerned, irrespective of its commercial substance. That means when, for example, the legal form of the instrument is debt, the tax treatment will be debt. However, there are a few examples in New Zealand's current tax rules where it has been necessary to specifically legislate to override legal form. One example is where a debt instrument is paying a return that is dependent on the profits of the company, that instrument is considered to be equity for tax purposes. The change we are recommending would just be a further example.

**5\. How will instruments that have already been issued be affected?**

The law change will not apply to publicly held instruments that were issued or stapled before today.

**6\. Why did the government not consult beforehand on this change?**

This issue is a base maintenance issue involving potentially large sums of revenue and the government has to proceed with urgency. The government will consult on the technical development of the new rules.

**7\. What are the next steps?**

Following consultation with interested parties, the government will include amending legislation in the next available taxation bill. When the bill is referred to a select committee interested parties will have the opportunity to make a submission.

The government announced today that it will close a legislative loophole to prevent New Zealand missing out on significant tax revenue from the petroleum mining industry. The Income Tax Act will be amended to ensure that expenditure on petroleum mining operations undertaken through a foreign branch cannot be offset against petroleum mining income from New Zealand. The changes will be included in the next taxation bill and, once enacted, will be effective from today.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Govt to close petroleum mining tax loophole

The government will close a legislative loophole to prevent New Zealand missing out on significant tax revenue from the burgeoning petroleum mining industry, Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne announced today.

"Under current law, New Zealand petroleum miners can offset their expenditure in other countries against the revenue from their New Zealand operations," Dr Cullen and Mr Dunne said.

"That means New Zealand might receive less income tax than expected on profits from oil production in New Zealand, which is particularly unacceptable when oil production revenue from New Zealand is at an all time high and predicted to grow.

"To safeguard our taxing rights on our petroleum resources, the government will amend the Income Tax Act to ensure that expenditure on petroleum mining operations undertaken through a foreign branch cannot be offset against petroleum mining income from New Zealand.

"That will bring New Zealand's taxation of petroleum mining revenue into line with the practice of a number of other countries.

"The changes will be included in the next taxation bill and, once enacted, will be effective from today. Expenditure incurred before today will not be affected by the changes.

"In the meantime, the government will be consulting with the petroleum mining industry on the details of the planned changes.

"New Zealand oil and condensate production is at levels not seen since the time of the Maui B development in the 1990s, with four major developments that are in production or due to begin within the next 12 months."

"It is estimated that over the next ten years the gross revenue from petroleum mining in New Zealand will be about $20 billion.

"It is therefore essential to ensure that New Zealand receives its proper share of benefit from its petroleum resources," they said.

### Questions and answers – Petroleum mining announcement

**1\. What are the main features of reforms announced today?**

The reforms are intended to protect the significant tax revenue being generated by New Zealand's growing petroleum production.

Expenditure incurred on petroleum mining operations through a branch in another country will be allowed to be deducted only from income from those foreign petroleum mining operations. The effect is to prevent foreign branch petroleum mining expenditure being offset against income from petroleum mining in New Zealand, so that tax is paid on it. This change will also prevent this expenditure from being used to offset non-petroleum mining income.

While discussion with the industry on the details is still to occur, expenditure incurred from today will be affected by the new rules. Expenditure incurred before today will not be affected by the new rules.

**2\. What is the concern?**

The concern is that there is a risk that income from petroleum mining operations in New Zealand will not generate any tax revenue for New Zealand.

The current tax treatment of petroleum mining is primarily designed to encourage petroleum exploration and production in New Zealand. However, the rules effectively allow expenditure on petroleum mining operations outside New Zealand to be deductible in New Zealand, as shown in the example.

> _Example: how mining operations overseas become tax-deductible here_
> 
> New Zealand Company has net income of $100 million from its petroleum operations in New Zealand. The parent of New Zealand Company is based in Country X. The parent company wishes to invest $100 million on exploration in Country Y. The parent company would normally invest directly in Country Y. The concern is that the current tax law encourages the parent company to have New Zealand Company set up a branch in Country Y. This way the expenditure on exploration in Country Y can be immediately offset against the petroleum mining income of New Zealand Company. The result is that New Zealand collects no tax on the $100 million of New Zealand petroleum mining income earned by the New Zealand Company.

An additional concern is that companies that operate in a number of countries are also able to structure arrangements in such a way that no income from the foreign branch petroleum mining operations will ever be returned to New Zealand.

**3\. How much tax is at risk?**

It is difficult to say with any certainty because many factors are at play. Four major developments have recently started production or are about to start production in the next 12 months. The government expects that over the next ten years known New Zealand petroleum fields will generate over $20 billion of gross revenue. This suggests that there is significant tax at risk.

Safeguarding New Zealand taxing rights on its petroleum resources is in line with the practice in a number of countries. For example, the United Kingdom ring-fences income from North Sea oil operations and does not allow expenditure on foreign oil fields to be offset against it.

**4\. Why the urgency?**

Revenue from oil production tends to peak early in a field's production life. The concern was that delaying this announcement could potentially result in New Zealand missing out on a large amount of tax because petroleum miners might use foreign branch expenditure to offset their petroleum mining income from New Zealand. The government therefore had to proceed with urgency to protect the tax base. The government will consult with interested parties on the technical details of the new rules.

The fact is that oil production revenue from New Zealand is now at an historical all-time high and expected to grow. The export of petroleum and petroleum products was valued at $250 million for the third consecutive month in December 2007. Nearly half of the GDP growth in the September 2007 quarter was due to production from the Tui oil field.

**5\. Who will be affected?**

The reforms announced today do not change the tax treatment of petroleum mining operations in New Zealand. Petroleum miners will be able to fully offset exploration expenditure and amortise development expenditure from their New Zealand operations against income as normal.

The changes will affect those companies that have, or are planning, petroleum mining operations in other countries through a foreign branch structure. While companies can still structure arrangements in this way, they will not be allowed to offset this expenditure against petroleum mining income from New Zealand.

**6\. What are the next steps?**

The main amendments preventing expenditure on petroleum mining operations outside New Zealand being used to shelter petroleum mining income from New Zealand operations will be included in the next available taxation bill.

Tax policy officials will consult with the petroleum industry on the details of how this quarantined expenditure may be treated in the future.

Speech - tax reform update
==========================

In a speech today to the Spicers Portfolio Management Conference, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne spoke about recent tax reforms designed to help increase productivity and growth, make New Zealand businesses more competitive internationally and increase personal savings. For more information see the Minister's [speech](/news/2008/2008-03-13-speech-tax-reform-update#speech)

### Speech by Hon Peter Dunne, Minister of Revenue  
Spicers Portfolio Management Conference  
Marlborough convention centre, Blenheim

I am very pleased to be here to address your conference today.

The main focus of the tax policy work programme over the last three years has been to introduce tax measures that will help to increase productivity and growth, to make New Zealand businesses more competitive internationally and to increase personal savings.

While tax policy alone cannot achieve these things, it can be used to support their achievement - by, for example, removing tax obstacles to growth and competitiveness reducing tax-related compliance costs, and increasing incentives to encourage certain activities or behaviours.

Fostering a climate of charitable giving is one such area.

It also happens to be a particular focus for the UnitedFuture Party, so I am especially pleased about the recent enactment of an incentive to increase charitable donations, the removal of caps on charitable rebates.

Another incentive under consideration is introducing a voluntary payroll giving system whereby employees can have their charitable donations deducted from their pay, to make donating easier.

That was the subject of a government discussion document released last year to gauge the views of interested parties.

My speech today will look at some of the fundamental tax reforms of the last three years that are aimed at supporting economic transformation, as well as transformation of New Zealand's savings culture.

The Business Tax Review is one of several projects that owe their presence on the government's tax policy work programme to the Confidence and Supply Agreement signed between UnitedFuture and the Labour/Progressive government shortly after the 2002 election.

A key plank of that agreement was to have a comprehensive review of our business tax rules, for the purpose of ensuring that the system works to give New Zealand businesses better incentives for productivity gains and improved competitiveness.

Therefore I take special pleasure in the fact that major changes resulting from the Business Tax Review will soon be a reality.

Last year saw the enactment of the reduction in the company tax rate from 33% to 30%.

That will allow successful companies to keep a greater share of their profits, and is expected to increase investment in New Zealand, which in turn will boost productivity.

It is also expected to increase profits recognised in New Zealand, which in turn will lift our international competitiveness, especially with Australia.

Also a product of the Business Tax Review, the new R&D tax credit, which also comes into effect in a few days' time, is designed to stimulate investment into research and development by New Zealand businesses.

The government wants to ensure that the R&D tax credit works as intended and is sustainable - meaning that it increases spill-over benefits from R&D, therefore making New Zealand businesses more competitive internationally.

It is not there to subsidise normal business expenditure.

The government will evaluate the success of the tax credit in three years' time, so that we can see if the country is getting value for money.

The reform of New Zealand's international tax rules, a project that has been under way for the last year and a half, represents a fundamental change in how we tax the offshore income of our controlled foreign companies.

We are moving from a system of taxing offshore income as it is earned, to exempting it from income tax.

That big change will bring us into line with the practice of other countries.

More importantly, it will put our businesses on a better footing internationally by freeing them from a tax cost that the controlled foreign companies of other countries do not face.

Legislation to implement the first stage of the review is scheduled to be introduced in June.

The second stage of the review will move to extend the active income exemption to non-portfolio foreign investment funds and overseas branches, which will be the subject of further extensive consultation with interested parties.

Legislation introducing new regulatory and tax rules for limited partnerships, as well as updating the tax rules for general partnerships, was introduced last year and is now passing through its final parliamentary stages this week.

The aim of that reform is to make it easier for New Zealand businesses to attract investment capital and to compete internationally.

We are also near the end of implementing major reforms designed to encourage personal savings and to improve the way they are used.

Those reforms involved introducing KiwiSaver, relieving the over-taxation of people who save through New Zealand-managed funds, and applying consistent tax rules to offshore portfolio investments in shares.

Last year saw the start-up of KiwiSaver, and Budget 2007 brought further enhancements to the scheme in the form of the member tax credit, compulsory matching employer contributions and associated employer tax credit, as incentives for people to join the scheme.

Enrolment figures confirm KiwiSaver's wide appeal.

In the first three months of its operation, enrolment broke through the 200,000 mark, which was an excellent start.

Now, nine months later, that figure is just about to hit the half a million mark.

An evaluation report of the first six months of KiwiSaver's operation will be released today.

It will indicate that, despite the inevitable teething problems, signs are positive for the scheme at this early stage - not only are enrolment figures higher than expected, but employers and providers are, on balance, positive about the way it has been implemented, despite the short time frames for implementation.

My view is that KiwiSaver is here to stay.

If take-up continues at this rate it may prove to be easier for all concerned to make the scheme compulsory, which would remove the employer compliance costs associated with people opting out. I stress, however, that these are my personal views.

All these savings-related reforms - the advent of the new PIE rules, the new foreign investment fund rules, and KiwiSaver - have, of course, had a huge impact on your industry.

I am aware that it has already involved a lot of work on your part, and that contribution is greatly valued.

But the foundations are there and it is now a matter of allowing the reforms to bed in.

You have asked me to include in my speech comments on a number of big topics ranging from how tax policy can be used to grow savings and investments, to whether tax cuts are good for New Zealand's growth, through to what can be done to increase our OECD ranking.

I have touched upon some of these, but to deal with all of them would undoubtedly take much more time than we have today.

However, I will touch briefly on a few more of the larger issues.

Tax is clearly becoming more important in international decision-making: where to invest is an important consideration for firms that operate internationally.

And yes, tax rates do come into planning about where to invest, but they are not the only consideration.

Globalisation, or whatever term you prefer to use for the phenomenon, has opened up new opportunities for business. At the same time it is creating enormous challenges for tax administrations everywhere because profits can be allocated anywhere in the world.

And that has led to complexity for tax administrations as well as firms.

In New Zealand, we are more heavily dependent on our corporate tax base than are many other countries, and that makes us particularly vulnerable.

For example, OECD figures show that in New Zealand in 2005, taxes on corporate income made up 6.3 percent of GDP, which put us in second place, after Norway.

Similarly, OECD figures for corporate tax as a percentage of total taxation for the same year had us in third place, at 16.8 percent, following Norway and Australia.

I reiterate that tax changes alone cannot bring about economic transformation, and for that reason they are unlikely to lead to sudden and rapid effects on our ranking in the GDP per capita stakes.

The best way of boosting New Zealand's economic performance through the tax system, in my view, is to keep tax rates as low as possible across a broad tax base.

Tax reforms across OECD countries in recent years have largely followed the base broadening and rate reduction theme.

The New Zealand government is following with interest the OECD's work on tax and growth.

With that work the OECD is attempting to discover whether some taxes are more harmful to growth than others are.

Its research is at an early stage, and conclusions should not be seen as definitive.

Even so, there is some evidence that company tax and personal income tax may be more harmful to growth than other taxes are.

I think it is generally accepted, however, that New Zealand cannot afford to join a race to the bottom as far as tax rates go.

We will never be able to compete internationally in that way.

Instead, we have other advantages that will help us to be competitive.

Our advantages include having a good tax system, which is fundamental to growth.

And for a tax system to be good it must be made up of a good tax administration and good tax policy.

Our policy and decision-making systems are such that we can work quickly to provide taxpayer certainty - as can be seen, for example, in the speed with which taxpayers can obtain a determination from Inland Revenue on whether the fair dividend rate method can or cannot be used for a particular investment.

When the new foreign investment fund rules came into effect, Inland Revenue quickly set up an efficient and streamlined process for people to apply for and obtain fair dividend rate determinations.

I am told that the department has fielded a number of enquiries about the determinations, has made about half a dozen of these determinations, and aims to turn around applications in four to six weeks.

To conclude with my own views on tax cuts, I have long advocated a 30/30/30 approach to tax rates.

That would involve reducing the top personal tax rate and the trustee tax rate to the level of the new company tax rate.

I stress that these are my personal views.

Even though we have entered uncertain times economically, I believe there is scope for achieving those remaining reductions, and that they would stimulate productivity, investment and personal savings, at a time when that is particularly needed.

A flatter alignment of tax rates would also deal with the so-called "integrity" issues that arise because of the difference in the company tax rate and the top personal and trustee tax rates.

My colleague the Minister of Finance has said that further tax cuts will be considered in the context of this year's Budget, and in my role as Minister of Revenue I will be working closely with him on the resulting proposals.

Thank you and I wish you a very successful conference.

In a speech today to the International Fiscal Association conference in Christchurch, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne described the extensive consultation over tax reforms that occurs under the government's Generic Tax Policy Process. He also described progress on the large tax reforms - including the reform of New Zealand's international tax rules - that have been the focus of the government's tax policy work for the last two years.

### Speech, Hon Peter Dunne, Minister of Revenue  
International Fiscal Association Conference 2008  
Crown Plaza Hotel, Christchurch

I am very pleased to have been invited once again to open your annual conference, which is becoming progressively more important as a forum of high-level discussion on tax and fiscal policy and is the most important gathering of its kind in the year.

When I addressed your conference last year I spoke about the fundamental tax reforms that got under way in 2006 and that were to be the main focus of policy work in 2007.

They included reforms to increase productivity and growth, to make New Zealand businesses more competitive internationally and to increase personal savings and to improve the way they are used.

And 2007 proved to be an extraordinarily busy and productive year for those reforms and for tax policy generally.

2007 saw the policy development and enactment of measures resulting from the Business Tax Review, which will come into effect in a few days' time.

They are, of course, the reduced company tax rate of 30% and the new R&D tax credit, which is designed to stimulate investment into research and development by New Zealand businesses.

Last year also saw the entry into force of KiwiSaver and associated reforms, such as the now very popular PIEs, to relieve the over-taxation of people who save through New Zealand-managed funds.

It saw the introduction of related savings reforms designed to apply consistent tax rules to offshore portfolio investments in shares.

Last year's Budget announcements and ensuing legislation brought further major KiwiSaver developments in the form of the member tax credit, compulsory matching employer contributions and associated employer tax credit, as incentives for people to join the scheme.

The reform of New Zealand's international tax rules maintained momentum throughout the year.

In Budget 2007 the government announced that it would proceed with the development of an active income exemption for New Zealand-controlled foreign companies, as proposed in the earlier discussion document, and that further extensive consultation on the matter would take place.

I shall update you shortly on where we are with that consultation and with the policy development.

Further reforms of the compliance and penalty rules in the Tax Administration Act, to make them clearer, more consistent and better at encouraging voluntary compliance, were enacted.

Also enacted last year were tax incentives to boost charitable giving - removing the rebate threshold on donations made by individual and the 5 percent deduction limit on donations made by companies and Maori authorities.

These changes also come into effect this year.

Legislation introducing new regulatory and tax rules for limited partnerships, as well as updating the tax rules for general partnerships, was introduced last year and is now passing through its final parliamentary stages.

The aim of that reform is to make it easier for New Zealand businesses to attract investment capital and to compete internationally.

And finally, in this round-up of big reforms of 2007, we had the historic enactment of a massive piece of legislation that completed the 15-year rewrite of New Zealand's income tax law.

That resulted in the enactment of the Income Tax Act 2007, which takes effect next month.

I have mentioned these major developments of last year because, with the speed of reform with which we all work, it is easy to forget just how much is achieved in tax policy in New Zealand in an intensive year, such as last year was.

This year, which promises to be no less intensive, will include consolidation of a number of big reforms, policy development leading up to Budget announcements, and of course the election - in which tax is bound to feature.

Before moving on to this year's policy work, I would like to pause for a moment to look at the subject of tax rates and related matters, and then at the tax policy consultative process, whose recent death has been greatly exaggerated.

**Tax rates and associated compliance matters**

I take special pleasure in the fact that the reduction in the company tax rate from 33% to 30% will soon become a reality.

That reduction emanated from the Business Tax Review, a key policy plank for my party in negotiating the confidence and supply agreement between Labour and United Future.

As I have said on a number of occasions, I have long advocated a 30/30/30 approach to tax rates.

That would mean a reduction in the top personal tax rate and the trustee tax rate to the level of the new company tax rate.

Even though we are in uncertain times economically, I believe there is scope for achieving those remaining reductions, and that they would stimulate productivity, investment and personal savings, at a time when that is particularly needed.

A flatter alignment of tax rates would also deal with what might be called "integrity" issues that arise because of the difference in the company tax rate and the top personal and trustee tax rates.

If we were to have a flatter alignment, however, it would be doubly important to ensure the robustness of the tax base, and that all involved pay their proper share of tax.

My colleague the Minister of Finance has said that further tax cuts will be considered in the context of this year's Budget, and in my role as Minister of Revenue I will be working closely with him on the development of those.

**Corporate tax base**

An important part of maintaining robustness of the tax system overall is to ensure that all companies, large and small, pay their fair share of tax as well.

That is especially important in New Zealand, where we seem to be more heavily dependent on our corporate tax base than are many other countries.

For example, in New Zealand in 2005, taxes on corporate income made up 6.3 percent of GDP, which put us in second place, after Norway.

Similarly, OECD figures for corporate tax as a percentage of total taxation for the same year had us again in third place, at 16.8 percent, following Norway and Australia.

That said, other tax administrations share our concern to protect the corporate revenue base in these increasingly borderless times.

That can be seen in collaborative efforts such as work done on harmful tax competition by the OECD and European Union in recent years.

One of the main items on the agenda for the OECD's Forum on Tax Administration, held in Cape Town in January, was new trends in global business and wealth management and the implications for revenue bodies.

The forum was attended by Revenue Commissioners from over 40 countries, including New Zealand.

Their joint communiqué, issued after the forum, emphasised that modern tax administrations should work with large businesses, at board and senior management levels, to ensure that tax compliance receives proper consideration in corporate governance.

Accordingly, our own Commissioner of Inland Revenue, Bob Russell, and other senior Inland Revenue officials have been conducting meetings with large businesses as part of the department's tax compliance strategy.

Another important part of Inland Revenue's approach is to have closer collaboration with revenue authorities in countries that are New Zealand's main trading partners.

**Generic Tax Policy Process**

To turn to the government's Generic Tax Policy Process - the GTPP, which is on your conference agenda, I am told that it is assured a lively discussion here.

The GTPP has, of course, been much in the news lately, with some firms claiming in the media that it has been abandoned.

At this point I would like to make it clear that the GTPP is alive and well.

Last year alone the government produced eleven tax policy discussion documents and issues papers that sought people's views on a wide range of tax changes, all involving significant change to the policy framework - such as the changes proposed in the Business Tax Review, the review of our international tax rules, and the review of the taxation of life the life insurance business, to cite just a few.

In response to those many consultative documents last year, we received over a thousand formal submissions.

And that occurred well before the proposed changes were incorporated into a bill, and obviously does not include the submissions that are invited later when a select committee considers the bill.

Very few countries allow that degree of consultation on law changes.

When the government considers fundamental change to the tax policy framework, which sometimes involves a complete change of direction, it consults widely before making final decisions on the matter and drafting it into legislation.

However, when changes are needed within the existing framework - perhaps to deal with an anomaly, an ambiguity, unintended consequences, uncertainty or a significant fiscal risk - the government may choose to deal with the problem by announcing that the measure, once enacted, will apply from the date of announcement, and that it will consult with interested parties on the details of the legislation before it is included in a bill.

Interested parties will have a second opportunity to express their views to the select committee that considers the bill.

Changes of this kind may involve some sort of grand-parenting whereby transactions entered into before the day of announcement will not be affected by the forthcoming change.

These announcements are not much used.

They make up a very small percentage of the many tax changes that are announced and enacted each year.

Furthermore, Ministers do not make them lightly, and when they do they must carefully balance competing factors such as commercial and market sensitivity against the need to protect New Zealand's revenue.

To engage in wide consultation before announcing the closure of a loophole or the blocking of a scheme that is losing New Zealand millions of dollars in revenue would risk creating enormous uncertainty.

If the government were to announce that a certain business tax change might or might not be made following extensive consultation, what should people running businesses do in the meantime?

Should they make an educated guess on which way the decision will go, and if they prove to be wrong suffer the tax consequences?

Tax advisers might have the edge in guessing, but even they would suffer uncertainty.

And what if they advise their clients incorrectly, as it turns out?

It is preferable in these situations, I believe, for the government to provide that much needed certainty by announcing that a legislative change will be made and the date from which it will apply, and as much detail as possible.

Absolute certainty would be provided by overnight legislation, but we have to balance that against the desirability of consultation on details.

Hence we generally prefer to consult on the details of a change before it is drafted into legislation.

It seems to me that you can have one or the other: this type of announcement, possibly with some form of grand-parenting from the date of announcement, or you can have extensive consultation before the announcement, with no grand-parenting.

New Zealand's tax policy consultative process has an excellent reputation overseas and is often cited as a "best practice" model.

If you want to know more, I recommend reading the 2007 report to the Treasurer of the Australian Board of Taxation on improving tax consultation in Australia.

The board has done an international investigation of tax consultation systems and cites the New Zealand system in some detail.

The report cites a number of factors that make our successful process more suited to us than to Australia, however.

They include the skills of our tax policy officials, the small size of the tax community, a national "predisposition towards public consultation", and a more positive approach taken by our financial press to tax matters.

**Reform of international tax rules**

An excellent example of the GTPP process in action can be found in the government review of New Zealand's international tax rules.

The public phase of the review started in December 2006 with the release of the discussion document New Zealand's International Tax Review: a direction for change.

The discussion document announced the government's intention to introduce a radical change for New Zealand's international tax system - replacement of the current system of accrual taxation with an active income exemption.

We recognised that a change of this magnitude needed the broadest possible consideration and consultation.

It was for this reason that the discussion document canvassed the wide variety of approaches that other countries have used in implementing their systems rather than present a definite proposal.

Our intention was to allow a full and thorough discussion with businesses and their advisors so that a system consistent with New Zealand's business realities could be developed.

To this end, the Minister of Finance and I asked our policy officials to meet directly with companies and members of the accounting and legal professions to discuss the design of the new system.

Over the period of the review, we have put out the May Budget Update and a number of issues papers that have made detailed refinements to the proposals as a basis for deeper discussion.

It should be apparent to those members of the audience who have been part of this process that the details of the proposals have been heavily influenced by our discussions, and I assure you that they continue to be so.

Not surprisingly, everyone enthusiastically supports the active income exemption and the proposal to exempt dividends.

And I think it is fair to say that almost everyone understands the need to tax passive income and generally agrees with our approach in this area.

There are two areas, however, where the level of support has been, shall we say, less enthusiastic - the extension of interest allocation rules to firms with outbound investments and the replacement of the grey list by the 5 percent active business test applying in all countries.

The goal has been to provide New Zealand businesses with flexible rules that facilitate their expansion overseas.

At the same time, the rules must protect the New Zealand tax base.

With regard to interest allocation, we received from the consultations a strong message, loud and clear, that substantial tightening of the rules, such as lowering the 75 percent threshold or removing goodwill from equity, would be neither possible nor desirable.

We have not pursued these possibilities.

However, the move to exempt active income fundamentally changes incentives for companies to allocate interest expenses.

We continue to believe that interest allocation rules are needed in this new environment.

The grey list is perhaps a more difficult area.

In proposing to replace the grey list, we have set ourselves the challenge of developing a simple test that will remove truly active businesses from the burden of attributing small amounts of passive income.

A number of features to this end have already been announced.

They include, for example:

*   choice in the use of accounts or tax data in applying the test;
*   consolidation of the test within a jurisdiction; and
*   an internationally limited definition of passive income.

And Ministers continue to listen.

From the most recent round of discussions, we have learned that some features of our proposed rules for taxing royalties and base company income would be burdensome and could inhibit active businesses.

Changes are probably possible here.

There is another area where change in the proposals may also be necessary.

A recurring theme in officials' discussions with accounting firms has been a concern for the impact on SMEs, particularly those investing into Australia.

We share this concern.

Legislation to implement the first phase of the international tax review is scheduled to be introduced in late June.

It has already been announced that there will be a second phase of the review.

It will move to extend the active income exemption to non-portfolio foreign investment funds and overseas branches, an extension that has been encouraged by many of the people who have been consulted on the review.

We will be consulting later this year on how best to achieve this.

The consultations have raised a number of other issues that will be dealt with in the second phase of the review.

A number of submissions suggested that there should be a relieving mechanism for non-resident withholding tax on dividends paid to non-resident shareholders if those dividends represent distributions of exempt active income.

Australia has rules along these lines.

This can be an important issue for New Zealand-based multinationals with non-resident shareholders, and it will be explored as part of phase 2 of the international tax review.

While there appears to be policy merit in providing such an exemption, fully exempting the dividend would require confidence in the level of base protection provided by the new CFC rules.

Base protection measures include taxing passive income above the 5 percent threshold and application of the interest allocation rules.

Consultations have revealed that a number of New Zealand-based financial institutions have active businesses offshore.

Extending the active income exemption to such businesses will be explored in the second phase of the review.

In conclusion, I want to thank all the companies and their advisors who have taken the time for meetings and making detailed and thoughtful submissions.

They do matter, Ministers do listen and our tax system is greatly improved by the process.

**Double tax agreements**

As part of the review of our international tax rules, the government has also been looking at lowering withholding tax rates in our double tax agreements.

In the discussion document published in December 2006, as part of the consultative process for the review, we noted that there may be a case for reducing those rates.

Implementing this new approach to non-resident withholding tax will make renegotiating treaties with our major trading partners a key priority going forwards.

In some cases changes may be made through negotiating amendments to existing double tax agreements, but in others a full renegotiation of the treaty may be more appropriate.

This programme of renegotiating some of our double tax agreements will kick off this year, with a full renegotiation of our Australian treaty beginning in early April.

**Life insurance reform**

The government review of the life insurance tax rules is making good progress.

We received eighteen submissions on the proposals set out in the December discussion document, which is a good number for such a highly specialised area.

Most submissions generally agreed with the direction of the reforms, which is to bring the tax rules up to date with developments in the industry over the last 18 years.

Fair taxation is the aim, for both policyholders and life insurers.

Several submissions did, however, raise a number of industry concerns, including concern about the proposals for participating policies and other savings policies, as well as about transitional losses.

Ministers are considering all these concerns and, in the meantime, I can confidently say that the reform is on track for inclusion in the June taxation bill.

**Payroll giving**

Ministers will soon be in a position to decide on whether to introduce a voluntary payroll giving system whereby employees can have their charitable donations deducted from their pay by their employers.

Feedback from consultation on last year's discussion document confirmed that there is strong support for the concept of a voluntary, before-tax payroll giving system for New Zealand.

We received 36 submissions from a wide range of people and organisations.

Most thought that payroll giving would make it much easier for employees to make regular, voluntary contributions to their chosen charities, and would also provide charities with a low cost, on-going source of funding.

Furthermore, some businesses see the introduction of payroll giving as part of their corporate responsibility.

Even so, there was concern about the potential compliance cost burden on employers.

My view is that it is important that any such system that is implemented in New Zealand enables employers, employees, and charitable and other non-profit organisations to establish schemes that best meet their individual circumstances, and allows them to manage the associated costs.

**Imputation review**

Policy work on the imputation review continues, with the government expecting to release a discussion document soon.

The review will examine how well the current imputation system is aligned with the policy principles that lay beyond its original introduction.

The review has arisen because of the increasing pressure that is being placed on the imputation allocation provisions.

Companies with unused credits may have an incentive to find ways to transfer them to other taxpayers if they would have greater value in their hands.

One aim of the review is to provide greater clarity in the determination of which transactions are counter to policy and to ask whether changes to the current imputation rules could better reflect policy intentions.

It is also necessary to review the matter of refunding imputation credits, in response to continued calls from the charitable sector for it to be able to use them.

Any possible changes to the imputation rules will need to be measured against the underlying principles of the imputation system.

The compliance and administrative costs of any changes will also need careful consideration.

Consultation with New Zealand business will play a critical role in determining the final form of resulting proposals.

**Income splitting**

A government discussion document on income splitting for families with children will be released this year.

In most countries, income splitting is a matter of allowing couples to lower their total tax liability by allocating some of the higher earning partner's income to the lower earning partner, in this way mitigating the effects of the progressive tax rate scale.

Along with providing additional support to families with children, income splitting may also give parents more choice in combining their working and caring roles.

This discussion document will investigate whether income splitting for tax purposes would be an effective way of further supporting families with children, if further support is desired.

If submissions show strong support for income splitting the government will look at developing detailed proposals for further consideration, though that would not occur until early 2009.

**GST base maintenance**

GST anti-avoidance matters will be the focus of another consultative document to be issued next month.

Our GST system is much lauded by the rest of the word for its comprehensiveness and simplicity.

It deserves its reputation as a model for a pure GST-VAT system.

It is, nevertheless, not without its problems.

Tax policy officials are working towards the release a technical issues paper about the GST treatment of transactions involving the supply of high-value assets.

The paper will discuss ways of improving business-to-business neutrality in GST and cover a range of topics including "phoenix" entities, which are a particular concern for all countries with a GST or VAT system.

It will also present a range of options for dealing with schemes whose central feature is that, because of differing GST accounting bases, one person gets a GST refund, while the other pays no offsetting output tax.

**Non-disclosure right**

To update you on progress on having the non-disclosure right for tax advice apply to discovery in litigation proceedings, which accountancy firms would like to see happen, policy officials have now consulted with a number of interested parties on the matter and reported to Ministers.

As you know, the right in relation to tax advice was enacted in 2005 to provide a degree of consistency for tax advice with the privilege enjoyed by lawyers.

Ministers are now considering the matter, and if all goes well I hope to see the amendment in the next taxation bill.

To conclude, I've spoken a lot today about the use of consultation in tax policy development.

That is because I place great value on its use in producing policy and legislation that work. I would like to express my appreciation of the contribution to that process of the many individuals, firms and professional associations who take the time to express their views on proposed reforms, many of whom are represented here today.

Your contributions are valued.

With that, I'll wish you a very successful conference.

Thank you.

Child support shared care provisions under review
=================================================

The government is looking at ways of improving the child support scheme to make it more responsive to factors such as the complexities of shared care, the income levels of both parents and the costs of raising children.

### Govt seeks to improve child support provisions

The government is looking at ways of improving the child support scheme to make it more responsive to factors such as the complexities of shared care, the income levels of both parents and the costs of raising children, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne said today.

"These are the most commonly identified areas of concern of the many people who write to me and to other MPs about their child support problems," Mr Dunne said.

"The standard formula for assessing the amount of child support to be paid by a liable parent is straightforward, easy to understand and in most cases provides certainty for both parents.

"However, it is solely based on the economic circumstances of the liable parent and his or her ability to provide financial support for the child involved. It does not take into account the income of the principal carer of the child.

"Nor does the formula take into account all the parental circumstances surrounding the shared care of children and the associated costs of raising them, and at different ages.

"It is timely to reassess the formula, to ensure that it is flexible enough to reflect the complexities of raising children when the parents are separated and both parents contribute to the care of their children.

"Since the current child support scheme came into being in 1992, there have been many changes in New Zealand society that make it timely to reconsider aspects of child support law.

"For example, family law now places far greater emphasis on both parents being actively involved in their children's lives and sharing responsibility for their welfare.

"Moreover, more women are now in the workforce, which has undoubtedly led to the more active involvement of fathers than occurred in the past.

"Many liable parents consider the current assessment of child support liability to be unfair.

"In trying to retain a significant role in their children's upbringing they incur considerable costs in providing for them during what are often significant periods of contact, although those costs are not recognised under the standard child support formula.

"Some say those costs affect their ability to make the child support payments required of them, placing strain on other financial commitments.

"Ultimately, however, both parents are responsible for supporting their children, and it is the child's interests that must predominate.

"I have asked my policy officials to examine a number of options for updating the child support system to deal with these and related concerns.

"One option is to make relatively minor changes to the existing definition of when the care of a child is shared – at present, to share care ‘substantially equally' a liable parent must care for the child or children for at least 40 percent of nights – or if less, prove that he or she meets the shared care test in specified other ways. This is one of the most contentious features of the child support scheme.

"To make things easier, the wording of the definition could be amended to extend the specified circumstances in which liable parents who do not meet the 40-percent-of-nights test but who do undertake significant care of their children on a daily basis can have the associated costs recognised.

"A second option is to reduce the shared care threshold from 40 percent of nights, which would allow a greater number of liable parents to benefit from the shared care provisions and pay less in child support.

"A third and more fundamental option than changing the shared care provisions is to adopt an approach that takes account of both parents' income as well as the costs of raising children. Such an approach has recently been adopted in Australia and is in use in Norway and part of the United States.

"The third option is a more complex way of assessing child support liability because it involves taking into account the costs of raising children as a percentage of parents' combined income.

"Both lowering the 40-percent-of-nights shared care threshold and adopting an approach based on joint parental income and the cost of raising children would require a great deal of information, much of which is very hard to come by.

"It is expected that some of the necessary information will result from the current Families Commission survey of 10,000 people – a sample of recipients of Working for Families, recipients of child support, and payers of child support. The survey is looking at patterns of post-separation care of children and the costs of raising children.

"Initial research results are expected in June and should help in the consideration of the options for ensuring a more flexible approach to recognising separated parents' contributions to the care of their children.

"I hope that by next year the government will be in a position to present for consideration some soundly based proposals for improving the system.

"All decisions on child support liability are a question of finding a balance between competing interests. For every liable parent who pays less in child support there is a custodial parent who will receive less in child support payments.

"Although it is impossible to come up with child support rules that will satisfy all separated parents, the government wants to devise rules that will meet the concerns of a greater number of separated parents than the current rules do," Mr Dunne said.

Charitable giving changes to proceed

### Charitable giving made easier for donors and volunteers

The Government has given the go-ahead to tax changes designed to make charitable giving of money and volunteers' time easier for all concerned.

"The Government will proceed with the introduction next year of a voluntary payroll giving system that will enable people to donate to charitable and philanthropic causes through work-based payroll deductions," Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne announced today.

"Complementary changes will clarify and simplify the law on how reimbursements and honoraria paid to volunteers in the non-profit sector are to be treated for tax purposes, thus removing long-standing problems and associated compliance costs for volunteers.

"Both sets of changes, which have been the subject of extensive consultation and have received strong public support, will be included in the next taxation bill, which is scheduled for introduction in late June this year.

"The changes announced today build upon the foundation laid by last year's Budget for a progressive strengthening of the culture of charitable giving in New Zealand," said Community and Voluntary Sector Minister, Ruth Dyson.

"New Zealanders are generous in giving money and time for charitable and philanthropic purposes. An estimated one million people take part in voluntary activities of one kind or another, and donations to charities and other non-profit organisations amount to over $350 million a year – a figure that includes just those people who claim tax rebates for their donations," she said.

Mr Dunne said "Budget 2007 removed the caps on the dollar amounts of charitable donations that are eligible for tax relief. As of this month, individuals can claim tax rebates up to the level of their taxable income, while companies and Maori authorities can claim deductions for donations up to the level of their annual net income.

"The changes announced today constitute the second step in the process.

"Payroll giving will make it easier for people to make regular, voluntary contributions to their chosen charities and provide charitable organisations with a low-cost source of funding.

"Payroll giving will be voluntary for employers as well. It will operate through the tax PAYE system and will be available to employers who file their employer monthly schedules electronically, which will make the scheme easier to administer.

"Clarifying the law relating to the taxation of honoraria for voluntary work and reimbursements of volunteers' expenses will make life easier for both volunteers and charitable organisations, who often incur unnecessary compliance costs in trying to understand what their tax obligations are.

"One of the long-standing problems for volunteers and the charitable organisations that use their services is that the law is unclear about how reimbursement payments made to volunteers should be taxed.

"A similar problem has arisen over payments of honoraria to volunteers – particularly if a portion of an honorarium is intended to reimburse the recipient for costs incurred.

"It is now time to remove these uncertainties, to remove tax barriers to people giving generously of their time.

"The Government is also looking at a range of further ideas to foster New Zealand's culture of charitable giving. For example, we are looking at the idea of making it possible for people to claim tax deductions for non-monetary donations, such as artworks and other property.

"Similarly, we are reviewing the question of whether imputation credits should be refundable to charitable organisations, which are not able to use them under current law.

"Charitable giving, whether of time or money, makes an invaluable contribution to the wellbeing of our country, and the Government is committed to supporting and fostering it," Dr Cullen and Mr Dunne said.

### More about the forthcoming legislative changes

**Payroll giving**

It will be voluntary for employers to introduce payroll giving into their workplace and voluntary for employees to participate. That will enable employers to weigh the costs and benefits of making payroll giving available to their employees.

The system will be available only to those employers who file their employer monthly schedules with Inland Revenue electronically. The schedules provide pay-period information on employee salaries and wages, PAYE deductions and other social policy-related deductions.

The system will deliver payday tax relief on charitable donations by way of a PAYE credit. Each payday employees will receive a PAYE credit on the amount of their donation. Employers will offset the credit against the PAYE calculated on the employee's gross pay. The PAYE credit will be calculated on a set rate of 33⅓%. Employees who make payroll donations will not have to keep receipts or wait until the end of the year to claim the tax benefit of their donations.

The current end-of-year rebate claim process will continue – employees who do not or are not able to donate through payroll giving can still claim tax relief on their donations through the rebate process.

**Reimbursements and honoraria**

Reimbursements that are based on actual costs incurred by volunteers will be tax-exempt, with no limits.

If a paying organisation puts in place a process for making a reasonable estimate of the costs likely to be incurred by volunteers, payments made to volunteers on the basis of that estimate will also be treated as tax-exempt income.

Honoraria will continue to be subject to withholding tax.

Organisations will have to pay reimbursements separately from honoraria if recipients are to have the advantage of having their reimbursements treated as tax-free.
INL1000.3.01 23 April 2008 Draft legislation for stapled stock amendments to Income Tax Act 2007 Explanatory Note Principal amendment New section FA 2B defines the concept of a stapled debt security, being a financial arrangement that provides funds to a company, that would otherwise give rise to deductions and that can ordinarily only be disposed of together with a share in the issuing company or in another company. The new section provides that a security that is a stapled debt security is treated as a share and the issuing company is denied a deduction for expenditure or loss incurred under the security. The new section also provides that the stapled debt security and the share to which it is stapled are treated as a single share for the purposes of various provisions in the Act that define and apply specific treatments to shares bearing a fixed rate of dividend (or having an equivalent consequence). The new provision does not apply to debt securities that are stapled before 25 February 2008. Related amendments Various provisions in the Act are amended in conjunction with the introduction of the new section FA 2B. Stapled debt securities are to be treated in the same way as debentures that are recharacterised as shares under section FA 2, by virtue of amendments to be made to section CD 22(9) (relating to returns of capital on off-market share cancellations), section DP 8 (which relates to qualifying debentures issued by certain forestry companies), sections EX 5(5)(c), EX 9(6)(c), and EX 30(6)(c) (which relate to various aspects of the CFC and FIF regimes) and section HD 14(2)(a) (which relates to companies being treated as agents of debenture holders). A new section DB 10B is introduced to confirm the denial of any deduction for interest or other expenditure. Various amendments are made to the definitions in section YA 1, including the insertion of new definitions of “stapled debt security”, “debt security” and “stapled”. Other consequential amendments ensure that stapled debt securities are treated in a similar way to debentures recharacterised as shares under section FA 2, for the purposes of certain definitions in section YA 1. Section 90A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is amended to authorise the Commissioner to issue determinations for the purposes of the new section FA 2B, determining the extent to which a financial arrangement provides funds to an issuing company, in the same way as the Commissioner can provide determinations for the purposes of the thin capitalisation rules in subpart FE of the Act. - 2 - INL1000.3.01 Principal amendment The following section is inserted after section FA 2: FA 2B Stapled debt securities When subsection (2) applies (1) Subsection (2) applies when — (a) a company has issued a debt security (stapled debt security); and (b) the stapled debt security is stapled to a share in the company or another company. Stapled debt treated as equity (2) The stapled debt security is treated as a share issued by the company and the company is denied a deduction under section DB 10B for expenditure or loss incurred under the security. When subsection (4) applies (3) Subsection (4) applies when stapled debt security treated as a share under subsection (2) is stapled to another share. Stapled securities aggregated (4) The shares are treated as a single share for the purposes of applying— (a) the definition of non-participating redeemable share in section CD 22(9) (Returns of capital: off-market share cancellations); (b) the definition of fixed rate share in section LL 9 (Some definitions), which relates to subpart LL (Underlying foreign tax credits (UFTC)) and sections EX 46 (Limits on choice of calculation methods) and FE 21 (Banking group’s New Zealand net equity); and (c) paragraphs (a) to (d) of the definition of fixed rate share in section YA 1. Some definitions (5) In this section — (a) debt security means a financial arrangement that— (i) provides funds to the company; and (ii) gives rise to an amount for which the company would have a deduction but for this section; and (iii) the amount does not arise only from either a movement in a currency exchange rate or a non-contingent fee: (b) a debt security is stapled to a share if the debt security can, or ordinarily can, be disposed of only together with the share. Section 90A Tax Administration Act 1994 (6) For a determination on whether a financial arrangement provides funds, see section 90A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Exclusion: stapled before 25 February 2008 (7) This section does not apply if the debt security was stapled to the share before 25 February 2008. Defined in this Act: amount, company, debt security, deduction, financial arrangement, non-contingent fee, share, stapled - 3 - INL1000.3.01 Related amendments 1.

### Law changes to provide tax certainty for entities in lead-up to charities registration deadline

The government will introduce legislation to ensure that state-funded tertiary education institutions, state and integrated schools, and non-resident charities do not have to register with the Charities Commission to retain their tax-exempt status, Finance Minister Michael Cullen, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne and Community and Voluntary Sector Minister Ruth Dyson announced today.

The proposed legislation will also introduce a transitional measure, to be used in limited circumstances, to protect the tax-exempt status of organisations that run into difficulty with completing their registration applications before deadline.

"Under law that enters into force on 1 July, charitable entities will have to be registered with the Charities Commission to be entitled to the charity-related income tax exemption and for gifts to them to be exempt from gift duty," Dr Cullen and Mr Dunne said.

"However, a number of associated gaps and uncertainties in the law have been revealed in the lead-up to the July deadline for registration.

"For the first time, New Zealand has a formal process for registering charities, with a deadline for registering, and that has highlighted some grey areas in current law as it relates to specific entities.

"As a result, there is some uncertainty about whether tertiary education institutions and state and state integrated schools must register with the Charities Commission if they are to maintain their tax-exempt status.

"A further question has arisen about the continuing tax-exempt status in New Zealand of non-resident entities that are registered as charities in their own countries.

"Under the new law, non-resident charities may not be allowed to register with our Charities Commission, which means they would lose their tax-exempt status in New Zealand, even though they may derive income from a variety of sources here.

"The government will therefore provide legislative certainty that all these entities and organisations will continue to be tax-exempt whether or not they register with the Charities Commission. Legislation will be introduced on Budget day, to ensure early enactment of the changes," the Ministers said.

**Tertiary education institutions**

"The Income Tax Act and the Estate and Gift Duties Act will be amended to clarify that tertiary education institutions are exempt from income tax and from gift duty. The provision, which will have built-in safeguards to prevent private pecuniary benefit, will apply to institutions set out in the Education Act: universities, polytechnics, specialist colleges and wananga.

"Further changes will ensure that these tertiary institutions automatically have Inland Revenue-approved donee status, so that people who donate money to them will continue to qualify for tax rebates for their donations.

"This legislative clarification means that state-funded tertiary education institutions do not have to register with the Charities Commission to retain their tax-exempt status.

**State and state integrated schools**

"The Estate and Gift Duties Act will be amended to provide that gifts to state and state integrated schools are exempt from gift duty, subject to safeguards to prevent private pecuniary benefit. They will also have automatic IRD-approved donee status, so that people who make cash donations to them will continue to qualify for tax rebates.

"State and state integrated schools do not need to register with the Charities Commission to be exempt from income tax because they already have a specific exemption in the Education Act."

**Non-resident charities**

"The Income Tax Act will be amended to ensure that non-resident charities that cannot register with the Charities Commission because they are not established in New Zealand or have no strong connection with New Zealand will be able to have tax-exempt status here, subject to Inland Revenue approval.

"The Estate and Gift Duties Act will also be amended to provide that gifts to non-resident charities will be exempt from gift duty if they are unable to register with the Charities Commission.

**Transitional matters**

"The proposed legislation will also amend the Income Tax Act to provide a limited discretion for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to preserve the tax-exempt status of charities that were not able to register with the Charities Commission within the deadline but can prove they began the process of preparing their application before deadline.

"That measure is to provide greater tax certainty to organisations that run into difficulty in preparing their applications, owing to circumstances that may be beyond their control. It is intended to be used on a limited basis and will not apply to organisations that merely have not got round to applying for registration before the deadline.

Table 4 Weekly gain from tax cuts and Working for Families indexation From 1 Oct 2008 From 1 April 2011 Two earner family with two children under 13 earning $45,000 and $20,000 $42.76 $84.55 One earner family with two children under 13 earning $45,000 $30.83 $62.82 Two earner family with one child under 13 both earning $20,000 $35.16 $67.76 One earner family with one child under 13 earning $45,000 $27.85 $56.42 One earner family with one child under 13 earning $35,000 $16.21 $30.94 Why are we doing it? 1. To provide timely tax relief for taxpayers The tax cuts, along with the changes to Working for Families, will provide timely relief to households with stretched budgets due to recent cost increases. 3 All workers will benefit from these tax cuts, which will see a new low rate of 12.5% for workers on modest incomes and will raise tax thresholds for workers on middle and higher incomes. 4 2. To build on previous tax relief In the last four Budgets, this government has reduced taxes benefiting a wide range of New Zealanders. By 2011, this tax relief will total $4.6bn a year (excluding Working for Families indexation), which has included support for: • businesses through the Business Tax Reform package • families through the introduction of Working for Families • savers and investors through the introduction of KiwiSaver and the introduction of the capped tax rate for portfolio investment entities. 3. To simplify the tax system New Zealand’s tax system is relatively simple and straightforward compared to other countries, and these changes continue that approach. Most taxpayers don’t need to do anything to benefit from these tax cuts. Q&A on tax relief for individuals & families A. Tax cuts – individuals What are the new tax rates? The table below shows the new tax rates being rolled out from 1 October 2008, 1 April 2010 and 1 April 2011, as compared to the current tax rates: NEW RATES Current rates On 1 October 2008 On 1 April 2010 On 1 April 2011 15% to $9,500 12.5% to $14,000 12.5% to $17,500 12.5% to $20,000 21% to $38,000 21% to $40,000 21% to $40,000 21% to $42,500 33% to $60,000 33% to $70,000 33% to $75,000 33% to $80,000 39% over $60,000 39% over $70,000 39% over $75,000 39% over $80,000 When do the tax cuts take effect? Wage and salary earners will start to benefit from these tax cuts from 1 October 2008. The tax cuts will result in lower tax being withheld by employers (pay as you earn or PAYE deductions) in the first pay period that ends on or after 1 October 2008. How much will I save? The table below shows the weekly tax savings for three sample workers over the three year phasing of the tax cuts – a fulltime worker on the current minimum wage of $12 per hour, a worker at the average wage and a worker at twice the average wage: Weekly tax saving from Workers without children 1 October 2008 1 April 2010 1 April 2011 Full-time on minimum wage ($24,960) $11.92 $17.64 $21.73 Average wage ($45,800) \* $16.54 $22.26 $32.12 Twice average wage ($91,600) $28.08 $39.57 $55.19 \* Quarterly Employment Survey (March 2008 quarter), Statistics NZ – ordinary time average weekly earnings per FTE Who benefits from the tax cuts? All workers will pay less tax as a result of these tax changes. In particular, the personal tax cuts benefit: 1. People on low incomes – the reduction in the bottom rate to 12.5% means that all workers will pay less tax. It particularly targets earners in part-time work or those earning around the minimum wage. The 12.5% rate will also improve the incentive for those on benefits and low wages to move into work, or for those working part- time to work more hours. 2 2. People earning around the average wage – raising the 33% threshold targets those around the average wage and provides additional tax relief to families with children who benefit from Working for Families. Importantly it reduces high effective marginal tax rates for many taxpayers. 3. People paying the highest rate of tax – the changes to the 39% threshold will move nearly 300,000 New Zealanders off the top marginal tax rate once it is fully phased in by April 2011. 4. Beneficiaries who are in part-time work and Superannuitants. How do the tax cuts affect people at different levels of income? These tax cuts will benefit all workers, and are designed to give New Zealanders a growth dividend following eight and a half years of strong economic growth. In designing this tax cut package, we have looked to ensure that changes don’t disproportionately benefit those on the very highest incomes at the expense of those on the very lowest. The 20% of households on lowest incomes will receive the biggest increase as a proportion of their disposable income (a 5% increase in disposable income). However, because their incomes are lower, these households receive the smallest increase in disposable income from the tax cuts (an average of $15 per week). These personal tax cuts will, at full implementation, cut personal tax by roughly one quarter at the current level of the full-time minimum wage, one sixth at the current level of the full-time average wage and one eighth at $80,000 a year. B. Changes to Working for Families What are the changes to Working for Families? The Working for Families tax credits consist of a range of tax credits: • Family Tax Credit • In-Work Tax Credit • Parental Tax Credit • Minimum Family Tax Credit Budget 2008 provides two key changes to the Family Tax Credit from 1 October 2008: 1. The Family Tax Credit, which is based on the number and age of your children, will increase. All 371,000 families who qualify for Working for Families will benefit from this change. 2. The family income threshold will also be increased to take account of inflation. This means that at any level of income above $35,000, you will also receive an extra $7 per week boost to your Working for Families tax credits. 3 What is the new income threshold? From 1 October 2008, the income threshold will increase to $36,827. As with the changes to personal tax, changing the income threshold from 1 October will require a composite rate for the year. The composite rate will be $35,914. More details on composite rates can be found in the Q&A on technical information. How will I benefit? The gains depend on the number of children in a family and also whether the family earns above the income threshold. Weekly gain from tax cuts and Working for Families indexation From 1 Oct 2008 From 1 April 2011 Two earner family with two children under 13 earning $45,000 and $20,000 $42.76 $84.55 One earner family with two children under 13 earning $45,000 $30.83 $62.82 Two earner family with one child under 13 both earning $20,000 $35.16 $67.76 One earner family with one child under 13 earning $45,000 $27.85 $56.42 One earner family with one child under 13 earning $35,000 $16.21 $30.94 What savings will I make under the new rates? The table below shows the new Family Tax Credit rates that will apply from 1 October 2008, as compared with the old weekly rates: Weekly rate Old weekly rates NEW weekly rates from 1 October 2008 First child if under 16 $82.00 $86.29 First child if 16 or over $95.00 $99.96 Subsequent child rate if under 13 $57.00 $59.98 Subsequent child rate if 13 to 15 $65.00 $68.40 Subsequent child rate if 16 or over $85.00 $89.44 In addition, the increase in the income threshold means that all families earning above the income threshold will get an extra $7 per week. Why are you changing Working for Families now? The Working for Families legislation requires that the income threshold and the level of the Family Tax Credit rates be adjusted for inflation when the CPI movement cumulatively reaches 5% from 1 April 2007. Treasury forecasts indicate that this trigger will be reached in September 2008 (18 months after 1 April 2007). Normally, this inflation adjustment would be applied from 1 April 2009, but the government has decided to bring it forward to 1 October 2008 so 4 that families and households currently under pressure from increased costs can benefit from this tax relief sooner. As my Working for Families entitlements increase, will it mean that other forms of social assistance I get will fall? Some forms of social assistance, such as the accommodation supplement and income related rents are affected by the level of the Family Tax Credit. Where this occurs, the fall in this assistance will be less than the rise in the Family Tax Credit and therefore no one is worse off. C. Tax cuts – superannuitants & beneficiaries Do superannuitants benefit from the tax cuts? Yes. After tax payments of New Zealand Superannuation will increase from 1 October 2008 as a result of the changes to personal tax rates. The increase for a married couple is $45.88 a fortnight and $23.84 for a single superannuitant living alone. This increase is in addition to the annual adjustments made to reflect increases to living costs. As the new tax package is rolled out, there will be further increases to the rates of net New Zealand Superannuation on 1 April 2010 and 2011. Note – for further details on how superannuitants benefit from the tax cuts, see the Fact sheet for superannuitants. Do beneficiaries gain from the tax cuts? Beneficiaries with children will benefit from the inflation increase to the Family Tax Credit. Beneficiaries that are working part-time will also pay less tax on income from part-time work. Benefits rates are set on an after tax basis, so the tax cuts won’t flow through to change benefit rates. Benefits will continue to be increased each year to take account of increases in the costs of living, with the next increase timed for 1 April 2009. D: Budget 2008 tax relief – general information Why are you implementing the tax cuts mid-year from 1 October 2008 instead of 1 April 2009? New Zealand’s economy has begun to feel the effects of a challenging global environment. Global increases in commodity prices have seen the cost of food and petrol increase significantly here at home. The continued fallout from the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States and the resulting global credit crunch have led to higher mortgage rates and a weakening of the housing market domestically, squeezing the budgets of existing homeowners and reducing household spending and investment. The weakness of the US dollar has been the main driver of a very strong NZ dollar, making life difficult for some exporters. Adding to this, farmers are battling drought in a number of regions and GDP growth will slow as a result. 5 While not of New Zealand’s making these challenges are affecting New Zealanders today. A tax cut now will provide real relief to hardworking New Zealanders; at a time when they need it and the economy needs it and can afford it. How much will the tax cuts cost? The table below shows how much New Zealanders will be receiving back in their pockets over the three years of tax cuts: Year 2008/09 $ million 2009/10 $ million 2010/11 $ million 2011/12 $ million Phase 1: From 1 October 2008 1,5152,101 2,150 2,161 Phase 2: From 1 April 2010 0173 695 711 Phase 3: From 1 April 2011 00 216 887 Total 1,5152,2743,061 3,759 How can the government afford tax cuts given current economic challenges? Over the past 9 years, the government has considerably strengthened the fiscal position. For example, we have reduced gross sovereign-issued debt (excluding Reserve Bank settlement cash) from over 30% of GDP at the beginning of the century to under 20% now. In fact, growth in GDP and tax revenue have been consistently faster than expected over our term in government, allowing us to achieve our fiscal objectives much faster than anticipated. Given this position of financial strength, we are able to deliver a sizable tax package over the next three years whilst remaining consistent with our long term debt and operating balance objectives such as accumulating financial assets in the NZ Superannuation Fund. Will tax cuts and the Working for Families impact inflation? After the longest period of economic growth in New Zealand since the end of World War II, economic growth is slowing with downside risks coming from international influences and an easing labour market. The softening economy gives us greater scope to reduce taxes without exacerbating inflationary pressures. While the government is aware that inflation is high at present, not least because of high world food and oil prices, inflation is expected to decline back inside the 1-3% target over the next few years. In addition to slowing growth, the delay of the introduction of fossil fuels into the Emissions Trading Scheme until 2011 will help reduce inflation pressures. 6 Will the government have to borrow or cut back on services to pay for the tax cuts? This package of tax relief is consistent with the government's debt target, and will not be funded by cutting back on public services. The government’s debt objective is to ensure that gross sovereign-issued debt (excluding Reserve Bank settlement cash) remains broadly stable at around 20% of GDP. Based on current projections by the Treasury, we remain on track to achieve this. In addition, Treasury projections continue to allow room for increased investment in public services through projecting an allowance for new operating and capital expenditure. How much is the inflation adjustment to Working for Families costing? The total cost of the adjustment is $1.1 billion over the period 2008/09 to 2011/12. The cost of bringing the indexation forward from 1 April 2009 to 1 October 2008 is $99 million in the 2008/09 fiscal year and $16 million in the 2009/10 fiscal year. The small fiscal cost in the 2009/10 year arises because some people get their tax credits paid out at the end of the year, which means some expenditure falls in the following fiscal year.
Page 1 22 May 2008 A special report from the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue Guide to the tax changes proposed in the Taxation (Personal Tax Cuts, Annual Rates, and Remedial Matters) Bill 2008 Budget 2008 announced personal tax reductions that are to be phased in over three and a half years, and changes to Working for Families Tax Credits to take account of inflation. The Taxation (Personal Tax Cuts, Annual Rates, and Remedial Matters) Bill 2008, introduced on 22 May 2008, gives effect to those announcements. The bill also includes three sets of remedial amendments that require early enactment: the legislative changes the government announced on 14 May 2008 that are to give tax certainty for various entities in the lead-up to the deadline for registration with the Charities Commission; small but necessary remedial amendments to the portfolio investment entity (PIE) and KiwiSaver rules; and a number of drafting corrections mainly arising from the rewrite of the Income Tax Act. Finally, the bill confirms the annual rates of income tax for the 2008-09 tax year. This report describes those changes. Tax cuts for individuals The Taxation (Personal Tax Cuts, Annual Rates, and Remedial Matters) Bill 2008 provides for tax cuts for individuals from 1 October 2008. It reduces the bottom personal tax rate from 15% to 12.5% and raises the thresholds at which tax rates apply over a period of three and a half years. The bill also contains a number of consequential amendments to the tax legislation to give effect to the tax cuts. KEY FEATURES • The tax cut package will be rolled out progressively in three stages. • The new tax rates and thresholds apply to income earned by individuals. • Stage 1 changes will apply from 1 October 2008. • Stage 2 changes will apply for the 2010-11 income year (meaning they generally apply from 1 April 2010). • Stage 3 changes apply for the 2011-12 income year (meaning they generally apply from 1 April 2011). • The bottom tax rate will be lowered from 15% to 12.5%. • The thresholds will be raised for each of the three stages as shown in the following table: Page 2 Rate Thresholds Stage 1 (beginning 1 Oct 2008) Stage 2 (1 April 2010) Stage 3 (1 April 2011) 12.5% $0 – $14,000 $0 – $17,500 $0 – $20,000 21% $14,001 – $40,000 $17,501 – $40,000 $20,001 – $42,500 33% $40,001 – $70,000 $40,001 – $75,000 $42,501 – $80,000 39% $70,001 and above $75,001 and above $80,001 and above • Consequential changes to other aspects of the tax legislation – such as PAYE tax and provisional tax, fringe benefit tax and employer superannuation contribution tax – will be made to coincide with the three stages. • The existing resident withholding tax rates for interest income and the portfolio investment entity (PIE) tax rates have not been changed, although the government has announced that they will be reviewed. • The low income rebate will be removed from the 2008-09 income year, to be replaced by the new 12.5% tax rate. DETAILED ANALYSIS Personal tax rate reductions New composite tax rates for 2008-09 income year (clause 7(1)) Income tax is calculated based on a person’s annual income. Because the tax rates and thresholds are changing part-way through the 2008-09 income year, the tax rates that apply for the whole of the 2008-09 income year are “composite tax rates” that reflect an average of the two income tax rates that are used during the year. The table below shows the income tax rates that will be used during the 2008-09 income year as well as the composite tax rates for the year. The new composite rates will be contained in proposed schedule 1, part A, table 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Old tax rates applying to PAYE for the period 1 April 2008 – 30 Sept 2008 New tax rates applying to PAYE for the period 1 Oct 2008 – 31 March 2009 Composite tax rates for 2008-09 income year $0 – $9,500 15%\* 12.5% 13.75% $9,501 – $14,000 21%\* 12.5% 16.75% $14,001 – $38,000 21%\* 21% 21.00% $38,001 – $40,000 33% 21% 27.00% $40,001 – $60,000 33% 33% 33.00% $60,001 – $70,000 39% 33% 36.00% $70,001 and higher 39% 39% 39.00% \*Including the low income rebate Page 3 New tax rates for 2009-10 income year, 2010-11 income year and 2011-12 income year (clause 7(2) to (4)) Proposed schedule 1, part A, table 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides for new tax rates for the 2009-10 income year, the 2010-11 income year and the 2011-12 income year. The new rates are shown in the table below: 2009-10 Income range Tax rate $0 – $14,000 12.5% $14,001 – $40,000 21% $40,001 – $70,000 33% $70,001 upwards 39% 2010-11 Income range Tax rate $0 – $17,500 12.5% $17,501 – $40,000 21% $40,001 – $75,000 33% $75,001 upwards 39% 2011-12 and subsequent years Income range Tax rate $0 – $20,000 12.5% $20,001 – $42,500 21% $42,501 – $80,000 33% $80,001 upwards 39% New PAYE rates from 1 October 2008 – M and ML tax codes The new tax rates and thresholds will apply for the first pay period that ends on or after 1 October 2008. For pay periods that span the 1 October date and are a month or shorter, PAYE should be deducted at the new rates. If the pay period spanning 1 October is longer than a month, then PAYE needs to be deducted at the old rate for the part of the pay period before 1 October and at the new rate for the part of the pay period after 1 October. Tax rates on which PAYE will be based from 1 October 2008 to 31 March 2010 Income range Tax rate $0 – $14,000 12.5% $14,001 – $40,000 21% $40,001 – $70,000 33% $70,001 upwards 39% Page 4 The new thresholds will be progressively raised from 1 April 2010 and 1 April 2011. Inland Revenue’s PAYE deduction tables will be updated to reflect the new rates and thresholds, so that the M and ML tax codes reflect the new rate and thresholds. New PAYE rates from 1 October 2008 – secondary tax codes (clause 18) Proposed section 24B(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 raises the thresholds for secondary tax codes to reflect the new thresholds. This applies from the first pay period that ends on or after 1 October 2008. Employees can elect a new secondary tax code if they believe that their annual income will be below the new threshold. The new thresholds will be progressively raised from 1 April 2010 and 1 April 2011. From 1 October 2008 to 31 March 2010 Income range Tax code Tax rate $0 – $40,000 S 21% $40,001 – $70,000 SH 33% $70,001 upwards ST 39% From 1 April 2010 to 31 March 2011 Income range Tax code Tax rate $0 – $40,000 S 21% $40,001 – $75,000 SH 33% $75,001 upwards ST 39% From 1 April 2011 Income range Tax code Tax rate $0 – $42,500 S 21% $42,501 – $80,000 SH 33% $80,001 upwards ST 39% New rates for extra pay from 1 October 2008 (clauses 14 and 15) Proposed sections RD 10(2)(a) and RD 17(2) and (3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 raise the thresholds at which tax rates of extra pay apply to reflect the new thresholds. This applies from the first pay period that ends on or after 1 October 2008. The new thresholds will be progressively raised from 1 April 2010 and 1 April 2011. Page 5 Rates from 1 October 2008 to 31 March 2010 Income range Tax rate $0 – $40,000 21% $40,001 – $70,000 33% $70,001 upwards 39% From 1 April 2010 to 31 March 2011 Income range Tax rate $0 – $40,000 21% $40,001 – $75,000 33% $75,001 upwards 39% From 1 April 2011 Income range Tax rate $0 – $42,500 21% $42,501 – $80,000 33% $80,001 upwards 39% New FBT rates (clause 8) Proposed schedule 1, part C, table 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides for new fringe benefit tax (FBT) rates and thresholds. These reflect the new bottom rate of 12.5% and the raised thresholds. Changes will apply to the 2008-09 income year, the 2009-10 income year, the 2010-11 income year and the 2011-12 income year. For the 2008-09 year, composite rates will apply to reflect the two sets of rates being used for that year. 2008-09 Income range Tax rate $0 – $8,194 0.1594 $8,195 – $11,940 0.2012 $11,941 – $30,900 0.2658 $30,901 – $32,360 0.3699 $32,361 – $45,760 0.4925 $45,761 – $52,160 0.5625 $52,161 upwards 0.6393 Page 6 2009-10 Income range Tax rate $0 – $12,250 0.1429 $12,251 – $32,790 0.2658 $32,791 – $52,890 0.4925 $52,891 upwards 0.6393 2010-11 Income range Tax rate $0 – $15,312 0.1429 $15,313 – $33,087 0.2658 $33,088 – $56,537 0.4925 $56,538 upwards 0.6393 2011-12 Income range Tax rate $0 – $17,500 0.1429 $17,501 – $35,275 0.2658 $32,276 – $60,400 0.4925 $60,401 upwards 0.6393 New employer superannuation contribution tax rates (clause 16) Proposed schedule 1, part D, table 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides for new employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) rates and thresholds. These reflect the new bottom rate of 12.5% and the raised thresholds. The changes apply from the first pay period that ends on or after 1 October 2008. The new thresholds will be progressively raised from 1 April 2010 and 1 April 2011. From 1 October 2008 Income range Tax rate $0 – $16,800 0.125 $16,801 – $48,000 0.210 $48,001 upwards 0.330 From 1 April 2010 Income range Tax rate $0 – $21,000 0.125 $21,001 – $48,000 0.210 $48,001 upwards 0.330 Page 7 From 1 April 2011 Income range Tax rate $0 – $24,000 0.125 $24,001 – $51,000 0.210 $51,001 upwards 0.330 Provisional tax (clauses 39, 40, 41, 42, 47 and 48(2)) New sections RZ 5B and RZ 5C amend provisional tax calculations to allow individuals who pay provisional tax to reduce their provisional tax payments from 1 October 2008. To calculate the new provisional tax payments, a taxpayer’s previous year’s residual income tax (RIT) liability will be reduced by the dollar amount of the maximum tax cut that a person earning $70,000 would receive for the 2008-09 year (that is, $730) before applying the standard uplift. This applies to provisional tax payments that are made on or after 1 October 2008. In subsequent income years, the same approach is taken to reduce the previous year’s RIT, or the RIT from two years ago, by the maximum incremental amount of the tax cut before applying the 105% or 110% uplift. Similarly, the RIT is reduced by the same amounts when calculating the GST ratio for a provisional taxpayer using the GST ratio method. ACC attendant carers (clause 51) Payments to ACC attendant carers are currently subject to a withholding tax rate of 15%, which reflects the bottom tax rate. Proposed schedule 4, part I, clause 1 reduces the withholding tax rate to 12.5% from 1 October 2008. Consequential amendments Low income rebate (clauses 24, 25, 27, 28, 29, 30, 34, 43, 49, 50(01)) The low income rebate (LIR) contained in sections LC 1 and LC 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 will be repealed with effect from the 2008-09 income year. This is because the LIR will be replaced by a new low statutory tax rate of 12.5%. Under the current rates the statutory tax rate on income under $38,001 is 19.5%. However, the LIR reduces this statutory rate by 4.5% for income under $9,501, resulting in an effective rate of 15%. The LIR is abated at 1.5% for income earned over $9,500, up to $38,000. This creates the 21% rate on income earned between $9,501 and $38,000. Page 8 Various cross-references to section LC 1 and 2 in the Income Tax Act 2007 will be consequentially repealed for the 2008-09 income year and subsequent income years. Child taxpayer rebate (clause 26) The child taxpayer rebate provides children with a tax rebate on income that is not interest or dividends. This allows an eligible child to earn income (less interest and dividends) up to $2,340 per annum tax-free. The calculation of the child rebate in section LC 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007 is being consequentially amended, from the 2008-09 income year and subsequent income years, to reflect the reduction in the lowest tax rate from 15% to 12.5%. Fund withdrawal tax (clause 13) Fund withdrawal tax is a 5% tax on certain withdrawals of employer superannuation contributions from superannuation funds. The tax currently applies where the superannuation fund member’s income is above $60,000. Section CS 1(7)(b) will be amended to raise the threshold to $70,000 from 1 October 2008, $75,000 from 1 April 2010, and $80,000 from 1 April 2011. Filing tax returns (clauses 10 and 11) Section 33A(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that taxpayers do not have to file a tax return if they earn interest and dividends, income from Maori authorities, extra pays, or income from second jobs that has been taxed at an incorrect rate if the income that has been taxed incorrectly is $200 or less. Section 33A(1) will be amended to reflect the new thresholds. These changes will apply from the 2008-09 and subsequent income years. Section 33C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ensures that a taxpayer who has received ACC attendant care payments that have had tax withheld at 15% does not have to file a tax return in certain circumstances. These circumstances are when he or she has earned $9,500 or under and is not otherwise required to file a tax return under section 33A(1). Clause 11 provides that section 33C applies to ACC attendant care payments that have had tax withheld at 12.5% from the 2008-09 and subsequent income years. It also raises the threshold to $14,000 in 2008-09 and 2009-10, $17,500 in 2010-11, and $20,000 in 2011-12. Page 9 Working for Families Tax Credits The bill makes changes to the Working for Families Tax Credit package to take account of movements in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The changes increase the family tax credit entitlement amounts and raise the abatement threshold above which the family tax credit, in work tax credit and the parental tax credit abate. The Working for Families legislation requires that the abatement threshold and the family tax credit entitlement amounts are adjusted for inflation when the CPI movement cumulatively reaches 5% after 1 April 2007. Although this would normally occur from 1 April 2009, the CPI adjustment is bring brought forward so that the new income threshold and family tax credit entitlement amounts will apply from 1 October 2008. These changes apply from 1 October 2008 and subsequent years. DETAILED ANALYSIS New family tax credit entitlement amounts (clauses 5 and 33) The Working for Families Tax Credit is calculated on the basis of a full tax year (1 April – 31 March). However, having the new entitlement amounts applying from 1 October 2008 will result in two sets of entitlement amounts applying during the 2008-09 tax year. The amounts before and after 1 October are outlined (shaded) in the table below. Proposed new sections MF 4B and 4C provide that these entitlement amounts will be used to calculate a family’s entitlement if it wants its family tax credit entitlement paid during the year (either weekly or fortnightly). Also outlined in the table are composite entitlement amounts that will apply for the whole of the 2008-09 year and reflect the combination of the entitlement amounts before and after 1 October. These composite amounts are used to calculate entitlements if a family waits until the end of the year to receive its family tax credit, or to square up a family’s entitlement if it has received family tax credit payments during the year. These changes will be made by amending section MD 3(4). Family tax credit amounts for the 2008-09 year Children Current amount 1 April 2008 New amount 1 October 2008 Composite amount for the 2008-09 year First child if under 16 $4,264 $4,487 $4,376 First child if 16 or over $4,940 $5,198 $5,069 Subsequent child if under 13 $2,964 $3,119 $3,042 Subsequent child if 13 to 15 $3,380 $3,557 $3,469 Subsequent child if 16 or over $4,420 $4,651 $4,536 Page 10 How much a family will gain from these changes depends on the number and age of children in the family and whether the family earns above the income abatement threshold. The new entitlement amounts from 1 October 2008 will also apply for the 2009-10 and subsequent years. Abatement threshold (clauses 6 and 52) In addition, the income threshold above which the family tax credit, in work tax credit and parental tax credit abate will rise from 1 October 2008 to take account of inflation. The current abatement threshold is $35,000, and from 1 October 2008 it will increase to $36,827. As with the changes to the family tax credit entitlement amount, changing the abatement threshold part-way through the year (1 October) will result in a composite threshold applying for the 2008-09 year. The composite threshold for this year will be $35,914. These changes will be made by amending section MD 13(3). For the 2009-10 and subsequent years the threshold amount will be $36,827. Schedule 31 of the Income Tax Act 2007 will also be amended to reflect the new abatement threshold of $36,827. This schedule is used to increase the annual family income when determining the amount of family tax credit to pay during the year. Future indexation (clause 35) Section MF 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007 requires that the abatement threshold and the family tax credit entitlement amounts are adjusted for inflation when the CPI movement cumulatively reaches 5% after 1 April 2007. Because the CPI indexation has been brought forward, section MF 7 will consequentially be changed so that the abatement threshold and the family tax credit entitlement amounts will be adjusted for inflation if the CPI movement cumulatively reaches 5% after 1 October 2008. Clarifying the tax law for entities in the lead-up to the charities registration deadline The bill introduces several amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007, Tax Administration 1994 and the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 to resolve certain tax consequences that have emerged in the lead-up to the 1 July deadline for charities to register with the Charities Commission. The amendments are intended to provide certainty to a number of different types of entities that were unclear about whether they had to register with the Charities commission to retain their tax-exempt status. Concerns had also been raised by Inland Revenue over how it would deal with charities that had not completed the registration process by the deadline and with international charities that are unable to register with the Charities Commission. Page 11 The amendments will apply from 1 July 2008, the date on which the tax provisions in the Charities Act 2005 come into force. KEY FEATURES The proposed amendments provide that: • Tertiary education institutions and certain non-resident charities will not be subject to income tax. • Those making gifts to state and state integrated schools, tertiary education institutions and certain non-resident charities will not need to pay gift duty on those gifts. • Those making cash donations to state and state integrated schools or tertiary education institutions can claim a charitable rebate on the cash donation. • The transitional changes allow Inland Revenue, in limited circumstances, to continue to treat an entity as tax-exempt as a charity if it has not completed the registration process by 1 July. The proposed amendments will mean that tertiary education institutions and state and state integrated schools will not need to register with the Charities Commission to retain their current tax-exempt treatment. However, they may still choose to register as a charitable entity under the Charities Act 2005 to have access to other benefits that flow from registration – for example, registered charity status can be a prerequisite for securing funding from other charitable organisations or be a means of branding for some organisations. DETAILED ANALYSIS (Clauses 20 to 23, 31, 48(4), 48(5), 55 and 57) State and state integrated schools New tax provisions will apply to state and state integrated schools that are run by boards of trustees constituted under Part 9 of the Education Act 1989. • Proposed new section LD 3(2)(bb) of the Income Tax Act 2007 includes state and state integrated schools in the entities that are donee organisations. Donations made to donee organisations qualify for the charitable donations rebate for individuals and tax deductions for companies and Māori authorities. • New section 73 (2)(jb) of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 exempts from gift duty gifts made to state and state integrated schools. • New section 32E(2)(kb) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows state and state integrated schools to apply for a Certificate of Exemption for resident withholding tax purposes. Page 12 Tertiary education institutions New tax provisions will apply to tertiary education institutions (universities, polytechnics, specialist colleges and wananga) that are established under Part 14 of the Education Act 1989: • New section CW 55C of the Income Tax Act 2007 exempts from income tax the income derived by a tertiary education institution. • New section LD 3(2)(bc) of the Income Tax Act 2007 includes tertiary education institutions in the entities that are donee organisations. • New section 73(2)(jc) of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 exempts from gift duty gifts made to a tertiary education institution. • New section 32E(2)(kc) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows tertiary education institutions to apply for a Certificate of Exemption for resident withholding tax purposes. Charities that need more time to complete the registration process Proposed new section CW 41(5)(ii) of the Income Tax Act 2007 deals with transitional tax consequences for charities that need more time to complete the registration process. It applies to entities that: • started, before 1 July 2008 to take reasonable steps in the process of preparing an application for registering as a charitable entity under the Charities Act 2005; and • intend to complete the process of preparing an application in future; and • have not been notified by the Inland Revenue that they are not a “tax charity”. Inland Revenue will develop administrative guidelines on what organisations will need to do to be eligible for the transitional relief. Charities that qualify for this transitional relief will continue to be treated as income tax-exempt, and gifts made to them will not attract gift duty. Non-resident charities Proposed new section CW 41(5)(iii) of the Income Tax Act 2007 enables Inland Revenue to approve certain non-resident charities as income tax-exempt on grounds of their having charitable purposes. Gifts made to these approved charities will not attract gift duty. To be eligible for the proposed treatment, a non-resident charity must carry out its charitable activities outside of New Zealand and must not have a strong connection to New Zealand such that the Charities Commission is able to exercise its monitoring and enforcement functions under the Charities Act 2005. Inland Revenue will develop a set of administrative guidelines on how it will assess whether a non-resident charity is eligible for the exemptions. Page 13 Remedial amendments to PIE and KiwiSaver rules and drafting corrections The bill makes the following remedial amendments to the portfolio investment entity (PIE) rules, which are consistent with the policy intention of the rules: • Clause 44 amends section RE 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to ensure that resident withholding tax does not apply to PIE distributions. • Clause 48 corrects a mistake in the definition of “portfolio investor rate” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 by replacing 33% with 30%. • Clause 54 amends section 31B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to require portfolio tax rate entities to request a tax file number from new investors as soon as is practicable. A related amendment to the definition of “portfolio investor rate” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 is contained in clause 48. This will ensure that the 19.5% “portfolio investor rate” is not available to investors unless they notify the portfolio tax rate entity of their tax file number. The bill makes the following remedial amendments relating to KiwiSaver, which are consistent with the policy intention of the legislation: • Clause 58 amends the definition of “salary or wages” in the KiwiSaver Act 2006 to ensure that an accommodation allowance is not treated as salary or wages for KiwiSaver purposes. • Clause 59 amends the Taxation (KiwiSaver) Act 2007 to delay the repeal of section 216 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 until 1 April 2009. The bill also proposes a number of drafting corrections that mainly arise from the rewrite of the Income Tax Act. These corrections are being made as a matter of urgency to give certainty to taxpayers. They are contained in clauses 32, 36, 37, 38, 45, 46, 50(2) to (4), 56 and 60. Most of these remedial amendments apply from the 2008-09 income year. Confirmation of annual rates Clause 61 confirms the annual rates of income tax for the 2008-09 tax year.

Revenue Minister's speech to NZICA
==================================

In a speech today to an NZICA special interest group, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne outlined his views on tax matters announced in Budget 2008. For more information see the [speech](/news/2008/2008-05-27-revenue-ministers-speech-nzica#speech)

### Peter Dunne, Minister of Revenue

### Speech to the NZICA Special Interest Group

### Wellington, Tuesday 27 May 2008

I am very pleased be here today to address your Special Interest Group on the tax changes announced in Budget 2008.

I plan to make a few brief comments on Budget tax matters, and then to invite your questions and comments.

If we can judge by post-Budget statements released by some of the large accountancy firms, your profession's response to the changes has, I think, been generally positive, if not enthusiastic.

The somewhat muted response may be the result of too-high expectations of what the Budget could deliver, but even then at least one firm commented that the tax cuts were "more generous than expected".

So what do people expect?

It may be that, with personal tax cuts tending to happen about only once a decade or so, when they do occur people expect them to be dramatic.

It may be that we need a series of smaller, more frequent and therefore more affordable tax cuts.

That way they might not be invested with too-high expectations.

In my view, the tax cuts announced and legislated for under urgency last week were long overdue.

They are not completely satisfactory to me and my party but they are a step in the right direction.

I supported their introduction and I am happy that they have been introduced.

However, they do not deal with the unfinished problem of the difference between the top personal tax rate, the trustee tax rate and the company tax rate.

I take special pleasure in the fact that the reduction of the company tax rate from 33% to 30%, with effect from this year, was a direct result of the Business Tax Review.

The establishment of the review was a key policy plank for my party in negotiating the confidence and supply agreement between Labour and UnitedFuture.

As you may know, I have long advocated a 30/30/30 approach to tax rates.

That would mean reducing the top personal tax rate and the trustee tax rate to the level of the new company tax rate.

Despite our present economic uncertainty, I believe there is scope for achieving those remaining reductions – and that we must pursue them.

I believe that they would stimulate productivity, investment and personal savings, at a time when they are especially needed.

A flatter alignment of tax rates would also help to deal with problems that arise as a result of the difference in these tax rates – such as companies and trusts being used to shelter personal income.

That creates unfairness in the tax system and undermines it.

On tax policy, UnitedFuture stands for an efficient and fair tax system, one that is easy to comply with and hard to avoid, one in which taxes are levied on broad base, and one with comparatively low, internationally competitive rates.

Our tax policy, which is to be announced shortly, will focus on these issues.

Budget 2008 also announced that the taxation bill to be introduced next month will include legislation to reduce tax-related compliance costs and remove tax impediments to the offshore expansion of New Zealand-resident companies.

These changes both result from tax policy reviews that have been under way for some time.

In December last year Dr Cullen and I released a discussion document seeking feed-back on a range of ideas aimed at reducing tax-related compliance costs for small and medium enterprises – or SMEs.

Even though tax compliance costs are a fact of business, SMEs, which make up the bulk of New Zealand businesses, bear a disproportionate burden of these costs.

It therefore makes sense to reduce compliance costs wherever possible so that smaller businesses can devote more of their resources to their core business activities.

Many of the possible changes outlined in the discussion document had to do with raising business tax thresholds.

That could result in reducing the number of tax returns a business has to file, the information it must supply, or the calculations it must make.

In other words, raising threshold could mean fewer tax matters for a business to deal with.

As announced in the budget, the forthcoming bill will introduce the first stage of the resulting changes, which will raise a number of tax thresholds to make life easier for smaller businesses.

The changes will allow, for example, more SME employers to file and pay PAYE deductions once a month instead of twice a month.

Likewise, raised thresholds will allow more employers to file and pay FBT annually rather than quarterly, and more taxpayers to file GST returns on a six-monthly basis rather than a two-monthly basis.

The second stage of the review will consider compliance cost reduction initiatives that represent more significant departures from the normal tax rules that businesses have identified, in consultation, as being desirable.

The continuing review of New Zealand's international tax rules has resulted in the second set of changes that the Budget announced would be included in the forthcoming bill.

That review, which is of enormous importance to New Zealand, has involved considerable consultation with businesses over the last couple of years.

The aim of the review is to boost the competitiveness of New Zealand businesses by bringing our international tax rules into line with the relevant rules of our main competitors.

Those changes will enable New Zealand-resident businesses to compete more effectively in foreign markets.

Many of you will be aware that the central feature of the reform is the introduction of a tax exemption for active income from the offshore operations of New Zealand-resident businesses.

That was announced in Budget 2007.

Our present rules tax that income, with the exception of income from operations in the so-called “grey list” of eight countries that our law singles out as having tax systems comparable to our own.

The active income exemption will be available to all controlled foreign companies in all jurisdictions, which means the grey list of eight is no longer required.

Budget 2008 announced that there would, however, be a grey list of one, which will consist of Australia.

Therefore New Zealand companies that set up operations in Australia, which is usually where our smaller businesses start when they decide to expand overseas, will not have to face the compliance costs associated with meeting the active business test.

It has already been announced that there will be a second stage of the review.

It will move to extend the active income exemption to non-portfolio foreign investment funds and financial institutions.

That stage of the review will also look at the possibility of introducing a relieving mechanism for non-resident withholding tax on dividends paid to shareholders if those dividends represent distributions of exempt active income.

An issues paper on how best to achieve the active income exemption for non-portfolio foreign investment funds will be released for consultation within the next couple of months.

As Minister of Revenue, I am pleased with the direction that tax reform has taken over the last three years.

Changes to the tax rules for business, investment, research and development, savings, charitable donations and now personal taxes have all helped to position New Zealand well for the future.

Much more remains to be done of course, and I am looking forward to progressing these and future reforms.

Thank you.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Paper seeks views on GST changes

A tax policy issues paper released today for public consultation looks at options for strengthening the GST neutrality of business-to-business transactions and reducing the risks that GST can present to both businesses and the government.

"A fundamental principle of our GST system is that the tax must be neutral for businesses whose supplies are subject to GST," Revenue Minister Peter Dunne said today.

"That means businesses should not bear the cost of the tax. The GST they charge on taxable supplies is balanced by input tax claims. GST should not be a permanent business cost in these circumstances.

"If the tax rules do not clearly provide neutrality for businesses, they can face unexpected GST payments or tax penalties.

"It is also important to the government that GST claims are balanced against payments. The GST refunds it issues should be offset by corresponding GST payments.

"When there is a large claim but no corresponding payment, that may be may be for legitimate reasons, the result - for example - of a business's liquidation or bad debts. It may also be for other reasons, such as the exploitation of timing mismatches or through the deliberate use of 'phoenix' entities to avoid paying GST.

"The issues paper released today, which has been prepared by tax policy officials as a first step in the consultation process, seeks feedback on a range of legislative options for ensuring that business-to-business transactions are neutral.

"To strengthen the GST neutrality of transactions involving high-value assets such as 'going concerns', land and assets with a value of $50 million or more, the paper suggests replacing the going concern rules with an expanded set of rules that ensure neutrality and that apply to a wider range of transactions. Associated changes would ensure that input tax deductions are not denied for nominee and related transactions.

"The paper outlines three options for reducing the risks arising from phoenix entities, which are a particular problem for GST systems that are based on the 'credit-invoice' method. They are to enforce GST neutrality on certain transactions created between close associates, allow Inland Revenue to impose caveats on certain land transactions, and extend the time available to Inland Revenue before it must release a refund.

"To reduce the revenue risks associated with timing mismatches, the paper suggests either limiting access to the invoice basis of accounting and strengthening the application of existing anti-avoidance measures or increasing the payments basis threshold.

"Also covered in the paper are a number of possible changes to simplify and clarify the change-in-use rules and to clarify the GST treatment of short-term accommodation – including redefining the terms 'dwelling' and 'commercial dwelling' and removing very small-scale and non-commercial supplies of accommodation from the definition of 'taxable activity'.

"These are all matters that will doubtless be of interest to tax professionals and to businesses that buy and sell significant assets, and I urge all interested parties to have their say on the options presented in the issues paper," Mr Dunne said.

The issues paper, "“Options for strengthening business-to-business neutrality in the GST rules", is published at [www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz](https://www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz)
. The closing date for submissions is 11 July.

Dr Cullen speech to Aus-NZ Leadership Forum
===========================================

In a speech today to the Australia-New Zealand Leadership Forum, Finance Minister Michael Cullen described work under way to contribute to the development of a Single Economic Market between the two countries, including investigating ways to improve the portability of retirement savings and the re-negotiation of the DTA between the two countries. He also proposed a mutual recognition system under which each country would provide tax credits to resident individuals who receive company distributions from the other country. That would remove a barrier to trans-Tasman investment flows, he said. For more information see the [speech](/news/2008/2008-06-13-dr-cullen-speech-aus-nz-leadership-forum#speech)

### Speech To Australia - New Zealand Leadership Forum

### Hon Dr Michael Cullen, Minister of Finance

### 13 June 2008, Te Papa, Wellington

I am delighted to be here today at the 5th Annual Australia-New Zealand Leadership Forum. I welcome my counterparts that have come here from Australia, and business leaders from both countries attending this forum.

New Zealand and Australia can both be proud of the quality and closeness of the long standing relationship between our two countries. We have a special partnership, which is "as close as it gets" to use the words of our Prime Ministers when they met in January this year. This relationship underpins the national interests of both countries.

One of the defining characteristics of our relationship is the depth and frequency of meetings, like this one, which aim to improve relations - from the point of view of government ministers, officials and business people. It is encouraging to see a wide range of people from all of these areas taking part in this Forum over the next two days.

Business leaders, in particular, are champions of the economic relationship between our two countries, and meetings like this offer them important opportunities to discuss the relationship from their perspective.

I will speak to you today about the close economic relationship between Australia and New Zealand, and the difficulties we both face in the current global economic climate.

I'll also discuss our work towards developing a Single Economic Market. In particular I will express my view that we need to address a significant barrier to trans-Tasman investment – the mutual recognition of franking and imputation credits.

**Australia/New Zealand Relationship**

The relationship between Australia and New Zealand is vitally important, not just to boost trade and investment on both sides, but for the movement of skilled workers, and sharing innovation and best practice within our business sectors.

This year marks the 25th Anniversary of the Closer Economic Relations (CER). We have come a long way over the last quarter century.

We have eliminated almost all of the major barriers to trans-Tasman trade and are now working to reduce the less "visible" barriers to business in order to create a Single Economic Market (SEM).

Although CER was negotiated and signed a quarter of a century ago, it is still regarded by the World Trade Organisation as "the world's most comprehensive, effective, and mutually compatible free trade agreement". This indicates not only the quality of the agreement reached in 1983, but the ongoing work by many to ensure that CER is an evolving, vital agreement.

Total free trade in goods and services, supported by free movement of people, and the mutual recognition of goods and occupations across the Tasman are the pillars on which CER was built.

The benefits are clear - trans-Tasman trade has grown at an average of nine per cent a year since 1983 – more than the growth rates of both economies combined.

Today, Australia remains New Zealand's largest market, taking just over 20 per cent of our total exports, and New Zealand is Australia's sixth largest market.

More Australian businesses export to New Zealand than to any other country, and Australian and New Zealand companies have nearly NZ$100 billion directly invested in each other.

Total trans-Tasman merchandise trade is currently valued at approximately NZ$15 billion, and trade in services is currently worth just over NZ$6 billion annually, and is growing strongly.

**Global Economic Challenges**

And while we have much to celebrate over recent years – with both our economies growing faster than the US, EU, and the OECD average since 2000 – this year, we are both confronting serious challenge.

Both of our economies have remained largely resilient in the face the sub-prime mortgage crisis and the resulting global credit crunch, but we have been provided with an important wake-up call for business and government that we are not immune to off-shore financial crises.

The rising prices of food and oil also pose a challenge to policy makers on both sides of the Tasman. New Zealand and Australian households are feeling significant pressure at the petrol pump and the supermarket checkout. The effects of these commodity price increases are a major worry for both fiscal and monetary policy makers as we seek to control inflation.

From a more global perspective, the food prices rises are undermining the work done in developing countries to raise the living standards of those who survive on very little.

It is a painful irony that the expansion of prosperity through the developing world – in China and India in particular – which should be a cause for celebration, has been a key driver of growing demand for food and thus rising prices, which threatens to impoverish tens of millions of people worldwide.

Both New Zealand and Australia have reacted to this risk by contributing to global appeals for assistance. Both our nations were represented at last week's United Nations meeting on the food crisis in Rome.

New Zealand will continue to monitor the humanitarian situation closely, with a particular focus on the Pacific region.

**Single Economic Market**

At this time of global uncertainty, the simple truth is that neither of our economies has a great number of options. We were not responsible for the recklessness that created the subprime crisis in North America. We certainly cannot significantly constrain international commodity prices that are putting pressure on our households and our headline inflation rates.

We can provide some relief via tax cuts as both the Australian and New Zealand governments have done in our recent Budgets. And we can continue to implement stable fiscal policy while our central banks seek to control inflation.

But we must also continue to build on our strengths and continue to accentuate our competitive advantages.

And what we know is that for both our economies, the Australia-New Zealand CER is a vital and enduring asset that we must continue to build upon if we want to not only weather this current economic slowdown, but to continue to work towards the greater prosperity citizens of both our countries deserve.

Now is the time to pick up the pace on the Single Market agenda, not to put it on the backburner.

It has been the vision of both the Australian and New Zealand governments for some years now to build on the close trading relationship created by CER, and work towards this vision of a seamless trans-Tasman business environment.

With most of the obvious barriers to trade, such as tariffs, already eliminated under CER, our vision for the Single Economic Market is to remove any behind-the-border impediments to trade. The SEM aims to find innovative new ways of further reducing any barriers to doing business between our two countries.

This will be a big boost to trade and industry, making it just as easy for business leaders such as yourselves to operate in Australia or New Zealand, as in your base country.

This is particularly important for small and medium enterprises taking their first steps offshore. Often, the first place small and medium enterprises will look to expand is across the Tasman, so it is essential that expansion be supported by the SEM in order to support a brighter future for our companies.

For example, New Zealand is a very important market for Australian small and medium enterprises.

AUSTrade recently reported that more than 17,000 Australian businesses exported to New Zealand in 2005-2006, almost double any other destination. Developing the SEM can only build on that solid export base and expand it even further.

The SEM continues to be a priority for the New Zealand government, and I am extremely pleased to see the enthusiastic commitment of the Rudd government towards it, clearly evidenced by the number of Ministers here at the Leadership Forum.

I am particularly looking forward to continuing my dialogue with Treasurer Wayne Swan at our upcoming bilateral meeting in July. I hope this meeting will allow us to make significant progress on our current priorities for the SEM.

**SEM – work so far**

We’ve already come a long way in developing a Single Economic Market. Positive steps forward this year have included:

*   A Treaty on the Mutual Recognition of Securities Offerings, which entered into force this morning following the requisite legal steps being taken by Senator Sherry and my colleague and Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel (more details to come)
*   A new Cooperation Agreement by the New Zealand Commerce Commission and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.
*   Sharing information between the New Zealand Companies Office and the Australian Securities & Investments Commission.
*   Bringing New Zealand's corporate insolvency regime closer into line with the Australian regime.

**SEM – work currently underway**

At the moment, officials in both countries are focussing their work on three key SEM initiatives:

1.  _Investigating ways to improve the portability of retirement savings between Australia and New Zealand:_  
    Currently workers with savings held within Australian savings accounts cannot transfer their savings to New Zealand, so officials are working to improve portability arrangements, which will allow the free flow of savings between the KiwiSaver Workplace Savings Scheme and Australian retirement savings accounts.
2.  _The re-negotiation of the Double Taxation Agreement:_  
    Officials began talks on this just last month, investigating the current levels of non-resident withholding tax. Another area of tax that could be a huge boost to both countries is the mutual recognition of imputation and franking credits, which could be a huge benefit to investors on both sides of the ditch – but I'll have more to say about that in a moment.
3.  _Negotiating a CER Investment Protocol:_  
    Historically, we've had a strong investment relationship under the CER trade agreement, but agreeing specific screening thresholds around investment will build even closer economic relations in this important area.  
    I look forward to discussing the Investment Protocol as a matter of priority at my upcoming meeting with Mr Swan.

**SEM – the future**

There is plenty of work still to do in the future to further enhance the Single Economic Market. Of particular interest to business leaders here today will be our work to enhance the trans-Tasman business environment to make it easier for you to work between countries, including:

*   Working to align the New Zealand and Australian approaches to financial reporting to help streamline accounting operations.
*   Concluding a Treaty to provide a legal framework to help resolve trans-Tasman disputes with greater efficiency and at a lower cost.
*   Increasing co-operation between Australia and New Zealand on banking crisis management arrangements, and removing barriers to providing banking services.

The future of our Single Economic Market will also focus on using our strong relationship with Australia regionally and internationally, by:

*   Reducing barriers to regional trade through APEC.
*   Advancing the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement.
*   Working together to combat climate change – a key part of this will be emissions trading between our countries and making the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme compatible with the one currently being developed by Australia.
*   We should also continue to work closely together as a post-Kyoto agreement develops, to advance areas of mutual interest in climate change negotiations.

**Next Steps in a Single Economic Market**

So where to from here?

I would now like to turn to an issue that will be of interest to a great number of you in business – the issue of imputation and franking credits between New Zealand and Australia. I acknowledge that some of you have been making a case for this for a long time. It's a problem that I look forward to solving creatively with my new Australian Ministerial colleagues.

To re-state the problem, under current arrangements investors on both sides are being double-taxed. And investment flows between us are distorted in a way which doesn’t sit well with wider moves towards a Single Economic Market.

I realise that this is a complex issue, but one approach which we think merits close attention is a mutual recognition system under which Australia and New Zealand each provide tax credits to their resident individuals who receive company distributions from across the Tasman, to compensate for tax paid in the other country.

Any solution to this problem has to be win-win. We think that under our mutual recognition proposal, cooperation between New Zealand and Australia in this area would see both countries better off. In effect, both countries would remove a barrier to trans-Tasman investment flows, which would encourage investment from New Zealand into Australia, in exchange for Australia encouraging investment into NZ.

This would boost the efficiency of capital allocation in the combined trans-Tasman economy and increase productivity and growth for both our countries.

There would, of course, be some loss of revenue to both countries, as it would relieve one level of tax from what is now double taxation of trans-Tasman investment. In this sort of area, governments have to make judgements.

For the Single Economic Market to have benefits to both countries, and to remain relevant to business needs,, we believe it makes no sense to deny imputation credits when dividends are paid across the Tasman.

After all, the wider logic of a Single Economic Market is to make it no more difficult for investment to flow between our two countries, than within our two countries.

I do acknowledge that Australia has significant concerns that mutual recognition could create a precedent that would need to be extended to other countries.

But I believe a way forward can be found by limiting mutual recognition to countries with essentially identical regimes. If that were possible then in each of our cases the other is the only country that would meet such a test.

I encourage all you as business leaders to look at this area and consider the benefits, and I urge you to also be involved in the dialogue. With creativity and goodwill we should be able to make good progress on the issue and it's in that spirit that I will look forward to engaging with my counterparts in Australia in the coming months.

**Conclusion**

As you can see, there's a huge amount of work going on to contribute to the development of a Single Economic Market between Australia and New Zealand and today's meeting gives us the opportunity to discuss how we can build on this solid base to improve our relationship even further, particularly given the international economic uncertainty.

Thank you for your time and thank you for your dedication to the economic relationship between our two nations.

### Business tax reforms focus of bill

A bill tabled in Parliament today introduces a number of major business tax reforms.

"The focus of several of the reforms is on reducing tax costs for businesses," Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne said today.

"High tax costs can arise from a range of factors, from tax rules that block sensible business transactions to others that create unnecessarily high compliance costs. The bill tackles these costs on a number of fronts.

"Other reforms introduced in the bill bring tax law up to date with today's commercial environment, ensure legislation is working as effectively as possible and protect the New Zealand revenue base,” the Ministers said.

**Reform of international tax rules**

"The central feature of the bill is the reform of our international tax rules, which represents a fundamental change in how we tax the offshore income of our controlled foreign companies. The present system of taxing that income as it is earned will be replaced by one that exempts the active offshore income of these companies.

"That reform will bring our tax rules into line with the practice in other countries and help New Zealand-based business to compete more effectively in foreign markets by freeing them from a tax cost that similar companies in other countries do not face.

**Raising tax thresholds for small businesses**

"The bill also reduces compliance costs for smaller businesses by raising several tax thresholds. For example, the PAYE once-a-month filing and payment threshold is being raised from $100,000 to $250,000. That will allow a greater number of small employers to file and pay their PAYE deductions once a month instead of twice a month, saving them time and money.

**Employee relocation and overtime meal allowances**

"The bill clarifies the law to ensure that employer payments for employee relocation and overtime meal allowances are exempt from income tax and fringe benefit tax if certain criteria are met. The changes remove long-standing uncertainty and simplify the law, which will save time and money for everyone involved.

**Taxation of the life insurance busines**s

"The bill introduces a major reform of the way the life insurance business is taxed, modernising rules that date back to 1990. As life insurance products and business practices have changed over the years, the tax rules have become out of date. For example, many term insurance profits are under-taxed today, with profitable business often leading to tax losses, while income from saving through life products is over-taxed.

"The bill brings in a coherent framework of changes that taxes risk business on actual profits, in a manner similar to the way other businesses are taxed. It also extends the tax benefits of the PIE rules to all savers in life products, ensuring savings through life insurance are taxed, as much as possible, in a manner that is consistent with the taxation of savings through other vehicles.

**Charitable giving and volunteering**

The bill introduces a voluntary payroll giving system whereby employees can have their charitable donations deducted from their pay by their employers.

Employees who donate in this way will receive the tax benefit of their donations each payday, without the need to present donation receipts. Payroll giving will operate through the PAYE system and will be available to people whose employers file their employer monthly schedules with Inland Revenue electronically.

"The introduction of payroll giving will undoubtedly be welcomed by the growing number of employers in New Zealand who see social responsibility and good corporate citizenship as an important part of their business.

"On a similar theme, the bill also clarifies the tax treatment of volunteer reimbursements and honoraria, to make it easier for volunteers and community organisations to comply with their tax obligations and to reduce the associated compliance costs," the Ministers said.

**Petroleum mining in NZ**

"The petroleum mining tax rules are being updated to remove possible disincentives to further investment in oil and gas exploration and development in New Zealand.

"The bill also introduces legislation to ensure that New Zealand receives its proper share of the benefits from our burgeoning petroleum mining industry, exports of crude oil now making a major contribution to our trade balance. The changes will allow expenditure on petroleum mining operations undertaken through a foreign branch to be offset only against petroleum mining income from outside New Zealand, to safeguard our taxing rights on our own petroleum resources.

**Associated persons in income tax law**

"The bill also introduces changes to strengthen the definitions of 'associated persons' in income tax law, which are there mainly in an anti-avoidance capacity, to counter transactions that are not conducted at arm's length. One of the main changes is to close gaps in the definition relating to land sales that allow land dealers, developers and builders to circumvent the rules by operating through connected persons,” the Ministers said.

Other measures in the bill include:

*   Non-disclosure for tax advice: changes to allow the right for non-disclosure of documents to apply to discovery and similar processes that occur in litigation with Inland Revenue.
*   Emissions trading: amendments to income tax and GST legislation to provide for the tax treatment of emissions units.
*   Film grants: tax changes necessitated by the introduction of the New Zealand Screen Production Incentive Fund, as announced in Budget 2008.
*   GST: changes to allow certain loyalty programme operators to defer imposing GST until loyalty points have been redeemed, and to allow exported second-hand goods to be zero-rated in certain circumstances.
*   General insurance: amendments will allow general insurers to take a deduction for the annual movement in outstanding claims reserves under the new financial accounting standard.
*   Fine-tuning of recent legislation: changes to ensure the new PIE rules, the offshore portfolio share investment rules, the R&D tax credit rules, the KiwiSaver rules and the provisional tax pooling rules work effectively and do what they were intended to do.

### Tax reform to help NZ companies compete overseas

Comprehensive reform of our international tax rules, to help New Zealand-based companies compete more effectively overseas, is the main feature of a taxation bill introduced today.

"The proposed changes represent a fundamentally different approach to taxing New Zealand companies that have offshore operations," Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne said.

"The cornerstone of the reform is the exemption from tax of the offshore active income of New Zealand's controlled foreign companies, regardless of where it is earned.

"That will bring our tax rules into line with the tax systems of comparable countries, particularly that of Australia, and remove a tax cost that similar companies in other countries do not face," the Ministers said.

At present, New Zealand taxes the active income – such as income from manufacturing – from its offshore subsidiaries, whereas other countries do not.

The change is designed to encourage businesses with international operations to remain in New Zealand and enable them to compete on an equal tax footing in foreign markets.

"Further important features of the proposed changes are an exemption from tax of most foreign dividends paid to companies and measures to protect the tax base as a result of adopting an active income exemption.

"The changes introduced today represent the first stage of the those to emerge from the government's review of our international tax rules and have been greatly influenced by extensive consultation with businesses and their advisors.

"Most aspects of the reforms were signalled in a series of consultative papers, although there has been further work to develop the detail in some areas.

**Active income exemption**

"Comprehensive attribution of income from controlled foreign companies (CFCs) to New Zealand owners will be replaced by attribution of passive income only. Passive income – such as interest – will continue to be attributable.

"There will be some exceptions to attribution of passive income, however, to reduce compliance costs. For example, there will generally be no attribution of passive income for CFCs in Australia, which is usually the first country of choice for our smaller businesses that want to expand overseas.

"There will also be an exception for CFCs that pass an 'active business' test: no attribution of passive income will be required for CFCs whose passive income is less than five percent of total income.

"Passive income will consist mainly of interest, rent, royalties and dividends. Certain services will also be classified as passive income, as will income from speculative derivative instruments and derivatives that hedge passive income.

**Foreign dividend exemption**

"Most dividends paid by a foreign company will be exempt from income tax when received by New Zealand companies, as was previously announced. Deductible dividends and dividends on fixed rate shares will be continue to be taxable as interest, and fixed rate shares issued by foreign companies will be treated as debt. That will prevent double New Zealand taxation, since a deduction will be allowed against the attributable income of the CFC.

"As part of the exemption for ordinary dividends, there will be a change to the qualifying company rules: a qualifying company may no longer hold an attributing interest in a controlled foreign company or non-portfolio foreign investment fund. That is to prevent foreign dividends being passed through to shareholders tax-free.

**Revenue base protection measures**

"Interest allocation rules will be extended to cover New Zealand residents that have outbound interests in a CFC. Several 'safe harbour' provisions will, however, minimise the impact of the rules and permit much of the cost of debt-funding for a foreign investment to be deducted against the New Zealand tax base.

"The present 'grey list' exemption from attribution of CFC income is being replaced with the active business test for CFCs in all countries, with one exception – Australian CFCs will generally continue to be exempt from the requirement to attribute any income to New Zealand residents.

"The existing conduit relief mechanism, which exempts from tax the foreign-sourced income of New Zealand companies owned by non-residents, is being removed. Even so, the active income exemption and the foreign dividend exemption provide the same results as conduit relief for active income.

**Transitional measures**

"Companies' foreign dividend payment accounts, branch equivalent tax accounts and conduit tax relief accounts will become unnecessary under the reform. It is the government's intention that existing FDP credit balances can be carried forward for five years and BETA debit balances and conduit tax credits can be carried forward for two years, with legislation repealing them to be introduced at a later date. BETA credit balances will be cancelled from the beginning of the 2009-10 income year.

"The aim in developing this comprehensive reform has been to devise flexible rules that are consistent with the realities of the business environment and that help New Zealand businesses to expand their operations but keep their head offices in New Zealand," the Ministers said.

Aus-NZ mutual recognition on agenda
===================================

The Australian and New Zealand governments are open to the idea of moving toward mutual recognition of imputation and franking credits between firms that invest in each other's country, Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan and New Zealand Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today. New Zealand will be making a submission on the matter to the Secretary of the Australian Treasury, they said.

Negotiations for a new double tax agreement between the two countries are progressing well, they said, and are expected to be concluded by the end of the year.

### Australia, NZ agree to progress work on mutual recognition of imputation and franking credits

The Australian and New Zealand governments are open to the idea of moving toward mutual recognition of imputation and franking credits between firms that invest in each other's country, Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan and New Zealand Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today.

Dr Cullen said the lack of mutual recognition was a difficult policy issue, but was of significant concern to the business community.

"Under current arrangements investors on both sides of the Tasman are being  
double-taxed," Dr Cullen said. "And investment flows between us are distorted in a way which doesn’t sit well with wider moves towards a Single Economic Market.

"I am pleased that the Treasurer has expressed openness to investigating this issue and to explore possible solutions. It is clear that any solution must be a win-win for both economies."

The first step in the process is to determine whether it is practical and feasible to introduce mutual recognition. And if it is practical, then the second issue is to determine the potential costs and benefits to each economy, the Ministers said.

Hon Swan invited the New Zealand Treasury to make a formal submission on mutual recognition to the _Australia's Future Tax System_ review which was recently established by the Federal Labor Government and is anticipated to issue its final report by the end of 2009.

New Zealand Revenue Minister, Hon Peter Dunne, who attended the session of the bilateral talks on taxation issues, said that he welcomes the fact that mutual recognition is now formally on the agenda for both countries given its importance to the trans-Tasman business community.

### Australia, NZ progress bilateral economic interests

The first formal meeting of New Zealand Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan in Wellington today acknowledged 25 years of Closer Economic Relations and discussed the shared goal of a Single Economic Market (SEM).

The SEM is a long-term strategic objective and a priority for both New Zealand and Australia. A range of related activities are already in progress, as well as a range of supporting technical work.

As well as reviewing a number of significant SEM achievements so far and discussing future development opportunities, Dr Cullen and Mr Swan made several SEM-related announcements.

*   A new arrangement on private retirement savings portability between Australia and New Zealand will be settled by October this year. Both countries will then undertake the necessary steps to allow the transfer of retirement savings between complying Australian superannuation accounts and KiwiSaver accounts.
*   Australia and New Zealand will progress negotiations on an Investment Protocol that aims to encourage investment in both countries. The intention is to conclude an agreement in early 2009.
*   Negotiations are progressing well for a new tax treaty between Australia and New Zealand. Officials expect to conclude negotiations by the end of this year.
*   A treaty on Trans-Tasman Court Proceedings and Regulatory Enforcement Treaty is close to finalisation, and the New Zealand and Australian Governments will sign it on 24 July in Christchurch at the Standing Council of Attornies-General Meeting. This will benefit businesses and individuals on both sides of the Tasman by resolving legal disputes more effectively and at lower cost.
*   Substantial progress has been made across an extensive range of issues under the Memorandum of Understanding on Business Law, in particular the entry into force of the Treaty on the Mutual Recognition of Securities Offerings.
*   Agreement to consider proposals for the mutual recognition of imputation and franking credits.

The Ministers also took the opportunity to discuss challenges currently facing the New Zealand and Australian economies including the global financial crisis, rising global food and oil prices, and to share experiences on these matters. Dr Cullen and Mr Swan also discussed New Zealand and Australia's mutual interests and engagement in regional and international arenas such as APEC, the Pacific Islands Forum and the IMF.

A particular area of interest for both Ministers was climate change and the progress Australia is making towards designing and implementing its Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. The Ministers agreed on the importance of New Zealand and Australian officials maintaining close contact to maximise prospects for future compatibility and harmonisation of the Australian and New Zealand systems with each other and with other future emissions trading schemes.

### Discussion document looks at streaming and refunding imputation credits

A discussion document released today seeks views on whether the law should allow limited streaming of imputation credits to those who can use them and refunds of credits for charities and other tax-exempt entities.

"The discussion document is the first step in a process of consultation on possible improvements to two important areas in the imputation rules of the Income Tax Act," Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne said today.

"Imputation credits are credits attached to dividends for income tax that has been paid by the company in which shares are held. New Zealand shareholders who pay tax in New Zealand can use imputation credits to offset their income tax.

"The focus of the discussion document is on those imputation credits that cannot be fully used under current law – either because the recipient is a foreign shareholder or because the recipient is a New Zealand organisation that is exempt from income tax.

"Our tax law does not permit 'streaming' of imputation credits, which means directing credits away from those who cannot use them to those who can. That is to protect the revenue base. Without anti-streaming rules, it would be easy, for example, to devise arrangements that resulted in foreign investors in New Zealand companies not paying tax in New Zealand on the income they derive here.

"For the same reason there is no question of allowing refunds of imputation credits to foreign shareholders in New Zealand companies. Doing so would effectively allow them to pay no tax on their New Zealand income.

"There are strong grounds for preventing streaming and possibly even for strengthening our anti-streaming rules. At the same time, the government would like to hear people's views on whether the anti-streaming rules inhibit valid commercial transactions and whether streaming should be allowed in some circumstances.

"Similarly, the government is prepared to consider the case for refunding imputation credits to organisations that have a specific exemption from New Zealand income tax, such as registered charities.

"The discussion document seeks comment on whether the lack of refunds for imputation credits affects the type of investments that tax-exempt organisations make, whether refunds could be made to work in some circumstances, and what might be better alternatives to refunds.

"A very important influence on the outcome of this review is the possibility of our entering negotiations with Australia to establish a system of mutual recognition of imputation and franking credits for trans-Tasman investment. As announced last month, that question is now formally on the agenda, which is a very significant development. If mutual recognition does proceed, it would be sensible to make our anti-streaming rules as compatible as possible. This could obviously affect the outcome of this review.

"Even if mutual recognition were not to proceed, any moves to allow limited streaming in New Zealand would have to be discussed with Australia under our existing trans-Tasman imputation arrangements.

"The questions raised in the discussion document will be of particular interest to shareholders, charitable organisations, tax professionals, fund managers and others who are interested in developing New Zealand's capital markets. We urge them all to express their views on these important matters," Dr Cullen and Mr Dunne said.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Tax treaty developments: Czech Republic, Mexico, Austria, Netherlands Antilles

The new double tax agreement between the Czech Republic and New Zealand has come into effect, one of several tax treaty developments to take place this week.

"I welcome the entry into force of our new double tax agreement with the Czech Republic, which is our 35th such treaty," Revenue Minister Peter Dunne said today.

"Trade and investment between our two countries is growing, and there is excellent potential for further growth. New Zealand exports to the Czech Republic last year, consisting mainly of wool and lifting machinery, were worth $9.5 million. For the same period we imported over $30 million of goods – mainly cars, tyres, tools and electrical apparatus – from the Czech Republic.

"Double tax agreements are useful tax treaties that reduce tax impediments to trade and investment between two countries. They prevent double taxation, give greater tax certainty to people doing cross-border business, lower compliance costs and lower tax on some income.

"In a further development, an Order in Council adds Mexico and Austria to the list of our treaty partners who have access to the income tax exemption for gains made on the sale of shares in unlisted New Zealand companies by certain non-resident investors.

"Those are standard changes that simply remove any risk that gains on the values of those shares might be taxed here, thus removing a potential tax barrier to foreign venture capital investment into New Zealand.

"A second Order in Council incorporates into New Zealand law a new tax information exchange agreement with the Netherlands on behalf of the Netherlands Antilles.

"Tax information exchange agreements are bilateral international treaties that are designed to make it easier for tax administrations to detect and prevent tax avoidance.

They allow both parties to request of each other information such as tax records, business books and accounts, bank information and ownership information.

"The Netherlands Antilles agreement will come into force once the final diplomatic procedures have been completed, which is expected to occur in early October," Mr Dunne said.

The new double tax agreement with the Czech Republic and the two Orders in Council will be available at [www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz](https://www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz)

### Tax changes boost economy, encourage prosperity

Tax changes introduced to parliament today are crucial to boosting New Zealand's economy as financial uncertainty continues worldwide, and lifting New Zealand's long term growth rates Finance Minister Bill English said today.

The Taxation (Urgent Measures and Annual Rates) Bill includes personal income tax cuts and threshold changes, a new independent earner tax credit for low and middle income earners, changes to make KiwiSaver more affordable, and the repeal of the research and development tax credit.

"In the short term tax cuts will put money in New Zealanders' pockets just when it is needed to keep the economy going," Mr English said.

"In the longer term this package will encourage people to invest in their own skills to earn more money, because they'll have to pay less of it back in tax.

"We see this move as a step towards our goal to deliver a personal tax system that rewards effort and provides better incentives to get ahead.

"People know best what to do with their own money. They can choose to spend their tax cuts, pay off the mortgage, or invest the money for the future."

An element of the Tax Bill is the repeal of the research and development tax credit from the 2009-10 income year.

"We firmly believe in the importance of research and development to keep New Zealand internationally competitive, but the tax credits aren't the most effective way to ensure that," Mr English said.

"We will work with business to better target government expenditure on innovation."

Mr English stressed that the tax package was affordable. National's tax cuts do not add to government debt. The tax cuts are funded by the savings from changes to KiwiSaver, discontinuing the research and development tax credit, and replacing the previous government's proposed tax cuts.

The Bill is being progressed under urgency, and is expected to pass through the House tomorrow.

Information sheets on the changes to tax, KiwiSaver and the research and development tax credit are available from the [Beehive website](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/tax-changes-boost-economy-encourage-prosperity)

### Changes make KiwiSaver more affordable for all

KiwiSaver changes introduced to parliament today will make the scheme more affordable for members, employers and taxpayers, especially in the current economic climate Finance Minister Bill English said today.

The KiwiSaver changes are included in the Taxation (Urgent Measures and Annual Rates) Bill.

"The Bill includes changes to National's pre-election policy, restoring the member tax credit to a dollar-for-dollar subsidy up to $1040 for low and middle income earners. The government has decided to abolish the member fee subsidy of $40 per year to help manage the cost of this decision," Mr English said.

The main changes to KiwiSaver are:

*   The minimum member contribution rate will reduce from 4% to 2%, and 2% will be the default contribution rate for new employee members from 1 April 2009.
*   The member fee subsidy will be discontinued from 1 April 2009.
*   Compulsory employer contributions will be capped at 2% from 1 April 2009.
*   The employer tax credit will be discontinued from 1 April 2009.
*   The employer superannuation contribution tax exemption will be capped at the compulsory employer contribution of 2% from 1 April 2009. (That is equivalent to 2% of the employee's gross salary or wages.)
*   The KiwiSaver Act will be amended to make it clear that upon joining KiwiSaver, no employee can have their gross pay reduced as a result of employer contributions. This will ensure that when employees join KiwiSaver, the compulsory contributions from their employer are a genuine addition to their existing pay. The changes will also provide employers and employees with the ability to negotiate their own arrangements in good faith. The Employer Relations Act amendment relating to KiwiSaver will then be obsolete, and will be repealed from the date of assent of the Employment Relations Amendment Bill.
*   The KiwiSaver Act will also be amended to provide a limited exemption from compliance with securities and other related legislation for a limited period so that providers have time to update prospectuses and investment statements, for example.

"We have retained the main features that have made KiwiSaver a popular means of saving for a better standard of living in retirement – the member tax credit of up to $20 a week, the $1000 kick-start, mortgage diversion, deposit subsidy and the first-home withdrawal provisions. And we have ensured that it is a more affordable scheme for low income earners and a more sustainable scheme for New Zealand," Mr English said.

Moving from National's pre-election policy of the member tax credit matching the minimum member contribution rate of 2%, to matching dollar-for-dollar up to $1040, would have come at a cost of $791 million over five years. This would have meant the final tax and KiwiSaver package would have gone from saving $566 million to costing $225 million over five years.

To help manage this cost and to ensure the package is fiscally neutral, the government has decided to remove the member fee subsidy and reduce costs by $203 million. This brings the total net cost of the package over five years to $22 million.

The key features of the proposed new rules are an active income exemption, some accompanying measures to protect the tax base, and an exemption from tax of most foreign dividends paid to companies. Active income exemption • Comprehensive attribution of income from controlled foreign companies (CFCs) to New Zealand owners will be replaced by attribution of only passive income. This is intended to allow New Zealand residents with active businesses in foreign markets to compete on an equal footing with similar companies overseas and to remove incentives for residents to move their head offices offshore. Passive income, which may be easily moved between jurisdictions, will continue to be attributable to prevent a significant erosion of the tax base. • To reduce compliance costs in situations where risks to the tax base are not excessive, there are some exceptions from the requirement to attribute passive income. There will typically be no attribution of passive income for CFCs in Australia. There will also be an exception for CFCs that pass an “active business” test – no attribution of passive income will be required for CFCs if the passive income of the CFC is less than 5 percent of total income. The test may be undertaken using tax rules, or financial accounting information. It is expected that most active businesses will pass the test, and therefore not have to undertake a full calculation of attributable CFC income. • Passive income will include mainly interest, rent, royalties and dividends. Certain services income will be classified as passive income too, to prevent arbitrary reassignment of New Zealand earnings to an offshore jurisdiction. Income from speculative derivative instruments and derivatives that hedge passive income will also be passive income. • The calculation of net attributable income of a CFC will be based on the definition of passive income, with deductions permitted for the costs incurred in deriving that passive income. These rules will prevent deductions being taken for expenses incurred in deriving (untaxed) active income. Base protection measures • Interest allocation rules will be extended to cover New Zealand residents with outbound interests in CFCs. The interest allocation rules protect the domestic tax base from erosion by preventing an over-allocation of global interest costs against New Zealand operations. There are several safe harbours in the proposed rules which allow debt-funding for a large proportion of foreign investment to be deducted against the New Zealand tax base. The rules will apply only if companies with a significant international presence choose to heavily debt-finance their domestic operations but not their foreign ones. New Zealand residents who fund their offshore operations by debt also qualify for an “on-lending” concession. 4 • The existing “grey list” exemption from attribution of CFC income is being replaced with the active business exemption for CFCs in all countries, with one exception – as noted above, Australian CFCs will generally continue to be exempt from the requirement to attribute any income to New Zealand residents. At the same time, the conduit relief mechanism, which exempts from tax foreign-sourced income of New Zealand companies that is destined to be paid out to non-residents, is being effectively removed. The general “grey list” exemption and the conduit relief mechanism were a necessary part of a system of comprehensive CFC taxation, but are not appropriate when active CFC income is exempt. Foreign dividend exemption • Most dividends paid by a foreign company will be exempt from income tax when received by New Zealand companies. Dividends that are tax-deductible for the foreign company and dividends on fixed rate shares will remain taxable; in the case of fixed rate shares, this will be achieved by treating the shares generating the dividends as debt instruments for all purposes. • Foreign dividend payment accounts and branch equivalent tax accounts of companies will be made unnecessary under the proposed reform. It is intended that existing BETA debit balances and FDP credit balances will be able to carried forward for two and five years respectively, with legislation at a later date to finally repeal them. 5 ACTIVE BUSINESS TEST FOR CONTROLLED FOREIGN COMPANIES (Clauses 122, 123, 408 and 484) Summary of proposed amendments An “active business” test is being provided for CFCs engaged in active business. CFCs that pass the test will not be required to attribute any income to New Zealand residents. CFCs will pass the test if less than 5 percent of their gross income is passive income. Some insurance businesses may also qualify for a separate exemption. Application date 2009–10 and later income years. Key features An “active business” test is being provided for CFCs engaged in active business. CFCs that pass the test will not be required to attribute any income to New Zealand residents. CFCs that do not pass the test will have to attribute passive income to New Zealand residents, unless the CFCs are resident in Australia. A CFC passes the active business test if less than 5 percent of its gross income is passive income. Because the typical rate of return on assets that generate passive income is lower than the rate of return on assets generating active income, an average business could qualify for the exemption even if a substantial portion (one quarter to one-third) of its assets was generating passive income. To reduce compliance costs, gross income and passive income may be measured using adjusted financial accounting information. Audited accounts that comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) or New Zealand equivalents to IFRS may be used. Some smaller entities may use audited accounts prepared under pre- IFRS New Zealand financial reporting standards (“old GAAP”). CFCs in the same jurisdiction can in most cases be consolidated for the purposes of active business test calculations. Where suitable accounting information is not available, gross income and passive income can be calculated using tax principles. A CFC might also pass the active business test if it is an insurance business that applies to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue for a determination that its business is active. 6 Background The active business test is a key element of the proposed international tax reforms. A detailed proposal for an active business test was included in the October 2007 issues paper Developing an active income exemption for controlled foreign companies. The test is intended to significantly reduce compliance costs for the majority of residents with CFCs. It allows financial accounting information to be used to demonstrate that the CFCs are primarily engaged in active business. If this can be demonstrated, the CFCs will not be required to attribute any income, nor to undertake detailed calculations of net attributable income. Detailed analysis CFCs can pass the active business test if one or more of the following conditions are met: • their passive income is less than 5 percent of their gross income; or • they are an insurance business that applies for a determination that their business is active, and the determination is made that the business is active. Passive income less than 5 percent of gross income A CFC is not required to attribute income to New Zealand residents if the amount of its passive income divided by the amount of its gross income is less than 5 percent. The amount of passive income is referred to in this document as the “numerator” and the amount of gross income as the “denominator”. For the purposes of the calculation, either an adjusted financial accounting basis or a tax basis, but not both, may be used to calculate amounts of passive income and gross income. To use accounting information: • the CFC’s accounts must be audited and comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS); or • the CFC’s accounts must be included in consolidated accounts that are audited and comply with IFRS or New Zealand equivalents to IFRS or pre-IFRS New Zealand financial reporting standards (“old GAAP”). The intention is that accounting information will be drawn directly from the audited accounts. However, the requirements of the legislation must still be met, and the ability to use accounting information does not remove the requirement to ensure the information is correct for that purpose. If suitable accounting information is not available, or if the taxpayer chooses not to use it, then tax concepts are always available for calculating passive income and gross income. 7 The following sections provide more detail about the situations in which accounting information may be used, and the required calculations when using this information or the tax-basis information. When the IFRS basis may be used (IFRSE) The calculation may be undertaken using information from accounts that comply with IFRS (referred to in the legislation and henceforth in this commentary as “IFRSE”). International Financial Reporting Standards are standards (International Financial Reporting Standards and International Accounting Standards) issued or adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board, and revised from time to time. To use this option, the CFC must prepare audited accounts that comply with IFRSE, or its accounts must be part of audited consolidated accounts that comply with IFRSE. In the latter case, it is expected that information relating to the CFC will be drawn from consolidation worksheets and other similar sources. “Audited” in this case means audited by a member of the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants who is a Chartered Accountant, or by a person with similar overseas accreditation. If the audit has resulted in anything other than an “unqualified” or “except for” opinion, then the IFRSE option cannot be used. In the absence of an unqualified opinion, there is a strong likelihood that information drawn from the accounts would not meet the requirements of the legislation anyway. (As noted above, the ability to use accounting information does not override the requirement that it be correct for the purposes of the legislation.) When the NZIFRS basis may be used (IFRS) The calculation may be undertaken using information from accounts that comply with New Zealand equivalents to IFRS (for historical reasons these are referred to in the legislation as “IFRS”, and this terminology will be used henceforth). IFRS is a defined term in the Income Tax Act 2007, and means “a New Zealand Equivalent to International Financial Reporting Standard, approved by the Accounting Standards Review Board, and as amended from time to time or an equivalent standard issued in its place”. To use this basis, the CFC’s accounts must be part of audited consolidated accounts that comply with IFRS. It is expected that information relating to the CFC will be drawn from consolidation worksheets and other similar sources. (For the meaning of audited, see When the IFRS basis may be used (IFRSE).) A person who qualifies for and uses exemptions under the framework for differential reporting under IFRS, which applies only in New Zealand, cannot claim compliance with IFRS. Nevertheless, if the accounts would comply with IFRS but for such legitimate use of these exemptions, the IFRS basis may still be used. The reason for allowing this is that the exemptions primarily relate to disclosure requirements rather than measurement of amounts. This does not alter the requirement that the accounts be audited. 8 When the Old GAAP basis may be used (OGAAP) The calculation may be undertaken using information from accounts that comply with pre-IFRS New Zealand Financial Reporting Standards (referred to in this document as OGAAP, and in the legislation as generally accepted accounting practice without IFRS). These standards include currently applying Financial Reporting Standards (not international standards) issued by the Accounting Standards Review Board, and Statements of Standard Accounting Practice issued by the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, as amended from time to time. The OGAAP option is provided because certain small companies are not required to comply with IFRS until a review of reporting requirements for small and medium-sized enterprises is completed by the government. It is intended to be a temporary option and, depending on the outcome of the review, the option is expected to be removed or altered in future. Where IFRS accounts are available, they are preferred and are required to be used. To use the OGAAP option, the CFC’s accounts must be part of audited consolidated accounts that comply with OGAAP. It is expected that information relating to the CFC will be drawn from consolidation worksheets and other similar sources. (For the meaning of audited, see When the IFRS basis may be used (IFRSE).) This option is available only to the small or medium-sized companies that are not required to comply with New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) because of the forthcoming government review. The consolidated accounts in which the CFC’s accounts are included must be accounts of an entity that is in this situation. The Accounting Standard Review Board has indicated that for an entity not to be required to comply with IFRS for the time being, it must be a company that: • Is not an issuer, as defined in section 4 of the Financial Reporting Act 1993, in either the current or the preceding accounting period. • Is not required by section 19 of the Financial Reporting Act 1993, to file its accounts with the Registrar of Companies. • Is not large, as defined in section 19A(1)(b) of the Financial Reporting Act 1993. (Broadly speaking, a company is large if it has more than two of: consolidated assets of $10 million, consolidated turnover of $20 million, and consolidated employment of 50 people.) • Does not have an insurance business. • Does not prepare audited accounts, and is not required to prepare accounts (whether or not there is a requirement to audit) that comply with IFRS or IFRSE. • Is not a subsidiary of a company that prepares and audits, or is required to prepare (whether or not there is a requirement to audit) consolidated accounts that include the accounts of the subsidiary and that comply with IFRS or IFRSE. 9 Entities that qualify for and apply differential reporting exemptions under OGAAP may be able to use this option. If the accounts would comply with New Zealand generally accepted accounting practice and applicable financial reporting standards but for such legitimate use of these exemptions, the OGAAP basis may still be used. Many smaller firms are likely to qualify for differential reporting exemptions. This does not alter the requirement that the accounts be audited. Measurement of passive income under accounting-based methods Both the numerator and denominator to be calculated for the active business test are defined in section EX 21E, with reference to the applicable accounting standards. Which standards are the applicable accounting standards depends on the choice of accounting method (IFRS, IFRSE or OGAAP), which may be restricted, as above. The numerator is reported passive + added passive – removed passive. Within each of the three components of the numerator, no amount should be included more than once. Reported passive is intended to include passive income that arises under the applicable accounting standards. This includes interest, dividends, rent, royalties, income from a finance or operating lease, gains arising from financial assets other than derivatives (whether in profit and loss or in equity), insurance premiums and gains from property used to back insurance assets (whether in profit and loss or equity). Gains arising from financial assets other than derivatives may be fair value gains, gains on de-recognition (alienation) of the assets or foreign exchange gains from holding assets denominated in a foreign currency. These may be recorded, for accounting purposes, as items of income (in profit and loss) or directly as changes in equity. For the purposes of the test, gains are measured on a gross basis (not netted off against losses on similar assets or other losses of a similar nature). Losses on non-derivative financial assets are not included. Under IFRS and IFRSE, interest, dividends and royalties will typically arise under NZIAS 18 or IAS 18 (Revenue) but will still be in reported passive even if they do not. Lease and rental income will typically arise under IAS 17 (Leases). Insurance income, including gains from property used to back insurance assets, will arise under IFRS 4 (Insurance Contracts, which also refers to IAS 39). Gains arising from financial assets will typically arise under IAS 39 (Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement) or IAS 21 (The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates). 10 Example: Reported passive under IFRS/IFRSE The table below shows an example, for a hypothetical set of accounts, of the components of income that would be included in reported passive if using an IFRS or an IFRSE basis. Interest and dividends arising under IAS 18 are included in this item, though ordinary sales revenue is not. Finance income (interest) that is not revenue under IAS 18 for some reason is also included. Foreign exchange and fair value gains on a non-derivative financial asset are both included, even though one appears as an item that is part of profit and loss and the other affects equity directly. Revenue Sales revenue (sale of manufactured goods) Not passive Interest Passive Dividends Passive Other income Finance income Passive Foreign exchange gain on financial asset Passive Movements in equity Gain from increase in fair value of financial asset Passive Under OGAAP, interest, dividends, royalties and rent will typically be reported as part of operating revenue under FRS 9 (Information To Be Disclosed In Financial Statements). Gains arising from financial assets may also be included in operating revenue, or may be recorded directly in equity. FRS 21 (Accounting For the Effects of Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates) is the relevant standard for assessing foreign exchange gains. The OGAAP basis may not be used if the CFC has insurance business, and there should therefore be no income from insurance premiums or gains on property that is backing insurance assets. Example: Reported passive under OGAAP The table below shows an example, for a hypothetical set of accounts, of components of income that would be included in reported passive if using an OGAAP basis. Operating revenue Sales revenue (sale of manufactured goods) Not passive Interest Passive Dividends Passive Finance income Passive Foreign exchange gain on financial asset Passive Movements in equity Gain from increase in fair value of financial asset Passive It is intended that the items which make up reported passive will be interpreted under the relevant accounting standards, unless otherwise noted. 11 For example, interest, dividends and royalties have a particular meaning under IAS 18 (Revenue) when an IFRS basis is being used, and may (though are unlikely to) have a different meaning when an OGAAP basis is being used. However, as another example, whether an IFRS or an OGAAP basis is being used, “non-derivative financial asset” is to be interpreted using the definitions of “financial asset” and “derivative” in NZIAS 32 and NZIAS 39 respectively, since this is explicitly stated. If using an OGAAP basis, the relevant assets are identified using the definitions in the NZIASs, but amounts relating to those assets are then measured using OGAAP. Terms without a specific meaning under the relevant standards should be given their ordinary meaning under the accounting standards. Added passive is intended to include items that are not in reported passive but which are, in nature, passive income. For example, some services income may be from services performed in New Zealand, and therefore passive “base company” income. Income from some derivative instruments is also included. The items in added passive are measured using tax concepts and are (or would be) components of the attributable CFC amount under section EX 20B. These items are included only to the extent they are not already in reported passive. Removed passive is intended to include items that are also included in reported passive, as adjusted by added passive, but would not normally be part of passive income for tax purposes. Most of these items are measured using tax concepts under EX 20B. Income from a share that is not held on revenue account, whether a fair value gain or gain on de-recognition is also part of removed passive, because equities that are not held on revenue account are not typically taxed on an accrual basis or on sale. “Revenue account property” is to be interpreted using tax concepts and “de-recognition” is to be interpreted using NZIAS 39, no matter which accounting basis is used, but measurement of resulting income takes place under the relevant standards. The items in removed passive are included only to the extent they are already in reported passive as adjusted by added passive. Measurement of gross income under accounting-based methods The denominator in the active business test under EX 21E is reported revenue + added revenue – removed revenue. Within each of the three components of the denominator, no amount should be included more than once. Reported revenue includes operating revenue under OGAAP (defined in FRS 9). Under IFRS and IFRSE it includes revenue (for which IAS 18 or NZIAS 18 are the relevant standards), income from finance or operating leases (for which IAS 17 is the relevant standard), and income from an insurance business (for which IFRS 4 is the relevant standard). Under IFRS, IFRSE and OGAAP, reported revenue also includes gross gains arising from non-derivative financial assets, whether in the form of increases in fair value, gains on de-recognition or foreign exchange gains. “Non-derivative financial assets” and “de-recognition” are to be interpreted using the relevant definitions in NZIAS 32 and NZIAS 39 for both IFRS/E and OGAAP. But once assets and de-recognitions have been identified, measurement of the gains uses the relevant standards (which will not be IFRS for OGAAP). 12 Added revenue adds certain amounts that might have the character of taxable income for tax purposes but may not be included in the measure of reported revenue. These amounts are determined using tax concepts rather than accounting definitions or measurement. Amounts are added only to the extent that they are not already in reported revenue. Removed revenue includes certain amounts that were removed from the numerator under tax or accounting concepts, such as payments of passive income from an active CFC in the same jurisdiction. These should also be removed from the denominator. Removed revenue also includes: • income received from other CFCs which could be consolidated for the purposes of the active business test (also see Consolidation of CFCs for the purpose of the active income test); and • payments from CFCs which could not be consolidated if those payments were made with the purpose of increasing the denominator. These rules are designed to prevent the inflation of the denominator by, for example, repeated sales between associated CFCs. Where CFCs have been consolidated for the purposes of the test, many of these amounts will be removed in the consolidation and do not need to be removed again. Two CFCs will be treated, for the purposes of calculating removed revenue, as able to be consolidated even if they cannot actually be consolidated because appropriate accounts are not available. Further items included in removed revenue are: • Income from a derivative, if the derivative is not one referred to in section EX 20B(4)(b) and the derivative is not part of a hedging relationship or the income from the derivative is from the ineffective portion of a hedge. • Income from a derivative, if the derivative is one referred to in section EX 20B(4)(b), to the extent the amount included in reported revenue, as adjusted by added revenue, was less than the amount that would be calculated under EX 20B(4)(b). (Also see Treatment of derivative income when using IFRS, IFRSE or OGAAP.) • Gains on a liability, if the accounting basis is OGAAP, unless the gain is sales or service revenue in the normal course of business. Because of the broad nature of “operating revenue” under OGAAP, reductions in liabilities may sometimes be recorded as revenue. It is not intended that these be included in the denominator. An exception is made for sales or service income – this contemplates the situation in which an unearned income liability is reduced as a service is performed, leading to recognition of revenue. • Gains on a non-financial asset that is not revenue account property, if the accounting basis is OGAAP. Gains on non-financial assets that are not revenue account property, such as plant and equipment, may be included in “operating revenue” under OGAAP, but should not be included in the denominator. Such gains would not generally be taxable under tax principles. 13 Items are included in removed revenue only to the extent they are in reported revenue, as adjusted by added revenue. Measurement of passive income under the tax method Both the numerator and denominator to be calculated for the active business test under a tax basis are defined in section EX 21D. The numerator is the amount that would be calculated as the attributable CFC amount under section EX 20B, if the CFC was not a non-attributing active CFC. Measurement of gross income under the tax method The denominator under a tax basis is annual gross – adjustments. Annual gross is the gross annual income that would be calculated for the taxpayer under part C of the Income Tax Act 2007, excluding subpart CQ (Attributed income from foreign equity). The rules in section EX 21 apply when calculating this gross annual income, with the exception of the normal currency rules. (See Currency conversion when using the tax basis.) Adjustments include certain amounts received from associated CFCs: • interest, rental income or royalty income received from an associated active CFC in the same jurisdiction (also removed from the numerator); • royalty income received from any CFC, to the extent it is removed from the numerator; • sales and service income received from an associated CFC if the CFC could be consolidated for the purposes of the active business test; and • payments for sales and services received from an associated CFC that could not be consolidated for the purposes of the active business test, if the payments were made with the purpose of increasing the denominator. The last two items should be excluded from the denominator to prevent the denominator being artificially increased by trading between associates. Consolidation of CFCs for the purpose of the active income test To reduce compliance costs and provide flexibility, some or all CFCs within the same jurisdiction may be consolidated for the purposes of the active income test. Consolidation is permitted only for the purposes of the test; if a CFC does not qualify for an exemption from the requirement to attribute income, the calculation of attributable CFC income is always undertaken at the level of the individual CFC. There are pre-requisites for such consolidation. These differ depending on the basis used for the calculation. 14 For IFRS and IFRSE, consolidation is permitted when the CFCs are in the same jurisdiction and: • the accounts of all the CFCs are required by NZIAS 27 or IAS 27, as applicable, to be consolidated together; and • audited and consolidated accounts are actually prepared that comply with IFRS or IFRSE standards, as applicable; and • the taxpayer holds voting interests of 50 percent or more in each of the CFCs. For OGAAP, consolidation is permitted when the CFCs are in the same jurisdiction and: • the accounts of all the CFCs are required by FRS-37 to be consolidated together; and • audited and consolidated accounts are actually prepared that comply with applicable OGAAP standards; and • the taxpayer holds voting interests of 50 percent or more in each of the CFCs. For the tax basis, consolidation is permitted when the CFCs are in the same jurisdiction and the taxpayer holds voting interests of 50 percent or more in each of the CFCs. If consolidation is carried out using the tax basis, uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances should be used. All intragroup balances, transactions, income and expenses should be eliminated in full. The consolidation that is undertaken for this purpose is distinguished from the “consolidation rules” that are defined in section YA 1 and apply to wholly owned consolidated groups. When a group of CFCs is consolidated for the purposes of the test, the group (a “test group”) is effectively treated as a single CFC. This means that, for example, exemptions from attributable CFC income for interest, rent or royalty payments between CFCs are to be interpreted as exemptions only for transactions between the test group and CFCs that are not part of the test group. When a CFC in which the taxpayer has less than 100 percent interest is consolidated, any minority interest in the consolidation will be removed. Without this requirement, the income of the minority interest in an active CFC, which is not income in any sense of the taxpayer, could be used to shelter passive income attributed to the taxpayer. The requirement to remove any minority interest applies regardless of whether the accounting-based or tax-based versions of the test are being used. 15 Example: Removal of minority interest. NZ Ltd has a 60 percent interest in CFC 1 and a 100 percent interest in CFC 2, which are both Japanese residents. NZ Ltd prepares consolidated and audited accounts that comply with IFRS, and CFC 1 and CFC 2 are included in the consolidation. NZ Ltd chooses to group CFC 1 and CFC 2 in a test group for the purposes of the active income test. The top half of the table below shows that CFC 1 (if treated on its own) would have reported revenue, under EX 21E(10), of $3 million. CFC 2 would have reported revenue of $1 million. In the consolidated accounts prepared by NZ Ltd, $1 million of transactions between CFC 1 and CFC 2 that would be part of reported revenue are eliminated, giving reported revenue on a consolidated basis of $3 million ($3 million + $1 million – $1 million). The bottom half of the table shows how the requirement to remove the minority interest affects the consolidated revenue figure that would appear in consolidated financial statements. The $2 million figure at the bottom-right of the table is the one that should be used for the purposes of the active business test.

In general, it is intended that income from derivative instruments that are not hedging instruments, as well income from the ineffective portion of hedges, will be included in the numerator for the purposes of the active business test (since they have the character of passive income). In addition, it is intended to include all income from instruments that hedge (or effectively hedge) passive income. Income from hedges of active income is not generally intended to be included in the numerator. For example, if a company takes out a forward exchange rate contract when an export sale is made, to hedge any currency movements before settlement, income from the contract will generally not be included in passive income. The approach taken in the legislation is generally not to count derivative income at all when using accounting concepts, and then to adjust the accounting measure by adding in just the appropriate income from (passive) derivatives using tax concepts. 16 In practice, income from a cash flow hedge is usually included with income from the hedged item in IFRS or OGAAP accounts. For example, where export sale is hedged against exchange rate movements, the sale will typically be recorded at the forward exchange rate, implicitly including both the actual receipt from the sale and any gain on the forward contract. In the case of most hedges, this is appropriate. For a typical active hedge, revenue can be smoothed using hedges, and the smoothed figure can be used for the test. For a passive hedge of, say, interest, implicit inclusion of the hedge income in interest revenue will ensure it is counted as part of both the numerator and denominator, as intended. Revenue risks may arise if hedge income that should be passive income arises in the denominator under accounting concepts but not the numerator. For example, if hedge income from an interest rate swap is recorded separately from the interest income that is being hedged, but both are recorded under revenue in IFRS accounts, then the hedge income will be measured using accounting concepts in the numerator but will only be brought into the denominator using tax concepts. When combined with the ability to use the expected value method under tax concepts rather than the fair value method prescribed by IFRS, this may bias the test in favour of an “active” result. To prevent this, to the extent that income from a passive derivative instrument included in the denominator exceeds income from that derivative instrument calculated under tax concepts, the excess must be removed from the denominator. Currency conversion when using IFRS, IFRSE or OGAAP When using the accounts of the CFC to calculate the numerator and denominator, the functional currency of the CFC must be used. The term “functional currency” is interpreted using, and must meet the requirements of, the definition in IFRS (notably in NZIAS 21), whether an IFRS, IFRSE or OGAAP basis is being used. It is intended that if CFCs are being consolidated for the purposes of the active business test, all CFCs in the test group must have the same functional currency. When amounts are required to be translated from other foreign currencies to the functional currency of the CFC, such as when the CFC makes an export sale in the currency of the buyer, the exchange rate rules in the applicable standards must be used, with one exception (discussed in the following paragraph). In IFRS and IFRSE this requirement includes compliance with IAS 21 or NZIAS 21 (The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates). In OGAAP, it includes compliance with FRS 21 (Accounting for the Effects of Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates) and SSAP 21 (Accounting for the Effects of Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates). The exception to the normally applicable exchange rate rules is that exchange rate differences arising on a monetary item that forms part of a reporting entity’s net investment in a foreign operation will be ignored for the purposes of the active business test. The relevant accounting standards in both IFRS/IFRSE and OGAAP explain that a monetary item forms part of a reporting entity’s net investment in a foreign operation when it is receivable from or payable to a foreign operation (the CFC) but settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future, so that the item is, in substance, part of the parent’s net investment in the foreign operation. 17 When using consolidated accounts that include the accounts of the CFC to calculate the numerator and denominator, the currency in which the audited financial statements are presented must be used. Amounts expressed in the functional currency of the CFC must be converted to amounts in the presentation currency using an average exchange rate for the accounting period, rather than following the rules for conversion to presentation currency in the applicable standards. In any conversion to functional currency that takes place before conversion to presentation currency, the exchange rate rules in the applicable standards are used, with the same exception noted in the preceding paragraph: exchange rate differences arising on a monetary item that forms part of a reporting entity’s net investment in a foreign operation should be ignored. Currency conversion when using the tax basis When using the tax basis, all calculations will be done in the functional currency of the CFC. The meaning of “functional currency” is in line with the meaning under accounting standards. Once a “functional currency” is determined, it may not be changed without notifying the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. The choice of functional currency is restricted to prevent a currency being chosen to manipulate the active business test. There are similar (existing) restrictions on the choice of foreign currency when attributable CFC income is calculated; these were added following the discovery of schemes designed to reduce taxable income. Other than the requirement to use the functional currency of the CFC, the normal tax rules for exchange rate conversion apply when calculating the numerator and denominator, just as if the functional currency were New Zealand dollars. Determination of active insurance business New section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act provides a facility for insurance companies with offshore insurance CFCs to apply for a Commissioner’s determination. This determination can deem the insurance CFC to have passed the active business test (and thus to be treated as a non-attributing CFC under section EX 21B). A set of qualitative criteria will be used to gauge whether the insurance CFC qualifies as an active business. This measure is necessary as most types of insurance income will be regarded as passive income even when they are earned by an active insurance business. The Commissioner’s determination is intended as an interim measure until further work is done to consider the extension of the active income exemption to accommodate financial institutions. Financial CFCs are a special case because the types of income they generate from their core business activities (interest, premiums and investment income) are the same sorts of income that can be used to shift profits out of the New Zealand tax base (passive income). The government plans to consider special rules that would extend the active income exemption to active offshore insurance and financial businesses as part of the second stage of the reforms. 18 THE DEFINITION OF PASSIVE INCOME FOR CONTROLLED FOREIGN COMPANIES (Clauses 119 and 408) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment introduces a definition of “passive income”. Application date 2009–10 and subsequent income years. Key features The proposed amendment inserts a definition of passive income (referred to in the legislation as the attributable CFC amount), which is central to the new CFC rules. This definition may apply, in the first instance, in the active business test to decide whether a CFC is active or passive and thus whether the CFC should be exempt from attribution. (As noted above, a CFC may calculate whether or not it is under the 5 percent active business test threshold for passive income using tax concepts – see Measurement of passive income under the tax method). It is primarily used when a CFC fails the active business test. If this occurs, the CFC has to attribute its passive income as defined in the legislation (unless the CFC is resident in Australia) and will be subjected to New Zealand tax on that income. The broad categories of passive income are as follows: • dividends; • interest; • royalties; • rents; • other passive income (income from offshore insurance businesses, life insurance policies, personal services and the disposal of revenue account property); • certain income related to telecommunications services; and • base company services income. Background New Zealand currently taxes its residents on their share of all income (active and passive) earned by CFCs as that income accrues. Under the proposed international tax reforms, active income earned by a controlled foreign company (CFC) will be exempt from New Zealand tax. 19 In order to apply the exemption, a definition of passive income is required. The proposed definition of passive income is intended to cover types of income which are not location-specific and which can be easily moved across jurisdictions for tax purposes. The definition is relatively limited compared to that used in other countries, as it contains several important exclusions. This is expected to make it easier to pass the active business test and should help simplify the test for most companies. Detailed analysis Dividends (subsection EX 20B(3)(a)) Most types of dividends received by CFCs are excluded from being passive income and are therefore exempt from New Zealand tax. This mirrors the way in which these dividends would be treated if received directly by a New Zealand company. Dividends received by CFCs from foreign fixed-rate shares or dividends that are deductible in a foreign jurisdiction will be treated as passive income, as the non-taxation of these dividends would create risks to the tax base. Dividends received by CFCs from non-attributing portfolio FIFs will continue to be taxed, because otherwise there would be no tax on these investments. There are no grounds to tax these portfolio investments more lightly than other portfolio investments (for which a fair dividend rate of 5 percent must be paid). Dividends received by CFCs from New Zealand companies will also be treated as passive income to the extent that they are unimputed. Financial arrangement income and interest (subsections EX 20B(4), EX 20B(8)) The definition of passive income includes income from financial arrangements held by a CFC. Income from a financial arrangement that is not a derivative instrument is not passive income if the financial arrangement is: • a loan provided by the CFC to an associated active CFC in the same jurisdiction; or • an agreement for the sale or purchase of property or services or a hire purchase agreement that is entered in the ordinary course of business by the CFC or for property or services produced or used in the CFC’s business. Income from financial arrangements that are derivative instruments is passive if the derivative instrument is held for the purpose of dealing in the derivative instrument, is not entered in the ordinary course of the CFC’s business or is a hedge instrument for passive income or for a transaction that produces passive income. Financial arrangement income is included on a gross basis – if there is income under the financial arrangement for the accounting period it is included, but if there is expenditure it is not. There is no “netting off” of expenses incurred, nor of expenditure on similar classes of financial arrangement (but note that these may be allowed as deductions under other provisions – see Calculation of attributable income). 20 Dividends on fixed rate shares issued by a foreign company are treated as financial arrangement income, and are therefore included as passive income. Dividends that are deductible in a foreign jurisdiction are not financial arrangement income, unless they are dividends on fixed rate shares. However, they are treated as interest (see section CD 36B) and are part of passive income if received by a CFC. Royalties (subsections EX 20B(3)(d), EX 20B(5), EX 20B(9)) The proposed rules for the treatment of royalty income balance a number of competing considerations. On the one hand, it is desirable to minimise the impact the rules will have on legitimate commercial activity. On the other hand, there is a need to protect the domestic tax base and to take account of the lack of a general capital gains tax, a distinctive feature of the New Zealand tax system. The general rule provides that royalties (as defined in section CC 9 of the ITA 2007) are included within the definition of passive income unless they fall into one of four exceptions. These exceptions are as follows: 1. Third party active royalties This refers to royalties received by a CFC from a third party where: • the CFC has created, developed or added substantial value to the intellectual property; • the CFC is regularly engaged in that activity; and • the property does not have a prior link to New Zealand. 2. Same jurisdiction active royalties This refers to royalties received by a CFC from a related CFC where: • the related CFC is within the same jurisdiction as the CFC; • the related CFC would pass the active business test; and • the property does not have a prior link to New Zealand. 3. Related-party active royalties This refers to royalties received by a CFC from a related CFC where: • the CFC has created, developed or added substantial value to the intellectual property; • the CFC is regularly engaged in that activity; • the royalties are an arm’s length amount under transfer pricing rules; and • the property does not have a prior link to New Zealand. 21 4. Royalties from property owned by a New Zealand resident This refers to royalties received by a CFC from a third party where: • the intellectual property is owned by a New Zealand resident and licensed to the CFC; and • it is licensed between the New Zealand owner and the CFC for an arm’s length amount applying transfer pricing rules. Explanation Royalties are not regarded as passive income in situations where it is considered that there are genuine commercial reasons for the intellectual property to be owned by a CFC, that is, where the CFC has created, developed or added substantial value to the property. There is a further requirement that the CFC be regularly engaged in the creation or development of intellectual property to help ensure that it is located in the jurisdiction for genuine commercial reasons. Additionally, the intellectual property should not have a prior link to New Zealand. While there may be genuine commercial reasons for transferring intellectual property offshore from New Zealand, given that intellectual property by its nature is highly mobile and can be easily transferred and held offshore, royalties relating to intellectual property that was previously connected to New Zealand are treated as passive income under the proposed rules. Intellectual property will be considered as having a prior connection to New Zealand if it: • was owned by a New Zealand resident, or owned by a non-resident for the purposes of a business carried on in New Zealand through a fixed establishment in New Zealand; • was created or developed in New Zealand or to which substantial value was added in New Zealand; • has given rise to a deduction in New Zealand for any expenditure or loss incurred in acquiring the property; • is property that is created or developed through the extension, continuation, development or completion of activities that also resulted in knowledge that has given rise to a deduction in New Zealand for expenditure or loss incurred in acquiring the knowledge; • is based on knowledge that has given rise to a deduction in New Zealand for expenditure or loss incurred in acquiring the knowledge and was acquired with a purpose of creating or developing the property. However, royalties may be exempt where they are derived from intellectual property that is retained in New Zealand and licensed to a CFC, which may then sublicense the property to a third party offshore. This is because the intellectual property remains within the New Zealand tax base (and the business carried on by the CFC is assumed to be active). 22 There is a further “same jurisdiction” exception which is designed to ensure that the active income exemption is not clawed back when active royalties are paid to holding companies in the same jurisdiction as the CFC. The intellectual property from which the royalties are derived must not have a prior link to New Zealand in order for this exception to apply. Rents (subsections EX 20B(3)(e), EX 20B(6)) The general rule is that rent earned by a CFC will be treated as passive income. However, it is recognised that rent is often associated with the carrying on of an active business. For example, a CFC may be in the business of letting or it may hold property used by related CFCs for the purposes of carrying on an active business and receive rental income from those CFCs. Moreover, in practice, it can be difficult to distinguish between active and passive rental income. Therefore rent from third parties will be treated as active income if it is derived from a lease of real or personal property in the same jurisdiction as the CFC. The principle underlying this exclusion is that there should be a nexus between the jurisdiction in which the CFC is located and the source of income (in this case, the property from which the rents are derived). This is to prevent sheltering of profits from taxation by shifting profits from the rental property either from New Zealand to a low-tax jurisdiction or another high tax jurisdiction to a low tax jurisdiction. Additionally, rent received by a CFC from a related CFC is not included in the definition of passive income when the related CFC would pass the active business test, as long as both CFCs are resident in the same jurisdiction. The rules above apply to rents from: • a lease or sublease of land; • a lease or sublease of personal property; • a licence to use intangible property; • a hire or bailment. Payments under hire purchase agreements and finance leases and payments that fall within the definition of “royalty” under section CC 9 of the ITA are not considered as rent under the definition of passive income, but may be – and are likely to be in some cases – passive income under other provisions. Other passive income The definition of passive income includes types of income other than dividends, interest, royalties and rents. These types of income relate to: • offshore insurance businesses; • life insurance policies; • personal services; • the disposal of revenue account property. 23 It is necessary to treat these income categories as passive to prevent New Zealand income from being shifted offshore. Other comparable jurisdictions, such as Australia and the United States, also include these categories of income as passive under their CFC rules. Income from offshore insurance business (subsection EX 20B(3)(f)) There are two types of insurance income: premiums from insurance contracts and investment income (change in revenue account property). Both of these are types of income are included in passive CFC income as insurance contracts can be used to shift New Zealand-sourced income offshore and CFCs can be used to hold investments on behalf of a New Zealand investor. However, in many cases these types of income will form a core part of an active offshore insurance business. For this reason a Commissioner’s determination process has been provided (see Determination of active insurance business) to enable active insurance CFCs to be deemed to have passed the active business test (and be treated as a non-attributing CFC). This is intended as a temporary measure until special rules are considered for extending the active income exemption to financial institutions. Income from life insurance policies (subsection EX 20B(3)(g)) Life insurance policies are typically treated as passive assets under CFC rules that have an active/passive distinction. Accordingly, income a CFC derives from holding a life insurance policy is treated as passive under the proposed rules. Additionally, net gains from the disposal of a life insurance policy are also passive to the extent that these policies are on revenue account. Income from life insurance policies that are FIF interests is not treated as passive under the CFC rules, as that income is already attributed under the FIF rules. Net gains from the disposal of such interests will continue to be passive where the net gain is not taxable under the FIF rules. Income from personal services (subsection EX 20B(3)(h)) Sections GB 27 to 29 of the Income Tax Act 2007 contain an attribution rule for income from personal services that applies domestically to ensure that individuals pay the 39% tax rate in respect of annual income exceeding $60,000 that arises from their personal effort when they use an intermediary to shelter that income. The rule attributes income earned by an interposed entity to the individual (“working person”) who provides the personal services when five criteria are met: • The working person and the entity are associated persons. • At least 80 percent of the entity’s gross income from personal services during the tax year is derived from one buyer. • At least 80 percent of entity’s gross income from personal services during the tax year relates to services personally performed by the working person (or a relative of the person). 24 • The working person’s net income for the tax year in which an attribution would be made is over $60,000. • Substantial business assets are not a necessary part of the business structure that is used to derive the income from personal services. The domestic rule should already cover the situation where a New Zealand-resident individual provides personal services offshore through a CFC. However, the criteria above have been modified to deal with the problems that arise in the cross-border context. The domestic attribution rule is aimed primarily at situations where an entity is interposed into a de facto employer/employee relationship between a buyer and a working person in order to avoid the 39% personal income tax rate. In the context of reformed CFC rules, the concern is that a New Zealand resident uses a CFC to avoid tax on income from personal effort. The threshold for the top rate of personal income tax and the existence of employer/employee relationship are less relevant. Accordingly, income from personal services will be treated as passive where: • The individual and the CFC are associated persons under section YB 5 (Company and non-corporate 25 percent interest holder) or the individual is a relative of a person associated with the CFC under section YB 5 at the time the services are performed. (The references to YB 5 will become references to YB 3 when new associated persons rules commence.) • At least 80 percent of the CFC’s gross income from personal services during the tax year relates to services personally performed by the individual (or a relative of the individual). • Substantial business assets are not a necessary part of the business structure that is used to derive the income from personal services. (By this it is meant that, to derive the income, the CFC uses depreciable property that, at the end of the accounting period, has a total cost of more than either $75,000 or 25 percent or more of the CFC’s total assessable income from services performed in that period.) The individual is exempt from attribution under the domestic personal services rule in certain cases, as specified under subsection GB 27(3). The only exception that is relevant in the CFC context is when the services personally performed by the individual are essential support for a product supplied by the associated entity. This is because the provision is not intended to apply to income earned from services that are provided in relation to the sale of goods by a CFC. Therefore income from personal services is not treated as passive if the services are essential support for a product supplied by the CFC. Income from the sale of shares (subsection EX 20B(3)(i)) The general principle is that income from the sale of shares held by CFCs should have the same tax treatment as if those shares were held directly by a New Zealand company. 25 New Zealand generally does not tax capital gains. For this reason income from the sale of shares on capital account is excluded from CFC income. Income from the sale of shares that are on revenue account is passive CFC income, although there are some exceptions to this. Revenue account gains are disregarded when a CFC sells an interest in a FIF whose income is calculated using either the comparative value, the deemed rate of return, the fair dividend rate or the cost method. This is consistent with the way in which these gains would be treated if held directly by a New Zealand company. Income from the disposal of revenue account property (subsection EX 20B(3)(j)) Gains from the disposal of revenue account property held by a CFC that is not used in an offshore active business will be treated as passive income. However, this rule does not apply to income from the disposal of revenue account property if the property is a share, financial arrangement or life insurance policy, as these items are dealt with specifically in other parts of the definition of passive income. Base company income (subsection EX 20B(3)(k)) It is not intended that the active income exemption be used to reclassify what is essentially New Zealand-sourced income as foreign-sourced income. Arrangements which interpose a CFC between a service-performing entity in New Zealand and the party purchasing the service could be used to achieve such a reclassification. The “base company” income rule is designed to prevent this. Under the “base company” income rule, income derived by a CFC for a service that is wholly or partly performed in New Zealand is passive income of the CFC. The proposed base company rule is significantly less restrictive than the version announced for public consultation in 2007. International telecommunications services are excluded from the base company income rule because of the difficulty of determining where a telecommunications service is performed, and because international telecommunications services have a logical connection with at least two jurisdictions. Income from telecommunications services (subsections EX 20B(3)(l)–(m)) Certain income from telecommunications services is passive income. Income from the use of a telecommunications asset outside any country Income derived from the use of a telecommunications asset that is wholly or partly located outside any country will be passive income. Such income shares with other types of passive income the characteristic that it can be assigned to an arbitrary jurisdiction. This rule will only apply if the asset is owned by the CFC or an associate, and that where only part of the asset is located outside any country, apportionment will be required. 26 Assets that would be subject to the new rule include (but are not limited to) telecommunications cables, satellites, and associated plant, equipment and facilities. It is not intended that a cellphone handset or transmitting equipment located on board a ship or aircraft would be subject to the rules. The types of income that would be derived from the use of a telecommunications asset include (but are not limited to) income from the transmission of telecommunications data using the asset; the lease of the asset; and the license or sale of rights – whether direct or indirect – to use the asset. Income when telecommunications services performed in New Zealand Income from the provision of telecommunications services is excluded from the application of the base company income rule if the CFC or a person holding a 50 percent or greater interest in the CFC is a network operator for the purposes of the Telecommunications (Interception Capability) Act 2004. This means that, in general, income from providing telecommunications services will not be passive income even if some of the service is performed in New Zealand. However, the income will still be passive income if the service is not the delivery of telecommunications traffic from the CFC’s jurisdiction to New Zealand. This is to prevent activities being reclassified to avoid the base company rule. The income will also be passive income, whether or not traffic is being delivered between the CFC’s jurisdiction and New Zealand, to the extent that the service is performed using equipment or staff of the CFC or of an associated CFC, that are located in New Zealand. Note that the residence or “source” rules may in any event apply in this situation to tax the income derived. Exclusions for rent, royalties and interest received from an associated CFC in the same jurisdiction As noted in the sections above, certain rent, royalties and financial arrangement income from associated active CFCs in the same jurisdiction as the CFC is excluded from passive income. There is a possibility that the status of the associated CFC cannot be determined, because the associated CFC itself needs to apply the same exclusions. Example: inability to determine active status of associated CFC CFC A and CFC B are 100 percent commonly owned and are both resident in the same jurisdiction. When it applies the active business test, CFC A has a numerator of $49,990 and a denominator of $1 million, but only if it can exclude royalties of $50,000 received from CFC B. CFC B has a numerator of $99,980 and a denominator of $2 million, but only if it can exclude interest of $100,000 received from CFC A. CFC A can only exclude the royalties if CFC B is active, and CFC B can only exclude the interest if CFC B is active, but neither CFC is active until it applies the exclusion. 27 To provide a resolution, when a CFC (CFC A) determines the status of an associated CFC (CFC B), it will do so without applying any of the exclusions to CFC B. That is, for this purpose only, CFC B’s status is to be determined assuming that any rent, royalties or interest it receives from an associated CFC in the same jurisdiction is passive income. In the example above, CFC A would determine that CFC B’s numerator was $199,980 and its denominator was $2,100,000, meaning that CFC B would not be active for this purpose. CFC A would then have to recognise the $50,000 of royalties as passive income. Similarly, CFC B would be required to recognise the $100,000 of interest as passive income. 28 CALCULATION OF ATTRIBUTABLE INCOME FOR CONTROLLED FOREIGN COMPANIES (Clauses 25, 66, 117-119, 121, 122, 191, 220, 221, 253 and 408) Summary of proposed amendment Several amendments concern the mechanics of calculating and attributing a CFC’s income or loss to its New Zealand-resident shareholders holding non-portfolio income interests. They make changes to the rules about income and expenditure to reflect the fact that, under the new system, income derived by a CFC from the conduct of an active offshore business will no longer be subject to attribution. Application date The amendments will apply for 2009–10 and later income years. Key features The proposed amendments replace existing references to, and rules about, the branch equivalent income of a CFC with new rules about the calculation of net attributable CFC income. Net attributable CFC income is the income of a CFC that will be subject to attribution to New Zealand shareholders under the new rules. Some CFCs will not be subject to attribution on any of their income (including any net attributable CFC income). The starting point for calculating net attributable CFC income is to determine the attributable CFC amount. (This term is discussed elsewhere in the commentary. In broad terms, it refers to the CFC’s gross passive income plus any net income from financial arrangements. It is generally referred to in this document as “passive income”.) The amount is then reduced to reflect expenditure incurred by the CFC. Generally speaking, deductions for expenditure will be allowed for these purposes only if it is incurred by the CFC in deriving an attributable amount. Special rules apply to interest expenditure incurred by a CFC because of difficulties associated with matching debt to particular income streams. Expenditure incurred by CFCs under financial arrangements that provide funds to the CFC will be subject to apportionment. Expenditure incurred under financial arrangements that do not provide funds to the CFC, such as derivative instruments, will be either deductible or non- deductible, according to whether any income derived from the arrangement would be included as an attributable CFC amount. Transitional rules will apply to attributed CFC net losses and foreign tax credits under subpart LK carried forward from 2008–09 and earlier years into the new rules. The effect of the transitional rules is intended to be to continue to reduce these historical amounts by reference to total CFC net income (including non-attributable income). 29 Background Under existing law, the branch equivalent income or loss of a CFC is attributed to its New Zealand shareholders in proportion to their income interest in the CFC. Broadly, branch equivalent income is calculated by applying the provisions of the Act as though the CFC were New Zealand-resident, subject to certain modifications. Similar rules will apply under the new system. Modifications are needed, however, because only a subset of a CFC’s income will be subject to attribution. In addition, some CFCs will not be subject to attribution on any of their income. Transitional rules will apply to historical losses and foreign tax credits carried forward into the new rules, on account of the fact that these historical amounts reflect a broader measure of attributable income than that which will apply under the new system. Detailed analysis Sections CQ 2 and DN 2 are amended, replacing references to branch equivalent income or loss with references to the narrower concept of net attributable CFC income or loss. This narrower measure of income will be the basis for attribution under the new rules. These sections are also amended to provide that attributed CFC income or loss does not arise for a taxpayer when a CFC is a non-attributing active CFC (being a CFC that satisfies the active business test) or a non-attributing Australian CFC. New section EX 20C (Definition of net attributable CFC income or loss) is inserted. Net attributable CFC income or loss provides the basis for attribution to resident shareholders under the new rules, much as branch equivalent income or loss does under the existing system. Net attributable CFC income or loss is the CFC’s attributable CFC amount (calculated under new section EX 20B) less the CFC’s allowable expenditure. Expenditure incurred under financial arrangements is discussed below. Other expenditure will be deductible for the purposes of calculating net attributable CFC income if it satisfies the usual criteria about deductibility under Part D of the Act, applied as if the CFC were a New Zealand resident. In addition, there must be a nexus between the expenditure and an attributable CFC amount. Accordingly, expenditure incurred by a CFC in deriving non-attributable (active) income will not be deductible, even if it would otherwise be allowed. Expenditure incurred under financial arrangements that provide funds to the CFC will be deductible according to the proportion, by value, of the CFC’s assets that produce an attributable CFC amount. Thus, a CFC that uses, say, half its assets to earn passive income will be able to set half its interest expenditure against that income when calculating net attributable CFC income. As a backstop against structures concentrating debt in mainly passive CFCs to maximise allowable deductions, interest apportionment for CFCs that are excessively debt funded will be undertaken by reference to the assets of all the CFCs of the taxpayer under new section EX 20D (Adjustment of fraction for excessively debt funded CFC). A CFC will be regarded as excessively debt funded if its debt percentage is greater than 75 percent and also greater than 110 percent of the worldwide group debt percentage, under rules similar to the general interest allocation rules in subpart FE. 30 Transitional rules There are transitional rules for the treatment, under the new system, of attributed CFC net losses and foreign tax credits arising under the existing (pre-2009–10) rules. As indicated in the officials’ issues paper published in December 2007, the intended effect to those rules is generally to set historical losses and credits against total branch equivalent income from CFCs, rather than just passive income, consistent with the approach that obtained when these amounts were accumulated. 31 INTEREST ALLOCATION RULES FOR OUTBOUND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT (Clauses 154-174 and 408) Summary of proposed amendments Amendments are made to subpart FE of the Income Tax Act 2007 to extend the existing interest allocation rules to New Zealand residents. Application date The proposed amendments will apply for the 2009–10 and later income years. Key features Interest allocation rules have been extended to New Zealand residents that have an income interest in a CFC, unless they have: • 90 percent or more of their assets in New Zealand; or • less than $250,000 of interest deductions. The interest allocation rules for New Zealand residents are integrated into the existing rules that apply to non-residents. New Zealand residents are required to apportion their interest deductions if their New Zealand group debt percentage ratio is greater than 75 percent, or 110 percent of their worldwide group debt percentage, whichever is higher. Amendments are made to the definition of “debt” and “assets” for the purpose of calculating the New Zealand group debt percentage and the worldwide group debt percentage. Under the amended rules: • fixed rate shares issued to New Zealand taxpayers are treated as debt and investments in CFCs are not counted as assets for the purpose of calculating the New Zealand group debt percentage; and • the definition of debt for the worldwide group has been aligned with the definition of debt for the New Zealand group Background The government announced in the 2007 Budget that interest allocation rules would be an integral part of the international tax review package. These rules are intended as a base protection measure to prevent New Zealand residents with international businesses from allocating an excessive amount of their global interest costs against the New Zealand tax base. 32 The interest allocation rules for New Zealand residents have been designed to have an adverse impact only on businesses that have allocated excessive amounts of their global interest costs to New Zealand. New Zealand resident companies that are primarily domestic or have a small interest deduction are exempt from the rules. The rules also contain a number of safe harbours and an “on-lending” concession, which allow businesses to avoid any potential adverse impact of the rules by shifting debt to their foreign operations. Detailed analysis Who has to apply the interest allocation rules Amendments have been made to extend the existing interest allocation rules to New Zealand resident companies, individuals and trustees that have an income interest in a CFC (that is, the outbound entities). However, these New Zealand residents are exempt from the rules if: • their total New Zealand group assets are 90 percent or more of their worldwide group assets; or • their New Zealand group’s interest deduction is less than $250,000 and they do not have any income interest in a CFC that derives rent from land in the country or territory in which the CFC is resident. The other safe harbours that apply to non-residents under the existing rules will also apply to the outbound entities. The outbound entities will not have to apportion their interest deductions if they have a New Zealand group debt percentage ratio that is within the 75 percent safe harbour. Outbound companies and trustees that exceed the 75 percent threshold will be further protected if their New Zealand group debt percentage ratio is less than 110 percent of their worldwide group debt percentage ratio. Determination of New Zealand group The outbound entities will apply the interest allocation rules on the basis of their “New Zealand group”. The New Zealand group of outbound individuals and trustees includes all associated persons who are residents in New Zealand or carrying on business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment in New Zealand or that have New Zealand source income that is taxable in New Zealand. Outbound companies will determine their New Zealand group by reference to their New Zealand parents. New Zealand parents of outbound companies are identified by tracing ownership interests up the chain of upper-tier companies on a tier-by-tier basis. The tracing stops when no other New Zealand resident company has a 50 percent or more direct ownership interest in the company at the top of the chain. The New Zealand- resident company at the top of this chain is the New Zealand parent of the outbound companies. Ownership interests include direct and indirect ownership interests as defined in sections FE 38 to FE 41 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 33 The New Zealand group of an outbound company contains those companies for which control can be traced from the company’s New Zealand parent company. In accordance with existing rules, the New Zealand parent can choose “more than 50 percent” or “66 percent or more” as the control threshold. “Control” is defined in section FE 27 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Outbound individuals and trustees are not included in the New Zealand group of outbound companies. However, special rules are provided to require outbound companies or groups of companies that are owned by the same person to be included in the same New Zealand group. Determination of worldwide groups Outbound companies and trustees may need to determine their worldwide group to determine their worldwide group debt percentage. The worldwide group of outbound companies is made up of the companies, the companies’ New Zealand group and all non-residents who are required to be included with the company in consolidated financial statements under generally accepted accounting practice. The worldwide group of outbound trustees includes the trustees, the trustees’ New Zealand group and all non-residents who are required to be included with the trustees in consolidated financial statements under generally accepted accounting practice. Measurement rules The existing measurement rules will apply to the outbound entities for the purpose of calculating total group debt and total group assets of their New Zealand group and worldwide group. In particular, the New Zealand group debt percentage ratio can be calculated on different measurement dates (section FE 8) and different valuation bases can be used to measure total group assets (section FE 16). The on-lending concession in section FE 13 will also apply to any arm’s length debt provided by the outbound entities to its CFCs. Amendments are made to the definition of debt and assets for the purpose of calculating the New Zealand group debt percentage and the definition of debt for the purpose of calculating the worldwide group debt percentage. These amended rules will apply to the outbound entities and non-residents that are covered by the interest allocation rules: • Fixed rate shares issued by an outbound entity and held by New Zealand residents will be treated as debt for the purpose of the amended interest allocation rules. As a result, any dividend from these fixed rate shares will also be subject to apportionment under section FE 6 of the Income Tax Act 2007. • The definition of “total group assets” has been amended to exclude equity investments in CFCs. These investments would not be counted as New Zealand assets under the amended interest allocation rules. • The definition of debt for the worldwide group has been aligned with the definition of debt for the New Zealand group. As such, non-interest bearing liabilities and liabilities that do not provide funds will no longer be treated as debt even if they are included as debt under generally accepted accounting practice. Minor remedial amendments have also been made to ensure that the rules operate properly for non-residents with New Zealand-source income. 34 FOREIGN DIVIDEND EXEMPTION FOR COMPANIES (Clauses 5, 6, 13, 16, 19, 30, 32, 53, 54, 55, 98, 122, 126, 132, 176-178, 184, 189, 190, 192, 195, 199, 200, 254, 273, 277, 286-288, 290-295, 299-304, 306, 316-322, 330, 332, 340, 342-348, 350, 352, 353, 361-367, 370, 373-376, 391, 392, 396, 398, 408, 409, 433, 434, 452, 468, 469, 483, 486, 487, 489, 496, 497, 500, 501, 505-507, 512, 514 and 515) Summary of proposed amendments The bill provides an exemption from tax when most foreign dividends are received from companies. This simplifies the taxation of foreign dividends. Application date The amendments will apply for 2009–10 and later income years. Key features Most foreign dividends will be exempt from tax when received by companies. Dividends on fixed-rate shares and deductible dividends will be regarded as interest payments and continue to be taxed. Dividends from non-attributing portfolio FIFs will also be taxed. The foreign dividend exemption will not be available to qualifying companies because they will not be permitted to hold attributing interests in CFCs or non-portfolio FIFs. BETA and FDP memorandum accounts will become unnecessary over time, and the government intends to introduce legislation at a later date to repeal them completely. Background Under the current rules, dividends from CFCs and non-portfolio foreign investment funds (FIFs) are taxed, but a BETA credit is provided where the income has already been taxed on accrual in order to prevent double New Zealand taxation of the same income. Under the proposed changes, BETA credit accounts of companies will be replaced by a dividend exemption for most types of foreign dividends, and the reclassification of foreign fixed rate share and deductible dividends as interest. This prevents double- taxation of income without the need for complex apportionment accounts for companies (currently known as branch equivalent tax accounts and foreign dividend payment accounts). This allows for simplification of the international tax rules. 35 Detailed analysis The bill replaces the existing taxation of foreign dividends (which allows a credit for tax paid on attributed foreign income and underlying foreign tax) with an exemption for most types of foreign dividends received by New Zealand companies. Foreign dividend payments and the underlying foreign tax credit are being abolished – this involves repealing provisions in subparts LL and RG, and modifying other parts of the Act. Dividends received by companies from foreign fixed-rate shares or where the dividend is deductible in a foreign jurisdiction will continue to be taxed as the non-taxation of these dividends would create opportunities for tax planning. 1 New section CD 36B redefines dividends received by companies from foreign fixed- rate shares and dividends which are deductible in a foreign jurisdiction as interest payments. This means that these payments will continue to be taxed but the CFC or (in certain cases) FIF making the payment will be allowed a deduction for the amount of the payment for New Zealand tax purposes. This eliminates the potential for double New Zealand taxation. In addition, foreign fixed rate shares will come into the financial arrangements rules, so will be effectively treated as debt for tax purposes (including interest allocation), as opposed to equity. Dividends from non-attributing portfolio FIFs will become subject to income tax. It is appropriate to continue to tax these dividends as otherwise there would be no tax on these investments. There are no grounds to tax these portfolio investments more lightly than other portfolio investments (for which a Fair Dividend Rate of 5 percent of the share value must be paid). Section CW 9 is modified so that dividends from non- attributing portfolio FIFs become subject to income tax. The foreign dividend exemption will not be available to qualifying companies. This is in line with existing rules, under which a qualifying company does not receive underlying foreign tax credits. This is to be achieved in the new rules by terminating the “qualifying” status of companies that hold non-portfolio interests in CFCs or FIFs. Memorandum accounts Numerous provisions in Part O of the Act are repealed or amended in order to limit the application of FDP accounts and company BETA accounts with debit balances. The effect of these amendments will be to prevent further BETA debits and FDP credits being generated, and to prevent BETA credits being used to reduce any liability for tax on foreign dividends. 1 For example, fixed rate shares could be used as a loan substitute to avoid New Zealand tax on interest received from a (non-attributing) foreign firm. 36 Remaining credit balances in company BETA accounts will be cancelled immediately, but company BETA debit balances can be carried forward and used for a period of two years. FDP credit balances can be utilised for five years, after which any remaining FDP credits will convert to imputation credits. The transitional period for BETA debits is intended only to prevent double taxation in the rare cases in which dividends have been paid significantly in advance of attributed passive income arising. BETA debits will be applied against total branch equivalent income (not just passive income), consistent with the approach that applied when the debits were accumulated. The government intends that legislation to finally repeal FDP and BETA accounts after the transitional period will be introduced as part of a later tax bill. 37 OTHER INTERNATIONAL TAX MEASURES – CHANGES TO CONDUIT TAX RELIEF AND THE GREY LIST (Clauses 17, 25, 26, 60, 66, 67, 80, 118, 122, 124, 125, 138, 147, 175, 193, 251, 255, 269, 308-315, 354-360, 408 and 488) Summary of proposed amendments The bill effectively prevents further conduit tax relief arising under the conduit mechanism. The conduit mechanism currently removes income tax on income that a New Zealand company receives from its foreign direct investments to the extent that the New Zealand company is owned by non-residents. The bill also removes the grey list tax exemption for CFC income in eight countries as this is being replaced by an active business test (see Active business test) and an Australian exemption. Application date The amendments will apply for the 2009–10 and later income years. Key features Sections LQ 1-LQ 4 are being repealed to prevent further conduit relief arising. Numerous provisions in section OD and subpart FF are being repealed or amended to ensure that no new conduit tax relief (CTR) credits are generated and to remove the tax liability that arises from CTR debits. CTR companies will be able to continue to attach CTR credits to any dividends they distribute to their non-resident shareholders, for a period of two years. The government intends that the legislation to remove the remaining vestiges of the conduit relief mechanism after two years will be included in a future tax bill. The current exemption for CFCs resident in eight grey list countries is removed and an exemption for a CFC resident in Australia is introduced. The eight-country grey list for 10 percent or greater interests in FIFs will be retained for the time being, while extending the active income exemption to these entities is considered. 38 Background New Zealand currently taxes New Zealand residents on their worldwide income. This includes any income earned by a foreign company that is controlled by New Zealand residents (a CFC). The only exceptions are that all income of a CFC in one of eight “grey list” countries is exempt and that “conduit” companies can get tax relief on their foreign-sourced income to the extent that they are owned by non-residents. The grey list and conduit exemptions were intended to reduce compliance costs and provide relief in the context of a system where there was full accrual all types of foreign-sourced income. With the introduction of an active income exemption and accompanying active business test as a compliance-saving filter for CFCs with less than 5 percent passive income, CFCs will attribute only passive income. Passive income comprises those types of income which are not location-specific and which can be easily moved across jurisdictions for tax purposes. For this reason there is a much weaker argument to retain the conduit and grey list exemptions for passive income only. Detailed analysis Repeal of conduit tax relief The bill effectively prevents further conduit tax relief arising under the conduit mechanism. Conduit tax relief in its current form The conduit rules remove income tax on income that a New Zealand company receives from its foreign direct investments to the extent that the New Zealand company is owned by non-residents. Conduit income is still subject to non-resident withholding tax when distributed by the New Zealand company to its non-resident shareholders. The conduit rules become unnecessary for active income, since the conduit exemption is, in effect, being replaced by the active income exemption and the exemption for dividends from CFCs and FIFs. The policy arguments for relieving tax on active income do not extend to passive income. Moreover, our experience shows that tax base risks arise from conduit treatment in relation to passive income. A major reason for introducing conduit rules was to allow a New Zealand-based subsidiary to act as the regional headquarters for subsidiaries in other jurisdictions without adverse tax consequences. This provides economic benefits to New Zealand by creating and retaining management expertise and valuable head office functions in New Zealand. The same cannot generally be said about a passive investment held by a New Zealand subsidiary. Retaining conduit rules for passive income would expose the tax base to significant risk. 39 Conduit tax relief accounts Every company that elects to become a “conduit tax relief company” must maintain a conduit tax relief credit account (CTRA). The purpose of the CTRA is to ensure that conduit tax relief is passed through to the non-resident owners of the New Zealand company. It achieves this result by tracking the amount of conduit tax relief provided to the conduit tax relief company, by way of conduit credits. A company’s conduit credit balance is reduced when the company distributes the conduit relieved income to the foreign shareholders by way of a dividend. Consequently, a positive balance in the CTRA reflects the fact that income has been relieved from income tax but not yet been paid through to the foreign shareholders of the conduit tax relief company. That credit balance can crystallise into a current year tax liability (in whole or in part) if the New Zealand entity significantly increases its level of New Zealand shareholders. That is because it would be contrary to the policy objectives underpinning conduit for the tax relief to be accessible to New Zealand shareholders. Submissions by taxpayers have demonstrated that the immediate cancellation of the CTR balances could, in some cases, increase taxes paid by non-resident shareholders on dividends paid out of conduit relieved income. This was not the policy intent. Therefore CTR accounts are to be maintained for the time being to allow taxpayers to use up their existing credit balances (although no new credits or liabilities will arise). Changes made Sections LQ 1-LQ 4 are being repealed to prevent further conduit relief arising. Section OD provides an account mechanism for tracking the amount of conduit relief. Numerous provisions in section OD are being repealed or amended to ensure that no new CTR credits are generated and to remove the tax liability that arises from CTR debits. The liability was an anti-avoidance measure which allows conduit relief to be clawed back in situations where a significant portion of the CTR company’s retained earnings became the property of New Zealand residents. The liability is no longer required now that companies can get no further conduit relief. CTR companies will be able to continue to attach CTR credits to any dividends they distribute to their non-resident shareholders, for a period of two years, as removing this facility would lead, in some cases, to an unintended increase in the tax paid on distributions to non-resident shareholders. With the removal of the liability that CTR credits represent, there may be incentives for conduit companies to build up CTR balances over the period before the application date of the new international tax rules, or to employ other means to maximise the value of cancelling the liability. To prevent this, an anti-avoidance rule will deny conduit relief and impose income tax when an arrangement has the purpose of inappropriately providing a tax benefit to New Zealand residents (section GZ 2). The government intends that the legislation to remove the remaining vestiges of the conduit relief mechanism after two years will be included in a future tax bill. 40 Conduit companies that wish to remove their liabilities at an earlier stage can elect to cease being a conduit company at any time after the beginning of the 2009–10 income year, in which case their conduit credits will be cancelled at the end of the income year in which the election is made. The conduit interest allocation rules in section FF are no longer necessary as there will be no further conduit relief – this eliminates the potential for conduit companies to erode the New Zealand tax base by funding their (exempt) offshore investments with excessive New Zealand interest deductions. Because of the introduction of an active income exemption for CFCs, the general interest allocation rules (see Interest allocation rules for outbound international investment) are extended to cover New Zealand residents with outbound interests in CFCs. Replacement of grey list exemption for CFCs with active business test and Australian exemption The bill removes the grey list tax exemption for CFC income in eight countries as this is being replaced by an active business test (see Active business test) and an Australian exemption. The current grey list The current grey list exempts the income of CFCs in eight countries from New Zealand tax on the grounds that the tax systems of those countries were broadly comparable to ours. The grey list made sense as a pragmatic mechanism for reducing compliance costs in the context of a system that otherwise taxed both active and passive income of CFCs on accrual. It does not make sense under the new rules, which provide an exemption for active CFCs in all jurisdictions, using the active business test as a filter to minimise compliance costs for businesses with less than 5 percent passive income. Retaining a grey list would be problematic for the following key reasons: • It would perpetuate an undesirable preference in the international tax rules for investment into traditional, high tax jurisdictions as opposed to encouraging New Zealand firms to expand into non-traditional markets. • Ensuring the overall integrity of the grey list, to protect the domestic tax base, would require on-going monitoring of the tax systems of the listed countries. • A grey list assumes comparable taxation of income in a listed country. This was a reasonable assumption to make when active income was taxed, but is not valid for passive income because of the differences in tax systems between countries. The case for an Australian exemption The removal of the grey list has raised concerns about increasing the compliance costs faced by smaller businesses looking to expand offshore. Many of these businesses could face a largely “one-off” increase in compliance costs from having to learn the new international tax rules and how to apply the active business test. In order to minimise these costs an exemption is being introduced for CFCs resident in Australia. An Australian exemption is justified for the following reasons: 41 • Australia is the first point of offshore expansion for most small to medium-sized enterprises – as they move beyond Australia they are likely to become increasingly sophisticated and so should more easily be able to apply the active business test. • New Zealand has a full exchange of information with Australia and Inland Revenue has a close working relationship with the Australian Tax Office. This makes monitoring the Australian tax system more practical than for other jurisdictions. Changes made The current exemption for CFCs resident in eight grey list countries is replaced with an exemption for a CFC resident in Australia. This is achieved by a modification of section EX 22. A CFC is currently ineligible for the grey list exemption if its income tax has been reduced by a concession listed in Part B of Schedule 24. This condition is retained for the new Australian exemption, but the relevant Australian concessions from Part B are now listed in section EX 22. In addition, when the government made the decision to provide an exemption for Australian CFCs, it intended that appropriate anti-avoidance rules would apply. For the time being, this is achieved by adding a requirement that a CFC must be subject to tax in Australia in order to qualify for the exemption in EX 22. Section EX 23, which applied when a grey list CFC had its income reduced by a Schedule 24 tax concession, is no longer required. It is expected that taxpayers with Australian CFCs that receive Australian concessions (that is, are ineligible for the section EX 22 Australian exemption) would be better off using the active business test or attributing only active income, because section EX 23 would require attributing all of the CFC’s income, as opposed to just the passive amounts. The eight country grey list for 10 percent or greater interests in FIFs will be retained until the active income exemption is extended to these entities. 43 Taxation of life insurance business 45 TAXATION OF LIFE INSURANCE BUSINESS (Clauses 2(22), 28, 44, 50(1), 56, 68, 98(2) & (6), 140-143, 146, 149, 150, 205(1) & (2), 216(1) & (4), 217, 222, 225, 238-240, 264, 267, 268(3), 272, 273(1) & (5), 274, 278, 279(1) & (3), 283, 285, 287(1) & (4), 289, 297, 324, 330(2) & (3), 331(1) & (3), 333-335, 336(1), (2) & (4), 338, 341, 342(2), 343(1) & (4), 344(2), 353(2), 368, 369, 372, 408(6), (11), (19), (45), (75), (77), (81), (102-105), (110), (113 & 114), (126 & 127), (130), (135), (140), (148), 421(1) and 493) Summary of proposed amendments Significant changes are being made to the taxation of life insurance business as a result of the proposals outlined in the government discussion document Taxation of the life insurance business: proposed new rules, released in December 2007. The new rules for the taxation of life insurance business are designed to introduce an integrated framework that: • taxes life risk business on actual profits in a manner similar to the way other businesses are taxed; and • extends the tax benefits of the portfolio investment entity (PIE) rules to all savers in life products. Under the new rules, life insurers will be taxed on two bases: the shareholder base (representing income derived for the benefit of shareholders) and the policyholder base (representing income derived for the benefit of policyholders). Detailed provisions apply to taxing participating policy income between the shareholder and the policyholder bases. Application date Most of the changes affecting the taxation of life insurance business, including the benefits of the PIE rules, will apply from the life insurer’s first income year, beginning on or after 1 April 2009. The new rules also provide, at the election of the life insurer, a lead-in period for up to five years for existing term life policies sold up to 31 March 2009. Full grand-parenting applies for term life policies sold up to 31 March 2009 for single premium policies or to the extent the premiums are locked in. Key features The rules governing the taxation of life insurance business are being replaced with the following changes: 46 The taxation base Changes to subparts CR and DR of the Income Tax Act 2007 outline the tax basis for life insurance business. Life insurers will be taxed on two bases, a shareholder base (representing income derived for the benefit of shareholders) and a policyholder base (representing income derived for the benefit of policyholders). Subpart EY is substantially replaced with new detailed rules for apportioning amounts relating to income, expenditure or loss between the two bases. The shareholder base will consist of: • profits from the risk component of premiums less risk claims net of reinsurance; • net investment income from shareholder funds; • shareholder share of participating policy profits; • fees from investment management and other services; • income from annuities; and • income determined under ordinary principles from any other sources; • less risk expenses • plus/less changes in risk reserves. Ordinary provisions apply to shareholder base losses carried forward or subject to grouping, as well as to imputation credit and other remaining memorandum account balances carried forward. The policyholder base will consist of: • net investment income from policyholder funds; and • policyholder share of investment income (less expenses) from participating policies. Section CX 55 extends the PIE tax base benefits of non-taxation of Australasian equity trading gains to all policyholder investment income. Excess imputation credits on the policyholder base income will convert and be carried forward as a policyholder base loss. Any policyholder base losses at the end of the income year can be carried forward without any requirement for continuity. Sections EY 17-18 and EY 21-22 and EY 28 contain detailed rules on the allocation of income, expenditure or loss from profit-participation policies between the shareholder base and policyholder base. 47 Rates of tax The shareholder base will be taxed at the prevailing corporate rate. The policyholder base will ordinarily be taxed at 30%, although life insurers will be permitted to elect to attribute investment income from investment-linked products to policyholders at their PIE marginal tax rates. Reinsurance Section EY 12, which deals with reinsurance, is amended. Only life reinsurance (as defined) premiums paid will be deductible from premiums paid, and life reinsurance claims received will be deductible only from claims paid by life insurers if the reinsurance contract is offered or entered into in New Zealand Life financial reinsurance premiums will be subject to tax under the financial arrangement rules. The new reinsurance rules will apply only to reinsurance contracts entered into for the first time on or after 1 April 2009. For contracts entered into before that date, section EZ 63 provides that the existing rules will apply for the later of the duration of the contract (without renewal) or to 31 March 2014. Transitional rules Sections EZ 53-63 contain a range of transitional and terminating provisions to deal with entry into the new rules All investments held by life insurers on behalf of policyholders will be treated as sold and re-acquired at the market value on the last day of the income year prior to the life insurer being subject to the new rules (section EZ 61). Section EZ 62 provides that what is commonly known as the life office base (LOB) tax loss, after any offsets remaining at the end of the life insurer’s income year that ends on or includes 31 March 2009, can be carried forward by the life insurer for application against the shareholder base, and also by election against the policyholder base in subsequent income years (subject to a number of limitations). Any loss carried forward is subject to ordinary shareholder continuity rules. Imputation and other remaining memorandum account balances will be carried forward into the shareholder base. The rules in section EY 29 preserve the current tax treatment for the following term policies sold before 1 April 2009: • for single premium policies, the current taxation rules will effectively apply for the life of the policy; • for level premium and guaranteed premium policies, the current taxation rules will apply for the longer of five years or the period for which the premium is guaranteed; and • for all other policies, the current taxation rules will effectively apply for five years. 48 If the amount of cover does not increase in the relevant year by the greater of an annual CPI adjustment and 10 percent in the amount covered, the eligibility of the life policy under the transitional rules is unaffected. The life insurer can elect out of the transitional rules for any policy. Background Under the current rules, life insurers are taxed on a two-tier basis. The LOB taxes the income earned for the benefit of both shareholders and policyholders of the life insurer as a whole, and consists of investments income less expenses, and underwriting income. Underwriting income comprises mortality profit, discontinuance profit and premium loading, determined by a formula set out in tax legislation that reflects the income derived from providing risk services. Income accruing to policyholders is taxed to the life insurer on a proxy basis as policyholder income (PHB). Income is calculated by a formula to arrive at the before- tax amount necessary to provide the after-tax benefit implicit in the policy. Tax paid on the LOB generates imputation credits that can then be used to meet the PHB liability. The current rules present the following problems: • Individuals who save through life insurance products face a higher tax burden than other savers who invest directly or through managed funds that become PIEs. This effect may distort consumer decisions about the type of saving vehicle they use and place life insurance polices at a competitive disadvantage. • Term insurance, which is now a major part of life insurance business, is under- taxed. The premium loading formula (which was not designed with term insurance products in mind) results in profitable term insurance business generating artificial tax losses, with, in many cases, a higher accounting profit that results in a larger tax loss. These tax benefits were unintended and cannot be justified on tax policy grounds. The new rules ensure that life insurance business is subject to tax under the same general tax consequences as other businesses in New Zealand. The new rules ensure that tax paid by life insurers corresponds to their profitability and that life-based savings products qualify to be taxed under the PIE rules. Detailed analysis Overview of the new rules – sections CR 2, DR 1, DR 2 and subpart EY The new rules create separate calculation methods for imposing a tax liability on the stakeholders who derive an economic benefit from life insurance business. These are referred to as the shareholder base (representing income net of certain reinsurance derived for the benefit of shareholders) and the policyholder base (representing income derived for the benefit of policyholders). Detailed rules apply to the taxation of participating policies. Sections DR 1(3) and DR 2(4) provide the new rules are codes for the deductions of life insurers in respect of their life insurance business. Section EY 1(2) prevents double counting of income, expenditure, or loss. 49 The calculation of income and tax credits received by shareholders and policyholders for each class of life insurance policies will be based, under section EY 4, on their respective share of taxable income earned by the life insurance business. Under the new rules, ordinary principles will determine whether an asset is held on revenue account by the life insurer and whether any expenditure or loss incurred is deductible. Treatment of the shareholder base under the new rules – sections CR 2, DR 2, EY 1, EY 3-4, EY 19-22, EY 28, EY 30, EZ 59(2), Schedule 1 Part A The shareholder base will reflect the economic return earned and available for distribution to the equity owners of the life insurance business. It will be subject to tax at the corporate rate. The shareholder base will be an aggregation of the following elements: • Risk income: The risk component of life insurance products (excluding annuities) will be taxed on the basis of their actual profits (premiums less claims and expenses). Premiums for traditional participating business are not treated as income under the new rules, as these are, in substance, principal amounts invested. Similarly, claims paid under these products are not deductible. • Fees: Fee income from investment management or managing life insurance policies is treated as taxable income, whether it is explicitly charged or implicitly included in premium income (to the extent that the fees are not already included as risk income). Expenses incurred in deriving fee income are deductible. • Share of participating profits: The net return from participating policies is shared between shareholders and policyholders. Because of the complicated nature of these products, the allocation method is discussed under the heading “participating policies”. • Income earned from annuities: Net annuity income will continue to be effectively determined under the current basis (see sections EY 30 and EZ 53 to EZ 60) and net investment income arising from annuity premiums will be taxed at 30%. Further work to integrate the treatment of annuities within the context of the new rules for life insurance is on the tax policy work programme. • Other income and expenses: Other income and expenses determined under ordinary tax concepts are included. Allocation of net investment income under the new rules – sections EY 4, EY 15-16, and EY 19-20 Investment income and expenses and credits have to be allocated to either the shareholder base or policyholder base, depending on whose benefit the investment income is derived. The new rules prescribe default methods of allocation, but allow the life insurer to use a different basis of apportionment if it is “actuarially determined” and is more equitable and reasonable. It is anticipated that many life insurers would apportion in manner consistent with financial reporting where relevant. 50 Treatment of reserves – sections EY 23-27 To reflect the unusual cashflows connected with certain life products – for example, premiums are received upfront with large claim payments possibly occurring later, life insurers use complicated reserving methods to match revenue and expense recognition and to smooth profits. The new rules provide for a specific treatment of these reserves. At the option of the life insurer, a reserving formula for tax called a premium smoothing reserve (PSR) can be used for: • products which have premiums that are level (or substantially level for more than one year); or • products which, in the view of the insurer, could result in a material mismatch in any one year between the incidence of risk and the premium payable (for the period of the mismatch). The rules for the premium smoothing reserve are illustrated in example 1. Products for which the life insurer does not elect to use the PSR will be treated using the unearned premium reserving (UPR) method. Example 1: Premium smoothing reserve LifeInsurer issues a level premium 10-year term life insurance policy for a level premium of $852.96 per annum. The sum insured is $500,000. The expected claim payments each year (based on the underlying mortality table) increase every year as the probability of dying increases with age. Having a level premium means that the premium more than covers the risk (and expenses) in the early years, so some of the premium needs to be set aside to cover the higher risk in later years. By using the premium smoothing reserve, the insurer is taxed on the premium in the year which more closely resembles the actual risk for the year. It allows the insurer to set aside the excess premiums in the early years and bring them into the tax base at the time that they are being used to meet the risk. Premiums less claims Year Expected premium Expected claims PSR at end of year Without PSR Including change in PSR 1 852.61 410.50 144.29 442.11 297.82 2 851.89 432.14 274.47 419.75 289.57 3 851.13 457.73 385.62 393.40 282.25 4 850.33 487.73 472.01 362.60 276.21 5 849.46 523.12 526.58 326.34 271.77 6 848.54 563.88 541.84 284.66 269.40 7 847.54 611.46 508.35 236.08 269.57 8 846.44 666.82 415.15 179.62 272.82 9 845.25 729.89 250.62 115.36 279.89 10 843.95 803.08 0.00 40.87 291.49 In this example the profit carrier is gross premiums 51 For capital guarantee products not elected to be treated as profit participation policies, transfers from reserves that support the capital guarantee from/to shareholders will be allowed as a deduction/income for shareholder income and as income/deduction to policyholder income. Deferred acquisition costs, which are expenses connected with the sale of life policies – for example, commissions, will continue to be deductible under ordinary principles. The combined effect of the rules discussed to this point is illustrated in example 2. Example 2: Taxation of term-risk life business under the new rules Year 1Year 2Year 3Year 4Year 5 Total Premiums 1,5001,5001,5001,5001,500 7,500 Claims -870-780-960-890-900 -4,400 Acquisition expenses -700 -700 Renewal expenses -200-200-200-200-200 -1,000 +/- Reserves -300250100-100-125 -175 Taxable income -570770440310275 1,225 Tax @30% -1712311329383 368 • The premiums are for pure-risk policies and so are taxable for the full cash amount when received. Any UPR or PSR is included in the reserves calculation. • Deductions are allowed for pure-risk policies. Any outstanding claims reserve (OCR) is included in the reserves calculation. • Acquisition costs are deductible upfront. Renewal expenses are deducted as incurred. Treatment of the policyholder base under the new rules – sections CR 1, CX 55, DB 23, DR 1, EY 1-2, EY 4, EY 15-18, Schedule 1 Part A The policyholder base will consist of investment income earned on behalf of policyholders, less expenses. The PIE rules currently exclude realised New Zealand and listed Australian equity gains from tax. The amendments in this bill extend this benefit to policyholders in all life insurance savings products. Under the new rules, life insurers can also elect to attribute income in investment-linked products to policyholders at their individual PIE rates); otherwise the income is taxed at 30%. The policyholder base can carry forward unused tax losses but these will not be subject to any continuity rules. Policyholder net taxable investment income cannot be offset with losses or credits from the shareholder base, except in the case of transitional losses, which is discussed later. 52 Participating policies under the new rules – sections EY 17-18, EY 21-22, EY 28 and YA 1 Specific rules deal with the treatment of income and expenditure arising from “profit participation policy” (as defined) business. A typical profit participation policy involves a group of members (policyholders) who pool their money together, generate income, self-insure (possibly with some outside reinsurance) and periodically formally increase their vested entitlement to the pool, usually by way of bonus allocations. Expenses associated with running the pool are met from within the pool. A manager (the shareholder) provides all the services associated with running the pool and may underwrite some of the risks of the pool. The manager is rewarded for carrying out its functions and bearing the risks by periodically transferring money from the pool. Typically, the reward is linked to the vesting of the increases in the entitlements for the members. The new rules are designed on the principle that net investment income should be taxable but that policyholders should not be taxed on any other sources of gains when they are derived by policyholders trading among themselves. Therefore apportionment of investment income between policyholders and shareholders recognises that part of the investment income is connected with policy liabilities (regarded as belonging to the policyholders) and part is connected with the existing surpluses (regarded as a source of future bonuses). Under the new rules, investment income less all participating pool expenses will be taxed to both policyholders and shareholders in the proportion in which they are eventually allocated. Any excess of premiums and claims may include bonus loading and mortality and discontinuance profits. Shareholders’ share of the excess is treated as profit and included in shareholder base income. Policyholders, however, will not be taxed on the excess as it effectively comprises reallocations of their own contributions from after tax income. Imputation and other credits will be apportioned between the shareholders and policyholders bases using the same ratio. Example 3 illustrates how the new rules will apply to participating policies. 53 Example 3: Taxation of participating life business LifeInsurer has a profit participation policy (called here a “with profit pool”) block of business. The portion of the insurer’s investment assets which are apportioned to that business can be readily identified, as can the proportion of each asset type. This enables the determination of investment returns which are attributable to the pool and also the determination of the taxable investment income under both ordinary rules and as modified by the PIE rules. The insurer has a documented policy of transferring to the shareholder’s account 25 percent of the present value of bonus additions to policies which are declared from time to time. The relevant data for the year for the pool are: $m Market value of the with profit pool assets at the start of the year – F(0) 82.365 Policy liabilities at the start of the year – L(0) 49.326 Taxable investment income under ordinary rules – Is 5.066 Taxable investment income under PIE rules– Ipie 4.053 Expenses attributed to the with profits pool – E 0.609 Valuation premiums expected in the year, net of reinsurance – P’ 3.599 Actual premiums brought into account in the year, net of reinsurance – P 8.117 Death and maturity claims expected in the year, net of reinsurance – C’ 0.605 Actual death, maturity, and surrender claims in the year, net of reinsurance – C 3.370 Expected policy liabilities at the end of the year – L’(1) 54.103 Actual policy liabilities at the end of the year – L(1) 51.384 Market value of the with profit pool assets at the end of the year, before payment of tax and shareholder transfer – F(0) 91.569 The average value of the assets over the year = (82.365+91.569)/2 = 86.967 The average policy liabilities over the year = (49.326+51.384)/2 = 50.355 The proportion of the pool attributed to policy liabilities (p) = 50.355/86.967 = 0.5790 The with profit gate (g) = 0.25 Policyholder base Policyholder investment income = Ipiex(1+pxg)/(1+g) = 4.053x(1+0.5790x0.25)/(1+0.25) = 4.053x1.14475/1.25 = 3.712 Policyholder expenses = Ex(1+pxg)/(1+g) = 0.609x1.14475/1.125 = 0.558 Policyholder taxable income = 3.712 + 0.558 = 3.154 Shareholder base Shareholder investment income = Isx(1-p)xg/(1+g) = 5.066x(1-0.5790)x0.25/(1+0.25) = 5.066x0.4210x0.20 = 0.427 Shareholder expenses = 609x0.4210x0.20 = 0.051 Shareholder minimum income = 0.427 – 0.051 = 0.376 Other profit (OP) = (P-P’) – (C-C’) +L’(1) – L(1) = (8.117-3.599)-(3.370-0.605)+54.103-51.384 = 4.518-2.765+2.719 = 4.472 Shareholder other income = OPxg/(1+g) = 4.472x0.20 = 0.894 Shareholder taxable income = 0.376 + 0.894 = 1.270 54 Life reinsurance – sections EW 5(8), EY 12 and EZ 63 The definition of “life insurance” includes reinsurance. Reinsurance is a way by which insurers manage risks. These risks include underwriting risk, timing risk (in settling claims), investment risk (low return or asset defaults), expense risk (higher than expected expenses) and credit risk (risk that the reinsurer will default on its payments). By reinsuring, the risk is transferred from one insurer to another. A transfer of premiums will also occur, proportionate to the risk being transferred. “Life reinsurance” premiums will be deductible from premiums and reinsurance claims will be deductible from claims paid when the reinsurance policies are offered or entered into in New Zealand. Table 1 shows the effect of reinsurance transactions on a life insurer’s taxable income. T ABLE 1: EFFECT OF REINSURANCE ON TAXABLE INCOME Transactions Gross income Reinsurance commissions of $500,000 received under a contract of reinsurance. The total amount relates to the risk components of the claims paid. +500,000 Life insurance premium paid under a contract of reinsurance of $1,500,000. -$1,500,000 $600,000 received under a profit sharing arrangement in relation to a contract of reinsurance. +600,000 $300,000 recovered as a refund of premiums paid under a contract of reinsurance. +300,000 “Life reinsurance” is defined in section EY 12(1) and does not include a contract that secures against a “financial risk” unless, in the contract, the risk is incidental to securing against life risk or is or is part of tax avoidance arrangement. Section EZ 63 provides that premiums for a reinsurance contract that is life financial reinsurance will be non-deductible to the life insurer, and the investment income is brought to tax by the life insurer under the financial arrangement rules. The new rules regarding life reinsurance will not apply to existing reinsurance contracts for five years or longer (if the contract period extends as far). Provisional tax Life insurers will be subject to tax on the basis of the shareholder base and the policyholder base, as illustrated in example 4. Life insurers will be subject to provisional tax on the aggregate amount calculated. 55 Tax paid on the shareholder base will generate imputation credits but tax paid on the policyholder base will not (section OB 4(3)(c)). Imputation credits attached to dividends received by the life insurer will generate a credit to the ICA when received. However, an end-of-year adjustment will be required on the life insurer’s balance date to debit received credits which have been allocated to the policyholder base (section OB 47). Example 4: Provisional tax payments A life insurer has a 30 June balance date. Provisional tax payments for tax are due on 28 November, 28 March, and 28 July. It has profit participation policies and estimates its provisional tax by allocating 90 percent of its expected investment income to the policyholder base. Provisional tax payments ICA Date Shareholder Policyholder Dr Cr 28 November 2008 200 2,000 200 28 March 2009 200 2,000 200 28 July 2009 200 2,000 200 Total at 28 July 2009 600 6,000 0 600 The company calculates its tax liabilities for the year ended 30 June 2009.

It still has a terminal tax liability of $940, which it should pay as soon as possible to stop interest accruing. 56 Non-resident life insurers – section EY 48 Section EY 48 incorporates the new taxation framework for life insurance business in connection with life insurance policies that are offered in New Zealand and life reinsurance policies connected with New Zealand life insurance policies. Actuarial advice and guidance, “actuarially determined” and “best estimate assumptions” – sections EY 6 and YA 1 A large part of the calculation and apportionment of amounts required by subpart EY, particularly in connection with reserves, require the use of actuarial determinations and judgement – provided by the definition “actuarially determined”. A new definition of “best estimate assumptions” is also inserted to provide that such judgements are consistent with professional actuarial judgement and that the assumptions underlying such judgements are not deliberately overstated or understated. Section EY 6 allows Inland Revenue to seek the advice of the Government Actuary or any other actuary on matters that are required to be actuarially determined under the new rules. Memorandum account balances – sections LA 8B, LE 2(1), LE 2B, LE 3, OB 3B, OB 32, OB 35B, OB 47, OC 2B, OC 6, OC 20, OP 30, OP 33B, OP 44, OP 74 and OZ 18 ICA and other memorandum account balances will need to be maintained for the shareholder base. Credits will be apportioned to shareholder and policyholder income as illustrated in example 5. Ordinary imputation credit rules will apply. Imputation and withholding payment credit account balances held by the life insurer will be carried forward to the shareholder base credit accounts provided ordinary continuity rules are met. The current rules for policyholder credit accounts are repealed. Any balance remaining in the policyholder credit account after satisfying the tax liability under the current rules will be automatically transferred back as at year end to the life insurer’s ICA. Imputation credits attached to dividends received during the year are credited to the ICA on the dates the dividends are paid to the company. The credits must be apportioned between the shareholder base and the policyholder base. Only credits apportioned to a particular category of income may be credited against tax on that income – see new section OB 3B. In addition, on the 31 March following the end of the income year, the ICA must be debited by the amount of imputation credits received that were apportioned to the policyholder base. Other definitions – section YA 1 New definitions are provided for terms that are not defined elsewhere in subpart EY. These terms include “ asset base”, “life risk”, “policyholder base”, “present value”, “profit participation policy”, “savings product policy”, “shareholder base”, and “surrender value”. A number of definitions related to the current life rules are repealed. 57 Example 5: Imputation credits Following on from example 4, assume that in addition to making the provisional tax payments the life insurer received $5,000 in imputation credits attached to dividend in its income year ended 30 June 2009. It’s ICA balance at 28 July 2009 would be $5,540. In calculating its tax liabilities, the company determines how much of the received imputation credits are apportioned to policyholder income. If we assume that: • for the year the net asset value of the participating fund was $240,000; and • the average value of policyholder liabilities for the year was $144,000; and • the portion of declared bonus for the year which is payable to the shareholders is 25 percent; then the amount of imputation credits apportioned to the policyholders is: $5,000 x (1 + .6 x .25) 1 + .25 Which is $4,600. To reflect this in the ICA, on the last day of the income year (30 June 2009) the ICA of the company must be debited by $4,600. General transition issues Deemed sale – section EZ 61 The current life insurance tax rules provide that investment income in one base the LOB is calculated under ordinary rules, meaning that trading gains and losses are recognised when they are realised. However, under the other base (the PHB) they are based on reserve calculations that have the effect of recognising the change in value of investments on an unrealised basis. This could cause timing differences in income recognition between the two bases. To remove this timing difference, the new rules provide that investments taken into account in determining the policyholder reserves for the policyholder base calculation will be treated as having been sold and re-acquired at market value on entry into the new rules. Tax losses – sections EZ 62, IT 1 and IT 2 Under the current rules, the two different bases (LOB and PHB) may have their own losses carried forward. The LOB loss is the correct amount to carry forward into the new tax rules as it better reflects the income of the entire life insurance business rather than the PHB. The new rules allow the LOB loss that exists at the end of the income year ending 31 March 2009 to be available for carry-forward and allocated as a shareholder base loss in the new rules. This loss can be offset with the life insurers income (including by way of election, policyholder base income subject to limitations discussed below) and group company losses, subject to ordinary continuity and grouping rules. 58 Section EZ 62 effectively provides on an annual basis that the LOB loss carried forward must be first applied against shareholder base income, but if there is still LOB available the excess can be elected to be offset against policyholder base income. The amount that can be offset is the least of: • the LOB available for offset; • the PHB loss cancelled less any LOB utilised by the policyholder base; or • the policyholder base income. Other balances held by the life insurer or a consolidated group to which it belongs can also be carried forward to be applied against the shareholder base, provided, where relevant, ordinary continuity rules are met. Term life products sold up to 31 March 2009 – section EY 29 Term life insurance policies sold before 1 April 2009 will be, at the election of the life insurer, subject to transitional rules for a period of up to five years. If the policy is a single premium, level premium or guaranteed premium, it can be grand-parented for the life of the policy or for the period for which the premium is guaranteed. Life insurers can elect out of transitional rules at any time. Grand-parenting would not be affected in situations when the amount of insured cover does not increase by an amount up to the greater of an annual CPI adjustment or 10 percent of the prior year’s amount. Table 2 illustrates the effects of the transition rules. The rules applying to profit participation policies and other savings policies apply from the first income year beginning on or after 1 April 2009. TABLE 2: SUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF THE TRANSITIONAL RULES Product Sold before 1 April 2009 Sold between 1 April 2009 and application date Level term Grand-parented for duration of policy. Current tax rules then subject to the new rules from application date. Guaranteed premium Grand-parented for the greater of duration of guaranteed period or five income years. Current tax rules then subject to the new rules from application date. Annual renewable term Grand-parented for up to five income years from application. Current tax rules then subject to the new rules from application date. Single premium Grand-parented for duration of policy. Current tax rules then subject to the new rules from application date. Traditional products and savings policies New rules apply from the beginning of the first income year after 1 April 2009. Current tax rules then subject to the new rules from application date. Note: Life insurers can elect out of the transitional rules for any product at any time. General A number of consequential amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 arise from the repeal of the current PHB and policyholder credit account. 59 Tax treatment of relocation payments and overtime meal allowances 61 TAX TREATMENT OF RELOCATION PAYMENTS AND OVERTIME MEAL ALLOWANCES (Clauses 34, 35, 42, 485, 545, 547-549, 616, 617 and 619) Summary of proposed amendments Amendments to the Income Tax Acts 1994, 2004 and 2007 specifically ensure that payments by employers when relocating their employees, and providing them with overtime meal allowances are exempt from income tax and fringe benefit tax if certain criteria are met. These changes were signalled in an officials’ issues paper released in November 2007, and are designed to remove uncertainty about whether and when these payments are tax-free. Application date The amendments will apply from the 2002–03 income year. Key features Relocation payments For these payments to be tax-free, all of the following criteria must be met: • The employee’s relocation must be as a result of: – taking up employment with a new employer; – taking up new duties at a new location with their existing employer; or – continuing in their current position, but at a new location. • The employee’s existing home must not be within reasonable travelling distance of the new workplace (unless accommodation is provided as an integral part of the job). • The expense must be on the proposed list of eligible relocation expenses. • The payment must reflect the expenditure incurred. • The expenditure must be incurred within certain time limits. Tax has been paid on some past relocation payments. Because the legislative changes are being backdated, some employers and employees may be entitled to tax credits. Employers, rather than employees, will receive the tax credits that arise in relation to past relocation payments that were subject to PAYE deductions if the employer has grossed up a payment to reflect the tax liability. 62 Overtime meal payments and allowances For these payments to be tax-free, all of the following criteria must be met: • Either the employee’s employment contract must specify that the employee is eligible for a payment in relation to overtime hours worked, or an employer must have a policy or practice of paying an overtime meal allowance. • The allowance must reflect the actual expenditure incurred by the employee or, alternatively, be a reasonable estimate of the expected costs likely to be incurred by the employee or group of employees. A specific definition of “overtime” is proposed. Background Over recent years there has been uncertainty over the tax treatment of employer payments for relocations and overtime meals, and whether these payments should be considered as income of the employees who receive them. For many years these two types of payment have been generally treated as non-taxable by both taxpayers and Inland Revenue. Developments over time have, however, complicated the situation. Before 1995, taxpayers required approval from Inland Revenue if a particular payment was to be treated as non-taxable but since then, taxpayers have self-assessed whether a payment is taxable or non-taxable. In November 2007, Inland Revenue attempted to identify more generally the circumstances under current tax law, including case law, when amounts paid by employers in relation to employee-related expenses would be exempt from income tax. These circumstances were outlined in draft Interpretation Guideline (IG03162), which was released for public comment on 24 October 2007. The Interpretation Guideline specifically focused on those situations covered by section CW 13 of the Income Tax Act 2004. Following public comment, this guideline is likely to be finalised in the near future. The draft guideline concluded that the following three criteria must be met 2 : • the employee was performing an obligation under the contract of service at the time the expenditure was incurred; • the obligation served the purpose of the income-earning process of deriving income from employment; and • the expenditure incurred by the employee was necessary as a practical requirement of the performance of the obligation. 2 The criteria would not apply to payments that already have their own rules in legislation; for example, the rules relating to reimbursement of additional transport costs are already set out in section CW 14 of the Income Tax Act 2004 (and section CW 18 of the Income Tax Act 2007). 63 Apart from relocations, application of these criteria also has implications for overtime meal allowances as these would be taxable under those criteria, whereas traditionally, in practice, they have been treated as non-taxable. In response to these developments, the government decided it would introduce amendments to the Income Tax Act to ensure that these payments are exempt from income tax and, where relevant, fringe benefit tax, subject to clear limitations to prevent their use for purposes of salary substitution. This was announced in a joint media statement released by the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue on 24 October 2007. There are several reasons why these two employer payments should be non-taxable: • The element of private benefit involved is considered to be small. • The degree of private benefit is hard to measure. • There is relatively little risk of recharacterisation of taxable salary and wages as non-taxable payments for relocation or as overtime meal allowances. The changes will also help employers and employees to make efficient employee relocation decisions by ensuring that tax considerations do not distort their decisions. This is particularly important given the mobility of skilled labour. To further reduce uncertainty, the government announced that the changes should apply to payments made over the past four years, as well as to future payments. By statute, Inland Revenue is generally unable to re-assess an income tax liability beyond four years. The changes were outlined in detail in the officials’ issues paper, Tax-free relocation payments and overtime meal allowances. Detailed analysis What payments are covered The changes focus on employer payments that cover the costs that employees have incurred as part of carrying out their employment obligations. The circumstances in which such payments are considered tax-free have been traditionally covered by section CW 17 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and its predecessors, section CW 13 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and subsection CB 12(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994. The payments may be made in several ways. Employers may directly pay an account that is in the name of an employee. Alternatively, employees might seek reimbursement of an amount they have already paid, or the employer might provide them with an allowance to cover the estimated costs they are expecting to incur. The legislative changes cover all these situations. These situations differ from those covered by the fringe benefit tax rules, although ideally the outcomes should be similar. Accordingly, some changes are also being made to the fringe benefit tax rules. 64 What legislation needs to be amended? Because the changes are being back-dated to the 2002–03 income year, the changes will be replicated in the three income tax acts that cover the period: • the Income Tax Act 1994, which applied up to and including the 2004–05 income years; • the Income Tax Act 2004, which applied for the 2005–06 to 2007–08 income years; and • the Income Tax Act 2007, which came into force from 1 April 2008, with application generally from the 2008–09 income year. However, for the purposes of the discussion below on individual section changes, we refer only to the 2007 Act unless otherwise stated. Although the wording changes to the other two Acts may differ because of the language used in those Acts, the changes are intended to have the same effect as those in the 2007 Act. Relocation payments New subsection CW 17B(1) provides the specific income tax exemption for payments that cover expenses in connection with a “work-related relocation”, with new subsection CW 17(4) making it clear that the more general provisions set out in section CW 17 do not apply to amounts covered by new section CW 17B. An equivalent change is being made to section CX 19 to cover any fringe benefits that arise from a work-related relocation. This means that provided the various requirements are met, the relocation payment will be exempt from income tax and fringe benefit tax, irrespective of how the employer makes the payment. Requirements Subsection CW 17B(2) requires that the amount paid must be no more than the actual eligible relocation expenses that the employee incurs from the work-related relocation. To be an eligible expense, it must be one of those listed in a determination issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Subsection CW 17B(6), in conjunction with new section 91AAR of the Tax Administration Act, enables the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to issue such determinations. Although the draft legislation refers to actual expenses, the definition is sufficiently wide to allow employers to provide an advance to an employee in anticipation of relocation expenditure being incurred, provided there is ultimately a square-up. Estimates of costs will not be allowed, on the basis that it is not unreasonable to expect employees and employers to keep track and provide evidence of actual expenditure given the relatively small number of employees involved and the magnitude of the costs associated with a relocation. 65 Subsection CW 17B(3) places a time limit on when the expenses must be incurred, which is within the period starting from the income year in which the employee relocates or undertakes work in the new location up to the end of the next income year. Although the requirements in general do not distinguish between temporary and permanent relocations, some flexibility is provided when a temporary secondment becomes permanent. The temporary move would be ignored for the purposes of determining when the time limit period began if the temporary move had not been already claimed as a work-related relocation. Subsection CW 17B(4) defines what is meant by “work-related relocation”. Under this provision, relocation must be as a result of an employee: • taking up new employment with a new employer; • taking up new duties at a new location with the existing employer; or • continuing in their current position, but at a new location. Furthermore, the relocation of the employee’s residence must be necessary to carry out the job. If the employee could have commuted to the new job from an existing residence there would appear to be a clear monetary private benefit involved when the employer pays for the relocation costs, and, in principle, this should be taxable. The specific legislative test is that the employee’s existing residence must not be within reasonable daily travelling distance of the new workplace (the distance test). Guidelines on what is meant by “reasonable travelling distance” will be provided separately. For example, traffic density could be a factor in limiting the distance that could be reasonably travelled. Subsection CW 17B(5) provides an exemption from the distance test when a person’s accommodation forms an integral part of their work. This exemption recognises that some employees may be provided with a house as a necessary part of their job and that when they are required as part of that job to move to a new location, their residence automatically changes irrespective of the distance. Overtime meal payments New subsection CW 17C(1) provides the specific income tax exemption for overtime meal payments, with new subsection CW 17(4) making it clear that the more general provisions set out in section CW 17 do not apply to amounts covered by new section CW 17C. The fringe benefit tax rules have not been changed. Meals provided on an employer’s premises would be exempt from fringe benefit tax. Fringe benefits arising outside of on-premises meals seem unlikely. If they do arise, they may get the benefit of subsection CX 5(3). That section states that if a benefit that an employer provides to employees in connection with their employment would have been exempt income if it had been paid in cash, the benefit is not considered to be a fringe benefit. 66 Subsection CW 17C(2) specifies that for the payment to be eligible for the exemption, either: • the employee’s employment agreement must provide for pay for overtime hours worked; or • the employer must have an established policy or practice of paying for overtime meals. (This is to cover situations when salaried staff are required to work overtime during periods of particular work pressure.) Subsection CW 17C(3) provides that the overtime meal payment must only cover either actual expenses or a reasonable estimate of those expenses. This is similar to the options available under the more general allowances provisions in section CW 17. If actual expenses are being reimbursed, then documentation is required to verify expenditure when the meal costs more than $20. Subsection CW 17C(4) defines what is meant by “overtime”. This is defined as the time worked on the day beyond the person’s ordinary hours of work as set out in the employment agreement when the employee has worked more than two hours beyond his or her ordinary hours on that day. Tax and associated adjustments Given that the legislative changes are being backdated to the 2002–03 income year, some taxpayers will be entitled to a credit for over-paid tax if they paid tax on past qualifying payments. These adjustments will be handled through Inland Revenue’s standard administrative practices. Section 113 of the Tax Administration Act enables the Commissioner to amend the relevant assessments. There was general agreement with the suggestion in the issues paper that employers should receive the credit for over-paid PAYE when they have grossed up the payment to compensate the employee for the tax impost. The issues paper also noted that a special legislative mechanism might be needed to achieve this. On further consideration, a special legislative mechanism is not necessary. Inland Revenue already has administrative practices in place that enable credits to be given for over-payments of PAYE. An employer can request an adjustment to a past Employer Monthly Schedule (EMS), which the Commissioner will do on the receipt of corroborating material. Similarly, as would normally occur, employers receiving such credits should be adjusting their taxable income when they have treated the past PAYE payment as a cost of business. Even when employers receive a credit for over-paid PAYE, employees will still be eligible for adjustments to their entitlements and liabilities that arise from readjusting their taxable income to exclude, say, a previously taxed qualifying relocation payment. These adjustments redress the fact that some employees will have received lower entitlements and had higher liabilities as a result of the payments being previously subject to income tax. 67 Determination New section 91AAR of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides some parameters around the proposed Commissioner’s power to issue determinations that list the types of expenditure that qualify as eligible relocation expenses. Subsection 91AAR(3), for example, sets out the factors that the Commissioner may take into account when considering whether a type of expenditure necessarily arises from a relocation of an employee rather than being costs that would have been incurred gradually over time, irrespective of whether an employee had relocated. In this regard, factors that may be borne in mind are whether the expenditure is really a substitute for salary and wages, whether employers generally treat the expenses as relocation expenses and the difficulty and costs of measuring any private benefit element. Subsection 91AAR(4) provides for a determination to be altered, subject to the Commissioner giving at least 30 days notice of the implementation date of any change. A person affected by a determination may challenge the determination under Parts 4A (disputes procedures) and 8A (challenges) of the Tax Administration Act (see new subsection 91AAR(5). 69 Payroll giving 71 PAYROLL GIVING (Clauses 232, 233, 235, 236, 379, 384, 402, 403, 408(23), 408(38), 408(89), 408(99), 442(1) & (3), 443, 447, 458 and 504) Summary of proposed amendments The bill introduces a voluntary payroll giving scheme that will allow employees to make regular payroll donations from their pay to charitable organisations of their choice. It will also enable employees to receive the tax benefit of their payroll donations each payday, in real-time, without the need to have donation receipts. People who make donations other than through payroll giving will continue to claim the charitable donation tax credit at the end of the tax year. The proposed payroll giving scheme results from options canvassed in the government’s November 2007 discussion document, Payroll giving: providing a real-time benefit for charitable giving. Application date The changes will apply from 1 April 2009. Key features The rules relating to payroll giving are largely contained in new sections LD 4 to LD 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and in new section 24Q of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The key features of the system are: • Participation in payroll giving will be voluntary for employers and employees. • Payroll giving is available only to employees whose employers file their employer monthly schedules electronically. • Employees who choose to make payroll donations will receive a tax credit on the amount of those donations each payday. The tax credit is calculated on a set rate of 33⅓ percent of the donation made. • The tax credit is offset against the PAYE calculated on the employee’s gross pay, thereby reducing the amount of PAYE payable for that period. The maximum tax credit permitted is limited to the employee’s PAYE deduction on the salary or wages each pay period. • Payroll donations must be made to a society, institution, association, organisation, trust or fund as described in section LD 3(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 or listed in Schedule 32. Employers are responsible for ensuring that payroll donations are transferred to those organisations. • Any payroll donations must be transferred within a three-month period. • Employees who donate through payroll giving are not eligible for the end-of-year tax credit on those donations. 72 Example The following example illustrates how payroll giving would operate: The employee receives $400 per week and makes regular contributions of $10 each pay. The employee is on a 19.5 percent tax rate. Employee’s (donor) weekly gross pay $400.00 Less payroll donation $10.00 Employee’s (donor) residual weekly pay $390.00 Less PAYE on $400 $78.23 Tax credit @ 33.3 percent $3.33 Employee’s net pay $315.10 Charity receives $10.00 Inland Revenue receives $74.90 In this example, the employee will receive an immediate tax benefit of $3.33 on his or her $10 payroll donation. The employer must transfer the payroll donation to the chosen charitable or philanthropic cause, or to an intermediary, who passes on the donations to those causes, within a three-month period. Background In Budget 2007, the government announced plans to look at several measures aimed at laying the foundation for a stronger culture of charitable giving in New Zealand. Among those measures was the release of the November 2007 discussion document, Payroll giving: providing a real-time benefit for charitable giving. Payroll giving enables employees to make regular payroll donations from their pay. The employer forwards these donations either directly to a charitable or philanthropic cause, or to an intermediary, who passes on the donations to those causes. The discussion document canvassed two options for delivering tax relief on payroll donations through a before-tax payroll-giving scheme, and possible measures for supporting employers who choose to offer payroll giving to their employees. The discussion document proposed that any payroll-giving scheme introduced in New Zealand should be voluntary for employers and employees. Two options were put forward in the discussion document for delivering tax relief through payroll giving – “the tax deduction mechanism” and “the PAYE credit mechanism” (on which the scheme of payroll giving is based). Under the tax deduction mechanism, donations would be deducted from an employee’s gross pay. This would reduce the employee’s taxable income and, as a result, alter the employee’s social policy entitlements and obligations. PAYE would be levied on the net amount. An immediate tax benefit would be received by way of a reduction in the amount of the PAYE required to be withheld. The tax benefit would be at the employee’s marginal tax rate. 73 Under the PAYE credit mechanism, employees would receive a PAYE credit on the amount of their donation made each payday. Employers would offset the credit against the PAYE calculated on the employee’s gross pay, and the PAYE credit would be calculated on a set rate of 33⅓ percent. The PAYE credit mechanism was preferred over the tax deduction mechanism as being more equitable in that all employees receive the same tax benefit regardless of their marginal tax rate. Furthermore, the PAYE credit mechanism does not alter the level of an employee’s taxable income, and therefore does not affect the employee’s social policy entitlements and obligations that use taxation income as the basis of their calculations – for example, Working for Families, student loans, child support or KiwiSaver. Detailed analysis The tax credit for payroll donations (new sections LD 4 and 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and new section 24Q of the Tax Administration Act 1994) New section LD 4 sets out who is eligible for the tax credit for payroll donations and describes the nature of that credit. New section LD 4(1) specifies that the tax credit will be available only to employees whose employers file their employer monthly schedules electronically. The employee will have to choose to make a payroll donation in the pay period in which the employer monthly schedule relates to. New section LD 4(2) calculates the amount of the tax credit according to the following formula: Total donations x 33⅓ New section LD 4(3) defines “total donations” as the total amount of all payroll donations made by the employee in the pay period. New section LD 4(4) limits the tax credit to the amount of the employee’s PAYE income payment for the period in which the donation was made. New section LD 4(5) states that the tax credit is a non-refundable tax credit to which section LA 4(1) applies. Section LA 4(1) determines the order in which tax credits are to be offset against a person’s income tax liability. Non-refundable tax credits are offset against a person’s income tax liability before other tax credits. New section LD 4(6) makes clear that an employee who makes a payroll donation cannot claim a refund on those donations under section 41A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. New section LD 7 defines “payroll donation”. A payroll donation is an amount that a person asks their employer to transfer from the amount of the person’s PAYE income payment (such as salary and wages) to an entity described in section LD 3(2) or is listed in Schedule 32. 74 Tax credit calculated incorrectly (new section LD 5) If an employer incorrectly calculates the amount of an employee’s tax credit, the credit is extinguished and the correct amount is to be included in the employee’s tax credits for salary and wages under section LB 1 for the tax year in which the pay period falls. Payroll donations transferred to ineligible recipient or not transferred (new section LD 6) The tax credit is extinguished if an employer fails to transfer an employee’s payroll donations to a chosen recipient or if the donation is not transferred to an organisation that is described in section LD 3(2) or listed in Schedule 32. Priority of payroll donations (new section LD 7(2)) Employees may only make a payroll donation if they have satisfied any tax obligations that they may have or any other statutory requirement that they may be obliged to meet from their salary and wages. Employer obligation Delivery of the tax credit and payroll donations New section RD 13B of the Income Tax Act 2007 requires employers or PAYE intermediaries to subtract the amount of the tax credit from the amount of PAYE payable for the employee for the pay period. New section RP 14(ab) of the Income Tax Act 2007 requires employers or PAYE intermediaries to transfer any payroll donation to the relevant recipient within a three- month period. Information requirements New sections RP 8(a)(iii) and (iv) of the Income Tax Act 2007 require employers to record the amount of payroll donations and any tax credit for payroll donations in their employer monthly schedule. New sections 22(2)(ed) and 22(2)(ke) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 require employers and PAYE intermediaries to keep sufficient records of the amount of any payroll donation deducted from an employee’s pay to enable the Inland Revenue to determine that payroll donations have in fact been transferred to the correct recipient. Liability for failure to transfer payroll donation Section 141E(1)(c) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is being amended so that an employer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty if the employer knowingly does not transfer the payroll donations to the correct recipient. 75 Reforming the Income Tax Act definitions of “associated persons” 77 REFORMING THE INCOME TAX ACT DEFINITIONS OF “ASSOCIATED PERSONS” (Clauses 7, 10-13, 18, 40, 41, 57, 82, 120, 152, 182, 183, 186, 188, 201-203, 408, 414, 415, 431, 436, 477, 502, 503 and 624) Summary of proposed amendments The bill makes amendments to strengthen and rationalise the definitions of “associated persons” in the Income Tax Act 2007. The definitions are mainly used in an anti-avoidance capacity to counter non-arm’s length transactions that could undermine the intent of the income tax legislation. There are a number of major weaknesses in the definitions and, in particular, that which applies to land sales. The current weaknesses in the definitions pose a risk to the tax base, and the bill proposes amendments to the income tax legislation to address them. The main changes will: • Address the weaknesses in the current definitions in relation to trusts. In particular, there will be new tests focussing on a trust’s settlor (that is, the person who provides the trust property). • Provide more robust rules aggregating the interests of associates to prevent the tests for associating two companies and a company and an individual being circumvented by the fragmentation of interests among close associates. • Implement a tripartite test associating two persons if they are each associated with the same third person, thereby making the associated persons tests as a whole more difficult to circumvent. The changes are consistent with a key theme of the government’s tax policy work programme, which is ensuring that the tax system is robust. The bill also rationalises the current income tax definition of associated persons and other income tax provisions that employ a similar concept, such as the definition of “related persons” in the dividend rules. This represents a significant simplification and makes the associated persons concept in the Income Tax Act more coherent. Application date The amendments will generally apply for the 2009–10 and later income years. However, for the purposes of the land provisions (as defined in section YA 1), except for section CB 11, the associated persons reforms will apply to land acquired on or after 1 April 2009. For the purposes of section CB 11 (disposal within ten years of improvement: building business), the reforms will apply to land on which improvements are begun on or after 1 April 2009. Therefore, in the case of the land provisions, the relevant date is 1 April 2009 irrespective of a person’s balance date. 78 Key features The reforms generally involve replacing the definitions of associated persons in the Income Tax Act 2007 with the objective of strengthening them. The other major part of the reforms involves rationalising other income tax provisions which employ a similar concept – for example, repealing the definition of “company control” in section YC 1. The tests of association in the new associated persons definition in subpart YB are as follows: • two companies; • a company and a person other than a company; • two relatives; • a person and a trustee for relative; • a trustee and a beneficiary; • trustees with a common settlor; • a trustee and a settlor; • a settlor and a beneficiary; • a trustee and a person with the power of appointment or removal of the trustee; • a partnership and a partner; • a partnership and an associate of a partner; and • two person who are each associated with the same third person (tripartite test). A number of modifications will apply to these tests for the purposes of the land provisions so they cover situations under the effective control of property dealers, developers and builders, but do not apply to other situations. These modifications include ensuring that the beneficiary-based associated persons tests – the trustee- beneficiary and settlor-beneficiary tests – do not apply in the case of land sales. It is not necessary to apply these tests to catch the type of structures being used to circumvent the land sale tax rules; the structures causing concern can be caught by the other new tests – in particular, the settlor-based trust and tripartite tests. The tripartite test, which associates two persons if they are each associated with the third person, will contain a number of modifications to ensure that it does not apply more widely than is necessary to protect the tax base. For example, partners in a partnership will not be automatically associated under the tripartite test unless they are separately associated with each other under another test such as that for relatives. Other modifications designed to ensure that the associated persons definitions do not apply more widely than is desirable are: • The test for associating relatives will extend to two degrees of relationship only, instead of four degrees as it does currently in the general associated persons definition. 79 • The definition of “settlor” that applies for the purposes of the associated persons tests will not include a person who provides services to a trust for less than market value. The income tax rules for dividends and fringe benefits will be amended by replacing their current associated persons tests with rules providing that: • If a company transfers value to a person and the transfer is caused by a shareholding in the company, the company has paid a dividend regardless of whether the recipient of the benefit is a shareholder. • If an employer provides a benefit because of an employment relationship, the employer has provided a fringe benefit subject to fringe benefit tax regardless of whether the recipient of the benefit is an employee. These reforms to the dividend and fringe benefit tax rules are considered a conceptually better approach to determining what should be subject to dividend taxation and fringe benefit taxation than the current associated persons rules. Background The associated persons definitions are used extensively in the Income Tax Act 2007 to determine whether persons are associated for the purposes of operative provisions in the Act. These operative provisions are often of an anti-avoidance nature, and recognise that transactions between related parties are more likely to be non-arm’s length than transactions between independent parties. These operative provisions mainly counter the non-arm’s length actions of associates by imputing the status or actions of an associated person to the taxpayer or requiring market value to be used. The most important application of the associated persons definitions in the Income Tax Act is probably in the area of land sales. Parliament’s intent in 1973, when it enacted the current land sale tax rules, was that land dealers, developers and builders are generally taxed on all gains on property sold within ten years of acquisition, and they cannot claim to hold non-taxable investment portfolios. This legislative intent is clear from the parliamentary debate. Hon W E Rowling, Minister of Finance, who introduced the relevant legislation, said: “Profits and gains from real property will now be assessed when ... the property was acquired by a land dealer and either was held as part of his land dealing business and later sold – in which case the profits will be assessable irrespective of the period between acquisition and sale – or, if it was not held as part of his land dealing business but is sold within ten years of acquisition, for example, claimed to be held as an investment but sold within this ten-year period.” It was therefore a deliberate decision by Parliament that gains on land sold by property developers within ten years of acquisition are generally taxed. There are some major weaknesses in the current associated persons definition which applies to land sales. These loopholes allow property dealers, developers and builders, who are meant to be taxed on such gains, to escape tax by operating through closely connected entities. 80 At present, the Income Tax Act has no coherent overall scheme for defining associated persons. There are number of shortcoming in the current definitions of associated persons. For example, some definitions do not consider some close relationships as being associated (for example, a settlor and a trustee). On the other hand, they treat some remoter relationships as being so (for example, fourth-degree relatives). The current structure of the associated persons definitions and other provisions employing a similar concept (such as the related person definition used in the dividend rules) create unnecessary complexity in the Income Tax Act. In March 2007, tax policy officials published an issues paper on suggested changes to the income tax definitions of associated persons. The paper examined the definitions with an emphasis on identifying their shortcomings and suggesting a number of changes to resolve the problems. The legislative changes proposed in the bill include modifications arising from the consultation process. This reform of the definition of associated persons in the Income Tax Act constitute their first comprehensive review since the inception of a definition in the income tax legislation in 1968. The proposals in the bill are designed to substantially address the current shortcomings in the associated persons definitions in the Income Tax Act – first, by addressing their weaknesses and, secondly, rationalising these and other provisions in the Income Tax Act which employ a similar concept. Detailed analysis Application of subpart YB Subpart YB, containing the associated persons definition provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007, will be substantially replaced. New section YB 1(4) states the general rule that the various associated persons tests in subpart YB apply for the purposes of the whole Act unless a provision expressly states otherwise. The main example where certain exceptions will apply in the new associated persons tests are the land provisions, which are defined in section YA 1. For example, the beneficiary-based associated persons tests contained in new section YB 6 (trustee- beneficiary test) and section YB 9 (settlor-beneficiary test) do not apply to the associated person rules in the land provisions. Also, the narrow range of relatives (spouses, civil union partners, de facto partners, and infant children) currently applying for the purposes of the company-individual and relatives tests will continue to apply in the new associated persons definitions for the purposes of the land provisions. New section YB 1(5) to (8) contain cross-references to several special rules that modify the associated persons definitions for the purpose of specific provisions. These special rules are contained in sections DS 4 (meaning of film reimbursement scheme), EB 13 (low-turnover valuation), EX 4 (limits to requirement to include associated person interests in the controlled foreign company rules), and LP 2 (tax credits for supplementary dividends). These special rules have not been changed as part of this reform of the associated persons definitions. 81 Two companies test (new section YB 2) New section YB 2(1) contains the primary test for associating two companies. It provides that two companies are associated if there is a group of persons whose total voting interests in each company are 50 percent or more. The concept of voting interests is defined in subpart YC. Under new section YB 2(2) two companies are associated if a market value circumstance exists for either company and there is a group of persons whose total market value interests in each company are 50 percent or more. A “market value circumstance” is defined in section YA 1 and a “ market value interest” is defined in subpart YC. Under the measurement of company ownership rules in subpart YC, a person’s interest in a company is generally measured by reference to their voting interests in the company. If these voting interests in certain circumstances – coming within the definition of “market value circumstance” in section YA 1 – do not reflect accurately the person’s economic interest in a company then the person’s interests are also measured by reference to their market value interests in the company. Finally, under new section YB 2(3) two companies are associated if a group of persons controls both companies by any other means. New section YB 2(4) contains an aggregation rule which provides that in determining whether two companies are associated, a person is treated as holding anything held by someone associated with them under sections YB 4 to YB 14. This aggregation rule is designed to prevent the two companies test being circumvented by the fragmentation of interests among associated persons, resulting in the 50 percent interest threshold not being reached. Set out below is an example of how this aggregation rule would work in the context of the land provisions. In this example the husband owns 100 percent of the voting interests in Company A, which is a property developer, and his wife holds 100 percent of the voting interests in Company B, which sells some land within ten years of acquisition. Without the aggregation rule, the two companies would not be associated despite their close community of interest. The application of the aggregation rule ensures that the two companies are associated under section YB 2(1), resulting in Company B being liable to tax on the sale of the land. 82 New section YB 2(5) provides that the control by any other means test does not apply to a company that is a state enterprise, Crown Research Institute, Crown health enterprise or a company that is part of the same group of companies as one of these Crown-related entities. New section YB 2(6) provides that in the international tax rules (defined in section YA 1) two companies are not associated if one, but not both, is a non-resident. Company and person other than a company test (new section YB 3) New section YB 3 contains a test for associating a company and a person other than a company (typically an individual, which is the reason this test is also referred to as the company-individual test). The main test contained in subsections (2) and (3) applies for the purposes of the whole Act except the land provisions. The primary test in new section YB 3(2) provides that a company and a person other than a company are associated if the person has a voting interest in the company of 25 percent or more. Voting interests are defined in subpart YC. Under new section YB 3(3), a company and a person other than a company are associated persons if a market value circumstance exists for the company and the person has a market value interest in the company of 25 percent or more. A “market value circumstance” is defined in section YA 1, and a “market value interest” is defined in subpart YC. An aggregation rule in new section YB 3(4) also applies for the purposes of the company-individual test. Accordingly, for the purposes of determining whether a company and an individual are associated, a person is treated as holding anything held by persons associated with them under sections YB 4 to YB 14. As for the two companies test, the aggregation rule in the company-individual test is designed to prevent the test being circumvented by the fragmentation of interests among associated persons, resulting in the interest threshold of 25 percent not being reached. The following example illustrates the application of the new aggregation rule in the company-individual test. 83 Without an aggregation rule, neither Sister A nor Sister B would be associated with Family Company under the company-individual test because their respective interests do not reach the required 25 percent threshold. However, under the aggregation rule in new section YB 3(4), both Sister A and Sister B would be associated with the company. This is because for the purposes of determining whether Sister A is associated with Family Company under section YB 3(2), she is treated as holding her sister’s 15 percent voting interest in the company, which when aggregated with her own 20 percent voting interest, means that Sister A is treated as holding a 35% interest and, therefore, is associated with the company. Similarly, Sister B is treated under the aggregation rule as holding Sister A’s 20 percent voting interest in the company, which when aggregated with Sister B’s own 15 percent interest also makes Family Company and Sister B associated persons. It should be noted that the aggregation rule is applied afresh to each person – as it was for each of the sisters in the example above. A more limited version of the company-individual associated persons test applies for the purposes of the land provisions: section YB 3(5) to (7). This test has the same ambit as that contained in new section OD 8(4)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2004. In particular, a company and an individual are associated if a voting interest (or market value interest if a market value circumstance exists for the company) in the company of 25 percent or more is held by: • the person • the person’s spouse, civil union partner, de facto partner or infant child • the trustee of a trust under which the person, his or her spouse, civil union partner, de facto partner or infant child has benefited or is eligible to benefit • a combination of the person and the other persons referred to above. For the purposes of section YB 3, a person other than a company includes a company acting in its capacity as a trustee of a trust. This treatment means that the company look through rules in subpart YC applying to voting and market value interests do not apply to a corporate trustee; therefore, the voting interests or market value interests held by a corporate trustee are not traced through to the shareholders of that corporate trustee. Given the non-look-through treatment of interests held by corporate trustees, it is appropriate to treat a corporate trustee (not being a bare trustee) as a person other than a company for the purpose of the test associating a company and a person other than a company. This amendment is of a clarifying nature only and is consistent with long- standing policy (Tax Information Bulletin, Vol. 3, No. 7, April 1992 at page 23). Relatives test (section YB 4) The blood relationships limb of the new associated persons test for relatives will extend only to the second degree of blood relationship, instead of the fourth degree as the current test does. This means that the blood relationships limb of the relatives test in new section YB 4(1)(a) will extend to grandparents and siblings but not to nephews and nieces (third degree) and cousins (fourth degree) as the relatives test in current section YB 9 does. 84 The second limb of the associated persons test for relatives provides that two persons who are married, in a civil union or are in a de facto relationship are associated (new section YB 4(1)(b)). The third limb of the relatives test provides that two persons are associated if one person is within two degrees of blood relationship to the other person’s spouse, civil union partner or de facto partner (new section YB 4(1)(c)). This limb associates persons with their in-laws and step-children. The first and third limbs of the general relatives associated persons test do not apply for the purposes of the land provisions (defined in section YA 1). Instead, for the purposes of the land provisions persons are associated because of a blood relationship only if one is the infant child of the other (section YB 4(2)). For the purposes of section YB 4, a child by adoption is treated as a natural child (section YB 4(3)). This treatment of adopted children continues the current position. The definition of “relative” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 will also be simplified so that it extends only to the second degree of blood relationship instead of also extending to the fourth degree of relationship. This involves omitting paragraph (c) of the current definition (which extends to the fourth degree of blood relationship) which leaves current paragraph (a) as the primary definition of “relative” in the Income Tax Act 2007. The new primary definition will include as a relative a trustee of a trust under which a relative has benefited or is eligible to benefit; this continues the effect of paragraph (c)(v) of the current relative definition. Person and trustee for relative test (new section YB 5) A person (first person) and a trustee of a trust under which a relative (as defined in section YB 4) of the first person has benefited or is eligible to benefit will be associated persons under new section YB 5. For example, a husband and a trustee of a trust under which the husband’s wife is a beneficiary would be associated under this test. Because it is only relatives as defined in new section YB 4 that are taken into account for the purposes of the trustee for relative test in new section YB 5, the limitations in section YB 4 that apply for the purposes of the land provisions would flow through to the test in section YB 5. Therefore, since persons are associated for the purposes of the land provisions because of a blood relationship only if one is the infant child of the other, the test in new section YB 5 would only extend this blood relationship, for the purposes of the land provisions, to associate a parent and a trustee of a trust under which the parent’s infant child has benefited or is eligible to benefit. Trustee and beneficiary test (new section YB 6) A trustee of a trust and a person who has benefited or is eligible to benefit under the trust will be associated persons under new section YB 6. This provision will not apply for the purposes of the land provisions. 85 Persons have benefited under a trust if they have received a distribution under the trust. Inland Revenue’s long-standing policy on when a person is eligible to benefit under a trust will continue (Tax Information Bulletin, Vol. 7, No. 9, February 1996 at page 25). In particular, a person is “eligible to benefit” when the person is either: • named by the trustee as a potential beneficiary; or • designated as a member of a class of potential beneficiaries, for example, “the children of ...” When trustees have a general power of appointment, persons not already appointed as beneficiaries under the power are not treated as being eligible to benefit. Therefore, a person who is eligible to benefit under a trust (as described above) does not need to have actually received a distribution (as defined in section HC 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007) under the trust to qualify as a beneficiary. An exception to this test for certain employee trusts is contained in new section YB 15. Two trustees with common settlor test (new section YB 7) Under new section YB 7, a trustee of a trust and a trustee of another trust will be associated persons if the same person is a settlor of both trusts. New section YB 10 provides that for the purposes of the new section YB 7, “settlor” has the meaning set out in section HC 27 of the Income Tax Act 2007, but does not include a person who provides services to a trust for less than market value. One effect of this modification is that a professional advisor who provides services to a trust at no charge will not be treated as a settlor of the trust. An exception to this test for certain employee trusts is contained in section YB 15. Trustee and settlor test (new section YB 8) A trustee of a trust and a settlor of the trust will be associated persons under new section YB 8. New section YB 10 provides that for the purposes of new section YB 8, “settlor” has the meaning set out in section HC 27, with the modification that a settlor does not include a person who provides services to a trust for less than market value. An exception to this test for certain employee trusts is contained in new section YB 15. Settlor and beneficiary test (new section YB 9) A settlor of a trust and a person who has benefited or is eligible to benefit under the trust will be associated persons under new section YB 9. This test does not apply for the purposes of the land provisions (defined in section YA 1). 86 New section YB 10 provides that for the purposes of new section YB 9, “settlor” has the meaning set out in section HC 27 with the modification that it does not include a person who provides services to a trust for less than market value. The comments above under the trustee and beneficiary test heading in relation to the meaning of when a person is eligible to benefit under a trust also apply for the settlor and beneficiary associated persons test. An exception to this test for certain employee trusts is contained in new section YB 15. The settlor-beneficiary test is a new associated persons test and is being implemented because there is considered to be a sufficient connection between a settlor and a beneficiary of a trust to justify treating them as associated persons. In particular, such a test is consistent with the settlor focus of the trust taxation rules in the Income Tax Act 2007. Trustee and person with power of appointment or removal (new section YB 11) A trustee of a trust and a person who has a power of appointment or removal of the trustee will be associated persons under new section YB 11. This test is intended to complement the trustee-settlor associated persons test. In many cases, a settlor of a trust, as the author of the instrument creating and governing the administration of the trust, retains the power to appoint or remove trustees. However, this power could be reposed in a separate person. It is considered that there is sufficient connection between a trustee of a trust and the person who has the power to appoint or remove the trustee to justify treating them as associated persons. Partnership and partner test (new section YB 12) A partnership and a partner in the partnership will be associated persons under new section YB 12. A separate associated persons rule applies in the case of a limited partnership (as defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007). A limited partnership and a limited partner are associated only if the limited partner has a partnership share of 25 percent or more in the limited partnership. Partnership and associate of partner test (new section YB 13) A partnership and a person associated with the partner (other than under this section) will be associated persons under new section YB 13. A common example of the application of this test would involve the spouse of a partner in a partnership. The spouse would be associated with the partner under the relatives test in new section YB 4, and the partner is associated with the partnership under the partnership and partner test in new section YB 12. Therefore the partnership and the spouse would be associated under the partnership and associate of partner test in new section YB 13. 87 It is necessary for the new provision to state that the person is associated with the partner in the partnership other than under new section YB 13 itself in order to prevent this test operating in a reiterative manner. The partnership and the associate of partner test described above does not apply in the case of a limited partnership (as defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007). A limited partnership and a person associated with a limited partner (other than under new section YB 13) are associated persons only if the limited partner has a partnership share of 25 percent or more in the limited partnership. Tripartite test (new section YB 14) The tripartite test in new section YB 14 will associate two persons if they are each associated with the same third person. The tripartite test acts as an important buttress to the other associated persons tests and makes the associated persons definition as a whole more difficult to circumvent. For the tripartite test to associate two persons, each of these persons must be associated, other than under the tripartite test itself, with the same third person. The requirement that the two persons cannot be associated with the same third person under the tripartite test itself is necessary to prevent the tripartite test operating in a reiterative manner. Set out below are two examples which illustrate the important role of the tripartite test in preventing the other associated persons tests being circumvented by arrangements involving the interposition of relatives, companies and trusts which are under the influence or control of the main protagonists. A Trust A Trust B settles Family Company 100% settles A settles two family trusts: Trust A and Trust B. Trust A in turn owns all the shares in Family Company. The issue is whether Family Company is associated with Trust B. Without the tripartite test in new section YB 14, Family Company and Trust B would not be associated, despite the close community of interests between them. However, Family Company and Trust B would be associated under the tripartite test, in conjunction with the test in new section YB 3 associating a company and a person other than a company (company-individual test) and the two trustees-common settlor test in new section YB 7. In particular, Family Company is associated with Trust A under the company-individual test, and Trust A is associated with Trust B under the two trustees- common settlor test. Therefore Family Company and Trust B would be associated under the tripartite test. 88 A A’s spouse Trust Family Company settles 100% A’s spouse settles Trust, which in turn owns all the shares in Family Company. The issue is whether A is associated with Family Company under the test associating a company and a person other than a company in new section YB 3 (company-individual test). Without the tripartite test in new section YB 14 and the rule in the company- individual test aggregating interests held by associated persons, A would not be associated with Family Company even though there is a large community of interest between them. However, A would be associated with Family Company under the company-individual test if that test was buttressed by the tripartite test, in conjunction with the aggregation rule and trustee-settlor tests. In particular, A would be treated for the purposes of the company-individual test as holding all the shares held by Trust in Family Company. This is because Trust is associated with A under the tripartite test: A is associated with her spouse under the relatives test and A’s spouse is associated with Trust under the settlor-trustee test, which means that A is associated with Trust under the tripartite test. The tripartite test in new section YB 14 contains a number of exceptions to ensure that the test does not apply more widely than is necessary to protect the tax base. In particular, the tripartite test will not apply to associate two persons if they are both associated with the same third person under the: • two companies test (new section YB 2); • company-individual test (new section YB 3); • relatives test (new section YB 4); • partnership-partner test (new section YB 12); or • partnership-associate of partner test (new section YB 13). It should be noted that it is necessary for the two persons to be associated with a third person under the same associated persons test (for example, the two companies test) before these exceptions apply. 89 Set out below are two examples of how these exceptions apply. In this example individuals X, Y and Z, who are not associated with each other, own all the shares in Company A, Company B and Company C. Without any modifications to the tripartite test, Company A and Company C would be associated, despite not having any common shareholders. However, because Company A and Company C are each associated with Company C under the two companies test, they are not associated under the tripartite test. A, B and C are individuals who are partners in a partnership. Without any modification to the tripartite test, A, B and C would be associated with each other under the tripartite test because they are each associated with the partnership under the partner-partnership test in new section YB 12. An exception to the tripartite test, however, means that these individuals are not associated with each other under the tripartite test through their association with the partnership. The individuals may still be associated with each other under a different associated persons test. For example, if individuals B and C were married they would be associated with each other under the relatives test in new section YB 4. Dividend rules The bill amends the dividend rules in subpart CD by replacing their current associated persons provisions with a rule providing that if a company transfers value to a person and the transfer is caused by a shareholding in the company, the company has paid a dividend regardless of whether the recipient of the benefit is a shareholder in the company. It is considered that the conceptually better approach for dividend taxation is whether a benefit has been provided because of a shareholding relationship rather than whether a company is associated with any person. It is already a requirement in the current dividend rules that the cause of a transfer of value from a company to a person is a shareholding in the company. 90 This change will be effected by replacing section CD 4(1)(a) so that the primary meaning of a dividend will be a transfer of value from a company to a person if the cause of the transfer is a shareholding in the company, whether or not the person holds shares in the company. This change means that section CD 6(1), which provides that a transfer of value is caused by a shareholding in the company in certain circumstances such as when the recipient is a shareholder or associated with a shareholder, can be omitted. Other references to section CD 6 in section CD 27 (providing that downward transfers of value within a group of companies are not dividends) and section FC 1(1)(d) (dealing with distributions in kind by a company) are consequentially amended. Fringe benefit tax rules Currently, fringe benefit tax applies to fringe benefits provided to associated persons of employees: section GB 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007. This associated persons provision will be replaced by rules providing that if an employer provides a benefit because of an employment relationship, the employer has provided a fringe benefit subject to fringe benefit tax, regardless of whether the recipient of the benefit is an employee. This is regarded as a conceptually more coherent approach to the taxation of fringe benefits and is similar to the approach described above in relation to dividends. The main difference between the approach for dividends and that for fringe benefits is that it is necessary to relate the benefit to a particular employee for fringe benefit tax rate purposes, whereas a connection to a specific shareholder is not necessary in the case of dividends because it is the recipient of the benefit that is treated as deriving a dividend and not the shareholder. This new approach in the fringe benefit tax rules will be effected mainly by amendments to sections GB 32 and CX 18 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section GB 32 will apply to benefits provided because of an employment relationship to persons other than employees. The focus of the amended section GB 32 will therefore be on whether the benefit is provided because of an employment relationship rather than whether the recipient of the benefit is associated with an employee. Current section CX 18 covers the situation when benefits are provided to associates of both employees and shareholders. It provides that in such cases the benefit is subject to the fringe benefit tax rules and is treated as not being a dividend. Section CX 18 will be amended to cover the situation when a benefit is provided because of both an employment relationship and a shareholding relationship; such a benefit will be treated as a fringe benefit subject to the fringe benefit tax rules and not a dividend. Rationalising associated persons references in operative provisions A number of operative provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 contain modifications or additional wording in their associated persons references. These modifications are a result of different combinations of the associated persons tests in current subpart YB applying, in particular, the parts of subpart YB that apply for the purposes of the whole Act (excluding the 1973, 1988 and 1990 version provisions) or the 1988 version provisions (corresponding to the associated persons definitions in section OD 7 and OD 8(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994). An example of such a provision is section EX 21(15) (after a remedial amendment in the bill that is effective from 1 April 2008). 91 These modifications to the associated person references in the operative provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 will be generally omitted because they are effectively subsumed by the various reforms to the associated persons tests in subpart YB. The wording of these operative provisions can therefore be significantly simplified because they will simply refer to persons being associated without more (for example, without various references to the 1973, 1988 or 1990 version provisions). As a result, the wording of the associated person references in the operative provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 will be streamlined and easier to understand. For example, the wording of section GB 28(2) (after a remedial amendment in the bill that is effective from 1 April 2008) is: “A person is treated as being associated with another person if a person would be treated as being associated under the parts of subpart YB (associated persons and nominees) that apply for the purposes of the whole Act (excluding the 1973, 1988, and 1990 version provisions), or the 1988 version provisions, at the time the services are personally performed by the working person.” This wording will be replaced simply by: “A person is treated as being associated with another person if they are associated at the time the services are personally performed by the working person.” The definitions of the 1973, 1988 and 1990 version provisions and current section YB 20 will be repealed because they are largely subsumed by the various reforms to the associated persons tests in subpart YB. These definitions equate to the lists of operative provisions to which the former specific associated persons definitions in sections OD 8(4), OD 8(3) and OD 8(1) of the Income Tax Act 2004 applied. However, because of the various modifications that apply in the associated persons tests in relation to the land transaction provisions, currently referred to as the “1973 version provisions”, this definition will be re-enacted in section YA 1 and called “land provisions”. The new associated persons definition in the Income Tax Act 2007 will apply also in the Tax Administration Act 1994 because of section 3(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. A number of the current specific modifications or additional wording in the associated persons references in the operative provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 are currently incorrect. The bill corrects these references from the commencement of the Income Tax Act 2007 on 1 April 2008, even though these references are themselves being omitted as part of the reform of the associated persons definitions in the Income Tax Act 2007. It is necessary to correct these references from the commencement of the Income Tax Act 2007 on 1 April 2008 because the associated person reforms do not apply until the 2009–10 income year. Omitted tests Several associated persons tests contained in the current subpart YB of the Income Tax Act 2007 are being omitted for simplification and rationalisation purposes. These omitted tests are: • The test associating two persons if they habitually act together (current section YB 18). 92 • The test associating a person and a charity, friendly society, or non-profit body controlled by that person or a relative of that person (current section YB 19). • The tests associating two companies and a company and a non company, which are based on income interests (current sections YB 3 and YB 7). These tests are redundant given the equivalent comprehensive tests based on voting interests. The existence of these tests can be explained historically by the fact that they were originally enacted in 1988 before the voting interest concept was enacted in 1992. Rationalisation of other provisions A number of provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 embodying a related person concept, similar to that in the associated persons definitions, will be rationalised. It is desirable, from a simplification perspective, for similar concepts in the Act to be addressed similarly. Replacing company control definition with associated persons definition Section YC 1, which defines when a company is treated as being under the control of any persons, will be repealed, and its function performed by the new associated persons definition. The definition of company control in section YC 1 and the definitions of associated persons in subpart YB are conceptually similar in that they define related parties for the purposes of operative provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007. The separate use of the section YC 1 company control definition rather than the associated persons definitions is probably a legacy of the company control definition being developed in the Income Tax Act before the associated persons definitions. The company control definition in the Act was first implemented in 1939, whereas the first associated persons definition in the Act was not enacted until 1968. Allowing section YC 1 to be subsumed by the new associated persons definition is a desirable simplification measure. The provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 which currently employ the section YC 1 definition of company control and which will be amended to use the new associated persons definition are section GC 5 (leases for inadequate rent), section RF 11 (dividends paid to companies under control of non-residents), and paragraph (a) of the definition of “holding company” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. There are also a number of provisions in other Acts which utilise current section YC 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. These section YC 1 references will be replaced with references to the new associated persons definition in the Income Tax Act 2007. The provisions in these other Acts are: • Insolvency Act 2006, section 182(1); • Public Service Investment Society Management Act (No.2) 1979, section 2(2); • Trustee Companies Management Act 1975, section 2(2); and • Unit Trusts Act 1960, section 3(4). 93 Replacing related person definition with associated person definition Section CD 44(15) to (17) of the Income Tax Act 2007 contains a definition of “related person” which is used for determining the amount of the capital gain exclusion from a dividend arising from the realisation of a capital asset in the course of a company’s liquidation. As part of the amendments to rationalise the Income Tax Act provisions which embody an associated persons concept, the function of the related person definition in section CD 44 will be performed by the new associated person definition. The two definitions are conceptually very similar, and replacing the related person definition with the new associated persons definition is a worthwhile simplification measure. The amendments involve repealing sections CD 44(15) to (17) and replacing the related person references in sections CD 44(11) and (12) with references to associated persons. The references to related person in the dividend definition in section YA 1 will also be replaced with references to associated persons. Section CD 22(9) amendment The definition of “fifteen percent interest reduction” in section CD 22(9), which relates to the share buy-back exclusion from the dividend definition, refers to “counted associate”, which is defined inter alia as “a trustee of a trust under which a spouse, civil union partner or de facto partner, or minor child of the shareholder is a beneficiary”. This wording is being amended to be made consistent with other references in the associated persons definitions which describe discretionary beneficiaries; the provision will therefore refer to a person who has benefited or is eligible to benefit under a trust. Section DB 42(2) amendment Section DB 42(1) allows a taxpayer a deduction for any loss arising through misappropriation by an employee. Section DB 42(2) states that this deduction is not available if the taxpayer and the defalcating employee are associated in certain ways. The new associated persons definition is comprehensive enough to cover all the relationships described in current section DB 42(2). Therefore the specific associated persons tests in this provision will be replaced by a standard associated persons reference. Section DB 42(2) will provide that the section does not apply when a person who misappropriates property is associated with the person who carries on the business. 95 Other policy matters 97 TAX TREATMENT OF EMISSIONS TRADING UNITS (Clauses 9, 31, 48, 61, 81, 84, 85, 98, 187, 408 and 524) Summary of proposed amendments New provisions inserted into the Income Tax Act 2007 provide for the tax treatment of emissions trading units. Most costs of emissions trading will be tax-deductible, and the government subsidy (the award of “free” emission units by government) of emissions costs will generally be assessable. The specific taxation treatment varies depending on the emissions type, of which there are four: • non-forestry – generally dealt with on an accruals basis; • post-1989 forestry – dealt with on a cash basis; • pre-1990 forestry where the land is held on capital account – outside the tax system; and • pre-1990 forestry where the land is held on revenue account – special rules apply. There are special rules for the surrender of emission units to government and for the timing of the recognition of income arising from the government subsidy. Emissions units will be treated as excepted financial arrangements that are revenue account property. Thus emissions units will generally be deductible upon acquisition, but added back at cost at year end to the extent they are still on hand. The changes proposed in the present bill are interdependent with tax amendments contained in the Climate Change (Emissions Trading and Renewable Preference) Bill, which was introduced in December 2007 and is still before Parliament. For that reason, the relevant amendments in the earlier bill are repeated in this bill. This commentary covers both sets of proposed tax amendments. This bill amends the Income Tax Act 2007. The only businesses that will deal with emissions units under the Income Tax Act 2004 are forestry businesses, and their position is addressed by amendments to the Income Tax Act 2004 introduced in the Climate Change Bill. Amendments are also made to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to deal with emissions units. Both the supply of emissions units and the actual or deemed supply of any services in exchange for emission units are zero-rated. Application date The amendments take effect from 1 January 2009. 98 Key features New section CB 36 provides that the disposal of emission units is taxable, other than when the disposal is of a unit allocated in relation to pre-1990 forestry land which is held on capital account – disposal of such a unit is on capital account. The net income to be returned will depend on the tax cost of the units disposed of – this is either actual cost, or tax value determined by subpart ED. When the disposal is by way of surrender to meet an emissions obligation, special rules apply (generally within section CB 36) to ensure that, generally, the act of surrender does not itself create a deduction. The exceptions are in relation to forestry in some circumstances. New section CX 51B provides that the receipt of “free” emission units awarded by government does not by itself cause income to be received. Section DB 60 provides that “free” emission units awarded by government are acquired at a nil cost. Emission units are added to the list of excepted financial arrangements in section EW 5(3) and excluded from the part E trading stock treatment by new section EB 2(3)(i). The standard excepted financial arrangement valuation methods of first-in first-out or weighted average cost set out in section ED 1 will generally apply. Separate pools of emissions units are specified to ensure that they can be correctly tracked and that the intended treatment of “free” emission units awarded by the government is not frustrated. Section ED 1 is also amended to provide that “replacement units” are effectively valued at nil, thus ensuring a deduction in the year of their acquisition. (If such units are surrendered in the year of acquisition the surrender process detailed in section CB 36 will provide the deduction.) Section ED 1B provides that income from non-forestry “free” emission units awarded by the government is recognised on an emerging basis over the period to which the award relates (usually an emissions year). The exception to this is that if the emerging income has not yet been recognised, a disposal of units will itself result in net income because the units will have a nil cost base at this stage. Amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1984 are also made. Section 11A(1), which generally lists zero-rated services, is amended with the addition of two new paragraphs, (s) and (t). Paragraph (s) adds the supply of emissions units to the list of zero-rated services, provided those emissions units are supplied under an arrangement entered into on or after 1 January 2009. This preserves the existing GST treatment of arrangements entered into outside the emissions trading scheme between the government and industry. Paragraph (t) adds the supply of services made in exchange for the supply of a zero-rated emissions unit to the list of zero-rated services. 99 Example 1, below, shows the tax consequences of some of the transactions in emissions units a forestry business might undertake. Example 2 shows the tax consequences of some of the transactions in emissions units which a non-forestry business might undertake. Background Emissions trading rules are contained in the Climate Change (Emissions Trading and Renewable Preference) Bill, which is before Parliament. That bill proposes the insertion of provisions into the Climate Change Response Act 2002, under which: • businesses in certain sectors will be required to surrender emission units based on their emissions; and • the government may allocate “free” emission units to businesses in certain sectors. Amendments to income tax legislation are required to ensure that the tax treatment of emission units is clear, income and expenditure are recognised appropriately, and no unintended distortions arise, such as a mismatch of recognition or timing of income and expenditure. Amendments to GST legislation are proposed to ensure that acquisitions and disposals of GST units can take place across international markets, where buyers and sellers will not be known to each other and where transactions may have multiple counterparties. Example 1: Post-1989 forest business DE Forestry has an exotic forest plantation planted in 1991 and has elected into the emissions trading scheme. For the 2009 emissions year, DE Forestry received an allocation of 100 emissions units. It sold 30 units immediately, for $10 each, and retained 70. The election and the receipt of units have no taxation consequences. The sale proceeds of 30 x $10 = $300 derived in 2009 are taxable, and there is a nil cost base. In 2011 DE Forestry bought 30 units on the market for $15 each. The purchase cost of 30 x $15 = $450 is deductible in 2011, and, as the units are “replacement” units (units purchased to replace post-1989 units previously sold), the year end valuation rule provides that they can be valued at nil, rather than cost. This gives a net deduction in 2011 for these units. In 2012, DE Forestry harvested its forest and was required to surrender 100 units. The harvest and the subsequent settling of the emissions obligation have no taxation consequences. 100 Example 2: Non-forestry business AB Co manufactures product Z for export. Carbon dioxide is emitted as part of manufacturing product Z, and the provisions of the Climate Change Bill will require AB Co to surrender the commensurate number of emission units following the end of each emissions year. The government will issue an allocation plan under the provisions of the Climate Change Bill under which businesses which make product Z for export are entitled to receive “free” emission units. AB Co is issued 100 free units for the emissions year which runs from 1 January to 31 December 2015. AB Co’s expected emissions liability for the emissions year is 800 units. AB Co has a 30 June balance date. On 30 April 2015, AB Co buys a further 150 emissions units for $8 each. On 30 June 2015, emission units are trading at $10 each. The following calculations are required for AB Co’s 2014-15 tax return. Under existing law, AB Co will be entitled to a deduction on an emerging basis for its emissions obligations. Assuming emissions are exactly the same level every month, at the end of the 2014-15 income year, the proportion of the emissions liability to be recognised is 6/12 x 800 units = 400 units. The fraction 6/12 is simply the number of months in the 2015 emissions year which have elapsed at the end of the 2014–15 income year. The 2014–15 income year deduction for the accrued liability to surrender 400 units will be calculated as follows: • 150 units x $8 = $1,200. This is the portion of the liability matched to the 150 units which have been purchased, valued at the cost price of those units. • 250 units x $10 = $2,500, which is the remaining portion of the liability, valued at the market value of those units at balance date. Any variance between the year end market value and the eventual actual cost of the 250 units required will be brought to account in the following income year. The 100 free units are not relevant to calculation of the deduction. The total deduction for the liability accrued in 2014–15 to surrender 400 units is therefore $1,200 + $2,500 = $3,700. The approach taken to recognition of the income from the 100 free units is similar. Income from the 100 allocated units will be recognised over the period to which the allocation applies, on a basis which matches the allocated units to the costs that they are intended to compensate for. AB Co will therefore recognise as income the value of 400/800 x 100 units = 50 units at the end of its 2014–15 income year. The fraction 400/800 is the number of units of emissions actually emitted in the 2015 emissions year at the end of the 2014–15 income year, divided by the number of units of emissions expected for the entire 2015 emissions year. The balance date market value of the units is used to calculate the income, so this is 50 units x $10 = $500. However, if the 100 units were sold immediately upon receipt for $8 each (and this might occur if the business does not have a direct emissions obligation, but rather is downstream from a business with emission obligations), then the sale proceeds of $800 would be income. The units sold would have no cost base. 101 TAX TREATMENT OF REIMBURSEMENTS AND HONORARIA PAID TO VOLUNTEERS (Clauses 23 and 39) Summary of proposed amendments The bill introduces specific tax rules for the treatment of payments that reimburse expenditure incurred in undertaking voluntary activities. Reimbursement payments received by people who meet the qualifying criteria for being considered a volunteer will be treated as exempt income under the new provisions. The rules also make it clear that a payment characterised as an honorarium, even if it includes an element of reimbursement for expenditure incurred, is treated as a schedular payment and the PAYE rules apply to the whole payment. Application date The new rules for the treatment of reimbursements paid to volunteers will apply from 1 April 2009. Key features New section CO 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides a general rule treating reimbursement payments for expenditure incurred in undertaking voluntary activities as income. New section CW 62B provides that: • Reimbursement payments that are based on actual expenses incurred by volunteers in undertaking voluntary activities will be treated as exempt income. • If a paying organisation puts in place a process for making a reasonable estimate of the amount of expenditure likely to be incurred by a volunteer for which reimbursement is payable, then payments based on that estimate will also be treated as exempt income. This will provide flexibility, such as when it is not practical for organisations to reimburse their volunteers on the basis of actual costs incurred. It is intended that this will include reimbursements in non-cash form such as petrol vouchers. The proposed treatment will extend to reimbursement of transport costs incurred in getting to and from the place of volunteering, as well as costs incurred in the course of volunteering. Volunteers are defined as people who: • are resident in New Zealand under subpart YD (Residence and source in New Zealand); and 102 • freely undertake an activity in New Zealand: – chosen either by themselves or a group of which they are a member; and – that provides a benefit to another person; and – for which there is no purpose or intention of private pecuniary gain. The new section also clarifies the treatment of a payment that is partly honorarium and partly reimbursement. In that case, the whole payment is to be treated as a schedular payment, and the PAYE rules apply. This does not alter the provision that allows an organisation making mixed schedular payments to apply for a determination under section RD 8(3) (Schedular payments). Under section RD 8(3) the Commissioner may determine how much expenditure the recipient of the payment has incurred in deriving that payment and the amount of the determination is not subject to withholding tax. For clarity, the term “honorarium” is defined for the purposes of both new section CW 62B and schedule 4, part B (Rates of tax for schedular payments). The new section makes it clear that the proposed tax treatment will apply regardless of whether reimbursements are paid progressively through the year or in a lump sum. Background In November 2007 Inland Revenue released the issues paper The tax treatment of honoraria and reimbursements paid to volunteers. It outlined options for clarifying the tax treatment of volunteer reimbursements and honoraria, to make it easier for volunteers and community organisations to comply with their tax obligations. One of the long-standing problems for volunteers and the organisations who use their services is that our tax laws are unclear about how reimbursement payments made to volunteers should be taxed. Under a strict interpretation, such payments are considered income and the relevant expenses are deductible. That means the income should be stated and expenses claimed in the volunteer’s income tax return. Because volunteers and community organisations have often been uncertain about their tax obligations relating to reimbursements, an inconsistent range of administrative practices has developed, resulting in high compliance costs for many of them. Similar problems relating to tax obligations have arisen over payments of honoraria. Honoraria are schedular payments from which the payer, under current law, must deduct tax at the rate of 33 cents in the dollar. However, payments that are characterised as honoraria sometimes include reimbursements along with a fee for service, or may even be wholly reimbursement payments. Recipients of such payments must file a tax return before their tax position can be finalised. 103 FILM AND GOVERNMENT FUNDING (Clauses 36, 45, 46, 62, 63, 65, 69, 70, 89-92, 408, 470, 471 and 473) Summary of proposed amendments Amendments are being made to tax law following the Budget 2008 announcement that, from 1 July, a new film grant, the New Zealand Screen Production Incentive Fund (SPIF) grant, will be available for “New Zealand” film and other screen formats. The tax amendments are being made to turn off the immediate deduction incentive provided in current law for films that attract SPIF grants. The bill also makes consequential amendments in relation to SPIF grant co-funding by government agencies. Amendments will also give Large Budget Screen Production Grants (LBSPG) standard grant treatment, which prevents the creation of artificial losses. Application date The principal amendments will apply from 1 July 2008. Changes to the LBSPG will apply from 1 April 2009. Key features SPIF grants will receive the standard grant treatment – meaning that deductible expenditure will be reduced by the amount of the grant. No law change is necessary to achieve this. The Income Tax Act 2007 is being amended as follows: • The definition of “Government Screen Production Payment” will be used to describe both LBSPG and SPIF grants. • Film that receives a SPIF grant will be deductible over the more usual two–year period, rather than qualify for the immediate deduction incentive. • The standard grant treatment will also explicitly apply to any funding from government funding organisations that is in addition to funding received via SPIF grants. This further reduces the allowable deductible expenditure of the production by the value of the additional funding from government funding organisations. Any payments to these funding bodies will, however, be deductible. • From 1 April 2009 the LBSPG will also being given the standard grant treatment. The Tax Administration Act 1994 will be amended so that tax auditing and secrecy obligations for the LBSPG also apply to SPIF grants. 104 Background As part of Budget 2008, the government announced a new film grant – the SPIF grant. Under the terms of the grant, “New Zealand” feature films will be eligible for a 40 percent grant and other “New Zealand” screen formats will be eligible for a 20 percent grant. The Film Commission will have overall responsibility for administration and will pay the grant, but Inland Revenue will be responsible for verifying the cost of the production to enable the grant to be quantified. Detailed analysis Standard grant treatment Under current legislation, the LBSPG does not receive standard grant treatment. This means that expenditure arising from funds given through this scheme to a production is treated as deductible for the production. This has resulted in the creation of artificial tax losses, and some film companies can use these losses, while others cannot. Under the new rules, the LBSPG and the SPIF grants are both afforded standard grant treatment, which, in this case, reduces the deductible expenditure by the amount of the grant. The LBSPG changes are achieved through the repeal of section CW 37 and the removal of the reference to the LBSPG in sections CX 47(3) and DF 1(6) of the Income Tax Act 2007. These changes are to apply from 1 April 2009, which should give any productions already planning to deduct expenditure derived in relation to a LBSPG payment sufficient warning to allow for the change. Introduction of SPIF grants References to “LBSPG” will be replaced by the generic, defined term “Government Screen Production Payment”, which covers both the LBSPG and SPIF grants. The repeal of the definition of the term “Large Budget Screen Production Grant” will occur from 1 April 2009 to coincide with the time LBSPG payments are given standard grant treatment. Removal of early deduction incentive As was done for LBSPG films, films that receive a SPIF grant will not also be entitled to the immediate deduction tax incentive. Rather, amendments made to subpart EJ (which, among other things, governs the timing of the deduction for film) will provide that the deduction is available over a two-year period. 105 Co-funding Government agencies such as the New Zealand Film Commission, NZ On Air, the New Zealand Film Production Fund Trust and Te Māngai Pāho are unable to provide additional funding (co-funding) to a production if that production has already received a LBSPG payment. However, these agencies can provide co-funding to productions that receive the SPIF grant. In these circumstances, the value of the additional government funding received by these agencies will also be unavailable as deductible expenditure. This will be done in a similar fashion to how government grants are treated and will formalise a practice already used by the Film Commission. The result is that, for tax purposes, the cost of the film or other screen format will be actual cost reduced by all government funding. When the funding from these government agencies comes with repayment obligations they will now explicitly be deductible. This is necessary to properly balance the changed treatment of the receipt of the co-funding from government agencies. These amendments are being made through the insertion of new sections CX 48B and DF 5. Tax Administration Act amendments Inland Revenue will have responsibility for verifying expenditure for the grant, which will be administered and paid out by the Film Commission. Sections 81(4)(p), 85F and 87(5)(d) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 are being amended so that those responsible for the administration of the SPIF grants are subject to the same secrecy requirements as those responsible for the administration of the LBSPG. 106 CLARIFYING THE TAX STATUS OF GENERAL INSURANCE RISK MARGINS (Clauses 29, 79, 408, 546 and 555) Summary of proposed amendments Amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 clarify that movements in a general insurer’s outstanding claims reserve (OCR) determined under the requirements of International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 4 will be deductible, provided certain requirements are met: the amount of the movement and how it is determined are well documented, reflect the company’s business experience, and are made for sound commercial or business reasons and not for income tax purposes. Application date The amendments apply from the first income year that the insurer adopts IFRS 4. Key features An insurer who uses IFRS 4 for accounting for its general insurance contracts may claim as a tax deduction (section DW 4) or return as income (section CR 3) the movement between the opening and closing OCR for the income year, provided the amount is “actuarially determined”. The OCR means the amount of a person’s outstanding claims liability for general insurance contracts, excluding contracts for which section FC 14 applies, determined under Appendix D paragraphs 5.1 to 5.2.12 of IFRS 4. The amount is “actuarially determined” when its calculation and methodology are certified by an actuary, but does not include an amount: • that does not accurately reflect the insurer’s business experience; • is not made according to usual business practice; and • is, or is part of, a tax avoidance arrangement. The amendment will not cover deductions for pre-IFRS 4 OCR movements, which will still need to be considered according to ordinary tax principles. Background Under IFRS 4, the OCR of a general insurance company has two components. The first, the “central estimate”, is the average present value of expected future payments. The second is a risk margin, which is a prudential addition to reflect the inherent uncertainty of the central estimate. IFRS 4 does not say how either of the components should be calculated, so reliance is placed on actuarial standards and practice. 107 Many general insurers already claim a tax deduction for the entire annual movement in the OCR. While it is clear that the movement in the central estimate is tax deductible under general tax principles, the law is unclear on the deductibility of the movement in the risk margin, though it is likely to be determined on the facts of each insurer. The amendments remove the uncertainty and confirm deductibility for financial accounts prepared under IFRS 4 provided certain other requirements are met. 108 CHANGES TO THE TAX TREATMENT OF PETROLEUM MINING (Clauses 71, 73, 74, 93-97, 551, 553, 554, 558, 559, 560, 561 and 562) Summary of proposed amendments As part of the government’s tax policy work programme a number of proposed amendments have been included in this taxation bill. The bill contains following proposals for the petroleum mining rules: • Deductions for expenditure on petroleum mining undertaken via a branch in another country will be allowed to be allocated only against petroleum mining income from foreign branch operations. The amendment ensures that New Zealand receives its proper share of benefit from New Zealand petroleum resources by preventing foreign branch petroleum mining expenditure being offset against income in New Zealand. • Further amendments remove disincentives that may affect investment in oil and gas exploration and development in New Zealand. For example, modern drilling techniques have made the current onshore offshore boundary unsustainable. • A remedial amendment ensures that a petroleum mining anti-avoidance provision does not inappropriately reduce a taxpayer's deductions. Application date • The amendment relating to petroleum mining expenditure incurred by a branch in another country, will apply to expenditure incurred on or after 4 March 2008. • The amendment that removes disincentives that may affect investment will apply to expenditure incurred on or after 1 April 2008. • The remedial amendment to the petroleum mining anti-avoidance provision will apply from 1 December 2007. Key features Expenditure on petroleum mining operations undertaken through a branch in another country Expenditure incurred on petroleum mining operations undertaken through a branch in another country will be allowed to be deducted only from income from foreign petroleum mining operations. The effect is to prevent foreign branch petroleum mining expenditure being offset against income from petroleum mining in New Zealand, so that tax is paid on it. This change will also prevent this expenditure from being used to offset non-petroleum mining income. Petroleum mining expenditure not allocated in a current year is carried forward and is available for allocation in the next income years. The amount that can be allocated in future years is capped to the amount of income that a petroleum miner earns from those petroleum mining operations in that country. 109 Removing existing impediments to investment The amendments are intended to remove disincentives that may affect investment in oil and gas exploration and development in New Zealand. Removing the onshore offshore boundary The bill repeals the current distinction between onshore and offshore petroleum mining development and allows deductions for petroleum development expenditure to be allocated from the date that expenditure is incurred. Section EJ 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007 currently allows different starting points for the allocation of deductions for onshore and offshore petroleum development expenditure. Modern drilling and oil and gas extraction techniques have made the current onshore offshore boundary unsustainable. The amendment replaces the two starting points with a single starting point and allows deductions for petroleum development expenditure to start to be allocated in the year that development expenditure is incurred. Consequential amendments will also be made to the Income Tax Act 2004. Units of production amortisation Under the proposed changes, petroleum miners will be able to elect to amortise development expenditure under either the current straight-line method or on the proposed units of production basis. The changes deal with a concern that petroleum miners may be discouraged under the current rules from investing in projects that have a shorter life span. Allowing development costs to be amortised over the life of the project more appropriately reflects the allocation of development costs over the life of the field. Petroleum miners will be able to choose to allocate development expenditure under the units of production method in the year that commercial production begins. The bill also proposes that a 50 percent reserves estimate be used for the unit of production amortisation. It also allows a deduction for any unallocated expenditure when a production well stops producing, when a taxpayer is amortising development expenditure under the units of production method. Consequential amendments will also be made to the Income Tax Act 2004. Deduction for expenditure on a dry well Petroleum miners will be allowed a deduction for the cost of a dry production well. A dry production well is one that is completed but will never produce petroleum in commercial quantities. A deduction for such expenditure will be allowed if the well is abandoned. Consequential amendments will also be made to the Income Tax Act 2004. 110 Remedial amendment to petroleum mining anti-avoidance provision A remedial change is being made to a petroleum mining anti-avoidance provision in the Income Tax Act 2004 and Income Tax Act 2007 – section DT 2 – to ensure that it does not apply more broadly than intended. Section DT 2 is aimed at preventing double deductions for the same amount of expenditure. However, in some cases it could give the inappropriate result of reducing a taxpayer's deductions from a single deduction to no deduction at all. The amendment to section DT 2 will prevent this inappropriate result by excluding from the provision transactions involving the disposal of foreign petroleum mining assets. The proposed amendment will apply from 1 December 2007. Background On 4 March 2008, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue announced changes to the tax treatment of foreign branches of petroleum miners. The changes will safeguard tax revenue from New Zealand’s growing petroleum production. The concern was that New Zealand may not receive its proper share of benefit from New Zealand petroleum resources as a result of arrangements involving expenditure on petroleum mining operations undertaken through a foreign branch being offset against New Zealand income. On 26 November 2007, tax policy officials released a consultative paper on possible changes to the tax treatment of petroleum mining expenditure. The proposed legislative changes are primarily designed to remove the uncertainty and disincentives to petroleum exploration and development in the current tax rules. 111 NIUE DEVELOPMENT (Clause 219) Summary of proposed amendment This amendment allows the 66 percent common ownership requirement for loss grouping to be varied by Order in Council in relation to Niue development projects. The purpose of the concession is to assist in the development of the Niuean economy. Application date The amendment comes into force on 1 April 2008 and has effect for the 2008–09 and subsequent income years. Key features The proposed amendment allows the percentage thresholds in sections IC 2(2), IC 3 and IC 5(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007 to be varied by Order in Council in relation to Niue development companies. An order may be made if the Governor General is satisfied that the company is carrying on a business that has been or is carried on wholly or mainly for the development of Niue or has been or is important to the development of Niue. Alternatively, an order may be made if the Governor General is satisfied that the company has incurred expenditure wholly or mainly in deriving income from Niue or in the course of carrying on a business in Niue for the purpose of deriving income. The order must name the company or companies with a tax loss to which the varied threshold should apply (referred to as company A in subpart IC). The relaxation of the common ownership requirement would be effected by replacing the percentage figure specified in section IC 3(1)(a) and (b) with a lower figure. Section IC 6(1) provides that the common ownership requirement applies for the commonality period. This is the period beginning from the start of the income year in which company A incurs the loss and ending at the end of the income year in which company B (the company to which the loss is made available) uses that loss. The order may specify a period or periods for which it applies. If no period is specified, the order applies for the whole of the commonality period. Background Currently, under section IC 3, losses incurred by one company can be offset against the profits of another company only if there is at least 66 percent common ownership of the two companies. This is intended to allow the ultimate shareholders of a group of companies to obtain immediate relief for a loss, while ensuring that the people who enjoy that relief are those who actually bore the economic loss in the first place. 112 The immediate intention is to use this order-making power to vary the common ownership threshold of two joint ventures which the New Zealand-based Reef Group is engaged in with the Government of Niue, in Niue. This will enable Reef to set losses incurred by the joint ventures against its other group profits. This is a concessionary measure intended to assist in the development of Niue’s economy. 113 RAISING CERTAIN TAX THRESHOLDS (Clauses 83, 105, 106, 109-114, 387(5) & (8), 389, 390, 494, 526 and 527) Summary of proposed amendments The amendments will raise certain tax thresholds, as outlined in the government discussion document, Reducing tax compliance costs for small and medium-sized enterprises, released in December 2007. The amendments are largely aimed at helping to reduce tax compliance costs for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), although some will also apply to other individuals and businesses generally. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2009. Key features The following changes to tax thresholds are being introduced: • Section RD 22 of the Income Tax Act 2007 is being amended to raise the threshold for filing and paying Pay As You Earn (PAYE) once a month from $100,000 to $250,000 (based on annual PAYE and SSCWT deductions). This will allow more employers to file and pay PAYE deductions once a month instead of twice a month. • Sections RD 60 and 61 of the Income Tax Act 2007 are being amended to raise the number of employers that can file and pay fringe benefit tax (FBT) returns on an annual basis rather than quarterly. The threshold for filing FBT on an annual basis is being raised from $100,000 to $250,000 (based on annual PAYE and SSCWT deductions). In addition, closely held businesses will be allowed to file FBT returns annually, regardless of their annual PAYE and SSCWT deductions, when their FBT liability arises solely from the provision of up to two vehicles for shareholder-employees. • Section 120KE of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is being amended to raise the safe harbour threshold for provisional tax use-of-money interest (UOMI) from $35,000 to $50,000 (based on annual residual income tax). This will allow more taxpayers to use the standard uplift method of calculating provisional tax rather than estimating their liability. • Section EB 23 of the Income Tax Act 2007 is being amended to raise the exemption threshold for low-value trading stock from $5,000 to $10,000 (based on the value of trading stock). This will allow more businesses for which stock on hand is an incidental part of their business to use a simplified valuation rule for tax purposes. 114 • Sections EW 54 to 60 of the Income Tax Act 2007 are being amended to allow non-individuals (such as companies and trusts) to return income tax for financial arrangements on a cash accounting basis. Currently, only individuals may account for financial arrangements using the cash basis. • Section EW 17 of the Income Tax Act 2007 is being amended to raise the threshold for allowing financial arrangements to be accounted for on a straight- line basis from $1.5 million to $1.85 million (based on the total level of financial arrangements). This means fewer taxpayers will have to make complex calculations when calculating their tax liabilities on financial arrangements. • Section 51 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 is being amended to raise the threshold above which GST registration is required, from $40,000 to $50,000 (based on annual GST turnover). This will allow more taxpayers to exit the GST base if they wish to do so, thus enjoying the associated compliance savings that this entails. • Section 15 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 is being amended to raise the threshold for filing GST on a six-monthly basis from $250,000 to $500,000 (based on annual turnover). This will allow more taxpayers to file GST returns on that basis if they wish to do so. Background Compliance with tax laws can entail significant time and costs for many businesses. Compliance costs can arise because of the variety of tax compliance activities involved (for example, performing tax calculations, seeking advice, record-keeping, filing returns and making tax payments), and the complexity of tax law and administrative procedures. These costs often have a disproportionate effect on SMEs, which make up approximately 96 percent of businesses in New Zealand. Reducing the complexity of the tax rules means that taxpayers are less likely to require expert assistance, and are less likely to make errors. As well as reducing tangible costs, such as hours spent and expenditure on accounting fees, reducing the complexity of the tax rules allows business operators to spend more time on their businesses. Tax thresholds can be changed by increasing the level at which they are set, and by extending the types of taxpayers that may elect to use them. Changing a tax threshold can reduce compliance costs in several ways. It can reduce the number of tax returns that must be completed, the amount of information or the number of calculations required to complete each return, and the number of payments the taxpayer must make to Inland Revenue. In turn, this reduces the number of interactions taxpayers have with Inland Revenue, and the amount of time taxpayers spend complying with tax rules. 115 CHANGES TO THE TAX POOLING RULES (Clauses 280, 282, 404, 405, 406, 407, 408(141), 492 and 510) Summary of proposed amendments A number of amendments are being made to the provisional tax pooling rules to ensure the legislation reflects the original policy intent and to extend tax pooling to include reassessments of all taxes (such as voluntary disclosure and resolution of disputes). Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2009, apart from the amendment to allow transfers of money between tax pooling intermediaries, which applies from the date of enactment. Key features The provisional tax pooling rules have been amended to ensure that the only regular tax payments that pooling funds can be used for is provisional tax and terminal tax. Pooling funds are not available to meet regular payments such as GST and PAYE because the amount due is known by the due date, unlike provisional tax. This change reflects the original policy intent. The policy intent of the tax pooling rules was that provisional taxpayers who meet their provisional tax liabilities during the year but who end up with tax to pay at the end of the year should, within 60 days of their terminal tax date, be able to purchase funds from a tax pooling intermediary to settle their provisional tax and terminal tax liabilities. The legislative amendment allows this. An amendment is being made to section RP 19(1) to clarify that transfers to provisional or terminal tax with an effective date after the terminal tax date are applied first to the interest outstanding. Any remainder is then applied to the core tax. The transfer rules in section 173M of the Tax Administration Act 1994 have been amended to clarify that transfers can be made from any tax type to a tax pooling account. The effective date of the transfer will be the date of the request (not a backdated date). This reflects current administrative practice. The tax pooling rules are to be extended. New section RP 17B is inserted in the Income Tax Act 2007 to provide for the extension of tax pooling to include reassessments of all taxes, including voluntary disclosures and resolution of disputes. The request for pooling funds must be made within 60 days of being notified of the reassessed amount by the Commissioner. Pooling funds will be available only for the difference between the previously assessed amount and the new reassessed amount. 116 If tax pooling funds are used to pay a reassessed amount of tax other than income tax, the taxpayer’s imputation credit account is debited for the amount transferred to another tax type. Taxpayers who change tax pooling intermediaries will be able to transfer their funds from one intermediary to another while retaining the original effective (deposit) date, which will foster competition between tax pooling intermediaries. The change will apply to both new and existing deposits. There has been some uncertainty over how the term “tax paid” should be interpreted. Section 120C(1) of the Tax Administration Act is also being amended to clarify that tax paid means the amount transferred to a taxpayer's account or a tax pooling account by the due date for the tax. Background A review of the legislation applying to tax pooling intermediaries has been undertaken to ensure the rules are working as intended. The changes proposed in this bill have resulted from that review. 117 MIGRANT WORKERS EMPLOYED UNDER THE RECOGNISED SEASONAL EMPLOYER POLICY (Clauses 383, 408 (91) and (116), 417, 422, 444, 445 and 454) Summary of proposed amendments Several remedial amendments are being made to reduce the compliance costs incurred by migrant workers who come to New Zealand to work under the recognised seasonal employer policy. The compliance costs will be reduced by correctly deducting tax from migrant workers during the year and removing the requirement for these workers to file end of year tax returns. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2009. Key features Changes are being made to reduce the tax compliance costs faced by migrant workers and deduct the correct tax from them during the year. They include a definition of non- resident seasonal worker which is being inserted in the definitions section, section YA 1, of the Income Tax Act 2007 and changes to the rules that deal with the residency of natural persons (section YD 1(10)), to treat these migrant workers, who would otherwise be treated as residents, as non-residents. This imposes significant compliance costs especially if the worker does not speak English. A new tax deduction code, “NSW”, is being introduced for these non-resident seasonal workers. The tax code requires tax to be deducted at a full and final flat tax rate of 19 cents in the dollar. Amendments are being made to Schedule 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and to sections 24B(3) and 24F(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to give effect to the new tax deduction code and rate. The return filing requirements of section 33A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 are being amended to remove the requirement for these migrant workers to file an income tax return or personal tax summary. Background Migrant workers who come to New Zealand under the Recognised Seasonal Employer policy can work here for seven to nine months before going home. As they are here more than 183 days, they are treated as resident for tax purposes. Because they work for only part of the year, the PAYE tax deduction system over-taxes these workers, requiring them to file an end-of-year return to receive their refund. 118 BANKING CONTINUITY ISSUES (Clauses 408(98) and 416) Summary of proposed amendments The bill introduces changes to ensure shareholder continuity is preserved for certain restructuring arrangements that result in no change of economic ownership of a group of companies. The preservation of shareholder continuity will ensure that no unintended consequences of the continuity rules as they apply to imputation credits and losses will arise as a result of the restructuring. In the absence of the amendments the concessionary continuity rules would not provide continuity, and the core continuity rule could not be readily applied. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2008. Key features New section YC 18B ensures that shareholder continuity is preserved for restructuring that result in no significant change of ownership within a group of companies. Shareholder continuity is preserved for the initial parent, new parent and any interests considered to be held by the initial parent before the restructuring. The main criteria for the concession will be that the restructuring will result in no significant change to the ultimate economic ownership of the initial parent company and its subsidiaries. The criteria for the concession are as follows: • Except for a nominal amount of shares issued to facilitate the reorganisation, shareholders of the initial parent company will have the same interests in the same proportions in the new parent as they did at the start of the restructuring and at its conclusion. • The market value of any nominal amount of shares issued to facilitate the restructuring expressed as a percentage of the market value of all the shares in the new parent company is such that it is reasonable to treat the exchanging shareholders as owning all the shares. • The restructuring does not result in any return to the shareholders (ignoring any nominal amount of shares issued to facilitate the transaction), apart from the exchange of shares in the initial parent company for shares in the new parent company. 119 • The initial parent company at the start of the restructuring and new parent company immediately at the completion of the restructuring are limited attribution companies. If the initial parent ceases to be a limited attribution company before the new parent company becomes a limited attribution company this will be ignored. If the criteria are met, the new parent company is regarded as holding all the interests and limited attribution status that the initial parent company held. This results in no breach of the concessionary continuity rules. Background Some Australian banking groups with significant New Zealand operations are considering restructuring to separate their banking from their other businesses. The restructuring results in the Australian bank replacing its initial parent company with a new company as the listed banking group parent company. This restructuring is a direct response to Australian regulatory standards and has the full support of the regulators and the Australian government. From a New Zealand tax policy perspective, the restructuring should not have any effect for New Zealand tax purposes, whether for New Zealand holders of the initial parent company’s shares or for the New Zealand banking group. The Income Tax Act 2007 provides general rules to determine the shareholder interests in a company. There are a number of concessionary rules that deal with situations where it is impractical to apply the more detailed general rules. However, this particular type of restructuring falls outside of the requirements of the concessions. This means that the initial parent company and its subsidiaries will not be able to carry forward any tax losses and imputation credits they had before restructuring under the concessionary rules. From a policy perspective, the initial parent company and its subsidiaries should be able to preserve their continuity, as the replacement parent company does not result in any substantive change to the ultimate ownership of the initial parent company and its subsidiaries. 120 CHARITABLE DONEE STATUS (Clause 427) Summary of proposed amendments The Educational Aid for International Development Trust Board, the Ingwavuma Orphan Trust Fund of New Zealand, the Kyrgyzstan New Zealand Rural Trust, the L Women of Africa Fund, Partners Relief and Development NZ, the Tender Trust, The Band Aid Box, The Destitute Children’s Home, Pokhara, Charitable Trust, The Palestine Children’s Relief Fund Charitable Trust, the Triyog Himalaya Trust and the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) are to be given charitable donee status. This will enable donors to obtain tax relief on their donations. Application date The amendments will apply from the 2008–09 tax year. Key features The following organisations are being added to Schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007, which lists the organisations that qualify for charitable donee status: • Educational Aid for International Development Trust Board; • Ingwavuma Orphan Trust Fund of New Zealand; • Kyrgyzstan New Zealand Rural Trust; • L Women of Africa Fund; • Partners Relief and Development NZ; • Tender Trust; • The Band Aid Box; • The Destitute Children’s Home, Pokhara, Charitable Trust; • The Palestine Children’s Relief Fund Charitable Trust; • Triyog Himalaya Trust; and • UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees). A change is also being made to reflect that the Bright Hope International Trust, which already has donee status, has changed its name to Global Hope. 121 Background Donations to qualifying organisations entitle individual taxpayers to a rebate of 33⅓ percent of the amount donated. Donations by companies qualify for a deduction. A Māori authority may also claim a deduction from its net income for donations to charitable organisations and/or a body that has been defined as a “Māori association” under the Māori Community Development Act 1962. Educational Aid for International Development Trust Board This organisation is involved in the establishment of a secondary school in the Kagera region of Tanzania. It is currently considering other projects in this region, including secondary teacher and nursing training. Ingwavuma Orphan Trust Fund of New Zealand This Trust provides care and education for children in the Ingwavuma area of Natal in South Africa who have been orphaned or who are in need. Kyrgyzstan New Zealand Rural Trust This Trust is engaged in agricultural aid programmes in Kyrgyzstan. L Women of Africa Fund This organisation funds surgery for women in Africa who are suffering from vesico vaginal fistula (caused by complications in childbirth). Partners Relief and Development NZ Partners Relief and Development is part of a global organisation that is providing humanitarian aid in Burma. Tender Trust The Tender Trust has established and runs an orphanage in Uganda. The Band Aid Box This organisation is providing medical assistance to the people of the Khari Khola area in Nepal. The Destitute Children’s Home, Pokhara, Charitable Trust This Trust has been established to support a small home for needy children in Pokhara, Nepal. 122 The Palestine Children’s Relief Fund Charitable Trust The Trust raises funds for medical services, particularly paediatric cardiac services for needy Palestine children, training medical staff in Palestine, and to bring Palestinian medical staff to New Zealand for advanced training. Triyog Himalaya Trust The Trust has been established for aid activities in Nepal. It is currently raising funds to sponsor a secondary school teacher. UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) The United Nations General Assembly established a High Commissioner’s Office for Refugees in 1951. UNHCR provides humanitarian aid in numerous countries. 123 APPLICATION OF THE NON-DISCLOSURE RIGHT (Clauses 433(2) & (5) and 437-441) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment is being made to the Tax Administration Act 1994 to allow the right of non-disclosure to apply to discovery and similar processes that occur during litigation. Application date The amendment will apply to challenge proceedings filed on or after the date of enactment. Key features The right of non-disclosure in sections 20B to 20G of the Tax Administration Act is being amended to allow the right to apply to documents that the Commissioner has sought to be disclosed during litigation. The amendment will allow the Courts to have access to the facts (the tax contextual information), but not to the tax advisor’s view of the facts. Currently, the ability of the Commissioner or taxpayer to challenge the claim that a book or document is a “tax advice document” subject to the non-disclosure right is determined by a District Court Judge. This can create difficulties if the matter is being heard in another court. A further amendment is being made to allow the determination to be made by the court hearing the matter. Background In 2005, the government introduced a right of non-disclosure relating to certain tax advice documents provided between tax advisors and their clients so there is greater parity between lawyers (who are able to claim legal professional privilege) and other tax advisors. The ability to not disclose such documents applies at the investigation and disputes phases entered into by, or with, Inland Revenue. However, the right does not extend to preventing disclosure of these documents by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue during litigation. In contrast, legal privilege extends throughout both court proceedings and Inland Revenue administrative proceedings. 124 TAX RECOVERY ARRANGEMENTS (Clause 508) Summary of the proposed amendments An amendment is being made to the Tax Administration Act 1994 to clarify that bilateral tax recovery arrangements entered into in double tax agreements (DTAs) may provide for charges associated with a collectible foreign tax debt also to be collected. The change is aimed at resolving uncertainty over what charges such as penalties, interest and costs of collection New Zealand can collect on behalf of other countries under a DTA arrangement. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2008. Key features A clarification is being inserted into section 173D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to ensure that charges such as interest, administrative penalties and costs may be collected under New Zealand’s tax recovery arrangements. Background New Zealand has recently begun entering into bilateral tax recovery arrangements in its DTAs. Part XA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 imposes some limitations on the tax recovery assistance that New Zealand can provide to other countries. DTAs generally override domestic law, but Part XA has been deliberately framed so that it cannot be overridden by a DTA. Part XA is silent on the matter of charges associated with the foreign unpaid tax that New Zealand may be asked to collect for other countries under such arrangements (such as penalties, interest and costs). However, concerns have arisen that an argument could be constructed that the way “tax” is defined for the purposes of the Act results in Part XA, preventing New Zealand from collecting such charges. This would run counter to the original intention that associated charges would be collected. It would also conflict with our tax recovery arrangements, all of which are explicit that such charges are to be collected. To date, New Zealand has entered into tax recovery arrangements only with Australia, the Netherlands, Poland and the United Kingdom. The administrative details for these arrangements have now been finalised, and New Zealand has potentially been able to receive requests for assistance from 1 April 2008. The clarifying amendment will therefore apply from that date. 125 PUBLIC AUTHORITIES AND GST (Clauses 2(2) and 519(4)) Summary of proposed amendments An amendment to the GST Act 1985 will confirm that the Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Parliamentary Service have an obligation to charge GST on the activities they undertake. The change reflects the activities of these offices in making supplies of goods and services which should be subject to GST. Application dates In relation to the Parliamentary Service, the amendment will apply from 1 October 1986, the date GST started. The amendment will apply to the Office of Clerk of the House of Representatives from 1 August 1988, the date the Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives was established. Key features Section 2, the interpretation section of the GST Act, will be amended to include the Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Parliamentary Service in the definition of “public authority”. Background The GST Act currently treats public authorities as carrying on a taxable activity and requires GST to be charged on appropriations received from Parliament. This outcome is achieved by deeming public authorities, including instruments of government and certain offices of Parliament, to be carrying on a taxable activity and making supplies of goods and services in return for appropriations from Parliament. This is consistent with the comprehensiveness of the GST base. 126 GST ON CERTAIN LOYALTY TRANSACTIONS (Clauses 519(3), 520, 521 and 525) Summary of proposed amendments An amendment to the GST Act 1985 is being introduced to allow certain loyalty programme operators to defer the imposition of GST until the redemption of loyalty points to ensure that GST is being paid at the correct rate. The new rules will ensure that the correct GST rate is imposed on loyalty points, depending on whether the points are ultimately redeemed for supplies that would normally be zero-rated or for supplies that are normally subject to a standard rate of GST. Application dates The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features New section 9(9) will allow certain loyalty programme operators to defer the imposition of GST on a sale of loyalty points to another person until such time that the loyalty points are redeemed. New section 11C specifies the requirements that must be satisfied before a loyalty programme operator can defer the imposition of GST under the proposed section 9(9). A loyalty programme operator will be able to use the proposed rules if it makes supplies for consideration under an arrangement with another person to provide loyalty points to a third person and the following conditions are satisfied: • Twenty-five percent or more of the loyalty programme operator’s business, or an associated person’s business involves providing zero-rated goods or services. • The operator or its associated person has a business activity outside the activity of operating a loyalty programme (the main business activity) and the loyalty points can be redeemed for rewards supplied by the operator or its associated person as part of the main business activity. • The loyalty programme operator can identify, at the time of the redemption of loyalty points, whether GST has already been imposed on the points in question when they were issued or whether the GST liability was deferred until the redemption of points under proposed section 9(9). New section 11C(6) states that the second requirement will still be satisfied if, in addition to being redeemable for rewards supplied by the operator’s or associated person’s main business activity, the loyalty points can be redeemed for a reward supplied by an operator’s partner under an associated loyalty programme. 127 The legislation also defines the term “loyalty programme” in section 2, and makes a consequential amendment to the meaning of the term “supply” in section 5(14). The new rules will ensure that the correct GST rate is imposed on loyalty points, depending on whether the points are ultimately redeemed for normally zero-rated supplies or for supplies that are normally subject to a standard rate of GST. Background GST is charged on goods and services consumed in New Zealand. Since exported goods and services are generally consumed outside of New Zealand, exports of goods and services are zero-rated. Zero-rating allows a supplier of goods and services not to charge GST, but to still be able to claim input tax deductions. There may be situations where, because of the involvement of an intermediary, supplies of what are normally considered zero-rated goods or services are subject to GST at the standard rate. For example, a loyalty programme operator (such as an airline) may enter into a transaction with a purchaser whereby the purchaser pays the loyalty programme operator for crediting loyalty points to a customer. The customer may later redeem the loyalty points for a zero-rated reward supplied by the loyalty programme operator. By imposing GST on the loyalty points at the time they were issued, GST is in effect imposed on what would normally be a zero-rated supply. This anomaly would not exist if the supply were acquired directly from the operator for a monetary consideration instead of through the use of loyalty points. Therefore an amendment to the GST Act is required to allow certain loyalty programme operators to defer the imposition of GST until the nature, and normal GST rate, of a reward is known. 128 GST AND EXPORTED SECOND-HAND GOODS (Clauses 522 and 523) Summary of proposed amendments Changes are being made to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to allow, in certain circumstances, exported second-hand goods to be zero-rated when the exporter has claimed a second-hand goods input tax deduction. The changes ensure that exported second-hand goods that are not brought back into New Zealand are treated in the same way as exported new goods. Application date The amendments will apply from the date of enactment. Key features The zero-rating rules that apply to exported goods are being amended by inserting three new subsections in section 11 of the GST Act. New section 11(3B) permits certain exported second-hand goods for which a second- hand goods input tax deduction has been claimed to be zero-rated, if: • the goods are entered for export under the Customs and Excise Act 1996; and • the goods leave New Zealand within 28 days of the goods being supplied (as determined by the earlier event of the recipient paying for the goods or the supplier issuing an invoice). New section 11(3B) will apply if the recipient provides the supplier, at or before the time of supply, a written undertaking that the goods will not be brought back to New Zealand by the recipient, or a person associated with the recipient, in a condition that is substantially the same as the condition in which they were exported. New section 11(3C) is an anti-avoidance provision that requires GST to be charged if all of the following events have taken place: • the exported goods were previously zero-rated; • the goods are subsequently imported into New Zealand; • the goods are reacquired by the exporter in a condition that is substantially the same as when the goods were zero-rated; and • the exporter had claimed a second-hand goods input tax deduction in connection with the original export of the goods. New section 11(3D) provides that section 11(3C) applies at the time the goods are reacquired unless GST is imposed under section 12 of the GST Act when the goods are subsequently imported into New Zealand. 129 A consequential change is being made to section 10(4), which determines the taxable value of the exported goods if section 11(3C) applies. Background Exports of second-hand goods are currently subject to GST at the standard rate of 12.5% if the exporter, or an associate of the exporter, has claimed a second-hand goods input tax deduction. The imposition of GST in these circumstances is designed to prevent revenue losses from exporting second-hand goods that have never been subject to GST but gave rise to an input tax deduction when acquired. A further tax base risk arises if the goods are subsequently brought back to New Zealand without GST applying on importation and again sold to the exporter or an associate of the exporter to create another second-hand goods deduction. These risks are dealt with by section 11(3)(a), which, by reference to section 10(4), requires GST to be charged on exported second-hand goods. Example 1: Exported scrap metal under the current rules Company A Ltd pays $630 for scrap metal (2,000 kg of light gauge grade steel and 1,500 kg of oversized grade steel) acquired from the demolition of a haybarn on private property. The owner of the haybarn is not registered for GST, and Company A claims a second-hand goods deduction of $70 ($630 ÷ 9) on the purchase of the scrap metal. Company A cleans and sorts the steel and cuts any oversized components to light gauge specification. The steel is baled and stored with similar gauged steel which is held as trading stock. Company A receives an order for 6,000 kg of steel from an Indonesian firm. Supplying the order involves Company A using a mixture of scrap metal that has been acquired from unregistered and registered persons (including all of the steel that was formerly part of the haybarn). Company A needs to calculate and charge GST on the quantity (3,500 kg) of scrap metal from the haybarn. GST of $70 is therefore payable on the export. The remaining quantity (2,500 kg) is zero-rated. The problem with charging GST on exported second-hand goods is, however, that it treats these goods differently from exported new goods and is inconsistent with the broad objective that goods consumed by businesses outside New Zealand should be zero-rated. For these reasons, the GST Act is being amended so that it allows exported second-hand goods to be zero-rated if: • the goods are entered for export; • the goods leave New Zealand within 28 days of the time of supply; and • the recipient provides a declaration (for example, in the sale and purchase agreement or other sales document) at or before the time of supply that neither they nor an associated person will cause the goods to be reimported to New Zealand in the same condition in which they were exported. 130 To reduce the tax base risks identified with zero-rating exported second-hand goods, an anti-avoidance measure is being added and will apply at the time of reacquisition if the exported goods are sold back to the exporter or an associate of the exporter in substantially the same condition in which they were originally supplied. The anti- avoidance provision would not apply if, in bringing the goods back to New Zealand, GST was imposed on importation as in this situation the GST treatment of the second- hand goods is considered to be tax-neutral. Example 2: Exported scrap metal under the proposed rules In the situation set out in Example 1, the entire export can be zero-rated under the proposed amendments if the Indonesian firm provides a declaration – for example, a clause in the sale and purchase agreement, that it or a person associated with the firm will not cause the goods to be brought back into New Zealand in substantially the same condition in which they were exported. 131 Remedial amendments 133 TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS TO THE PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT ENTITY RULES (Clauses 49, 56, 76-78, 206-211, 213, 223, 237, 275, 286, 408, 449, 460, 463, 581-587 and 613) Summary of proposed amendments A number of remedial amendments are being made to the new tax rules for portfolio investment entities (PIEs). These proposed amendments ensure that the rules achieve their intended policy effect. Application date The amendments to the PIE rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 are effective from 1 April 2008. The amendments to the PIE rules in the Income Tax Act 2004 are effective from 1 October 2007. The relevant amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 are effective from 1 October 2007. Key features The main areas covered by the amendments are the eligibility criteria for becoming a portfolio investment entity, the calculation of tax liability, filing and information provision requirements, and investors’ tax rates that are used by portfolio investment entities. Background New tax rules for collective investment vehicles that meet the definition of a “portfolio investment entity” (PIE) were enacted by the Taxation (Savings Investment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act in December 2006. The PIE rules were designed to alleviate a number of long-standing problems with the taxation of collective investment vehicles. The rules treat investment through PIEs largely in the same way as direct investment by individuals, thus removing long- standing disadvantages of saving through collective investment vehicles, such as superannuation funds being taxed at a rate higher than investors in those funds with a lower marginal tax rate. These reforms were particularly important given the implementation of KiwiSaver in 2007. PIEs are not taxable on realised share gains made on investments in New Zealand and certain Australian companies. They pay tax on investment income for their individual investors at a rate of 19.5% or 30%, depending on the investor's income in the previous two years. Income earned through a PIE generally does not affect investors’ entitlements to family assistance, their student loan repayments or child support obligations. 134 The amendments in the bill are of a remedial nature and address technical problems that have been identified with the new rules or amend the rules to cater for different circumstances. The amendments are consistent with the policy intent of the new tax rules for portfolio investment entities. Detailed analysis Land-owning companies As well as holding shares and debt investments, PIEs can also directly own land because passive investments in land can be a major element of a diversified investment portfolio. However, weaknesses in the current law allow land-rich active businesses (for example, rest homes and airports) to use the ability of portfolio investment entities to own land directly to their advantage and restructure themselves as PIEs. This is contrary to the policy intent of the portfolio investment entity rules, which were designed to be used by widely held passive savings vehicles. In particular, the weakness in the current law allow a land-rich active business to be effectively split up into a land-owning company (the PIE), and an operating company, using a structure that ensures the operating company does not “taint” the land-owing company and prevent it from being a PIE. This can be done by: • stapling shares in the land-owing company to shares in the operating company; or • leasing the PIE’s land and buildings to an associated operating company and ensuring the operating company does not represent a significant portion of the PIE’s total investments. The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue announced in September 2007 that amendments would be introduced to address these weaknesses, with application from 1 October 2007. The weaknesses in the current law that allow a land-owing active business to access the PIE rules in a way that is contrary to policy intent will be addressed by amending the income type requirement in section HL 10(2)(b)(iii) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007, which currently provides that income under a lease of land meets the income type requirement. The amendment will provide that income under a lease of land derived by a PIE from an associated person (which would include a company whose shares are stapled to the shares in the PIE) does not count as qualifying income for the purposes of the income type eligibility requirement in section HL 10(2)(b)(iii). Transfer of expenditure to portfolio investment entities The PIE tax rules allow a superannuation fund or a unit trust (a member fund) that has not elected to be a PIE but has invested in a portfolio investment entity to transfer deductible expenditure to the PIE. A member fund may want to transfer expenditure to a PIE in this way as it may not have sufficient income against which to offset the expenditure. The member fund gains the tax benefit of the expenditure it transfers because the PIE offsets the transferred expenditure against the income that it earns for the member fund. 135 A number of remedial amendments to the expenditure transfer rules in subpart DV of the Income Tax Act 2007 are required so that they apply appropriately for portfolio tax rate entities. Section DV 2 will be amended to ensure that the transferred expenditure is deductible to the portfolio tax rate entity in the income year the expenditure is transferred by the member fund. Sections DV 2 and DV 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007 are being amended to provide that a portfolio tax rate entity’s deduction is limited to: • expenditure that the member fund has incurred since it started investing in the portfolio tax rate entity; and • expenditure that the member fund has incurred in relation to its investment in the portfolio tax rate entity. Section DV 4, which allows surplus expenditure to be carried forward by member funds, will be amended so that it does not apply to transfers of expenditure to portfolio tax rate entities. Australasian share gains exclusion Section CX 55 of the Income Tax Act 2007, which provides that proceeds from disposals of certain Australasian shares by PIEs are excluded income, will be amended to reinstate the previous Australian Stock Exchange listing and franking account requirements. These requirements were contained in the former section CX 55(1)(a)(ii) and (iii) and were inadvertently omitted when an amendment was made to this provision by the Taxation (Business Taxation and Remedial Matters) Act 2007. Entity type eligibility requirement Section HL 4(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and Income Tax Act 2004 is being amended to provide that an entity ceases to be a PIE if the entity fails to meet the entity type requirements in section HL 2(2) – for example, the requirement that a portfolio tax rate entity must be a company, superannuation fund or a group investment fund. Effect of failure to meet eligibility requirements Section HL 4(2)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Income Tax Act 2004, concerning breaches of certain eligibility requirements, is being amended to apply fully on a portfolio investor class basis in relation to a failure to meet a requirement of section HL 6 (investor membership requirement) or section HL 9 (investor interest size requirement). New section HL 4(2)(ab), concerning breaches of the investment requirements in section HL 10, will be structured on an entity rather a portfolio investor class basis. 136 Becoming a portfolio investment entity Section HL 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section HL 12 of the Income Tax Act 2004 contain rules dealing with consequences of an entity becoming a portfolio investment entity. Section HL 13(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section HL 12(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2004 provide that an entity is deemed never to have been a PIE if within 12 months of the date of election to become a PIE it fails to meet one or more of the eligibility criteria referred to in section HL 4. These deeming provisions are being amended so that they apply only if an entity fails to meet one or more of the eligibility requirements in section HL 6 (investor membership requirement), HL 9 (investor interest size requirement), or section HL 10 (investment requirements) in each quarter of the 12-month period. Credits received by portfolio tax rate entities The credit allocation rules for PIEs in section HL 29(7) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section HL 27(7) of the Income Tax Act 2004 are being amended to ensure that an investor with a portfolio investor exit period (exiting investor) is not allocated an excessive amount of credits. An exiting investor in a quarterly portfolio tax rate entity should be treated as receiving a credit which has been allocated to the investor in the quarter in which the exit occurs. Under the current wording of these provisions the exiting investor may get the benefit of credits that are allocated in previous quarters twice – first by the portfolio tax rate entity reducing its portfolio entity tax liability, and second by the investor being able to use the allocated credit against other tax liabilities. Therefore a clarifying amendment is being made to section HL 29(7) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section HL 27(7) of the Income Tax Act 2004 to ensure that the proper amount of credit is allocated to an exiting investor. Recording allocated credits in company investor’s imputation credit account A new provision, section OB 9B, is being inserted in the Income Tax Act 2007 to ensure that a company investor in a portfolio tax rate entity can include imputation credits allocated to it under section HL 29(7)(b) in its imputation credit account. The imputation credit will be recorded in the company investor’s imputation credit account on the date the credit is allocated by the portfolio tax rate entity to the investor. Current section OB 9 allows a company to include in its imputation credit account an imputation credit attached to a dividend derived by the company. This does not cater for a company investor in a portfolio tax rate entity which is allocated imputation credits under section HL 29(7)(b) separately from any distribution from the portfolio tax rate entity. Use of allocated imputation credits A clarifying amendment is being made to section LE 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to ensure that persons are allowed a tax credit if imputation credits are allocated to them under section HL 29(7)(b). The relevant persons are zero-rated portfolio investors such as companies and trustees and investors with portfolio investor exit periods. New section LE (1B) will provide that an investor in a portfolio tax rate entity who is 137 allocated an imputation credit under section HL 29(7)(b) has a tax credit for the tax year of an amount equal to the imputation credit. The main imputation crediting provision in section LE 1(1) refers to a person whose assessable income for an income year includes an imputation credit. This inclusion is achieved by section CD 15, which provides that an amount of a dividend is increased by an imputation credit attached to the dividend. This provision, however, is not applicable to investors in portfolio tax rate entities who are allocated imputation credits under section HL 29(7)(b) separately from any dividend. Current section LE 1(4) will be consequently repealed. Confirming refundability of certain tax credits for portfolio tax rate entities A clarifying amendment is being made to ensure that tax credits under section LS 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 are refundable to a portfolio tax rate entity (other than an entity that chooses to pay provisional tax). The relevant credits are credits (not being foreign tax credits) allocated to individual investors (other than investors with portfolio investor exit periods) under section HL 29 and credits arising under section HL 21(2) from portfolio investor allocated losses of such investors. The amendment confirming refundability of credits arising under section LS 1 involves including section LS 1 credits in the list of refundable credits in section LA 6(1). The section YA 1 definition of “refundable tax credit” is also being amended to include credits arising under section LS 1. Prescribed investor rates and trustees of charitable trusts The definition of “prescribed investor rate” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 is being amended to prevent trustees of charitable trusts electing a 30% rate instead of being zero-rated portfolio investors. If charitable investors could elect a 30% rate this could mean they could get the benefit of refundable credits for portfolio investor allocated losses and excess imputation or other credits, something they could not get as zero-rated portfolio investors. This would be contrary to the policy intent of the portfolio investment entity rules. Selection of incorrect portfolio investor rate An amendment is being made to the definition of “portfolio investor rate” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to allow the Commissioner to override a rate incorrectly selected by an investor; the exercise of this discretion would result in the default portfolio investor rate of 30% applying. Normally, the portfolio investor rate is the rate that an investor notifies to the portfolio tax rate entity as the investor’s prescribed investor rate. The portfolio tax rate entity is entitled to rely on the rate notified to it by the investor. Under the proposed amendment, the rate notified by the investor to the portfolio tax rate entity will continue to apply as the portfolio investor rate unless the Commissioner has notified the entity that the rate notified by the investor is to be disregarded, in which case the default rate of 30% under paragraph (a) of the portfolio investor rate definition applies. 138 Information provided by portfolio tax rate entities to investors Section 31B(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which contains the requirement for portfolio tax rate entities to provide information statements to zero-rated portfolio investors, is being repealed. This means that such investors will be covered by the information statement rules in section 31B(3), which require portfolio tax rate entities to provide information statements to their investors by 30 June after the end of the tax year (or a later date if the entity has a late balance date). Currently, portfolio tax rate entities are required under section 31B(2B) to provide information statements to their zero-rated portfolio investors within one month of the end of the relevant period, which in practice is an insufficient period to comply with. Also, for zero-rated portfolio investors in quarterly portfolio tax rate entities it is important only that they receive information on an annual basis rather than after the end of each quarter, as is currently required. Returns by portfolio tax rate entities Section 57B(6)(c) is being amended to provide an additional month for portfolio tax rate entities that are ceasing to file their final return. This means that such entities will have three months rather than the current two months to provide their final return. A cross-referencing correction to section 57B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is being made in section 61(1C). The amended section 61(1C) will require a portfolio tax rate entity (not being an entity that chooses under section HL 23 to pay provisional tax) to disclose its interests in foreign companies or foreign investment funds by the due date for the entity’s return under section 57B(5). The provision in section 57B, containing the deadlines by when portfolio tax rate entities must perform their responsibilities for investors with portfolio investor exit periods, is being re-enacted as subsection (3B); the provision is currently incorrectly located within section 57B. Minor drafting corrections A number of amendments have been made to correct minor drafting and cross- referencing errors. These are: • Section HL 6(4)(a) and (b) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Income Tax Act 2004, relating to the investor membership requirement, are being amended to include a cross-reference to the paragraph that lists Auckland Regional Holdings. • Section HL 9(6)(a) and (b) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Income Tax Act 2004, relating to the investor interest size requirement, are being amended to include a cross-reference to the paragraph that lists Auckland Regional Holdings. • Section HL 12(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section HL 11B(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2004, relating to unlisted companies choosing to become portfolio listed companies, are being amended so that the reference to an unlisted company needing to have 100 shareholders is changed to an unlisted company needing to have at least 100 shareholders. 139 TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS TO THE OFFSHORE PORTFOLIO SHARE INVESTMENT RULES (Clauses 15, 128, 130, 132-137, 139, 463, 513, 543 and 569-575) Summary of proposed amendments A number of remedial amendments are being made to the new tax rules for offshore portfolio investment in shares. These proposed amendments ensure that the new rules achieve their intended policy effect. Application date The amendments contained in the Income Tax Act 2007 are effective from 1 April 2008. The smaller number of amendments to the Income Tax Act 2004 are effective from 1 April 2007. Background New tax rules for offshore portfolio investment in shares were enacted by the Taxation (Savings, Investment, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006. The new rules apply for income years beginning on or after 1 April 2007. The new rules generally apply to an investment by a New Zealand resident in a foreign company when the investor owns less than 10 percent of the company. Under the new rules, offshore portfolio investment in shares is taxed consistently, regardless of the country where the investment is located and whether the investment is made by an individual directly or through a collective investment vehicle. The new tax rules for offshore portfolio investment in shares mainly relate to the foreign investment fund rules. The main changes were that the “grey list” exemption in the foreign investment fund rules has been removed and the new fair dividend rate method – which broadly taxes 5 percent of a person’s offshore share portfolio’s opening value each year – has been introduced. The amendments in the bill are of a remedial nature and address technical problems that have been identified with the new rules or amend the rules to cater for different circumstances; all the amendments are consistent with the policy intent of the new tax rules for offshore portfolio investment in shares. 140 Detailed analysis Venture capital exemption Several aspects of the exemption in the foreign investment fund rules for interests in grey list companies which own New Zealand venture capital companies – section EX 37 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section EX 33(4) of the Income Tax Act 2004 – will be clarified. First, ownership of the New Zealand company should be defined as holding more than 50 percent of the voting interests in the company. This amendment will make it clear when the 10-year limitation for the exemption ends. Secondly, it will be clarified that the company that carries on business in New Zealand is a New Zealand- resident company. Australian-resident listed company exemption The exemption from the foreign investment fund rules for shares in Australian-resident companies listed on the Australian Stock Exchange is being amended to cater for companies which are the subject of court-approved reorganisations. In particular, the requirement that shares in the company be included in an approved Australian Stock Exchange index will be expanded to include the situation where the shares are included in an approved index at the beginning of the final month of the preceding income year, if the shares are cancelled in the first month of an income year under a court-approved arrangement. Excluding managed funds from grey list exception in fair dividend rate method The fair dividend rate rules were amended by the Taxation (Business Taxation and Remedial Matters) Act 2007 to provide that there is no foreign investment fund income in the situation where a 10 percent or more holding is held in a grey list company at the start of an income year. This ensures there is no foreign investment fund income if that holding falls below 10 percent during the year. This treatment is consistent with the general fair dividend rate treatment, which ignores purchases of shares during a year (other than quick sales). However, this 2007 amendment should not generally apply to managed funds that hold shares in a foreign investment vehicle because the remaining grey list exemption for 10 percent or more interests does not apply to managed funds such as portfolio investment entities; instead the fair dividend rate method applies to such investments. Accordingly, an exclusion will be made to this amendment for managed funds (portfolio investment entities, entities eligible to be portfolio investment entities, or life insurance companies) that hold interests in foreign investment vehicles (as defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004). A managed fund will therefore be able to use the fair dividend rate method for a 10 percent or more interest in a foreign investment vehicle that is resident in a grey list country (as it can currently for an interest in a foreign investment vehicle resident in a non-grey list country). This exclusion will be achieved by amendments to the fair dividend rate method provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 (sections EX 52 and EX 53) and the Income Tax Act 2004 (sections EX 44C and EX 44D). 141 Related amendments are being made to sections EX 59 and CD 36 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and sections EX 47 and CD 26 of the Income Tax Act 2004 to ensure that the dividend exclusion continues to apply for a managed fund holding an interest in a foreign investment vehicle. Comparative value method and currency conversion rules A clarifying amendment is being made to the opening value definition in the comparative value method in the foreign investment fund rules (section EX 51 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section EX 44 of the Income Tax Act 2004) to ensure that the correct exchange rate is used. The opening value definition in the comparative value method refers to the market value of the person’s interest at the end of the previous income year. If a person has chosen to use the average exchange rate (the average of the close of trading spot exchange rates for the 15th day of each month that falls in the year), it is the average exchange rate applying for that previous year which should be used to calculate the opening value for the current year. This approach is necessary to ensure that exchange rate gains and losses are reflected in foreign investment fund income or loss under the comparative value method over different income years. Therefore the comparative value method provisions are being amended to ensure that it is the relevant exchange rate applying in the previous income year that is used to calculate the opening value for the current year. Cost method The cost method in the foreign investment fund rules was amended by the Taxation (Business Taxation and Remedial Matters) Act 2007 to allow investors to use their actual cost for their opening value under that method, instead of having to obtain an independent valuation, for interests acquired in the 2005–06 or 2006–07 income year. This amendment was designed to reduce compliance costs for a person using the cost method for the 2007–08 income year, the first income year that the cost method is used for. An amendment is being made to the cost method in section EX 56 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section EX 45B of the Income Tax Act 2004 to ensure that this opening value option is available only for the 2007–08 income year and not future income years as this opening value does not include an uplift factor for the previous year’s foreign investment fund income to act as a proxy for an increase in the value of the investment. Drafting consistency amendment To achieve consistency with other references to the comparative value method in sections EX 46(4)(a)(i) and EX 62(2)(c), section EX 47 of the Income Tax Act 2007 will be amended by replacing the reference to “start of the income year” with “end of the income year”. Therefore a person who is not allowed to use the fair dividend rate method for an attributing interest is required to use the comparative value method for that interest or the deemed rate of return method if the comparative value method is not practical because the person cannot obtain the market value of the interest at the end of the income year. The same change is also being made to the corresponding provision in section EX 40B of the Income Tax Act 2004. 142 Income Tax Act rewrite-related amendments A number of remedial amendments are being made to the foreign investment fund rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 to ensure that there has been no change to the rules as part of the Income Tax Act rewrite process. The significant rewrite-related amendments are: • The fair dividend rate rules in sections EX 52 and EX 53 of the Income Tax Act 2007 are being amended to allow an investor to offset a net loss from one foreign investment fund interest against the net gain from another foreign investment fund interest. This reinstates the position that under the Income Tax Act 2004. The fair dividend rate rules in the Income Tax Act 2004 pooled the results for all attributing interests for which an investor used the fair dividend rate method. In contrast, the fair dividend rate rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 deal separately with each foreign investment fund in which an investor holds attributing interests. This approach prevents an investor offsetting, under the quick sale gains part of the fair dividend rate formula, a net loss from one foreign investment fund interest against a net gain from another foreign investment fund interest. • The references to treating certain shares as debt will be removed from sections EX 46 and EX 47. That will prevent the wording of a number of provisions in sections EX 46 and EX 47 of the Income Tax Act 2007 giving the incorrect impression that certain types of shares for which the fair dividend rate method may not be used are instead treated as debt for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 2007 (and therefore subject to the financial arrangement rules rather than the foreign investment fund rules). It is intended that such shares are taxed under the comparative value method in the foreign investment fund rules. • For the purposes of applying the fair dividend rate method, an original share in a foreign company that is subject to a returning share transfer should be treated as being held by the share supplier and not the share user. This amendment was made by the Taxation (Business Taxation and Remedial Matters) Act 2007 to the fair dividend rate method provisions in the Income Tax Act 2004 but was inadvertently not made to the corresponding provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007; this omission will be rectified by amendments to sections EX 52 and EX 53 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Disclosure of foreign interests Section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, containing the disclosure requirements for interests in foreign companies or foreign investment funds, is being amended to facilitate electronic filing. The part of the current provision that may be problematic for electronic filing is the requirement in the opening wording of section 61(1) that the disclosure must be “with that person’s return of income”. This will be replaced by a requirement that the disclosure be made within the time allowed for providing a person’s return of income for the year. The first reference to “tax year” in section 61(1) is also being replaced with “income year” to cater for persons with non-standard balance dates. This amendment is a correction since references to years in the international tax rules – which include section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 – have always included non-standard accounting years since their inception in 1988. This amendment is effective from 1 April 2005. 143 Suspending obligation to pay tax on foreign investment fund income Section 183 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which allows the payment of tax on foreign investment fund income to be suspended in very limited circumstances, is being repealed as a tax simplification measure. This complicated provision is not used in practice and has also been superseded by exemptions enacted in 2006 for new migrants. 144 AMENDMENTS TO R&D TAX CREDIT RULES (Clauses 47, 243-247, 273, 279, 280, 284, 287, 296, 307, 325-329, 331, 336, 337, 339, 343, 424, 433, 466, 467, 474-476, 490, 491, 509 and 511) The bill contains several remedial amendments to the R&D tax credit rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 and related administrative provisions in the Tax Administration Act 2004. They are required to fine-tune the provisions to ensure that they give full effect to the policy intent of the R&D tax credits. Summary of proposed changes The proposed amendments: • align the expenditure rules for testing a process with other expenditure rules; • amend the timing rules so that deferred salary expenditure will be eligible for the tax credit in the year in which the salary is actually paid and overseas expenditure that has been carried forward will be eligible for a tax credit at the time there is sufficient local expenditure to make a claim; • remove the option for partnerships to file R&D detailed statements on behalf of partners; • create a requirement that a detailed statement supporting an R&D tax credit claim or a proposed amendment leading to a tax credit must be received before the claim can be processed; • align the final dates for filing a tax credit claim, providing supporting information, and amending a tax credit claim by making them relative to the due date for the initial claim; • allow more time for Inland Revenue to revise up claims in some cases when a request for amendment arrives close to the final date; and • confirm current policy in relation to imputation rules, refunds, effective dates of transfer and the tax status of the credit. Application date The amendments will apply from the 2008–09 income year, the application date for the R&D tax credit. Process testing expenditure Two amendments are proposed to the provisions that deal with expenditure incurred in circumstances where, typically, a mass-production process is being tested as part of an R&D activity. 145 The current schedule 21, part A, clause 8, which is a general provision allowing a credit for this type of expenditure, is to be repealed. This will mean that to qualify for the tax credit, the majority of “process” expenditure needs to meet the general tests in part A in the same way other types of expenditure need to. The exception is materials processed or transformed as part of the R&D activity, which are to be covered by the new clause 8. The current schedule 21, part B, clause 7 is intended to limit process expenditure eligible for the credit to the excess of that spending over any valuable output of the process. This provision could be interpreted to have a wider application and so is being rewritten to make its application clear. Deferred salaries and overseas R&D expenditure Currently, the R&D activity must be performed in the income year for which the claimant has a tax credit. Similarly, the expenditure must be incurred in the income year for which the claim is made. These timing rules prevent tax credits arising for deferred salary expenditure and for overseas expenditure that has been required to be carried forward until there is sufficient local expenditure. Therefore new sections LH 5B and LH 5C are being inserted to override the two timing rules for these two types of expenditure. The amendments do not change the requirement that the claimant must have satisfied the requirements in section LH 2(1) at the time the R&D activities were undertaken. New section LH 3(6) is a consequential amendment. Filing on behalf of partners The amendments to sections 68D and 68E of the Tax Administration Act remove the ability for partnerships to file a single R&D detailed statement on behalf of all partners. The changes are intended to prevent potential disclosure of information about non- partnership R&D activities and to simplify administration. No credit until detailed statement is filed A new section LH 2(8) is being added to prevent an R&D tax credit arising before a detailed statement for the relevant year is filed under sections 68D or 68E of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The information contained in the detailed statement is necessary for Inland Revenue to be able to process the claim properly for a credit, and needs to be received before the credit legally arises. Sections 68D and 68E are consequentially modified so that they will not override section LH 2(8). Change to response periods for notices related to R&D tax credits The core definition of “response period” is to be moved from section 3(1) to a new section 89AB. Time periods for filing notices of proposed adjustment (NOPAs) that relate solely to an amount of R&D tax credit are to be altered so that they are consistent with other time limits for those credits. Currently claimants have one year from the final date for filing a tax return to file a NOPA that relates solely to an amount of R&D tax credit for that income year. There is a temporary extension from one year to two years for the 2008–09 and 2009–10 income years. There is no intention to change response periods except in the case of NOPAs relating solely to an amount of R&D tax credit. 146 Requirements for notice of proposed adjustment relating to R&D tax credit If a taxpayer has claimed a tax credit in an income tax return and/or is going to issue a NOPA that would affect the entitlement to an amount of tax credit, it should not be possible for the claimant to issue a NOPA in relation to that return unless a detailed statement has been filed. Amendments to sections 89D and 89DA ensure that a claimant files a detailed statement under sections 68D or 68E, as applicable, before disputing an assessment of an amount of tax credit. This is to ensure that Inland Revenue has basic information about the R&D activities of the taxpayer before the dispute commences. Date after which amount of R&D tax credit may not be raised Section 108(1B) prevents the Commissioner of Inland Revenue from increasing the amount of tax credit after a certain time has passed. The section is being amended so that the date is consistent with other time limits for R&D tax credits. The amount of credit may not be increased if one year has passed since the final date for filing a tax return for the relevant income year. Section 108(1C) provides a temporary extension from one year to two years, in the 2008–09 and 2009–10 income years. The time limit does not apply if a NOPA relating to the amount of credit has been issued within the relevant time period, or if a request has been made within the relevant time period to adjust the amount under section 113 and appropriate documentation has been provided. This is to allow time for the disputes process to be completed, or for the request to be properly processed. Section 113D provides that if the time limit in section 108(1B) does not apply, the amount of the tax credit may not be increased to more than the amount specified in the NOPA or request. The intent is that NOPAs or requests received within the relevant time periods can be processed, not that the extension of time will allow further claims. Effective date of transfer when excess R&D tax credits transferred When excess tax is transferred under Part 10B of the Tax Administration Act, the taxpayer may choose an effective date for the transfer. Section 173L specifies when the effective date may be. Section 173L is to be amended so that the earliest date for transfers of excess R&D tax credits is the same as the date for refundable credits that are deducted at source, such as resident withholding tax. For most taxpayers this will mean an earlier effective date, which is to their advantage. Surplus R&D tax credit used to satisfy liabilities treated as excess tax A new section LH 2(7) is being added to treat surplus R&D tax credits that are used by the Commissioner to satisfy a liability of the taxpayer under an Inland Revenue Act as excess tax for the purposes of Part 10B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This will ensure that section 173T of the Tax Administration Act applies, and the taxpayer may choose a date for the transfer under that Part. This aligns the treatment of amounts transferred compulsorily by the Commissioner under section LH 2(6) with the treatment of amounts transferred at the request of the taxpayer under section LA 6(2)(d). 147 Recovery of overpaid R&D tax credits R&D tax credits are offset against a person’s income tax liability under section LA 2 or otherwise used under sections LA 6(2) or LH 2(6). A new section LH 14B ensures that if the Commissioner considers that the amount so offset or used was greater than the proper amount, the difference between that amount and the proper amount may be recovered as if it were tax payable by the person. This provision will apply if, for example, a taxpayer mistakenly claims too much tax credit and later corrects the mistake, or if the taxpayer is audited and a claim is found to be in excess of the proper amount. The tax or other amounts saved by the person, or the refund received, will become repayable. Interaction of the imputation rules and R&D tax credits When a company with an imputation credit account receives an amount of R&D tax credit it receives a corresponding credit to its imputation credit account. An amendment to section OB 4(3) ensures that only a single credit arises in the imputation credit account (ICA) of that company. An amendment to section OB 37 ensures that if a refund of R&D tax credits is used other than to offset income tax liabilities of the taxpayer (that is, used under sections LA 6(2)(d), (e) and LH 2(6)), the company will have a corresponding debit to its imputation credit account. Amendments to sections OB 32 and OB 33 are intended to ensure that a company does not receive a double debit to its imputation credit account. Additionally, if a refundable credit is used under sections LA 6(2)(d), LA 6(2)(e) or LH 2(6) by a company with an Foreign Dividend Payment (FDP) account, that company will also receive a debit to its ICA. There is one exception: if the credit is an FDP credit, use of these credits by a company will generate a debit in the FDP account of that company rather than a debit in its ICA. This amendment to section OB 37 corrects an unintended change introduced by the rewrite of the Income Tax Act. Similar changes apply to Maori authority credit accounts and imputation credit accounts of consolidated imputation groups. Refunds of R&D tax credit when instalment arrangement in place Taxpayers with overdue liabilities under an Inland Revenue Act may have established an instalment arrangement to enable them to pay their debts. If such an arrangement is in place and is being complied with, it is desirable that the taxpayer be able to receive tax refunds if it elects to do so. Section 177B is to be amended so that an amount of R&D tax credit may be refunded or transferred in such a case, rather than being applied to outstanding tax liabilities under sections LA 6(2) or LH 2(6) of the Income Tax Act 2007. This also applies to other credits used under section LA 6(2) but does not apply to a current-year income tax liability, which is offset under section LA 2 of the Income Tax Act. 148 R&D tax credits are excluded income New sections LH 1(3) and CX 48B are being added to clarify that the R&D tax credit is excluded income of the claimant. It was not intended that a person claiming would be required to pay income tax on those credits when they were received. Incorrect cross-reference The cross-reference in section 139BA(3)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is being corrected to refer to section 177(4). 149 TAX DEPRECIATION RULES (Clauses 86, 87, 423, 478-482, 556, 557, 614, 618, 620, 621, 622 and 625) Summary of proposed amendments The bill contains a number of minor amendments to the tax depreciation rules, mostly dealing with remedial matters. The other amendments add two categories to the list of depreciable land improvements. The amendments clarify current tax depreciation policy settings. Application dates The application dates for the amendments depend on when the remedial matter arose. Many of the amendments have retrospective application dates to provide taxpayer comfort about previous years’ tax positions. Proposal Application dates – Power to withdraw provisional rate determinations – Power to withdraw economic rate determinations – Schedule 13 – purpose-built surfaces for outdoor sports grounds 1 April 2008 and from the 2008–2009 and subsequent income years – Scope for retrospective determinations 3 April 2006 and from the 2005–2006 and subsequent income years – Calculation of provisional rates – Formula for calculating special rates 1 October 2005 and from the 2005–2006 and subsequent income years – Incorrect legislative references in the Income Tax (Depreciation Determination) Regulations 1993 – Annual rate for depreciable property – High residual value assets – Obsolescence and special rates 1 April 2005 and from the 2005–2006 and subsequent income years – Schedule 13/16 – pipes and conduit – Status of default rates 1 April 1993 and from the 1993–1994 and subsequent income years 150 Key features The depreciation proposals in this bill amend the Income Tax Acts 1976, 1994, 2004 and 2007, the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Income Tax (Depreciation Determination) Regulations 1993. Power to withdraw provisional and economic rate determinations The amendment gives the Commissioner of Inland Revenue the power to withdraw both provisional determinations and economic rate determinations. Currently, the Commissioner does not have the power to make these determinations, which are necessary for administrative reasons. For example, a depreciation determination (either a provisional or on economic rate) may become outdated because the item no longer exists in the form set out in the determination, and should be withdrawn. Providing the Commissioner the power to withdraw depreciation determinations deals with this concern. Annual rate for depreciable property The lack of a reference to “special rate” or “provisional rate” in section EE 31 of the Income Tax Act 2007 raises two concerns. The first is whether depreciation loading is allowed for assets that are the subject of a special or provisional rate determination. The second is that taxpayers relying on these determinations may not be entitled to depreciation deductions. Neither result is consistent with the original policy. Including “special rate” and “provisional rate” in section EE 31 deals with both concerns. Consequential amendments to section EE 26 of the Income Tax Act 2004 will also be made. Determining a provisional rate The amendment deals with two remedial matters by inserting “provisional rate, as applicable” in section 91 AAG(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. First, it clarifies that provisional rate determinations are based upon the same methodology as economic rate determinations. Currently, the legislation contains no reference to the formulas the Commissioner of Inland Revenue must use to set the rate under a provisional rate determination. Secondly, the amendment clarifies that the Commissioner must select the appropriate formula when making a determination that sets a provisional rate or special rate. It is currently unclear whether the Commissioner should consider the other requirements of the sections that contain the formulae when making these types of determinations. For example, the formula in section EE 28 only applies to assets that are buildings. Default rates The changes clarify that taxpayers can apply in writing for a provisional rate determination when there is an applicable default rate available. There is some uncertainty whether the law currently allows these applications to be made. The amendment also allows the Commissioner to decline an application for a provisional rate when it is unlikely that the work would result in a change in depreciation rate, as a result of the requirement that the Commissioner rounds the rate to the nearest banded rate in Schedule 11 or 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 151 Comprehensiveness of the pre-2005 rules The amendment inserts section EZ 23 to the list in section 91AAG(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This addition ensures that special rate determinations for assets acquired before the reform of the depreciation rules in 2005 are determined under the earlier rules. As a matter of principle, special rate applications for assets held before 1 April 2005 should be determined using the earlier rules. Update of references depreciation regulations As a result of the Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004, certain legislative references in the Income Tax (Depreciation Determination) Regulations 1993 are no longer correct and require updating. Accordingly, the Income Tax (Depreciation Determination) Regulations 1993 are being updated so that the legislative references in the regulations correctly reflect the proper reference in the Tax Administration Act 1994. References to sections 91AE and 91AJ in the regulations are being amended to sections 91AAG and 91AAL respectively. Missing phrase “of cost” in section EE 30 The amendment inserts the words “of cost” in subsection (1) paragraph (b) of section EE 30 of the Income Tax Act 2007. This clarifies that a high residual value asset is one where the estimated residual value is greater than 13.5 percent of cost. Consequential amendments to the Income tax Act 2004 will also be made. Removing Commissioner’s ability to make retrospective determinations The amendments to section 91 AAF(4) prevent the Commissioner from being able to issue a determination that has a retrospective application. Section 91AAF(3) provides taxpayers with certainty that the Commissioner cannot retrospectively change economic depreciation rates for assets already owned or under contract to purchase. However, the current phrasing in section 91AAF(4) overrides section 91AAF(3) with the effect that the Commissioner has the power to make a retrospective determination on economic rate. This result is inconsistent with the policy intent. Additions to the list of depreciable land improvements The bill adds two categories of depreciable land improvements to Schedule 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007, with consequential amendments to earlier Income Tax Acts. Under existing tax law, land is not generally considered to be depreciable property. However, certain improvements to the land, that in a legal sense become part of the land, do depreciate over a reasonably easily determinable period. Not allowing depreciation deductions on these improvements may discourage investment in making improvements to land. The first category added to the list, “pipes and conduit”, deals with an omission dating back to when the current tax depreciation rules were introduced in 1993. The second category inserted, “purpose-built surfaces for outdoor sports grounds”, is in response to two requests for two types of land improvements to be added to the list of depreciable land improvements. The first request relates to “stabilised turf” (a composite of natural turf and synthetic materials) and the second relates to an equestrian arena. 152 Both types of land improvement depreciate and should be added to the list. The proposed wording broadly captures these types of surfaces and will allow the Commissioner to make depreciation determinations for these and other types of purpose-built surfaces for outdoor sports grounds (for example, tennis courts and artificial turf). 153 KIWISAVER AMENDMENTS (Clauses 258-261, 408(28), 465, 529-541 and 613(4)) The bill makes several remedial amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994, Income Tax Act 2004, the Income Tax Act 2007 and the KiwiSaver Act 2006. Some are required to fine-tune the provisions to ensure that they give full effect to the policy intent of KiwiSaver, while others correct minor drafting errors. Calculation of the employer tax credit (Clauses 258-261) Summary of proposed changes The government announced in Budget 2007 that, from 1 April 2008, the employer tax credit would reimburse employers for matching contributions they make into their employees’ KiwiSaver (and complying fund) accounts at a rate of 100 percent, up to a maximum of $20 per week for each employee. The existing formula in the KiwiSaver Act will not provide all eligible employers with the full entitlement to the credit. New sections MK 2(B) and MK 12B to MK 12D of the Income Tax Act 2007 introduce an annual square-up process to ensure that employers receive their full entitlement to the employer tax credit. The process enables employers who experience a short payment of the tax credit to make an additional claim at the end of the tax year (from 1 April 2009). This means that employers are able to claim up to $1,042.86 each year for each employee and do not have to keep track of when extra pays and therefore tax credit shortfalls occur during the year. Application dates The amendments relating to employer contributions made from 1 April 2008 will apply from 1 April 2009. The application dates for the remaining amendments vary from 1 July 2007 to the date of enactment. (See following text.) Liability to pay compulsory employer contributions in cases of belated automatic enrolment (Clauses 536 and 538) Non-compliance with the automatic enrolment rules has implications for employees in terms of their entitlement to and accumulation of compulsory employer contributions. From 1 April 2008, compulsory employer contributions are payable if the employer is required to make KiwiSaver deductions from an employee’s salary or wages. Employers who fail to comply with the automatic enrolment provisions of the KiwiSaver Act by not making deductions from their employees’ salary or wages when they begin new employment must back-pay any unpaid compulsory employer contributions once their non-compliance is detected. The amendments to sections 101A and 101FB of the KiwiSaver Act therefore limit employers’ liability to pay compulsory 154 employer contributions to the lesser of the duration of the current employment relationship or a time period of the first year of current employment (provided the employee becomes a KiwiSaver member during either of those periods). The amendment strikes a balance between the employer’s obligation to automatically enrol new employees (and make employer contributions) and employees’ obligations to make contributions from their salary or wages in order to receive employer contributions by becoming a member of KiwiSaver. Application date The amendments are to apply from 1 April 2008. Minor technical and drafting amendments A number of proposed amendments relating to KiwiSaver correct errors of a minor technical or drafting nature. Application date – 1 July 2007 The following minor amendments are to apply from 1 July 2007: Kick-start payment (clause 540) Section 226(4) of the KiwiSaver Act provides that in all instances when people have ceased to be a member of a KiwiSaver scheme, and then rejoin, they will not be entitled to the kick-start contribution even if they have never previously benefited from the kick- start. The policy intention was, however, that each KiwiSaver member is eligible for one kick-start payment. The amendments to section 226 of the KiwiSaver Act will ensure that people who have not received a kick-start payment before but subsequently become members, are able to receive a kick-start payment. Commissioner discretion to back-date member tax credit (clauses 408(28) and 613(4)) Non-compliance by employers with the automatic enrolment rules has implications for employees in terms of their entitlement to and accumulation of the member tax credit. Membership for employees who join KiwiSaver through their employer begins on the first of the month in which their first contribution is deducted from their salary or wages or the first of the month in which Inland Revenue received the first contribution. If people were not automatically enrolled into KiwiSaver when they should have been, they will have a belated membership start date because their employer failed to begin deductions. This results in these employees missing out on the member tax credit for periods of time against which their annual contributions could be pro-rated. 155 The amendment to the definition of “creditable membership” in sections OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and sections YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides a Commissioner discretion so that the start date of “creditable membership” can be backdated when, because of circumstances outside the control of the employee, deductions of KiwiSaver contributions from an employee’s salary or wages did not begin at the correct time. The amendment to the definition of “creditable membership” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 will apply from 1 April 2008. Application date – 1 April 2008 The following minor amendments are to apply from 1 April 2008: Refund of employer contributions (clause 535) Currently, a refund of KiwiSaver employer contributions may be used either to offset tax debt or be forwarded to the employer at the discretion of Inland Revenue. As employer contributions may form part of an employee’s total remuneration package, the amendment to section 100 of the KiwiSaver Act will ensure that employer contributions that are to be refunded to an employer (for example, because an employee has opted out of KiwiSaver) must be refunded to employers and not offset against tax debt. Employer contributions for employees with two or more funds (clause 538) Problems arise when an employee is a member of two funds, such as a KiwiSaver scheme and an existing employer fund. That is because of the difference in the base on which contributions are calculated between complying superannuation funds and other existing schemes (calculated on a gross base salary and wage basis) and KiwiSaver funds (calculated on a gross salary or wage basis). New section 101FC of the KiwiSaver Act ensures that when an employee is a member of two funds the employer is not required to make a “top up” payment of the difference to the employee’s KiwiSaver scheme. Extending double dipping provisions to existing defined contribution schemes (clause 537) The proposed amendment extends the legislation for preventing double dipping to existing defined superannuation schemes in which membership rights are portable. This means that members of a multi-employer scheme who change jobs to work for another employer who is part of the same scheme will not be able to continue receiving employer contributions for their existing scheme as well as access compulsory employer contributions for KiwiSaver. 156 Employer tax credit – “payment period” (clause 530) The KiwiSaver Act requires the employer tax credit to be based on the PAYE payment period. However, Inland Revenue does not have the information necessary to correctly administer employers’ entitlement to the employer tax credit because large employers pay employer contributions twice monthly but file information relating to the amounts contributed only once a month. Accordingly, the amendment to section 4(1) of the KiwiSaver Act will amend the reference to “payment period” for the employer tax credit, to reflect the payment period covered and align it with the employer monthly schedule that is monthly. Application date – 1 July 2008 The following minor amendment is to apply from 1 July 2008. Mortgage diversion facility – fixed dollar amount (clause 541) The “fixed dollar amount” requirement has been identified by superannuation industry representatives as being administratively costly and complex and likely to result in delays in payments to members’ mortgage lenders. The amendment to section 229(2)(i) of the KiwiSaver Act therefore removes the requirement that amounts diverted under the mortgage diversion facility be a “fixed dollar amount”. This will mean that the amount diverted from a person’s KiwiSaver scheme and complying funds will be capped at not more than the total of: • half the total contributions deducted for or contributed by the person and received by the KiwiSaver scheme provider; and • half the person’s contributions to the complying superannuation funds, but limited to 4% of their annual gross base salary or wages for each complying superannuation fund. This will ensure that members’ diverted contributions can be applied to their mortgage repayments in a timely manner. Application date – 1 October 2008 The following minor amendment is to apply from 1 October 2008: Removal of section 13 (clause 531) Section 13 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 provides that employees who begin a new job at a state or integrated school are treated as starting new employment, despite staying on the same payroll. However, to date, automatic enrolment has not occurred because Boards of Trustees 3 are exempt from automatically enrolling new employees as they meet the exempt employer requirements in the Act. This exemption will be revoked from 1 October 2008, when the State Sector Retirement Savings Scheme and the Teachers Retirement Savings Scheme, the vehicles which provided the exempt employer status, are closed to new enrolments. The Boards of Trustees’ exemption for automatic enrolment will therefore be revoked, creating compliance problems for 3 The Board of Trustees of a school is treated as the employer for KiwiSaver purposes. 157 Boards of Trustees and the Education Service Payroll, particularly in respect of transferring employees and employees in multiple employment across the education sector. The amendment accordingly removes section 13 of the KiwiSaver 2006 so that automatic enrolment will not occur for employees who transfer between schools. Application date – date of enactment The following minor amendments are to apply from the date of enactment of the amending legislation: Member tax credit (clause 465) The Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that fund providers must furnish the member tax credit claim on a date determined by the Commissioner. The reason for the due date was to ensure that each provider had the same opportunity to claim the credit and for the member tax credit payment to be pro-rated between providers for members who contribute to more than one scheme. The pro-rating of the credit between providers was removed at the select committee stage of the Taxation (KiwiSaver) Act 2007. Accordingly, the credit is to be paid to providers on a first come, first served basis, removing the need for a due date (other than after the end of the member tax credit year (30 June)). The amendment to section 68C of the Tax Administration Act will remove the requirement that the member tax credit claimed by a fund provider be furnished on a date determined by the Commissioner. Complying fund providers – eligibility to withdraw funds (clause 539) Employers are required to make compulsory contributions into their employees’ KiwiSaver or complying superannuation fund only for employees who are over 18 and under the age of eligibility to withdraw. Members become eligible to withdraw their KiwiSaver savings when they reach the age of eligibility for New Zealand Superannuation or after having been a member for five years, whichever occurs later. Section 101G(3) of the KiwiSaver Act requires providers to notify Inland Revenue of the date that members will be entitled to withdraw their accumulated interest in the scheme. This must be done within two months of members becoming entitled to withdraw the accumulated interest. The Commissioner may notify a member’s employer of the date so that the employer can cease making compulsory employer contributions. As complying superannuation fund providers have a direct relationship with employers, the amendment to section 101G (3) of the KiwiSaver Act ensures that complying fund providers inform employers directly (rather than via Inland Revenue) of the date upon which a member will be eligible to withdraw funds. 158 Exempt employer provisions sunset clause (clause 532) Sections 24 to 31 of the KiwiSaver Act contain the rules allowing certain employers to be exempt from the requirement to automatically enrol their new employees in KiwiSaver. Namely, employers can apply to the Government Actuary for approval for their employees to be exempt from the automatic enrolment rules if they provide access to an approved registered superannuation scheme which complies with specific criteria. The government is concerned that a number of employers have been establishing schemes which are not KiwiSaver schemes, for the apparent purpose of avoiding the automatic enrolment rules. This behaviour undermines the policy intent of KiwiSaver and the rationale behind the exemption from the automatic enrolment rules. To overcome this concern, an amendment to section 25(1)(b) of the KiwiSaver Act introduces a sunset clause for the exemption from automatic enrolment. The exemption applies only if the scheme is in existence at the date of enactment of the amending legislation. Interest paid on refunds (clause 534) Inland Revenue pays interest on money to be refunded to members and employers – for example, if members opt out. A minimum-value threshold of five dollars currently applies to interest paid on refunded contributions. The proposed repeal of sections 89(3) and (4) of the KiwiSaver Act will remove the threshold of five dollars for KiwiSaver purposes only so that interest is payable on all KiwiSaver refunds. 159 MISCELLANEOUS TECHNICAL ISSUES Amendments to correct drafting and printing errors (Various clauses) An unfortunate but inevitable consequence of the enactment of more than 3000 pages of tax legislation in 2007 is the need for remedial legislation to address drafting and printing issues that occurred in the last three months of the year. This bill contains over 100 amendments of this type. The amendments are to correct wrong cross-references, replace incorrect formulae with correct formulae, replace incorrect terminology with correct terminology, and to correct commencement dates. These amendments affect the Income Tax Act 2007, the Tax Administration Act 1994, and the KiwiSaver Act 2006. Pending enactment of legislation introduced in this bill, the effect of section ZA 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (the transitional provision) is generally considered to be that the meanings of the comparable provisions in the Income Tax Act 2004 are preserved. Recharacterisation of certain debentures (Clause 151) A remedial amendment corrects two unintended changes arising from the recent rewrite of the Income Tax Act which are contained in section FA 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The first unintended change is that certain debentures with market-related interest rates appear to be recharacterised as shares, contrary to former section FC 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004. The second unintended change relates to “substituting debentures”, which correspond to debentures included in former section FC 2 of the Income Tax Act 2004. That section excluded all convertible notes, but it appears that subsection FA 2(6) of the rewritten Act does not do so in the case of convertible notes issued with reference to shares in another company. The amendment applies from when the Income Tax Act 2007 came into force. Threshold rise for attribution of personal services income (Clause 181) The $60,000 income threshold in the personal services attribution rule is being raised to reflect the new personal tax rate structure enacted as part of Budget 2008 legislation. The personal services attribution rule ensures that income from personal services is attributed to the person who performs the services, rather than an interposed entity, in certain circumstances. Currently, the personal services attribution rule applies if the net income of the person performing the services is more than $60,000. The Taxation (Personal Tax Cuts, Annual Rates, and Remedial Matters) Act 2008 increases the threshold for the highest marginal tax rate over a period of four years. Section GB 27(2)(c) is therefore being consequentially amended to raise the personal services attribution threshold to $70,000 from 1 April 2008, $75,000 from 1 April 2010, and $80,000 from 1 April 2011. 160 Rewriting of the portfolio investment entity rules (Clause 214) In the second half of 2007, while the Income Tax Act 2007 was in its final Parliamentary stages, the portfolio investment entity rules (then Subpart HL of the 2004 Act) were in the course of extensive further development. To assist users of those rules, it was decided not to rewrite the rules for the Income Tax Act 2007. Undertakings were however given to rewrite these rules in “rewrite” style and to consult with representatives of the tax professions to ensure that the rewritten rules correctly reflect the law as it stood at the end of 2007. The rules have now been rewritten and the comments and suggestions of the various reviewers have been taken in to account. The rewritten portfolio investment entity rules appear in this bill as an amendment to insert the new Subpart HM of the Income Tax Act 2007 and have application from 1 April 2009 for the 2009–10 and later income years.

Every resident company, independent of size, is affected by the imputation tax credit rules, and every shareholder in a New Zealand company is eligible to receive imputation credits. 1.2 Imputation is a mechanism that allows credit for income tax paid at the company level to be passed through to shareholders on dividends paid by the company. Resident shareholders may use the imputation credits attached to their dividends to reduce the amount of New Zealand tax they pay, which means that the company tax is essentially a withholding tax for New Zealand- resident taxpaying shareholders. However, because surplus imputation credits cannot be refunded to shareholders, the company tax is a final tax for shareholders who do not pay income tax in New Zealand – non-resident shareholders and New Zealand-resident shareholders that are tax-exempt, such as charities. They have no final New Zealand tax liability against which to offset the imputation credits. Scope of discussion document 1.3 This discussion document is very much a problem definition exercise that seeks the public’s views on certain features of New Zealand’s imputation system concerning the question of who can use imputation credits. The government is not reviewing whether to retain an imputation system, which will remain an integral part of the New Zealand tax system. 1.4 The main areas of interest in this review are the rules relating to streaming of imputation credits, which means directing them to shareholders who can use them, and the refundability of imputation credits, an issue of particular importance to charities. 1.5 Key objectives for the government when considering the areas addressed by this review are: • keeping the company tax system as close to a fully integrated system as possible – that is, as far as possible, taxing income derived through companies at the tax rates of the shareholders who own the company at the time the income is derived; • ensuring that New Zealand source-basis taxation is retained – that is, taxing non-residents on the income that is derived through their investments in New Zealand; • ensuring that the relevant rules do not stand in the way of legitimate business transactions; and 2 • continuing to provide a “belt and braces” approach to reducing incentives for company tax to be avoided by continuing to tax domestic shareholders on their unimputed dividends. 1.6 At times there may be conflicts between these objectives that will need to be resolved. 1.7 This discussion document is the first step in a process of consultation on possible improvements to the imputation system. The document describes the policy behind the current rules and seeks views on whether there are problems with these rules, and especially whether they impede legitimate business activity. It also seeks readers’ views on whether there are better options that meet the government’s objectives but work more smoothly and provide greater certainty in practice. 1.8 It is important to understand the issues before concrete proposals are developed, so the government invites submissions from interested parties on these important areas of our imputation system. Following consideration of submissions, the government may develop detailed proposals and consult further on any such proposals. 1.9 Chapter 2 considers what streaming is and why we have rules to prevent it. It covers why allowing the streaming of imputation credits to those who can use them can be contrary to the government’s objectives. It invites submissions on whether not allowing streaming can stand in the way of valid business transactions. 1.10 Chapter 3 considers the current rules on streaming and seeks views on whether they create significant costs or uncertainties for business. It seeks views on possible improvements to these rules. 1.11 Chapter 4 examines the question of refunding imputation credits, which is not available under the current rules. The chapter sets out the basis for this approach and discusses the concerns raised by the possibility of allowing refunds and how that would fit with the government’s objectives. The question of refunds is of particular interest to the charitable sector. At present, charities that receive imputation credits with their New Zealand dividends are not able to use them given that they are exempt from New Zealand income tax. This is likely to bias their investment decisions away from New Zealand shares. 1.12 The matters outlined in this discussion document need to be considered in their entirety, since design changes in one area of the imputation system would put pressure on other areas of the system. For example, allowing imputation credits to be refunded in some circumstances would tend to place greater pressure on measures that protect against streaming. For this reason, the government would appreciate feedback that considers coherent packages of possible reforms and clearly communicates the submitters’ priorities. 1.13 There are two general issues that warrant some introductory comments: the relationship between the imputation review and the continuing review of New Zealand’s international tax rules, and mutual recognition of imputation and franking credits between Australia and New Zealand. 3 Relation to review of international tax rules 1.14 Some commentators have argued that New Zealand’s imputation system is inconsistent with the direction of the reform of our international tax rules, which has been to exempt the offshore active income of controlled foreign companies, in keeping with the practice of other OECD countries. However, that is a misunderstanding of the objectives behind the international review, the aim of which has not been to provide incentives for offshore investment ahead of investment in New Zealand. Nor is there any overarching principal that offshore income should be exempt. 1.15 Instead the exemption of offshore active income, which is the subject of legislation currently before Parliament, reflects an acceptance that if New Zealand attempts to tax the active income of its CFCs much more harshly than other countries do, New Zealand firms that want to internationalise will have incentives to migrate to countries that have more favourable tax rules. That is clearly not in New Zealand’s best interest. 1.16 Without the proposed legislative changes, firms looking to expand offshore might well have found it more attractive to base their head offices in a country such as Australia, which exempts offshore active income. The aim of the reform of our international tax rules has been to remove this bias. 1.17 There is no reason, however, for this income to be exempt from tax when it is distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends. 1.18 If a company migrates from New Zealand, any New Zealand portfolio shareholders will pay tax either through the fair dividend rate system or, if the company is listed in Australia, on any dividends received from the company. Taxing unimputed dividends in New Zealand is unlikely to make it more attractive for firms to migrate offshore. Moreover, it has allowed our proposed international rules to be less onerous than would otherwise be the case. 1.19 The imputation rules offer incentives for New Zealand-owned firms to pay tax in New Zealand because they can offer imputation credits to New Zealand shareholders. That provides some safeguards against erosion of the domestic tax base. Mutual recognition 1.20 A major issue which is outside the scope of this review is the possibility of introducing a system of mutual recognition of imputation and franking credits between Australia and New Zealand, the subject of a joint media statement from the Australian Treasurer and the New Zealand Minister of Finance in July. In the government’s view, mutual recognition would increase the efficiency of trans-Tasman investment decisions and reduce incentives for the streaming of profits between the two countries. The Australian Treasurer, Mr Swan, has stated that the Australian government has an open mind on the question of whether or not to enter into a bilateral agreement on mutual recognition with New Zealand. He has invited the New Zealand Treasury to make a submission on this issue to the review known as Australia’s Future Tax 4 System, which was recently established by the Federal Labor Government. Its final report is expected by the end of 2009. 1.21 The government believes that for mutual recognition to proceed, it would not be necessary to achieve complete harmonisation of our respective imputation systems. It would, however, be attractive for our systems to be aligned as much as is feasible and consistent with each country’s policy goals. The possibility of introducing mutual recognition might also place constraints on policy reform options that would make Australia less comfortable with entering into such an agreement. 1.22 The question arises of why issue a discussion document on imputation at this stage when there is so much uncertainty as to future developments. On this point, the purpose of this document is to make sure that private sector concerns about the imputation system are clearly understood by the government before further work is undertaken in this area. This will be useful irrespective of the future direction on mutual recognition. How to make a submission 1.23 The government invites submissions on the issues raised in this discussion document. Submissions should be made by 10 October 2008 and be addressed to: Imputation review C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington Or email policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Imputation review” in the subject line. 1.24 Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. They should also indicated whether it would be acceptable for Inland Revenue and Treasury officials to contact those making the submission to discuss the points raised, if required. 1.25 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their publication. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. Those making a submission who consider there is any part of it that should properly be withheld under the Act should clearly indicate this. 5 CHAPTER 2 What is streaming and why have rules to prevent it? Matters for discussion This chapter discusses imputation streaming and the reason we have rules preventing it. Allowing streaming would conflict with a number of the key objectives of the review, including that of keeping the company tax system as close to a fully integrated tax system as possible. At the same time, preventing streaming may also stand in the way of legitimate business transactions. The government seeks comment on the following matters: • Do the current anti-streaming rules create particularly difficult problems for companies or shareholders? • What are the pros and cons of allowing streaming in limited circumstances? 2.1 Under current law there are rules to prevent the streaming of imputation credits to particular shareholders, which are discussed in Chapter 3. This chapter describes the concept of streaming in the context of our current imputation system. It explains why our rules seek to prevent streaming. It also considers whether this approach is appropriate and, in particular whether there are situations where streaming should be allowed. What is streaming? 2.2 New Zealand-resident companies earn imputation credits from the payment of their company tax and from the imputation credits attached to dividends they receive from other New Zealand-resident companies. These credits can be attached by the company to dividends paid to its shareholders. 2.3 The value of imputation credits will not be the same for all shareholders. For some shareholders imputation credits have little or no value. New Zealand- resident shareholders that pay tax can use the credits to reduce their New Zealand tax payable. However, foreign shareholders have no New Zealand income tax against which to apply imputation credits, and tax-exempt New Zealand shareholders do not benefit from imputation credits. 2.4 This creates an incentive to direct the credits to those shareholders best able to use them, a practice commonly called dividend or imputation credit “streaming”. Rules preventing streaming support a number of the key objectives of the imputation system. 6 Why have rules preventing streaming? 2.5 Chapter 1 set out the government’s objectives, which include ensuring that New Zealand’s tax system remains as close to a fully integrated tax system as possible, New Zealand source-basis taxation is retained and income that has not borne company tax is subject to shareholder tax to provide a “belt and braces” approach to protecting the tax base. Abandoning any rules preventing streaming and instead allowing unlimited streaming would be inconsistent with these objectives. This is best illustrated by way of examples. Example 1 – How unlimited streaming undermines integration principle 2.6 Consider a company owned by two shareholders, each of whom has a 50 percent shareholding. One is a domestic resident taxed at a rate of 33% and the other is a non-resident. The company earns $100 of New Zealand-source income, on which it pays $30 of tax and $100 of foreign-source income (net of any foreign taxes), on which it pays no tax in New Zealand. Any foreign tax liability for the non-resident shareholder is ignored. 2.7 Streaming is not permitted under current rules. If the company distributed all of its profits, it could pay an $85 cash dividend to both its domestic and its foreign shareholders. The New Zealand shareholder would receive $85 of dividends, together with $15 of imputation credits, and hence income of $100 on which there would be further tax of $18 to pay. This is tax of $33 minus the imputation credit of $15. The resident shareholder’s after-tax income would be $67. 2.8 The non-resident shareholder receives $85 in cash dividends plus $15 of imputation credits, which implies a supplementary dividend and associated foreign investor tax credit (FITC credit) of $6.18. The cash plus the supplementary dividends lead to a gross dividend of $91.18, on which $13.68 of non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) is due. This leads to an after-tax dividend of $77.50. This is captured in Figure 1. 2.9 Total tax collected is $55.50. This appears an appropriate level of tax under current policy settings. The resident’s share of the domestic-source income is $50, as is her share of the foreign-source income. On distribution, all this income ends up being taxed at the shareholder’s rate of 33%, resulting in $33 of tax. The non-resident’s share of domestic-source income is taxed at 30%, resulting in $15 of tax, and, on final distribution, there is an NRWT deduction of 15%, or $7.50, on his share of foreign-source income that flows through New Zealand. The total tax of $55.50 is the sum of these amounts ($33 plus $15 plus $7.50). These calculations are shown in Figure 1. 7 Figure 1.

Assuming that both shareholders in the figure continue to receive a cash dividend of $85, the domestic resident now has gross income of $115 ($85 plus an imputation credit of $30). 1 Extra tax on this is $7.95, leading to after-tax income of $77.05. 1 The examples here abstract from a number of potential company and securities law issues. This particular example assumes that streaming imputation credits within a single class of shareholder is acceptable under company law as well as tax law. 8 2.11 The non-resident shareholder now receives a cash dividend of $85, with no imputation credits, on which 15 percent NRWT is levied, amounting to $12.75. The after-tax return is $72.25. In this example, tax paid by the resident has fallen by $10.05 ($18 minus $7.95), while taxes in respect of the non-resident’s dividend have increased by $5.25 ($12.75 minus $7.50). 2.12 If streaming is allowed, New Zealand obtains less tax than would be the case if both shareholders invested in a single company with half of the foreign and half of the domestic earnings of the company that they jointly own. We end up taxing shareholders on less than their shares of the income. Thus streaming would be counter to the integration principle. 2 2.13 The anti-streaming provisions also guard against artificial incentives for sales of shares or mergers to achieve a tax-efficient ownership structure. To illustrate this point, suppose once more that there were two companies, each with half the foreign and half the domestic income of the company described above. Assume that one company is owned by a resident and the other by a non-resident. Allowing streaming would create an artificial incentive for these firms to merge so that imputation credits could be streamed to the resident shareholder, who is best able to use them. 2.14 The rules preventing streaming also act as a barrier to the undermining of the integration principle or source-basis taxation in a number of other ways. 2.15 For example, abandoning our anti-streaming provisions (such as the share lending and imputation continuity provisions discussed in Chapter 3) could also open up scope for source-basis taxation to be undermined. This is illustrated in Example 2. Example 2 – How unlimited streaming undermines source-basis taxation 2.16 Suppose that a company that is 100 percent owned by a non-resident shareholder earns $100 profit and pays $30 tax. If these profits are distributed to the non-resident shareholder then the shareholder will make an after-tax return of $70. New Zealand has imposed source-basis taxation, as intended. 2.17 However, to take an extreme possibility, suppose instead that before distribution the shares are sold temporarily to a 33% shareholder, with an arrangement to receive a $100 cash payment (equal to the cash dividend plus a share of the imputation credits). The non-resident would make an after-tax return of $100. In this case source-basis taxation would be completely undermined. As a tax deduction is likely to be available for making the payment, the 33% shareholder would receive excess imputation credits of $30, which could be used against its tax liability on other New Zealand income. This would equate to a $30 reduction in New Zealand tax collected. These calculations are shown in Figure 3. 2 In this simple example, if streaming were allowed the foreign shareholder ends up being worse off. However, the company might make both shareholders better off than they are in Figure 1 by issuing two classes of shares, one of which pays a slightly higher cash dividend than the other. 9 Figure 3. After-tax returns for Example 2 Attributed income$100 Tax liability$30 Tax paid$30 After-tax return$70 Dividend$70 Imputation credits$30 Swap payment($100) Tax liability$0 Imputation credits(30) Excess credits$30 Dividends direct to shareholder Share lending Company Income$100 Tax$30 Non-resident shareholder Domestic shareholder Company Income$100 Non-resident shareholder $100 2.18 In this extreme example, the taxpayer acquiring the shares just breaks even. The cash dividend of $70 and the $30 of excess imputation credits just compensate for the $100 cost of the swap payment. In practice, the benefits of this arrangement are likely to be shared between the two parties. 2.19 The transaction raises policy concerns because the taxation of the dividend income in the hands of the domestic shareholder is sheltered by the swap payment. Therefore the purchaser obtains access to the imputation credit without receiving any net tax liability on the underlying income. 2.20 In practice, both the returning share transfer rules and the imputation continuity rules discussed in Chapter 3 guard against this possibility. They are necessary to protect source-basis taxation. 2.21 Example 3 provides a further illustration of the way in which eliminating anti- streaming provisions would be inconsistent with the objective of keeping the tax system as close to a fully integrated tax system as possible. Example 3 – How unlimited streaming undermines integration objective 2.22 Suppose that a company were owned by an individual taxed at a 39% marginal rate. The company earns $100 and pays tax of $30. If the dividend were distributed to its shareholder, there would be a further $9 of tax to pay, leaving an after-tax dividend of $61. This is illustrated in the left-hand panel of Figure 4. 10 Figure 4. After-tax returns for Example 3 Attributed income$100 Tax liability$39 Tax paid$39 After-tax return$61 Dividend$70 Imputation credits$30 Tax liability$33 Imputation credits(30) Tax paid$3 After-tax return$67 Dividends direct to shareholder Sale of shares Company Income$100 Tax$30 39% shareholder 33% shareholder Company Income$100 39% shareholder 2.23 However, if there were no continuity provisions or other safeguards, the company might be sold to a shareholder on a 33% tax rate (possibly a trust). In this case, the dividends could be distributed to the new shareholder and taxed at 33%, which is less than the tax rate of the shareholder who owned the company at the time the profit was earned. This would be inconsistent with the integration objective of ensuring that, as far as possible, income is taxed as income of the shareholders who own the company at the time the profits are being earned. 2.24 New Zealand’s continuity provisions, which are described in Chapter 3, may guard against this sort of possibility. They generally ensure that before any such sale takes place, profits are distributed to the original shareholder, either as a dividend or through a bonus issue, so that the profits end up being taxed at the marginal rate of the original owner (although not, of course, necessarily at the marginal rate that applied in the year the income was earned). 2.25 It is an open question, however, as to how concerned we should be if shares are sold to one person to another on a different tax rate when there is only a minor difference in their rates. These concerns obviously become larger the greater the difference in tax rates or, as discussed in Chapter 4, if imputation credits can be refunded. What would the cost be if there were no anti-streaming provisions? 2.26 First, consider the potential costs arising from undermining source-basis taxation, as shown in Example 1. 2.27 Figure 5 shows imputation credits claimed in 2006. Approximately 43 percent of these were claimed by non-resident shareholders. 11 Figure 5. Imputation credits claimed in 2006 income year 2% 1% 9% 25% 17% 2% 43% 1% Unallocated (individual non-filers) Individual 19.5% Individual 33% Individual 39% Trust Company Super funds & others Non resident 2.28 It is clear that if unlimited streaming were allowed and this effectively allowed domestic company tax to be refunded to non-resident shareholders, the cost could be very substantial indeed. Company tax for 2008-09 is forecast to be $7.5 billion, and 43 percent of this would be of the order of $3.2 billion. 2.29 This is a very rough costing. The 43 percent figure does not necessarily reflect the proportion of foreign ownership of New Zealand companies because different companies will have different distribution rates. Also, there is the possibility for double counting as dividends are passed between related companies. Finally, there is considerable volatility in this ratio. For example, in 2005 only 36 percent of imputation credits were claimed by non-residents. 2.30 Whether or not all of this would be at risk is an open question. However, loss of any significant part of $3.2 billion could not be contemplated by the government. 2.31 Costs of allowing streaming could also arise in the case of a company owned by a New Zealand resident. Suppose, for example, that our imputation continuity provisions (discussed in Chapter 3) were repealed and there were no replacement safeguards. That would allow the type of arrangement considered in Example 3. While there is a theoretical risk of income that should be taxed at a marginal rate of 39% being diverted to companies owned by those on a marginal rate of 12.5%, it is unlikely to be a major problem in practice. The larger concern could be diversion of income from those on a marginal rate of 39% to those, including trusts, taxed at a marginal rate of 33% percent or perhaps to widely held savings vehicles taxed at 30%. 12 2.32 At present, those on the top marginal tax rate are declaring $1,872 million in imputed dividends. If all of these were diverted to taxpayers on a 33% rate, the cost would be $112 million. It is also possible that income would be diverted to taxpayers on lower rates. If instead the income were all diverted to taxpayers on a 30% rate, the cost would be $169 million. 2.33 In practice, only a fraction of this amount is likely to be at risk because the kind of diversion shown in Example 3 would apply only to companies owned and controlled by a small group of shareholders. It would seem to be much more difficult to achieve diversion in the case of a more widely held company, although individual shareholders in the company could sell their shares before receiving a dividend without the company losing credits. 2.34 As well as any ongoing costs, there could potentially be an important one-off cost from allowing unlimited streaming. Figure 6 shows imputation credit account balances for various types of companies in New Zealand. By far the largest number of excess credits are held by close companies. These are companies with five or fewer shareholders, which can of course include very large private companies. The explanation for this is likely to relate in part to the fact that if dividends are distributed to shareholders rather than being retained in the company, they will be taxed in the shareholders’ hands at 39%. Removing anti-streaming provisions would create opportunities for this income to be passed to new shareholders on lower tax rates. Figure 6.

An important question is whether or not these anti-streaming rules get in the way of valid commercial transactions. 2.36 Before examining the question, it is worth briefly discussing the imputation system itself. Some have argued that imputation can stand in the way of firms expanding overseas. This is because domestic profits are taxed once, whereas foreign profits may be taxed twice: first when earned abroad by a foreign tax authority, and second when distributed as non-imputed dividends to domestic shareholders. Foreign profits would be double taxed under some other tax systems as well, including New Zealand’s former classical company tax system. 2.37 It is clear that relative to New Zealand’s former classical company tax system, there is a greater incentive to earn taxable domestic income under full imputation. Incentives to earn income in forms that are taxable in New Zealand help to make our company tax base more robust. They also tend to boost New Zealand’s capital stock, which will add to growth and productivity. 2.38 However, the fact that the full imputation system increases incentives for domestic investment does not mean that it discourages offshore investment more than a classical company tax system does (for a given company tax rate). Shareholders will invest in companies that invest abroad if the after-tax returns are likely to exceed the opportunity cost of capital. Under both a classical company tax system and New Zealand’s full imputation system, foreign-source income can be taxed both by the foreign revenue authority when the income is earned and in New Zealand when ultimately distributed to shareholders. 2.39 There may, however, be some more complex instances where the imputation system could be argued to impede internationalisation. This leads to a difficult conundrum for the government because addressing this issue would open up the concerns with streaming that were discussed earlier. Example 4 – Bias against domestic company taking on foreign equity to invest abroad 2.40 Consider, for example, Company 1, which is owned solely by residents and is earning domestic-source income. Also suppose that this company is currently fully distributing its profits as dividends and that it wishes to continue to do so. Such a company can be discouraged from issuing shares to foreigners to invest abroad in ways that would not happen if the investment took place through a separate company. This is illustrated in Example 4. 14 2.41 Suppose that Company 1 is initially owned by a New Zealand-resident shareholder taxed at a rate of 33%. It earns $100 of income on which it pays $30 of tax. It has a 100 percent distribution policy so it distributes its $70 of after-tax income as a dividend. The shareholder pays further tax of $3 and receives after-tax income of $67. This is illustrated in the left-hand side of the top panel of Figure 7. 2.42 Also suppose that a non-resident is willing to invest an amount, say $1,000, to a New Zealand firm (Company 2) with a technological innovation that allows the company to earn $90 abroad net of any foreign taxes. This income can then be paid as a dividend to the foreign shareholder. Under the proposed active income exemption that is currently before Parliament, Company 2 would pay no further tax in New Zealand, assuming the income is “active”. This income can then be distributed as a dividend on which $13.50 of NRWT is paid, leaving the non-residents with $76.50 net of New Zealand taxes. For simplicity, we assume that the non-resident is not taxed on this income and cares only about the return net of New Zealand tax. 2.43 The imputation system can disadvantage the New Zealand company drawing on foreign capital to expand into offshore markets. Suppose, for example, that rather than these investments being undertaken by two separate companies, Company 1 acquires the foreign capital and starts earning both domestic and foreign-source income. Also suppose that it continues to want to fully distribute its profits. This case is illustrated in the bottom panel of Figure 7. The company is now earning $100 of domestic income, on which it pays $30 of tax and $90 of foreign-source income net of any foreign taxes. It pays no New Zealand tax on its foreign-source income. It could now pay a dividend of $80 to both its domestic shareholder and its foreign shareholder, assuming equal numbers of shares are held by both parties. However, this will be less attractive to both shareholders than if the investment were to be undertaken by separate companies. 2.44 Under the single company scenario, the domestic shareholder would receive an $80 dividend together with $15 of imputation credits, on which it would need to pay $16.35 in further tax. This would leave it with an after-tax return of $63.65, which is less than the initial after-tax return of $67. At the same time, the foreign shareholder would receive $80 of dividends and $15 of imputation credits, leading to a FITC credit of $6.18 and a gross dividend of $86.18. NRWT of $12.93 would be payable, leaving an after-tax return of $73.25, which would be unattractive from the foreign shareholder’s point of view as well. Thus an investment that would be attractive if taken through separate companies can become unattractive if undertaken through a single firm. Figure 7 shows the after-tax return under both scenarios. 15 Figure 7. After-tax returns for Example 4 Dividend$70.00 Imputation credits$30.00 Tax paid$3.00 After-tax return$67.00 Company 1 NZ income$100.00 Tax$30.00 A shareholder (33% resident) Dividend$90.00 NRWT$13.50 After-tax return$76.50 Company 2 Foreign income$90.00 NZ tax$0.00 B shareholder (non-resident) Dividend$80.00 Imputation credits$15.00 Tax paid$16.35 After-tax return$63.65 Company NZ income$100.00 Foreign income$90.00 NZ Tax$30.00 A shareholder (33% resident) Dividend$80.00 Imputation credits$15.00 FITC$6.18 Total dividends\*$86.18 NRWT$12.93 After-tax return$73.25 B shareholder (non-resident) \* Includes supplementary dividend 2.45 There are clearly some margins of adjustment that this example has ignored. For instance, one possibility might be for Company 1 to reduce its dividend yield when it takes on foreign shareholders to invest abroad. 2.46 Clearly, one possible way of removing this bias would be to allow foreign- source income to be streamed to foreign shareholders and domestic-source income to domestic shareholders. In this case, Company 1 could take on additional foreign capital to invest abroad without this diminishing its ability to pay fully imputed dividends to its domestic residents. It is very easy for taxpayers to convert domestic passive income into foreign passive income, and there may be concerns about biases discouraging firms from acquiring foreign equity to earn passive income abroad. This might possibly provide grounds for allowing only foreign active income to be streamed to foreign residents. At least in principle, however, a case could be made for allowing domestic income to be streamed to domestic residents and, perhaps, foreign active income to be streamed to foreign residents. 2.47 There are, however, a number of balancing considerations. 16 2.48 First, it is clear that there is a conflict between allowing such streaming and the government’s objective of keeping the imputation system as close to a fully integrated system as possible. 2.49 In principle, all shareholders own a fraction of a company’s underlying assets and have, in effect, borne a share of the corporate tax. Integration would mean that credits should, in principle, be distributed to all shareholders on a pro rata basis. This is not compatible with streaming, as was illustrated in Example 1. 2.50 Second, as noted, an important constraint on considering any possible streaming options is that the options should not create scope for source-basis taxation to be undermined. Before the government could contemplate allowing this form of dividend streaming it would need to be assured that it could do so without undermining source-basis taxation. 2.51 Third, allowing streaming would also create other biases. As was examined when discussing Example 1, allowing streaming would provide artificial incentives for mergers or sales of shares to create a tax-efficient ownership structure. Would these efficiency costs be greater than any efficiency benefits from allowing such streaming? 2.52 Fourth, an important feature of the New Zealand imputation scheme is the way in which it taxes dividends to domestic taxpaying shareholders when these dividends are not out of profits that have borne domestic tax. This creates incentives, all else equal, for firms to pay tax in New Zealand. This helps ensure the integrity of the New Zealand company tax system. A potential concern with any system of dividend streaming is that it may weaken these incentives. 2.53 Working through the pros and cons of allowing this form of dividend streaming is a complex issue. The government has yet to make a firm decision on this issue but there is clearly a big hurdle that needs to be overcome before contemplating any change in this area. The government would need to be convinced that the current rules were causing particularly difficult problems and that any rule change could be reasonably contained to the identified problem. It would also need to be convinced that the benefits of allowing streaming would outweigh the costs. It is interested, however, in receiving submissions on this issue and especially on whether or not it would be possible to introduce some form of dividend streaming without compromising the government’s other objectives. Impact on capital markets 2.54 A number of other, more limited dividend streaming proposals have been made for certain foreign-owned companies operating in New Zealand as ways of developing capital markets. 17 2.55 Market participants have raised concerns about the lack of depth in the New Zealand market. In particular, it has been argued that the acquisition of New Zealand companies by foreign investors means that New Zealand investors can now access only certain key sectors of the market by investing through foreign (mainly Australian) companies. It is clear that New Zealand’s imputation system does provide incentives for New Zealand residents to invest at home, since imputation credits are provided for domestic but not foreign taxes. However, that is arguably attractive from a national welfare perspective because domestic taxes form part of the national return on the investment as they contribute to the government’s ability to finance a wide range of public services. Capital invested in New Zealand will add to labour productivity and growth. 2.56 Limited dividend streaming might be one way of increasing the attractiveness of investment in foreign companies, but a case would need to be made as to why this would be in the best interest of New Zealand as a whole. A more attractive option still would be to allow mutual recognition of imputation credits between Australia and New Zealand. This option is being explored with Australia. It would appear to be an attractive way of expanding the set of companies that New Zealanders can invest in and receive imputation credits. 2.57 A number of parties have expressed concerns about the size of New Zealand’s share market. On the surface, New Zealand’s full imputation system, by making it more attractive for New Zealanders to invest at home, would appear likely to increase the size of the New Zealand share market. Even so, the government is particularly interested to hear of any features of the imputation system that might be inefficiently restricting the development of New Zealand’s capital markets. This is an issue that might be considered by the government’s recently announced Capital Market Development Task Force. 2.58 The government is not closing the door on limited dividend streaming proposals and is interested in receiving submissions on the issue. Before any moves in this direction were contemplated, however, it would be necessary to ensure that any such changes would not advantage foreign-owned firms relative to domestic-owned firms. To do so could create incentives for New Zealand companies to move their head offices overseas and then conduct their domestic operations through a subsidiary of the foreign parent. 2.59 It is also recognised that allowing any form of dividend streaming may or may not be acceptable to Australia if the two countries were to agree on a system of mutual recognition of imputation credits. Therefore it may not be possible to decide if this sort of reform is feasible until we decide on whether or not to pursue mutual recognition. Even if mutual recognition were not to proceed, any move to allow limited streaming would need to be discussed with Australia under the existing trans-Tasman imputation arrangements. 18 CHAPTER 3 Options for improving the current anti-streaming rules Matters for discussion Chapter 2 discussed the grounds for the government continuing to enforce some form of anti-streaming and credit allocation rules. This chapter seeks feed-back on the current anti-streaming rules as follows: • The extent to which the rules: – interfere with normal commercial transactions; – impose unnecessary compliance costs; or – lack certainty. • Suggestions for changes to any or all of the current anti-streaming rules. Would adoption of some Australian anti-streaming concepts enhance our rules? 3.1 Chapter 2 discussed why New Zealand’s current imputation rules are aimed at preventing dividend streaming and the reasons for the government continuing to enforce some form of anti-streaming rules. 3.2 That means, regardless of the eventual decision on whether or not there may be limited circumstances when streaming should be allowable, that a review of the current anti-streaming rules is timely. It would be of particular importance if the government were to support some form of limited streaming as that would introduce a new boundary into the tax system. Limited streaming would inevitably place more pressure on the existing rules. How will the government judge suggestions for change? 3.3 Some of the current anti-streaming rules target specific transactions, while others are of a general anti-avoidance nature. The rules are intended to be interdependent. When considering whether any or all of the rules can be enhanced, the government seeks comment on three broad questions. 3.4 The first question, taking into account the government’s objectives for this review, as set out in Chapter 1, is whether the rules inhibit normal commercial transactions. The government is especially keen to hear how the rules impact on arrangements using hybrid instruments (mixtures of debt and equity) such as redeemable preference shares, or the use of special purpose vehicles, as these type of arrangements are becoming increasingly common. 19 3.5 The second question is whether the rules impose an unnecessary compliance burden. As was pointed out in Example 3 of Chapter 1, the rules provide some protection for keeping the tax system as close as possible to an integrated tax system when the original and new shareholders are on different rates. The weight that is given to this concern when the rate differential is small is an open question. Take, for example, a share sale (including sale of an imputation credit balance) where the vendor shareholder is on a 39% percent tax rate and the purchaser on a 33% rate. In that case, the current rules would protect against a small loss of revenue ($6). It is clear, however, that concerns about this sort of arbitrage would be much larger if there were much bigger differences in tax rates. 3.6 The third potential question is whether the rules provide sufficient certainty for taxpayers to undertake commercial transactions with a clear understanding of the boundaries between what is legally acceptable and unacceptable. 3.7 The rules need to be considered in their entirety. Design change in one area of the rules puts pressure on other areas. The ease of administering any rule changes would also need to be considered. 3.8 This chapter outlines the current rules and suggests some possible areas where the anti-streaming provisions might be amended, particularly in light of the possibility of some movement in the direction of Australia’s anti-streaming rules. Relationship with Australian rules 3.9 Contemplating rules that are more consistent with those in Australia may be helpful when negotiating whether to have a system of mutual recognition of imputation credits and in implementing such a system. Australian rulings issued under the rules, as well as relevant case law, may also help provide taxpayers and administrators with a greater degree of certainty. 3.10 Any consideration of moving towards the Australian rules, however, should recognise New Zealand’s different tax environment. Share sales in Australia are subject to a capital gains tax, which also has the effect of inhibiting short- term transactions. The absence of such a tax in New Zealand means that it is more likely that shareholder integrity measures have to be comprehensive, to avoid unintended manipulation of the rules. This means that, other things being equal, New Zealand may need tighter anti-streaming provisions than Australia does. 20 New Zealand’s current anti-streaming rules Shareholder continuity rule (sections OA 8, OB 41, OZ 4) 3 3.11 The shareholder continuity rule helps to protect both source-basis taxation and the objective of keeping that tax system as close to a fully integrated system as possible, by preventing the type of streaming discussed in Examples 2 and 3 of the preceding chapter. This rule attempts to prohibit a company from carrying forward imputation credits unless a substantial percentage of those people who benefit from imputation credits were shareholders when the income was derived. It works by cancelling imputation credits in the event of a change of ownership greater than 34 percent from the time when those credits were generated Same credit ratio (sections OA 18, OB 60-63, OZ 7, OZ 8, OZ 9) 3.12 A company can attach imputation credits to its dividends from a minimum of nil to a maximum ratio of: Company Tax Rate 4 1 – Company Tax Rate 3.13 Companies are required either to maintain the same ratio of credit to net dividend distributions for all distributions during any income year as the credit ratio on the first (or benchmark) dividend, or make a ratio change declaration to the effect that the variation of credit ratio is not a streaming arrangement. Individual shareholders are therefore not able to gain a tax credit for a greater amount of tax than others who may have paid it on distributions within the current imputation year. Trusts and partnerships (sections LE 1-6, LF 2-4) 3.14 Imputation credits on dividends distributed to trust beneficiaries are allocated according to the proportion of aggregate distributions (whether capital or income) made to each beneficiary from the trust in that year. The allocation rules for partnerships mirror those of trusts. Imputation credit shopping (section OB 71, OB 72) 3.15 These rules are intended to prevent imputation credits earned by one group of companies being paid to the shareholders of a different group of companies. In broad terms, a company that has an imputation credit account debit balance when it leaves or joins a wholly owned group must pay an amount of tax equal to the debit. When there is no change in the ultimate owners of the group the leaving company can elect to have the debit balance debited to the imputation credit account of another company in the group. The shareholder continuity rule is also intended to prevent imputation credit shopping. 3 All statutory references are to the Income Tax Act 2007. 4 Following the change in the company tax rate to 30% from the start of the 2008-09 income year, a transitional rule allows existing credits to be passed through at the 33/67 ratio until 1 April 2010. 21 Share lending (section GB 49) 3.16 Share lending rules allow qualifying transactions to be taxed on the substance of the transaction, which is a loan of shares, rather than the legal form, which is a sale of shares. Therefore, for imputation purposes, the imputation credits remain with the economic owner of the shares (the share supplier), who is the person who originally transferred the shares to another person (the share user). This is achieved by transferring the imputation credits to the share supplier and denying the tax credit to the share user. A specific anti-avoidance provision ensures that taxpayers do not attempt to structure arrangements to fall outside of the Income Tax Act (not merely the share lending rules). In that situation, Inland Revenue may treat the arrangement as a returning share transfer, with the person affected by the arrangement treated as a share supplier or share user. These rules guard against the type of arrangements illustrated in Example 2 of Chapter 2. General anti-avoidance rules Arrangements to defeat continuity rule (section GB 34) 3.17 When shares have been subject to an arrangement intended to defeat the intent and application of the shareholder continuity rule, under this rule the company is deemed not to have met the continuity requirements in respect of those shares. Stapled stock (section GB 37) 3.18 This rule is aimed at arrangements in which a taxpayer is a shareholder of, say, a non-resident company but the rights of shareholding include allowing the shareholder to receive dividends from an associated company resident in New Zealand. (This kind of arrangement is not to be confused with arrangements that involve equity stapled to debt instruments. These are being addressed separately.) 3.19 If an arrangement is entered into for a purpose of having another company pay a dividend to the shareholder, a dividend is deemed to be paid by the company that entered into the arrangement. Also, the imputation credits attached to the dividend are deemed to be a debit to that company’s imputation credit account. 3.20 Any imputation credit subject to this provision is neither eligible as a credit of tax against the recipient’s income tax liability nor is it eligible for conversion and carry-forward as a net loss or tax credit. Arrangements to obtain a tax advantage from imputation credits (section GB 35) 3.21 The imputation rules have a general anti-avoidance provision directed at counteracting trading in or recycling of credits and temporary transfers of interests in companies in order to obtain a tax advantage. 22 3.22 An arrangement to obtain a tax advantage includes streaming arrangements in which the streaming will give a higher credit value to a person receiving the credit than would have been case for the person who would have otherwise received the credit. A dividend has a higher credit value if it has an attached imputation credit and it replaces a dividend that does not, or if the imputation ratio of the dividend is higher than that of the other dividend. 3.23 When an arrangement is subject to this provision, the person who would get a tax credit advantage is denied it, and the company that would get an account advantage (a credit to its imputation credit account) has a debit to its imputation credit account equal to the imputation credit. What are the private sector’s concerns about the current rules? 3.24 The government is uncertain about the overall depth of private sector concern about the current anti-streaming rules, and therefore seeks comment about whether they need change and, if so, the form that change should take. General anti-avoidance rules 3.25 Most comment to date has been that the general anti-avoidance rules present a number of difficulties of interpretation for both taxpayers and Inland Revenue, particularly when taxpayers contend the arrangements in question have legitimate commercial purposes. Existing rules have been criticised as being unclear on complex arrangements. Also, they should be flexible enough to allow arrangements that are commercially desirable. 3.26 One alternative would be to replace the general rule with rules that target particular types of transactions (as is done with imputation selling transactions, referred to earlier). If we move in the direction of closer alignment between the Australian and New Zealand imputation provisions, another possibility would be to adopt some of the Australian provisions. 3.27 Australia has four basic anti-avoidance rules (see Appendix) and while one rule is similar to New Zealand’s current stapled stock provisions, referred to earlier, and another is purely of an administrative nature, the others attack arrangements that might otherwise be allowable in New Zealand under the current rules. Continuity rules 3.28 If there was no continuity test or it was set at a lower threshold than the present 66 percent, a credit that had been earned in the past could be transferred to a new owner (say, a taxable resident) who might be in a very different tax position from that of the original owner (say, a tax-exempt entity). The continuity test also helps prevent sales of companies with imputation credit balances to companies who can more benefit from them. 23 3.29 Generally, when a continuity breach is imminent, a company may take action to prevent the loss of the imputation credits to shareholders by paying a dividend (often by way of a bonus issue) to reduce the imputation credit account to zero. Therefore the continuity rule can fill a useful function in that it can prevent the build up of unusable credit balances. 3.30 Some companies, however, lose their imputation credit balances because of errors in calculating shareholding changes. Moreover, the rules sometimes require companies to pay dividends or bonus shares, which may be costly for those companies, when there are no policy concerns with the shareholding change. 3.31 For example, suppose a company that is 100 percent owned by a shareholder on capital account on the 33% tax rate earns $100 profit and pays $30 tax. Under our current continuity rules, if these profits and imputation credits are not distributed before a sale of more than 66 percent of the shares of the company, the credits are cancelled in full. However, assuming the purchaser is able to make use of the imputation credits, if there were no continuity rules the value of the credits would be factored into the sale price for the shares. If the purchaser is also on capital account and on a 33% tax rate the vendor would receive a $67 after-tax return. Although this is, on the face of it, inconsistent with the integration principle, it is of no practical effect as the aggregate tax liabilities are unchanged. 3.32 The share sale in these circumstances, therefore, does not appear to create concerns as the transfer of a credit is accompanied by an offsetting obligation to pay tax on the underlying income. On the other hand, Examples 2 and 3 in Chapter 2 show that the risks of removing the rule in its entirety could be significant, especially if at some point in the future imputation credits could be refunded to some non-taxpayers, such as charities, as discussed in Chapter 4. 3.33 In the light of these policy concerns, the government seeks comment on whether the continuity rules have practical compliance consequences or if they constrain commercial activity, and if so, how these problems can be addressed without opening up arbitrage opportunities. For example, if a continuity rule is retained, is the 66 percent continuity threshold still appropriate, or should the ratio go up or down? What are the costs and practical implications of complying with the current rules, including taking action such as making bonus issues before a major shareholding change occurs? Alternatively, are there better ways of targeting arrangements, such as those described in Examples 2 and 3 in Chapter 2? Exempting credit rule 3.34 Australia does not have quantitative tests for shareholding continuity. Instead it protects its source-basis taxation by an exempting credit rule that is designed to prevent the trading of imputation credits when foreign-owned companies or companies owned by tax-exempt entities are sold to residents. This rule is described in the Appendix. 24 3.35 A question for New Zealand is whether any such rules should be considered as a replacement for continuity provisions or in addition to continuity. If refunds are provided to charities and/or other non-taxpayers, transfers of imputation credits from non-resident shareholders to domestic taxpaying shareholders will not be the only issue of policy concern. Similar concerns would arise with transfers between domestic taxpayers on different rates. New Zealand may be subject to much greater pressures here than Australia would be because of the absence of a capital gains tax. 3.36 There is also an element of arbitrariness in the Australian rules. Should there, for example be a foreign/tax-exempt ownership threshold before the rules kick- in (in Australia it is 95 percent) and if so what is an appropriate ratio? Holding period rule 3.37 While some of the impact of the exempting credit rules can be avoided by a temporary transfer of shares, the Australian franking credit holding rule, which generally allows only shareholders to benefit from imputation credits if shares are held for a minimum period (45 days, as discussed in the Appendix) provide some barriers to such arrangements. Would a similar rule be sensible for New Zealand and, if so, is 45 days a reasonable period? If such a rule were introduced, how should we best assess when a substantial part of the risks of ownership of shares is subject to an arrangement to defeat their application. 3.38 Finally, would compliance costs be eased by repealing our continuity rule and adopting the Australian holding period rule, together with the exempting credit rule? Same credit ratios 3.39 The benchmark dividend rule is intended to ensure that imputation credits are evenly spread across all shareholders and not directed at those best able to use the credits. However, the current rule does not prevent the unequal distribution of imputation credits. This is because it looks only at actual distributions within the current year. Therefore it is possible to stream imputation credits by paying dividends only on one class of share, or using a special purpose vehicle with a different payout ratio to the head company or by paying dividends in alternate years. The question is whether, in practice, this causes major concerns. 3.40 The rules could be changed to measure imputation credit ratios across a two- year period and require them to be maintained. Moreover, to target transactions that consistently pay dividends only on certain classes of share or from special purpose vehicles, the benchmark rules could be extended to all shares from all entities within a group of companies. Would such a change have a substantial effect on compliance costs or hinder valid commercial transactions? 25 Trusts 3.41 The rule preventing streaming of credits to beneficiaries applies even if, for example, one beneficiary receives all dividend income and another receives non-dividend or capital payments only. This can lead to capital beneficiaries losing all of their allocation of imputation credits, as illustrated in Example 5. Example 5. How beneficiaries can lose imputation credits An estate has a number of beneficiaries. Beneficiary A has a lifetime interest in the income from half the original capital. The other half of the capital plus accrued income is to be paid to the deceased’s children (Beneficiaries B and C) when they turn 25. The income of the estate includes dividends that carry imputation credits. In a particular year, Beneficiary A is paid out her share of the estate’s income, being $4,000 of dividends. Beneficiary B turns 25 and is paid out her capital of $36,000. Therefore the total distribution is $40,000. $500 of imputation credits were attached to the dividend income distributed. Based on her share of total distributions, Beneficiary A is entitled to 10 percent of the $500 of imputation credits, being $50. The remaining imputation credits are forgone as Beneficiary B is not entitled to an allocation of imputation credits because she is a capital beneficiary only. 3.42 The current requirement to pro-rate the imputation credits in the circumstances described in Example 5 produces results that are not equitable to the beneficiaries when there is no avoidance concern. Therefore some have argued that the scope of the rule is too wide. 3.43 One option would be to remove the current rule and instead rely on the general anti-avoidance rule. Alternatively, a formulaic approach could be used, although in the past this has been rejected as unworkable and not sufficiently robust. 3.44 The government is not considering a change to the rule requiring pro rata allocation of imputation credits to partners in a partnership as it was decided during the review of partnership taxation that all tax attributes associated with partnership income must be allocated pro rata, in proportion to partnership income. This is to prevent partnerships from using special allocations as a way of streaming tax benefits to partners who can best use them. Imputation credit shopping 3.45 The imputation credit shopping rules preserve the integration principle, and the government would be reluctant to narrow it unless there was evidence of legitimate commercial transactions being prevented. If the continuity rule is relaxed, however, there may be a case for its extension to deal with situations involving change of ownership of group companies with credit balances to prevent inappropriate access to tax refunds by corporate purchasers. 26 Share lending 3.46 The specific anti-avoidance rule in the share lending provisions targets the streaming possibility outlined in Example 2, so the government would also be reluctant to change it without providing some clear substitute preventing temporary share transfers 27 CHAPTER 4 Rethinking the refund rules Matters for discussion The current imputation rules do not provide refunds for imputation credits that cannot be used. This chapter discusses the case for providing refunds for imputation credits in some cases – such as for tax-exempt organisations such as charities – and seeks comment on the following matters: • Does the absence of a rule allowing a refund for imputation credits affect the type of investments a tax-exempt organisation makes? • If rules were introduced to allow imputation credits to be refunded, it would be necessary to ensure they did not undermine the objectives of the imputation system. What checks and balances would a responsible refund mechanism have? • Do other options exist to deal with concerns identified in this chapter? 4.1 New Zealand company tax is paid on income earned by New Zealand companies. This company tax paid can then be attached in the form of imputation credits to dividends paid to shareholders, so that, effectively, the company tax is seen as a withholding tax for the shareholder. If shareholders are subject to New Zealand tax they will have tax to pay on the dividend they receive and can use the imputation credits to pay all or part of that tax. 4.2 If, however, the shareholder does not have to pay tax on the dividend – for example, if the shareholder is a tax-exempt charity – the imputation credits cannot be used and cannot be refunded. The benefit of the imputation credits is lost to the shareholder. Moreover, the dividend income earned by the tax- exempt shareholder has effectively been taxed at the company rate rather than at the shareholder’s effective rate of zero percent. 4.3 One of the effects of this treatment is that tax-exempt organisations may choose investments that pay them a before-tax return (referred to as non- imputed income, such as interest) over those New Zealand shares that provide an after-tax return, such as imputed dividends. 4.4 This outcome is a concern for shareholders in New Zealand companies when those shareholders have a specific exemption from New Zealand income tax and consequently are not subject to tax on the dividends they receive. Registered charities are one example of a group that currently has a specific income tax exemption. 28 4.5 Similar concerns arise for shareholders who have tax losses or who are on marginal tax rates that are lower than the company tax rate. In these cases, however, the imputation credits that are not needed to satisfy the current year’s tax obligation on the dividend can be carried forward by the shareholder and used to meet future tax obligations on other income. 4.6 This chapter covers the current policy reasons for not allowing the refunding of imputation credits. It then considers the case for refunding imputation credits to organisations that have specific exemption from New Zealand income tax – for example, registered charities – and taxpayers with losses or tax rates that are lower than the company tax rate. Current policy on refunding imputation credits 4.7 For reasons discussed in Chapter 2, New Zealand tax will continue to apply to foreign shareholders on the income they earn indirectly through their investments in New Zealand companies. This means that foreign shareholders should not receive refunds for imputation credits. Providing a refund to these shareholders would mean that any company tax paid in New Zealand would be effectively refunded. 4.8 In the case of New Zealand organisations that are not subject to tax on their income the issue is more complex, however. The concern is that these organisations are not able to benefit from the imputation system. This is contrary to one of the principles underpinning the imputation system, which is that shareholders should, as far as possible, be treated as if the income earned by the company were earned by them directly. 4.9 This concern with the current policy is frequently raised by the charitable sector as a reason for rethinking the rules that apply to refund of imputation credits. 5 The government is very aware of these concerns. In designing the imputation system, however, policy decisions were made that imputation credits should not be refunded, meaning that tax-exempt organisations and non-resident shareholders continued to be taxed at the company level on dividends received. Tax-exempt organisations are, in principle, no worse off under this decision than they were under the dividend system that applied till 1988. 4.10 The concern that has always existed when considering the case for refunding imputation credits is the pressure that could be placed on the company tax base by allowing refunds. Refunding tax credits could also create greater incentives for charities to be used in “tax planning” arrangements, contrary to policy. 4.11 Given the objective of taxing non-residents on the income they earn in New Zealand and that shareholders should, as far as possible, be treated as if the income earned by the company were earned by them directly, we now consider the case for refunding imputation credits. 5 As noted in the October 2006 discussion document Tax incentives for giving to charities and other non-profit organisations. 29 The case for refunding imputation credits to tax-exempt organisations 4.12 Tax-exempt organisations are concerned that they cannot use imputation credits. They are effectively subject to tax at the company rate, 30%, on the income that is taxed within any companies they invest in. Example 6 shows the after-tax return a tax-exempt organisation receives from an investment in New Zealand shares, compared to what it would get if the taxation of the company income reflected its tax-exempt status. 4.13 As a result of the effects illustrated in Example 6, tax-exempt organisations are likely to prefer investing in products such as loans, bank deposits or shares that do not pay imputed dividends. Investment in New Zealand company shares, on the other hand, offers an after-tax return in the form of imputed dividends. Example 7 illustrates this point. Example 6. How the imputation rules do not reflect tax-exempt status A tax-exempt charity invests in a company that earns $100 profit and pays $30 tax at the company level. The profit is distributed to the charity. If the imputation system recognised the charity’s tax- exempt status the after-tax return would be $100. Under the current imputation system, however, when the profit is distributed to the charity, there is an after-tax return of $70. The imputation credits of $30 are lost. Dividend$70 Imputation credits$30 Tax liability$0 Refunded credits($30) After-tax return$100 Dividend$70 Imputation credits$30 Tax liability$0 Imputation credits(30) Unused credits$30 After-tax return$70 If exempt status was reflected Current rules Company Income$100 Tax$30 Tax exempt charity Company Income$100 Tax$30 Tax exempt charity 30 Example 7. How the imputation rules can affect the after-tax return on investments The case for refunding imputation credits to taxpayers with lower marginal tax rates or those with losses 4.14 Taxpayers with marginal tax rates that are lower than the company rate or taxpayers with losses may also have an interest in receiving refunds of imputation credits. They are unable to receive the full benefit of the imputation credits attached to the dividends they receive unless they have enough other taxable income. Imputation credits that cannot be used must be carried forward against future taxable income. 4.15 One important distinction between this group of taxpayers and tax-exempt organisations is that taxpayers in loss or on lower marginal tax rates may benefit from using the imputation credits in future income years. 4.16 While there is a cost to this deferral, the tax benefit of the imputation credits is not lost and, for financial reporting purposes, the value of these credits may be recorded as a tax asset. Therefore the concern is a matter of timing because tax is collected on taxable income at an earlier point in time than it would be otherwise. 4.17 The fact that the benefit of the imputation credits is not lost raises questions about whether it is necessary to refund to this group of taxpayers any imputation credits that remain unused in a current tax year. The following illustration compares two investments that a tax-exempt organisation could make and the after-tax returns from both investments. Interest income$100 Tax liability$0 Tax paid$0 After-tax return$100 Dividend$70 Imputation credits$30 Tax liability$0 Imputation credits(30) Unused credits$30 After-tax return$70 Loan to New Zealand Company Shares in New Zealand Company New Zealand Company Income$100 Tax$30 Tax exempt charity New Zealand Company Income$100 Interest deduction $100 Tax exempt charity 31 Important considerations for refunding imputation credits Scope 4.18 Consideration could be given to allowing imputation credits to be refunded to some or all of the groups that have an interest in allowing imputation credits to be refundable – including registered charities, other entities with specific statutory tax exemptions, taxpayers whose marginal tax rates are lower than the company rate, and taxpayers in loss. 4.19 Australia, for example, has taken the approach of limiting access to refunds to certain groups, including individuals who are Australian residents, superannuation funds and certain tax-exempt organisations. 4.20 To qualify for a refund under the Australian rules, tax-exempt organisations must have a physical presence in Australia, incur expenditure in Australia, pursue their objectives principally in Australia during the income year in which the distribution is made. 4.21 The Australian refund rules are supported by a range of anti-avoidance rules designed to ensure that the franking credits (Australia’s equivalent to our imputation credits) are not streamed to those that can seek refunds of the credits. If New Zealand provided for refunds, consideration would need to be given to these sorts of rules. It is obviously necessary to balance the complexity of the rules against concerns about the potential for tax planning opportunities. The rules in this area are also relevant in the context of streaming generally, as discussed in Chapter 3. 4.22 In considering the scope of introducing a refund mechanism it is relevant to consider whether such a move could be viewed as discriminatory. In other words, would it be acceptable to discriminate against non-resident shareholders over resident shareholders and between domestic shareholders in different tax paying situations? “Tax planning” 4.23 Refunding imputation credits could lead to an increase in incentives for companies and shareholders to allocate imputation credits to shareholders that could access refunds. A concern with refunding imputation credits is that it would place additional pressure on the rules that ensure taxpaying shareholders in New Zealand companies continue to pay the correct amount tax on the income they earn in New Zealand. 4.24 For example, allowing imputation credits to be refunded to tax-exempt organisations could increase the incentive for certain taxpayers to temporarily transfer shares to tax-exempt organisations and then extract the refund, to the benefit of both parties – as illustrated in Example 8. If the type of arrangement described in the example resulted in less tax being paid by non-resident shareholders or higher marginal tax rate taxpayers (those that are required to pay tax at 33% or 39%), that would pose a risk to the tax base. The risk would apply equally to shareholders with losses. 32 4.25 The need for robust, potentially complex, rules to guard against tax planning opportunities must be balanced against the need to have legislation that is easy to understand and comply with. Example 8. Base maintenance problem with refunding imputation credits A company that is 100 percent owned by a non-resident shareholder earns $100 profit and pays $30 tax. If these profits are distributed to the non-resident shareholder, there will be an after-tax return to the shareholder of $70. However, if the shares were sold to a tax-exempt entity before distribution, in the absence of suitable anti-avoidance rules the tax-exempt entity would be entitled to a $30 refund of tax (assuming a refund is available for the imputation credits). This tax refund is likely to be shared between the vendor and purchaser through the sale price of the shares. If the shares were sold for $100, the vendor would receive a $100 after-tax return. This result is inconsistent with the objectives of the imputation system, and the $30 reduction in tax paid would also be a fiscal cost. Dividend$100 Tax liability$30 Tax paid$30 After-tax return$70 Tax collected$30 Dividend$70 Imputation credits$30 Payment for shares ($100) Tax liability$0 Imputation credits(30) Refunded credits$30 Tax collected$0 Current rules Possible tax planning arrangement Company Income$100 Tax$30 Non-resident shareholder Tax exempt entity Company Income$100 Non-resident shareholder $100 Fiscal cost 4.26 It is difficult to determine the fiscal cost of providing refunds to the various groups identified in this chapter. 4.27 Refunding imputation credits to tax-paying resident shareholders that cannot use the credits against a current year’s tax liability (for example, if the taxpayer is in a tax loss position or has insufficient current year’s taxable income to use the credit against) is estimated to have a fiscal cost of $400 million. This estimate is based on data available for the 2006 and 2007 income years. This fiscal cost is likely to make it difficult for the government to extend refundability to this group. It should be noted, however, that these taxpayers can use the imputation credits against future years income tax liabilities. 4.28 Information about the value of imputation credit balances held by tax-exempt organisations is limited because they are not required to file tax returns. Allowing refunds for imputation credits, though, is likely to come with significant cost to New Zealand, without taking into account any changes in investment behaviour that may result. 33 4.29 There is also the question of the value of existing imputation credit balances and whether refunds should be limited to imputation credits generated by companies after the introduction of any refunds. The cost of not doing so is expected to be prohibitively expensive. Fairness 4.30 If, because of concerns about tax planning or fiscal cost, decisions are made to exclude certain persons or organisations from any refund mechanism, that will add to the complexity of any rules and raise questions about discrimination. For example, refunds could be selectively made to organisations such as registered charities or charities that qualify for income tax exemptions. That, however, would discriminate against other tax-exempt taxpayers such as local authorities, qualifying friendly societies and amateur sports clubs. Discrimination and non-residents 4.31 Similarly, establishing the grounds for refunding imputation credits is also important if New Zealand continues to tax income earned in New Zealand by non-residents. For example, consideration needs to be given to whether or not the extension of refunds to some or all New Zealand residents could violate discrimination prohibitions, either in domestic law or in international agreements (such as double tax treaties). Matters for consultation 4.32 The question of refunding imputation credits to charities or other groups poses a number of complex questions and is not without its risks. Readers’ views about whether a refund mechanism for imputation credits would be suitable for New Zealand, in light of the issues outlined in this chapter, are welcome. 34 APPENDIX Australian anti-streaming rules Australia has four anti-streaming rules contained in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. The rules are: 1. A franking debit is generated if the exercise or non-exercise of a choice by a member (in broad terms, a shareholder) of one corporate entity results in a linked distribution being made by another corporate entity in substitution for a distribution by the first entity. 2. A franking debit is generated if the exercise or non-exercise of a choice by a member of the entity determines (to any extent) that the entity issues tax exempt bonus issues (as defined) to the member or another member in substitution for imputed dividends. 3. A rule that applies where a member who is better able to benefit from imputation credits receives one or more imputation benefits. An imputation benefit is: • an entitlement to a tax offset or, if the member is a corporate tax entity, a franking credit; • an amount that would be included in the member’s assessable income as a result of the distribution; or • an exemption from withholding tax (relevant if the member is a non- resident). The recipient must derive a greater benefit from imputation credits than another member who misses out on an imputation benefit. Relevant factors in determining whether the recipient derives a greater benefit from imputation credits than another member includes, amongst a number of factors, the residency of the members. A difference in shareholders’ marginal tax rates does not, by itself, indicate that some members derive a greater benefit from imputation credits than others. If the elements of this streaming rule are present, the Commissioner may make a determination that: • the streaming entity will incur an additional franking debit in respect of each distribution made or other benefit received by a member; and/or • no imputation benefit is to arise in respect of any streamed distributions paid to a member. The following examples are adapted from the explanatory memorandum that accompanied the legislation in order to illustrate the type of arrangements that this rule intends to target: 35 Single distribution streaming by a non-resident controlled company A non-resident controlled company with resident minority shareholders adopts a strategy of distributing all its franking credits to the minority shareholders while retaining the share of profits belonging to the controlling shareholder in the company. It does this with a view to ultimately paying an unfranked dividend, or paying some other benefit to the majority shareholder, or someone else, in lieu of a dividend (which would include realising accumulated profits as a capital amount on the sale of shares). Share buy-back – limited imputation credit surplus A company has members with differing abilities to benefit from franking credits and a limited supply of credits. It makes a fully franked distribution by buying back off-market the shares owned by taxable residents to stream the limited credits available to those who can most benefit from them. Share buy-back – excess credits A company has more franking credits than it is reasonably likely to use to frank its ordinary distributions. It buys back shares off-market predominantly from members most able to benefit from franking credits because the terms of the buy-back are not attractive to the other members. As a result of the buy-back it uses profits it would not normally distribute, thereby directing a large franked distribution predominantly to those who benefit most from franking credits. Dividend access share A company group contains an operating subsidiary which is owned by a company that has tax losses. The members of the loss company can, because they are not in tax loss, derive a greater benefit from franking credits than the loss company. The members are issued with a dividend access share to stream dividends directly to them. (Broadly speaking, a dividend access share is one that confers no rights and is issued only to enable a shareholder to get a distribution from the company.) 4. A rule requiring disclosure to the Commissioner where an entity's benchmark ratio varies significantly between imputation periods. Exempting credit rules The exempting credit rules are designed to prevent imputation streaming by companies that are effectively owned (up to 95%) by non-residents or tax-exempt entities. Franking credits held by companies subject to these rules can only be used to relieve dividend payments to non-residents from NRWT. These rules apply to an Australian resident company (the exempting entity) that is effectively owned (directly or indirectly) by a tax exempt or non-resident shareholder (though there is an exception to the rules where the company has New Zealand owners). The exempting entity would be subject to the ordinary imputation rules except that franking credits attached to dividends paid by it would be restricted solely to providing an exemption for NRWT on dividends to non-resident members. None of the franking credits would be attached to dividends paid to resident shareholders, with the credits being cancelled. If all the shares in the exempting entity were sold to Australian residents, its franking credit account would be converted to an “exempting account”. The exempting credits attached to these dividends would continue only to be eligible to reduce non-resident withholding tax where relevant. They otherwise would have no value. 36 Holding period rule This rule requires resident taxpayers to hold shares for a minimum period of at least 45 days to be eligible to use franking credits from dividends paid on those shares as a credit against their tax liability. There are several exceptions to the rule, including an exemption threshold for certain small shareholders. Furthermore, even if the shares are held for the minimum period, the franking credit is denied if the resident taxpayer has eliminated a substantial part of the risks of their ownership in the shares by other financial transactions during that period. Hence the rule also specifies a 30 percent minimum level of ownership risk. 37 GLOSSARY Active income. Income of a controlled foreign company which is not passive income. It could include, for example, income from the sale of goods manufactured or purchased by the company. Benchmark dividend. The first dividend paid by a company required to maintain an imputation credit account the imputation year (defined below). All subsequent dividends paid during the imputation year must carry imputation credits at the same ratio (unless the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is furnished with a ratio change declaration). Classical system. The classical tax system levies income tax on company profits as they are earned and on dividends distributed to shareholders from those profits without providing any relief for what is essentially double taxation. This is the system that existed in New Zealand immediately prior to the introduction of imputation in 1988. Controlled foreign company (CFC). A foreign company controlled by a small number of resident shareholders. Double tax agreement. A bilateral treaty between countries designed to avoid, or provide relief from, double taxation and to prevent fiscal evasion. Exempting credit rules. Australian anti- avoidance measures designed to prevent imputation “streaming” by targeting companies that are effectively owned by non-residents or exempt entities. Discussed in the Appendix. Fair dividend rate. The method of calculating income from international share investments applying from 1 April 2007. Foreign investor tax credit. The foreign investor tax credit rules reduce the combined income tax and non-resident withholding tax imposed on foreign investors with interests in a New Zealand company to 30%. A company is entitled to a foreign investor tax credit when it pays a supplementary dividend (also defined) of the same amount to its non-resident shareholders. The foreign investor tax credit can then be offset against the company's income tax liability. Franking. The Australian equivalent of New Zealand’s imputation system. The terms “franking” and “imputation” are often used interchangeably. Holding period rules. Australian anti- avoidance rules to prevent the short-term transfer of shares over dividend payment dates. Discussed in the Appendix. Hybrid instrument. Securities that combine elements of both equity and debt. Imputation. A tax system whereby credit for all or part of the income tax paid at the company level is passed through to shareholders when dividends are paid. Imputation year. The period 1 April to 31 March, irrespective of the company’s balance date. Imputation credit shopping. Describes an arrangement in which imputation credits earned by one group of companies are sold to the shareholders of a different group of companies. Imputation streaming. When companies direct imputation credits to shareholders who can use them, while providing some other benefit to shareholders, such as non-residents, exempt or tax loss shareholders, who cannot fully use the credits. Integration principle. The principle that income earned at the company level is attributed to the shareholder and taxed at the shareholder’s personal tax rate. Mutual recognition. A system under which Australia and New Zealand each provide tax credits to their resident individuals who receive company distributions from across the Tasman, to compensate for tax paid in the other country. Non-resident withholding tax (NRWT). An amount withheld by the party making payment to a non-resident (payee) of non-resident withholding income and paid to Inland Revenue. Non-resident withholding income comprises income derived from New Zealand consisting of dividends (other than investment society dividends and, from 1 October 2007, dividends from portfolio listed companies), royalties derived by a non-resident, or interest and investment society dividends derived by a non-resident (except those carrying on business through a fixed establishment). The NRWT rate for dividends is ordinarily 30% of the non- imputed amount, though this can be reduced to 15 percent under an applicable double tax agreement. 38 Passive income. Income of a controlled foreign company that, in general, is very mobile and may easily be shifted between jurisdictions. Redeemable preference shares. Shares which, on a stated date, the issuing company will buy back for face value plus dividend. Being preference shares, they rank ahead of ordinary shares, but behind debentures, in any claim on the assets of the company. They usually also give their holder priority in relation to the payment of dividends and often carry the right to a fixed dividend each year. Finally, they may be non-voting, or may only have the right to vote if the payment of their preference dividend is in arrears or in relation to certain key issues which may affect the preference shares. Share lending. An agreement under which securities are lent in consideration for the return of equivalent securities at a later date (plus payment of a fee). New rules were enacted to ensure that imputation credits remain with the economic owner of the shares were enacted in 2006. Source-basis taxation. The principle that all income which originates in a country is subject to tax in that country, whether the person or entity to which the income accrues is resident or non-resident. Special purpose vehicle. A body corporate (usually a limited company or, sometimes, a limited partnership) created to fulfil narrow, specific or temporary objectives, primarily to isolate financial risk. Stapled stock. A security which is comprised of two parts that cannot be separated from one another – for example, a unit of a unit trust and a share of a company. The resulting security is influenced by both parts and must be treated as one unit at all times for tax purposes. Supplementary dividend. A dividend paid to non-resident portfolio investors during the year which is in addition to another dividend paid in the same income year. The amount of the supplementary dividend is calculated on the basis of the imputation credits (net of the non- resident portfolio investor tax credit) allocated to the first dividend.

Income splitting, in its simplest form, would treat the family rather than the individual as the taxable unit. Family income would be split equally between parents for tax purposes, which would mitigate the effect of progressive tax rates – resulting in tax savings for many families. 1.3 The discussion document invites readers’ views on whether introducing income splitting of the kind discussed here would be the best way to provide additional government support for families with children, provided they think additional support is needed. And if income splitting is not the answer, what other options should be considered? 1.4 The discussion document limits its consideration of income splitting to families with children, even though several countries allow income splitting for all couples. There are two reasons for that limitation: first, supporting families with children is one of the main priorities for this government, and, second, the fiscal cost of allowing income splitting for all couples would be very high. Working for Families tax credits 1.5 Working for Families tax credits are the most notable way in which the government provides support for families with children. These tax credits help families by targeting support on the basis of family income. The level of support provided depends on the number and age of children in the family and whether the family is in work. As a result, Working for Families provides equal support to families that have the same family income, work status and number and age of children. 1.6 By the end of last year about 360,000 families were receiving assistance through Working for Families. On average, each family received $5,600 in assistance. 2 Choices for families 1.7 The government is also committed to providing real choices to parents and carers in combining their work with their caring roles. Its “Choices for Living, Caring and Working” ten-year action plan, developed in 2006, involves initiatives in a number of areas that meet the needs of families as they move through their lives. These include parental leave, early childhood education, out-of-school services, the development of a carers’ strategy, and encouraging flexible work practices. 1.8 By helping single-earner families, income splitting may enhance the choices available to parents by helping to ensure that it is a viable option for one parent to stay at home, or work part-time, to care for their dependent children. How income splitting would work 1.9 There are two broad ways to achieve income splitting for tax purposes. The first is to aggregate family income and (as the name suggests) split it evenly between the two partners. Total tax liability would then be determined by applying the tax rate schedule to the split level of income. 1.10 That would mean, for example, that a family with one partner earning $80,000 a year and the other partner earning $20,000 a year would be taxed as if both partners earned $50,000 a year. Thus the highest tax rate applying to their joint income would be 33%, rather than the top rate of 39% that the high earning partner would attract under individual taxation. That would mean a tax saving of $3,360 a year for the family. 1.11 The second way of achieving income splitting, and with the same effect, would be to provide a separate tax rate schedule for families, one where the tax-rate thresholds were twice as high as the thresholds that apply for an individual. 1.12 Whichever method was used, allowing income to be split on a 50/50 basis would change the taxable unit from the individual to the couple or family. 1.13 Possible variations of income splitting might include income splitting by more than two family members – for example, by including dependent children, elderly and disabled family members. There might also be a case for allowing only a 70/30 or 60/40 split rather than a 50/50 split. 1.14 Other important questions are how “family” should be defined for purposes of income splitting; what age restriction should be placed on children in the family for it to qualify for income splitting; and whether income splitting should be optional or compulsory. 3 1.15 These considerations are discussed in chapter 3, which outlines a possible approach to income splitting for New Zealand. 1.16 Chapter 4 looks at the impact of income splitting on families in terms of who would benefit financially and how effective marginal tax rates would change as a result of income splitting. Criteria for assessing income splitting 1.17 Chapter 5 discusses the merits of income splitting against a set of criteria, including whether it would be complementary to the government’s “Choices for Living, Caring and Working” action plan. 1.18 The main criterion, however, is fairness: would the introduction of income splitting for families with children lead, at a reasonable fiscal cost, to a fairer outcome for families than is currently the case? 1.19 It is debateable whether the introduction of income splitting would be fairer on families with children. That is highlighted in the example of two families with one child of the same age. Both families earn $100,000 in total, but in Family 1 each partner earns $50,000, while in Family 2 one partner earns $100,000 and the other is not in paid employment. These families will receive the same level of support through Working for Families, but Family 2 will face a higher tax burden under the present system because some of its income is taxed at a higher rate than Family 1’s income. If income splitting were to be adopted, Family 2 would pay less tax than it does now. 1.20 On the other hand, perhaps Family 2 is better able to pay more tax than Family 1 and so should face a higher tax burden. It may be that the partner in Family 2 who is not in paid employment is able to engage in valuable activities at home, such as full-time childcare, which neither partner in Family 1 can do. 1.21 Other important criteria are: • Efficiency – would income splitting bias people’s decisions to produce, consume, work, save and invest? • Simplicity – would income splitting be easy to understand and comply with, or would it create significant additional compliance costs for people? • Administrative costs – would income splitting be compatible with the current tax system, and would it be costly to implement and administer? 4 Timing of any possible changes 1.22 If submissions show strong support for allowing income splitting for families with children, the government will look at developing detailed proposals for further consideration, although that would not occur until early in 2009. How to make a submission 1.23 The government invites submissions on the questions posed in this discussion document, as well as those on any other measures that could support families with children. Special points for submissions The government invites readers’ views on the following matters: • Is income splitting the best way to provide additional support for families with children? • If not, what other options could be considered to provide additional support for families with children? If income splitting is favoured: • Should the split be on a 50/50 basis, a 70/30 basis or in some other way? • How should a “family” be defined? • What restrictions should be placed on the children’s ages for a family to be eligible? • Should it be optional or compulsory? 1.24 Submissions should be made by 30 June 2008 and can be addressed to: Income splitting C/- Deputy Commissioner Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington Or email: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Income splitting” in the subject line. 5 1.25 Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for officials from Inland Revenue and the Treasury to contact those making submissions to discuss their submission, if required. 1.26 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their publication. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. Accordingly, those making a submission who think that any part of it should be properly withheld under the Act should indicate this clearly. 6 CHAPTER 2 Some useful information 2.1 This chapter provides background information relevant to the discussion in chapter 3 of a possible approach to the use of income splitting in New Zealand. Current support for families with children in New Zealand 2.2 The government is committed to supporting families with children and, as such, provides a number of measures to assist them. 2.3 The Working for Families package, introduced in 2005 and extended in 2007, provides significant financial support to families with children. The package consists of four tax credits – the family tax credit, in-work tax credit, parental tax credit and minimum family tax credit; the childcare and Out of School Care and Recreation (OSCAR) subsidies; and the accommodation supplement. The accommodation supplement assists low-income and middle-income families with housing costs irrespective of whether they have children. The other measures are all targeted at families with children. 2.4 The main goals of Working for Families are to ensure income adequacy, to make work pay, and to support people into work. The measures are targeted at low-income and middle-income families: the minimum family tax credit ensures working families have a specified minimum level of income, while the other three tax credits abate as family income increases. 2.5 The family tax credit and the in-work tax credit are paid for families that have children under 18 years of age if the children are financially dependent on the principal caregiver. The amounts of the credits depend on family income and, for the family tax credit, the age of the children. To receive the in-work credit, parents must work a combined total of 30 hours or more per week. The parental tax credit is paid on the birth of a child for the first eight weeks of the child’s life. It also depends on family income. However, it can be received only if the primary caregiver is not receiving paid parental leave. 2.6 The childcare subsidy is paid per hour per child under five 1 directly to the childcare provider at varying rates (depending on family income) and for up to 50 hours a week. It is abated by family income. If the child’s primary caregiver is not in work or is studying (on an approved course) he or she will be eligible for up to nine hours of subsidised childcare. 1 Technically, the childcare subsidy is payable until a child enters school, which can be at any time between age five and six. 7 2.7 The OSCAR subsidy is for children from five to 13 years of age, and is provided at the same rate and with the same abatement as the childcare subsidy. It is available for up to 20 hours a week in term-time, and 50 hours a week during school holidays. 2.8 Outside the Working for Families package, free early childhood education (ECE) is provided to three and four-year-olds for up to six hours a day, and a maximum of 20 hours a week. Families can choose between receiving free ECE, the childcare subsidy or a combination of both, but they cannot receive both for the same hours. Targeted assistance is provided to single parent families through the Domestic Purposes Benefit. 2.9 Paid parental leave is available for 14 weeks to eligible employees and self- employed parents, on the birth or adoption of a child. To be eligible, the parent must have worked for the same employer or have been self-employed for six or 12 months immediately before the expected date of birth or adoption, and have worked an average of at least 10 hours a week. Parents receiving paid parental leave receive their gross weekly rate of pay or the maximum rate of payment (currently $391.28), whichever is lower. Employees who meet the 12-month criteria are also entitled to 38 weeks extended unpaid leave, which can be shared between eligible parents. 2.10 These, then, are the main forms of government support for families with children. The main question posed in this discussion document is whether income splitting would be the best way to provide additional support, provided readers think that additional support is needed. 2.11 Before looking at the specifics, however, it is useful to see how income splitting works elsewhere. Income splitting in other OECD countries 2.12 Whether to allow income splitting is essentially a question regarding the appropriate unit of taxation – the family or the individual. New Zealand is not alone in taxing on an individual basis, and the international trend over the last 30 years has been away from family-based or “joint” taxation towards individual-based taxation. 2.13 At present, 17 OECD countries (including Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom) use pure individual taxation. Only four OECD countries (France, Luxembourg, Portugal and Switzerland) use pure joint taxation of earnings. In the Czech Republic, Iceland, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Spain, the individual is used as the tax unit but joint taxation is also possible (only capital income of married couples is taxed jointly in Iceland, while in the Netherlands certain parts of income, such as from owner-occupied housing and from savings, can be taxed jointly). In Germany and Ireland, spouses are normally assessed jointly but they have the option of being separately assessed. In the United States, married couples can file their earnings either separately or jointly 8 2.14 In every country where joint taxation is allowed, income can be split between partners 2 who do not have children. This is because the general rationale for taxing on a family basis is one of increasing fairness in the taxation of households with different compositions of income. 3 In other words, why should two different couples with the same aggregate income pay different amounts of tax? With the partial exception of France, the support of children is not the rationale for income splitting, and consequently most countries also provide some form of additional assistance to families with children in the form of tax credits or targeted cash transfers. 2.15 Germany and the United States provide good examples of the alternative methods of achieving standard 50/50 income splitting, while France, Belgium and Denmark illustrate what variations from the standard model are possible. 2.16 In Germany, married partners are generally assessed jointly, but can elect to be separately assessed. The tax liability of jointly assessed married couples is determined by aggregating the total income of each partner and dividing by two. The progressive tax schedule is then applied to this figure, the result of which is multiplied by two to determine the family’s total tax liability. 2.17 The United States also allows married partners to be assessed jointly or separately, by having a separate tax rate schedule for joint filers. Tax thresholds for joint filers are double those which apply to individuals for joint income up to $63,700 (as of 2007), providing full 50/50 income splitting. Beyond this point the joint filing thresholds are less than double those for individuals. Consequently, it will be better for some couples that both earn significant incomes to file separately. The top tax rate (35%) applies from exactly the same income level ($349,700) whether taxpayers file individually or jointly. 2.18 France provides an example of an extreme version of joint taxation, whereby taxpayers can split their income not just with their partner, but also with their children and any dependent adults in the family. The system was instituted just after World War II, the intent being to take into account the consumption capacity of each member of the family and to tax it accordingly. 4 The tax unit is the “fiscal household” (foyer fiscal). This means the total family, including children if they are claimed as dependents. Since 2004, a family includes a French civil union (pacte civil de solidarité). Unmarried couples always constitute two separate fiscal households, while married persons can, in exceptional circumstances, file separately provided that they live apart. 2 In some countries income splitting is restricted to married partners, while in other countries it is allowed for de facto partners and same-sex partners. 3 OECD, (2006) “Fundamental Reform of Personal Income Tax”, OECD Publishing, Paris, at p55. 4 Ault, H., (1997) “Comparative Income Taxation: A Structural Analysis”, Kluwer Law International, Amsterdam, at p273. 9 2.19 Income splitting occurs according to the quotient familial or “family share” system. A family is attributed a total number of family shares as follows: two shares are attributed to a married couple (or pacte civil de solidarité), one share for a single person, half a share for the first two dependents, and one share for each additional dependent (or for each dependent of a single parent). Total family income is then divided by total family shares. Tax liability is calculated according to the progressive tax rate schedule for one share and then multiplied by the total number of family shares to determine the family’s total tax liability. 2.20 The tax benefit available for half shares beyond the first two full shares (or one full share for an individual) is limited to €2,159 per half share. The tax benefit from the share attributable to the first dependent of a single parent is limited to €7,472. The benefit from additional dependents is limited to €4,318 (2 x €2,159). These limits have been set on equity grounds, in recognition that the tax benefit of income splitting is greater for households with higher incomes. 2.21 Belgium allows partial income splitting similar to that proposed for New Zealand in the 1982 McCaw Report (discussed in more detail in chapter 3). Spouses are generally taxed separately, but under the marital quotient system (quotient conjugal), a notional amount of income can be transferred between spouses if one earns no more than 30 percent of the couple’s combined income. In this case the amount transferred is limited to 30 percent of total family income less the secondary earner’s actual income. This effectively provides 70/30 income splitting. The amount transferred is limited to a maximum of €8,570 (in 2006). 2.22 Another alternative is employed in Denmark, where family members are taxed separately, but some unutilised “personal allowances” can be transferred between spouses. The low tax bracket (at central government level) taxes aggregate personal and net positive capital income under 265,500 Kroner at 5.48%. If a married individual cannot use all of his or her 265,500 Kroner “personal allowance”, the remainder can be transferred to the spouse. This cannot be done for personal allowances at higher marginal rates. 2.23 The next chapter looks at the possibility of a different form of income splitting for New Zealand, one aimed at providing support for families with children. 10 CHAPTER 3 How income splitting could work 3.1 This chapter outlines a possible approach to the use of income splitting in New Zealand and poses a number of questions in relation to its possible introduction. 3.2 Income splitting for tax purposes is allowed in a number of countries and takes a variety of forms, as discussed in chapter 2. In most countries, income splitting is a matter of allowing couples to lower their total tax liability by allocating some of the higher earning partner’s income to the lower earning partner, thus mitigating the effects of the progressive nature of tax rates. 3.3 There are two broad ways to achieve income splitting. The first is to aggregate family income and (as the name suggests) split it evenly between the two partners. Total tax liability is then determined by applying the tax rate schedule to the split level of income, and multiplying the result by two. The second achieves the same effect by providing a separate tax rate schedule for families, one in which the tax rate thresholds are twice as high as the thresholds that apply to individuals. Effectively, allowing income to be split 50/50 would change the taxable unit from the individual to the couple or family. New Zealand’s past experience with income splitting 3.4 New Zealand currently taxes on an individual basis. Family-based taxation is not, however, an entirely new concept to New Zealand. Between 1939 and 1962 New Zealand required the aggregation of a married couple’s incomes if it exceeded a moderately high level in aggregate. However, this measure was not targeted at families with children. In fact, because tax rate thresholds were not raised when aggregation was required, it acted to increase wealthier families’ tax burdens rather than decrease them. 3.5 In contrast, the 1982 Report of the Task Force on Tax Reform (the McCaw Report) strongly recommended income splitting be allowed in New Zealand as a means of reducing the tax liability of many families. The recommendation did not require a family to have children to be able to split income. The rationale behind the recommendation was the concern about a lack of recognition of the costs associated with the family unit in the tax system at the time. Essentially, the differences in tax liability between one- income and two-income families with similar abilities to pay tax were seen as unfair. 3.6 Although the McCaw Report recommended a specific, limited form of income splitting, it can be designed in a number of ways. The remainder of this chapter looks at the main considerations in adopting income splitting for families with children. 11 Who would be able to split income? 3.7 A “family” could be defined as including married, civil union and de facto partners, a definition that would be consistent with eligibility for the Working for Families tax credits. 3.8 One of the first questions to be considered is what age restrictions there should be for the children of the families involved. Should it apply to families with children up to the age of 18? That is the age for which the Working for Families tax credits are available, and it is also the age at which parents are no longer responsible as guardians for the day-to-day care of their children. 3.9 The child would also need to be dependent on the principal caregiver. For purposes of Working for Families tax credits, a dependent child is defined as a child 18 years and under that is financially dependent on the principal caregiver. To be considered financially dependent, the child must be financially supported by the principal caregiver and not work more than 30 hours a week or receive a student allowance, benefit or other government assistance. For simplicity and consistency across government policy, it would be desirable to use the same test if an 18-year age limit were to be adopted. 3.10 An alternative is to limit income splitting to families with a younger child – say, one who has not yet started school. 3.11 The question of restrictions on the ages of the children concerned in families that split their income is a fundamental one, and the government is particularly interested in readers’ views on this matter. In what way would income be split? 3.12 The standard model of income splitting would be to allow a straight 50/50 income split. However, a number of variations are possible. These include allowing income to be split amongst children as well as parents (as in France) or allowing a restricted form of income splitting such as a 70/30 split (as in Belgium). A further restricted option would be to adopt the transferable personal allowance approach taken in Denmark. 3.13 The McCaw Report favoured a limited form of income splitting similar to the Belgian 70/30 approach. The report recommended (with one member of the Task Force dissenting) that the government introduce: “a voluntary scheme of ‘partial income splitting’ for married couples, whereby couples would have the option of notionally dividing their aggregate income by some divisor of between 1.3 and 1.8, with their total income being taxed at the average rate applicable to a single individual whose income equals that quotient.” (p101) 12 3.14 Dividing by two would provide full 50/50 income splitting, so in effect the Task Force’s recommendation would allow only the majority of income to be split between partners, but would still provide a significant tax advantage to most couples with differing incomes. The Task Force favoured this restricted approach over a 50/50 split, to ensure that couples were not overly advantaged relative to individuals. 3.15 The Task Force considered that, in principle, income splitting should be allowed amongst children of the family as well, but for administrative ease, it recommended increased family benefit support instead. Similar administrative difficulties are likely to preclude a broader approach here also. 3.16 While not ruling out variations such as these, this discussion document concentrates on the standard 50/50 version, to illustrate the questions that would arise if income splitting were to be introduced in New Zealand. Should income splitting be compulsory? 3.17 While no one would be financially worse off through 50/50 income splitting, the government’s view is that, if adopted, income splitting should be voluntary. Partners who currently have very similar incomes may gain very little from income splitting, and they should have the choice not to participate if they think the compliance costs involved outweigh any benefit they would receive. 3.18 If a 70/30 split were to be adopted, it would result in families that are already closer to a 50/50 split being made worse off. In this case, there is even stronger justification for income splitting to be voluntary. Fiscal cost of income splitting for families with children 3.19 The fiscal cost of allowing standard 50/50 income splitting for families with children who are under five years of age would be around $160 million a year. Extending it to families with children who are 18 years and under would increase the cost to around $370 million. Administrative considerations 3.20 Two important issues to be considered in relation to the possible introduction of income splitting are determining how it should be administered and how the tax benefit would be paid out. 3.21 Because income splitting would be tied to the presence of children, the most administratively manageable, and compliance cost minimising, approach is likely to be for Inland Revenue to administer income splitting through the Working for Families tax credit system. This way Inland Revenue could adapt the current Working for Families tax credit system that is already in place, rather than develop entirely new systems and procedures. 13 3.22 It may be possible for Inland Revenue to pay the tax benefit out during the year through the PAYE system by use of a special tax code. Further work would be necessary to determine if that were feasible. It would place some additional compliance costs on taxpayers by requiring them to estimate their correct tax rate having regard for the impact of their partner’s income. 3.23 The alternative would be for the tax benefit to be paid at the end of the year as an “income splitting tax credit” through the standard tax assessment process. Most people who receive the Working for Families tax credits are already required to have an end of year tax assessment, so income splitting would not impose additional compliance costs on the vast majority of them. The tax credit could be paid to either partner, or split and paid to both. 3.24 Further administrative questions that would need to be considered in more detail if income splitting were to be implemented include how Inland Revenue would deal with couples who file tax returns (especially provisional taxpayers), with relationship changes, and with Working for Families and other payments such as child support, student loans and certain rebates that are currently linked to individual earnings. The implications of shared care of a child would also need further consideration, particularly for determining when a family is considered to have a child, and therefore is able to split its income. 14 CHAPTER 4 The impact of income splitting on families 4.1 This chapter looks at the implications of income splitting in terms of who would benefit financially, and how effective marginal tax rates would change. It assumes 50/50 income splitting. 4.2 Figure 1 shows the reduction in tax paid (the “tax benefit”) for different combinations of primary and secondary earner incomes. For any level of primary earner income, the tax benefit from income splitting increases as the secondary earner’s income falls, with the maximum tax benefit going to couples in which the secondary earner is not earning any income. 4.3 Figure 1 shows that, for every level of secondary earner income, the tax benefit increases as the primary earner’s income increases. It reaches its maximum when the primary earner earns $120,000. Beyond this level the couple gains no additional benefit as all additional income will be taxed at the top marginal tax rate. 4.4 When both partners earn the same amount of income, or if the secondary earner earns $60,000 or more, there is no tax benefit from income splitting. In neither case can the partners move some income from a higher marginal tax rate to a lower one. Notably, families with a secondary earner who receives up to around $30,000 can still gain a significant tax benefit from income splitting. 4.5 Figure 1 is reproduced in table form in the Annex (Table A). This shows the exact dollar tax benefit going to each primary/secondary earner combination. The exact benefit is dependant on statutory tax rates and would alter if tax rates were to change. However, the same pattern would result, with the tax benefit increasing as primary income increases, and as secondary income decreases.

The distribution is reproduced in Table B in the annex and is based on Inland Revenue sample data. 4.7 As illustrated in Figure 1, the greatest tax benefit from income splitting would go to a couple where the primary earner earns $120,000 or more and the secondary earner receives no income. Figure 2 shows that, because there are relatively few couples in this position, only a relatively small amount of the total tax benefit from income splitting goes to these couples. 4.8 The largest aggregate tax benefit would go to families in which one partner earns around $60,000 to $80,000 and the other earns less than $20,000. 4.9 Families in which a secondary earner receives up to around $30,000 would still receive a significant amount of the aggregate tax benefit from income splitting. 4.10 Figure 2 is reproduced in table form in the Annex (Table C). This shows the exact aggregate tax benefit going to each primary/secondary earner combination. Again, the exact benefit is dependant on statutory tax rates, but also on any changes to the income distribution.

(As used in this discussion document, the term “effective marginal tax rate” means the proportion of an extra dollar of income that is lost as a result of taxation, benefit abatements and other income-related obligations such as ACC levies and child support payments.) 4.12 Table 1 shows the percentage point changes in primary earners’ EMTRs for different combinations of primary and secondary income. Table 2 shows the effect on secondary earners’ EMTRs. 4.13 Table 1 shows that primary earner EMTRs will decrease for a large number of combinations of primary and secondary income. For couples in which the primary earner has income between around $40,000 and $70,000 and the secondary earner earns less than $30,000 there tends to be a significant fall in the primary earner’s EMTR. The largest drop is 18 percentage points for couples in which the primary earner earns around $60,000 to $70,000 and the secondary earner receives around $10,000 or less. 4.14 Table 2 shows that secondary earner EMTRs would increase for a large number of combinations of primary and secondary income. When the primary earner has income of $80,000 or more, EMTRs would increase substantially for all secondary earners with less than $60,000 of income. The largest increase would be 24 percentage points when the primary earner earns around $120,000 or more, and the secondary earner receives less than $9,500.

Five percent would face an increase of 18 percentage points, while one percent would face a 24 percentage point increase. 4.17 The average percentage point decrease in EMTRs for primary earners is 4.56, while the average increase in secondary earner EMTRs is 4.28 percentage points. 18 T ABLE 3: N UMBER OF TAXPAYERS FACING PERCENTAGE POINT CHANGES IN EMTRS Primary earners Secondary earners change Number percentage change number percentage 0 236,250 56% 0221,900 52% -6 70,525 17% 6129,850 31% -12 101,150 24% 1248,300 11% -18 16,625 4% 1821,875 5% 242,625 1% 19 CHAPTER 5 Assessing income splitting against the criteria 5.1 This chapter assesses the idea of income splitting against the criteria outlined in chapter 1. Fairness 5.2 The decision to tax on a family basis by allowing income splitting may increase perceived fairness in some areas at the expense of others. Whether taxing on a family basis is a good thing depends on the relative weightings given to different goals. 5.3 With individual taxation, as at present, a one-earner family will pay more tax than a two-earner family when the two have the same total family income. In fact, whenever one partner contributes more to total family income than the other, the tax system will impose at least as high and generally a greater burden than if they both contributed the same incomes. This may be seen as unfair, particularly when considered in light of the Working for Families package. 5.4 Working for Families uses the family, rather than the individual, as its basis for determining the appropriate level of assistance for families. As such, it provides equal support to families in similar circumstances that have the same total family income (and the same number, and age, of children). However, while those families are treated equally for Working for Families purposes, some will still end up worse off than others because of the individual basis of the tax system. Allowing income splitting for families would ensure that such families are treated consistently. 5.5 Furthermore, limiting income splitting to families with children would also ensure that a couple with a child would pay less tax than a couple without a child when both had the same aggregate income. 5.6 It is also arguable that income splitting recognises the contribution of stay-at- home parents, when the current individual system of taxation does not. 5.7 On the other hand, it is arguable that family income does not always accurately capture a family’s ability to pay tax, and so is not the fairest means of determining tax liability. This is because family income does not take account of the hours worked by family members. While it may be considered unfair for different couples working full-time with the same aggregate income to face different tax burdens, if one partner in a family is not in paid employment he or she will have additional time available for valuable activities at home, such as childcare. 20 5.8 Compare the following two families: Family 1 has both partners working full-time for 40 hours a week, earning $50,000 each. Family 2 has one partner working full-time for 40 hours a week and earning $100,000, with the other partner not in paid employment. Family income is the same, so income splitting would allow these two families to pay the same amount of tax. But do these families have similar abilities to pay tax? If both families have young children needing to be cared for, Family 1 may need to employ childcare as both parents work full-time, whereas Family 2 may not need to do so. Individual taxation places a higher burden on the single-income family and so it may possibly be argued to be fairer in this situation. 5.9 It may also be perceived as unfair that the benefit from income splitting increases as primary income increases, providing more benefit to families with higher incomes. Providing choice to families 5.10 The government is also committed to providing real choices to parents and carers in combining their work with their caring roles through the government’s “Choices for Living, Caring and Working” ten-year action plan. 5.11 Parents raising children often face the choice between both parents working (and employing childcare), or one parent staying at home or working part- time to care for a dependent child or children. 5.12 In some cases, both parents in a two-parent family may wish to work but may be deterred by the cost of childcare, as may a sole parent who wishes to work. The government has acknowledged this concern, and the childcare and Out of School Care and Recreation (OSCAR) subsidies, along with the recently introduced free Early Childhood Education programme, are ways of alleviating this concern. 5.13 In other cases, one parent may wish to stay at home and care for dependent children but may not see this as a viable option because of financial considerations. At present, there are no government measures specifically designed to make staying at home or working part-time a more viable option in this situation, although Working for Families does implicitly aid this goal by providing financial support to families. 5.14 Income splitting may enhance the choices available to parents by making it easier for a partner to stay home to care for dependant children, if he or she wishes to, as single earner families would benefit the most from 50/50 income splitting. 5.15 Even so, income splitting may not target support very well if this is the goal to be achieved. As Figure 1 shows, the greatest benefit from income splitting goes to families on higher incomes, and these families may not necessarily be the families who most need assistance. 21 5.16 For families with lower incomes, for whom the financial constraints may be greater, income splitting would provide only small amounts of support. For example, a one-earner family receiving $40,000 would gain only $600 a year from income splitting. Efficiency 5.17 The impact on economic efficiency of income splitting is not immediately obvious because effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs) increase for some people (secondary earners) and decrease for others (primary earners). 5.18 Taxation of labour income will distort price signals and alter people’s work decisions, leading to an inefficient allocation of resources. This inefficiency increases the higher the tax rate is, and the more responsive people are to the imposition of the tax. Therefore the reduction in primary earner EMTRs will increase efficiency, while the rise in secondary earner EMTRs will decrease efficiency. 5.19 The average decrease in primary earner EMTRs and the increase in secondary earner EMTRs is roughly the same, so the efficiency gains from the reduction of higher primary earner EMTRs would appear likely to outweigh the negative effect of the increases in lower secondary earner EMTRs. However, if labour supply responsiveness differs between these groups, this may not be the case. 5.20 Empirical evidence 5 suggests that secondary earners, especially women, are far more responsive to changes in the return to labour than primary workers. Consequently, the negative impact on efficiency of an increase in secondary earner EMTRs may outweigh the positive impact of the reduction in primary earner EMTRs. For example, a full-time worker may decide to continue working full-time under any circumstances, whereas a part-time worker is more likely to reduce hours of work or leave the workforce altogether if EMTRs become too high. 5.21 Even in the absence of income splitting, EMTRs can be high for many people as a result of the abatement of the Working for Families package, the ACC earner premium, student loan repayments and child support obligations. As such, the efficiency impact of a further change in EMTRs as a result of income splitting would be greater for such people than for those with a lower pre-income splitting EMTR. 5.22 There may also be further efficiency impacts beyond those directly relating to the tax system. The lower EMTRs on primary income earners are likely to provide greater incentives for them to acquire new skills and move to better remunerated jobs, which, by itself, is likely to boost labour productivity. However, the higher EMTRs for secondary earners create incentives to reduce hours of work, or to leave the workforce temporarily, which may 5 See, for example, Blundell, R. and McCurdy, T. (1999) “Labour supply: A review of alternative approaches”, in O Ashenfelter and D Card (eds.), “Handbook of Labour Economics”, Volume 3, North Holland, Amsterdam. 22 adversely affect labour productivity. Evidence suggests 6 that once people have been outside the workforce for more than a year their skills may begin to atrophy, resulting, in the long term, in a less productive workforce, which may have an impact on economic growth. Simplicity 5.23 By implementing income splitting through the existing Working for Families tax credits system, income splitting is likely to be relatively simple for people to comply with. If they were able to use a special tax code to receive the tax benefit from income splitting during the year, there would be some increase in compliance costs. That is because they would need to estimate their correct tax rate having regard for the impact of their partner’s income on their tax liability. 5.24 If the income splitting benefit were paid out after the end of the tax year the only families who might face a significant increase in compliance costs would be those who were eligible to split their income but who were not eligible for Working for Families tax credits. The reason is that they may not previously have been required to file a tax return, but might now have to do so in order to receive the tax benefit from income splitting. Administrative costs 5.25 Income splitting would be very expensive to implement and administer irrespective of the specific design. However, it might be possible to implement it through the current Working for Families tax credits system, which would restrict costs to an extent. 6 See, for example, Jaumotte, F., (2003) “Female labour force participation: past trends and main determinants in OECD countries”, OECD Economics Department working papers No. 376; Fagan, C. and Walthery, P. “The role and effectiveness of time policies for reconciliation of care responsibilities”, paper presented to the OECD Conference on Life Risks, Life Course and Social Policy, Paris, 31 May – 1 June 2007. 23 ANNEX TABLE A: G AIN PER COUPLE UNDER INCOME SPLITTING Secondary earner income $0k $10k$20k$30k$40k$50k $60k Primary $0k 0 earner $10k 30 0 income $20k 570 00 $30k 570 000 $40k 810 2402402400 $50k 2,010 1,4401,44096000 $60k 3,210 2,6402,16096000 0 $70k 5,010 3,9602,7601,560600600 0 $80k 6,330 4,5603,3602,1601,200600 0 $90k 6,930 5,1603,9602,7601,200600 0 $100k 7,530 5,7604,5602,7601,200600 0 $110k 8,130 6,3604,5602,7601,200600 0 $120k 8,730 6,3604,5602,7601,200600 0 T ABLE B: DISTRIBUTION OF COUPLES BY PRIMARY/SECONDARY EARNER INCOME 7 Secondary earner income $0 $0k - $10k $10k - $20k $20 - $30k $30 - $40k $40 - $50k $50 - $60k Primary $0 0 Earner $0 - $10k 175 0 Income $10 - $20k 175 3500 $20 - $30k 9,100 21,1751750 $30 - $40k 5,425 16,80001750 $40 - $50k 8,750 14,8753,6752,6251,5750 $50 - $60k 11,900 16,97517,85012,25010,6750 0 $60 - $70k 5,600 11,3758,9257,0004,7250 0 $70 - $80k 2,975 9,2757,8754,3755,0753,500 1,575 $80 - $90k 3,150 5,2504,0251,4002,1001,400 1,400 $90- $100k 1,225 3,6758751,5751,225175 1,225 $100 - $110k175 1,2251,225350700525 0 $110 - $120k700 875350875700525 0 7 Based on Inland Revenue sample data. 24 T ABLE C: D ISTRIBUTION OF TAX BENEFITS FROM INCOME SPLITTING ($M) 8 Secondary earner income $0 $0k - $10k $10k - $20k $20 - $30k $30 - $40k $40 - $50k $50 - $60k Primary $0 0 Earner $0 - $10k 0 0.1 Income $10 - $20k 3.4 5.00 $20 - $30k 3.4 5.500 $30 - $40k 5.5 5.50.40.30.1 $40 - $50k 17.0 20.214.710.35.10 $50 - $60k 15.1 27.818.311.22.20 0 $60 - $70k 12.5 37.023.78.73.21.0 0.3 $70 - $80k 17.8 26.014.53.02.41.0 0.5 $80 - $90k 8.0 22.53.44.61.90.2 0.3 $90- $100k 2.5 8.25.61.41.70.4 0 $100 - $110k5.5 6.21.73.41.50.4 0 $110 - $120k9.1 15.46.69.31.91.1 0 8 Based on Inland Revenue sample data. 25 Regulatory Impact Statement This discussion document incorporates the substantive regulatory impact analysis elements.

It also prevents the tax from “cascading” as goods and services are supplied between businesses that are registered for GST. 1.2 The compliance costs inherent in the credit-invoice mechanism are a trade- off against the benefit that comes from the comprehensive application of GST to goods and services that are imported, produced and distributed in New Zealand. The mechanism also ensures that businesses are tax-neutral in the sense that when a business pays GST, it can deduct input tax. 1.3 The operation of GST in this manner is not, however, without its problems, particularly for transactions involving the supply of significant assets, such as the sale of businesses, land, or other high-value assets. These problems can include, for example, a transaction not qualifying under the legislation that would zero-rate a “going concern” or an invoicing error resulting in a purchaser’s expected input tax (sometimes referred to as a GST “refund” or GST “credit”) entitlement being denied. Because the assets are significant, they are infrequently traded and can create GST consequences that businesses may not have expected or planned for. 1.4 Such GST errors can be particularly costly for businesses, resulting in penalties and use-of-money interest being applied and the reduction of any profit margin on the transaction if the tax becomes an irrecoverable business cost. Government revenue losses can also occur if an input tax entitlement does not result in the corresponding payment of GST to Inland Revenue as a result of arrangements aimed at achieving this effect. 1.5 The purpose of this officials’ paper is to suggest a number of options to solve the problems that can arise in connection with the supply of significant assets, and to improve the operation of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 for businesses and the government. As part of the discussion, we have suggested measures to help ensure business neutrality and reduce base maintenance risks associated with GST. The rules applicable to changes in taxable use and the supply of accommodation are also considered. Our objective is to seek public comment on a range of policy solutions before formal recommendations are made to the government. 1 An obvious exception applies to purchases acquired for the purpose of making exempt supplies, such as financial services. 2 Business-to-business neutrality explained 1.6 Because GST is designed to tax consumption rather than production, transactions between businesses should generally be GST-neutral unless express exemptions are provided (for example, the supply of financial services). The terms “GST-neutral” and “business-to-business neutrality” describe the situation where GST paid by a business can be claimed against the GST payable on taxable supplies. A business is “neutral” about the purchase of goods and services if the GST it pays does not become a permanent business cost. 1.7 To reduce revenue risks to the government that could arise if GST were deductible by individuals or entities that make minimal or no supplies on which GST is charged, the GST Act prescribes the circumstances for neutrality to occur. These include the requirements to carry on a “taxable activity” and register for GST. 2 There should also be a connection with making taxable supplies. 3 These requirements set the necessary parameters for taxpayers to be viewed as being involved in the intermediate production of goods and services so that they are entitled to deduct input tax. 1.8 The ideal consumption tax system would ensure perfect neutrality for both businesses and the government in business-to-business transactions. Perfect neutrality would be achievable in practice if GST did not apply at every stage of production and distribution but applied only at the point of final consumption, as happens with retail sales taxes. 4 However, retail sales taxes are more likely to be exposed to evasion than is GST because of the opportunity for goods and services to be untaxed if acquired by consumers from wholesalers, importers or other providers who are not identified as “retailers”. 1.9 The trade-off associated with the government preferring GST over a retail sales tax is the challenge of ensuring that business neutrality is achieved to the greatest extent possible. This includes the need to ensure that in all but exceptional business-to-business transactions, refunds of GST will be met by a corresponding payment of GST. 1.10 We have reviewed the treatment of business-to-business supplies and, in summary, consider that: • GST is not designed to be a tax on business, with suppliers of exempt goods and services being the exception. • GST-registered businesses have an expectation that GST should not be a direct cost on businesses. This means that input tax entitlements should be promptly refunded, subject to the appropriate level of Inland Revenue enquiry. 2 See sections 6 and 51 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. 3 See section 3A. 4 GST and sales taxes are generally economically equivalent when they function perfectly. 3 • Similarly, the government should have an expectation that transactions between GST-registered businesses are neutral. • The GST Act should provide effective and clear rules that ensure that GST does not unnecessarily hinder transactions between GST- registered persons. Problems considered 1.11 As we have noted, if GST-registered businesses are not entitled to input tax deductions, GST can have a direct negative operational effect on the distribution of resources and profitability. In line with this theme, this document considers: • the cashflow cost associated with collecting GST (which can arise if GST is paid but is not recoverable as input tax until a later date); • the treatment of high-value, one-off transactions (where neutrality is critical); and • the potential for over-taxation when nominees are involved in transactions. 1.12 This issues paper places emphasis on aspects of the GST system that create a risk to the tax base. GST creates the unique situation whereby Inland Revenue regularly refunds GST-registered persons for excess input tax deductions. Another unique feature of the GST system is that it allows taxpayers to use different GST accounting bases and different taxable periods. Aggressive arrangements such as those present in the series of Court decisions concerning Ch’elle, 5 demonstrate that the government’s revenue base is at risk from business structures that are designed to exploit these aspects of the GST system. The inevitable complexity and pace of litigation in this area suggests a need to address the issues not only at an operational level but in terms of possible amendments to the GST Act. “Phoenix fraud” (discussed in chapter 5) and the emergence of “carousel” or “missing trader” fraud (which has had a material effect on the revenue collections for some countries), 6 should, in our view, also be considered in developing any legislative changes. 1.13 Options canvassed in this paper include greater scope for setting off GST liabilities and corresponding deductions and a review of the accounting bases among the range of possible measures for addressing these tax base concerns. 5 See Ch’elle Properties (New Zealand) Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2007\] NZCA 299; Ch’elle Properties (New Zealand) Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (2004) 21 NZTC 18,618 and Case W22 (2003) 21 NZTC 11,212. 6 Michael Keen, VAT attacks!, International Monetary Fund Working Paper WP/07/142 June 2007; Michael Keen and Stephen Smith, VAT fraud and evasion: what do we know and what can be done?, National Tax Journal, Vol. LIX, No 4 December 2006. 4 Other possible measures 1.14 Significant capital assets also present special concerns for the application of the change-in-use or apportionment rules as these assets can be consumed over a number of taxable periods and be applied for a variety of mixed purposes over their lifetime. This paper includes a number of suggestions to improve and clarify the application of the change-in-use rules to capital assets such as land. 1.15 The paper also considers the treatment of holiday and short-term accommodation. The changes suggested in this paper respond to concerns that have been raised in submissions about the correct legislative framework that applies to supplies of accommodation following the Inland Revenue’s draft interpretation statement about the exemption for accommodation provided in a dwelling. 7 Objectives of the possible solutions 1.16 In this paper we have considered a series of possible options to enhance the neutrality of some transactions and reduce the risk that GST can present to businesses and the government. In some cases, common solutions could deal with both business and government concerns. The current rules governing the supply of a “going concern” are an example of the GST Act providing both a business-to-business neutral solution and an anti-avoidance rule. 8 1.17 The options outlined in this paper aim to provide a more certain GST outcome for both GST-registered persons and the government. The options discussed in the document have therefore been developed with the following principles in mind: • preserving the policy objective that GST applies to the widest possible range of goods and services supplied in New Zealand, at a uniform low rate; • reducing, as far as practical, compliance and administrative costs arising from the application of GST; • ensuring that the obligations facing those required to comply with the GST Act are clear and straightforward; and • limiting the scope for erosion of the GST base. References 1.18 All section references in this paper refer to the GST Act unless otherwise specified. Amounts and values used in this document to describe transactions are also expressed as including GST. 7 IS0049 GST Exempt Supply: Supply of accommodation in a dwelling, released by Inland Revenue on 19 October 2006. 8 See sections 2, 11(1)(m) and 78E. 5 SUMMARY OF SUGGESTED OPTIONS This paper outlines a range of options to ensure that business-to-business transactions are GST-neutral. Submissions are invited on which options should be considered in preference to others. Legislating for business-to-business neutrality – Chapter 4 Suggestions are made to improve the GST consequences arising from transactions involving high-value assets such as “going concerns”, assets with a value of $50 million or more, and land, using a mechanism known as a “domestic reverse charge”. The GST treatment of nominee transactions is also discussed. Managing the government’s revenue risk – Chapter 5 “Phoenix” entities are a particular problem for GST systems that are based on the “credit-invoice” method. Three options for reducing this risk are suggested: • Enforcing GST neutrality on certain transactions created between close associates. • Allowing Inland Revenue to impose caveats on certain land transactions. • Extending the time available before Inland Revenue is required to release a refund. The accounting bases – Chapter 6 The incidence of “timing mismatches” created by the operation of the various accounting bases allowed under the GST Act is noted. The policy reasons for the various accounting bases are discussed and two options are suggested to reduce revenue risk: • Limiting access to the invoice basis of accounting. • Strengthening the application of existing anti-avoidance measures accompanied by an increase in the payments basis threshold. The payments basis – Chapter 7 Further adjustments to the current limitations for using the payments basis are considered. Change-in-use adjustments – Chapter 8 A number of changes are suggested to simplify and clarify the change-in-use rules. The relationship between the application of the change-in-use adjustment rules when the use of assets changes from non-taxable to taxable, and the deduction for second- hand goods are discussed. 6 Accommodation – Chapter 9 Options to clarify the GST treatment of short-term accommodation include: • Redefining the terms “dwelling” and “commercial dwelling”. • Removing very small-scale and non-commercial activities involving the supply of accommodation from the definition of “taxable activity”. How to make a submission 1.19 Submissions are invited on the merits of the options suggested in this officials’ paper. We also welcome submissions on alternative measures that meet the objectives of enhancing business neutrality as it affects the application of GST to day-to-day business activities. Those who make submissions are asked to: • discuss whether, and how, the suggested changes would achieve GST neutrality without compromising the integrity of the GST base; and • prioritise these initiatives and any others put forward. 1.20 Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for officials from Inland Revenue and the Treasury to contact you about your submission to discuss the points raised. 1.21 Submissions should be made by 11 July 2008 and be addressed to: GST: Strengthening business-to-business neutrality C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington Or e-mail policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “GST: Strengthening business-to-business neutrality” in the subject line. 1.22 Submissions may be the source of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their publication. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. If you think any part of your submission should properly be withheld under the Act, you should indicate this clearly. 7 Chapter 2 GENERAL OPERATION OF GST 2.1 This chapter discusses the design principles underlying the operation of GST. The collection of GST in New Zealand is modelled on the “credit-invoice” method. Under this model, a liability for GST arises every time goods and services are supplied by a GST-registered person in the course of a taxable activity. GST is also imposed on imported goods and services. Tax is therefore paid throughout the production and distribution chain, but because GST-registered persons are able to deduct GST paid, the tax is ultimately passed on to the final consumer. 2.2 The deduction of GST (by way of a refund or credit) ensures that GST does not cascade as goods and services are supplied between GST-registered persons, and does not impose a cost on business. Therefore, unless the GST paid is connected with the supply of GST exempt goods or services, it does not directly tax the intermediate production of goods and services in New Zealand. 2.3 Other reasons why the credit-invoice method has been adopted over other alternative indirect tax systems are: • It allows all goods and services to be included in the tax base. • It is transparent. • It requires businesses to maintain accounting records detailing sales and purchases, which helps improve financial management and managerial decisions. • It provides a robust revenue stream for the government by taxing each stage of the production and distribution chain. As imports are taxed, it ensures that the tax is secured at the earliest stages of production. • The requirement to issue tax invoices means that the tax generates its own audit trail, which assists in its administration and enforcement. Accounting for GST 2.4 Because GST is a tax based on transactions, its operation, including input tax entitlements, depends on the contractual relationships between the supplier and the recipient. 9 Accounting for GST therefore requires an understanding and knowledge of: • when a supply occurs (or is deemed to occur); • when an entitlement to an input tax deduction arises; and 9 Wilson & Horton v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1995) 17 NZTC 12,325. 8 • when (and how) the calculation of GST less input tax needs to be made using the various accounting bases and filing frequencies allowed under the GST Act. Time of supply and output tax 2.5 The GST Act contains a number of rules that determine the point in time when a GST-registered person must recognise a supply of goods and services that gives rise to an output tax liability. In the majority of cases, this will be when the supplier issues an invoice or receives payment. 2.6 The rules attempt to approximate when a transaction has been concluded and economic control of the goods and services has passed from the supplier to the recipient. When GST was being developed, a number of rules were considered necessary to reflect this concept. 10 Following the recommendation of the Advisory Panel on Goods and Services Tax, 11 which considered public submissions on the White Paper, the then government agreed to simplify the time of supply rules to the earlier of invoice or payment. 2.7 In situations when the application of the general “earlier of invoice or payment” rule is not appropriate – for example, agreements for hire or regular periodic supplies of goods and services, the GST Act contains a range of supplementary rules. Deduction of input tax 2.8 GST paid on purchased taxable supplies can be deducted as input tax when the GST-registered person holds a valid “tax invoice”. 12 Unlike output tax, input tax is not generally subject to timing rules. 13 The point in time when input tax can be deducted is largely determined by the taxpayer holding evidence that tax has been paid. If the registered person does not hold a tax invoice or other documentation to support the purchase, 14 no deduction can be made. 2.9 In each taxable period, GST-registered persons aggregate the total output tax deemed to arise either under the time of supply rules or the accounting rules for that period and deduct from that amount any input tax invoiced or paid. The net of these two amounts is either the tax payable owed by the GST- registered person or, if input tax exceeds output tax, a refund. 10 White Paper on goods and services tax: Proposals for the administration of the goods and services tax, New Zealand Government, March 1985, p. 17. 11 Report of the Advisory Panel on Goods and Services Tax to the Minister of Finance, June 1985, p . 12. 12 See sections 24 and 24BA. 13 Subject to the proviso applicable to section 20(3). 14 Subject to the application of section 24(6). 9 The accounting bases 2.10 The accounting bases available in the GST Act determine how output tax and input tax should be attributed to a particular taxable period. Although the time of supply rules determine when GST-registered persons are required to recognise a liability for GST, the accounting basis adopted can alter the taxable period in which that liability needs to be disclosed to Inland Revenue. 2.11 The GST Act allows for three bases of accounting for GST, as described in Table 1. The current choice of accounting bases is largely a response to compliance cost concerns. TABLE 1: D ESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOUNTING BASES PERMITTED UNDER THE GST ACT Accounting basis Description The invoice basis The standard basis of accounting for GST is the invoice basis. Output tax is accounted for at the time of supply. Input tax deductions may be claimed on the basis of payment or invoice – subject to the deduction being supported by a valid tax invoice. The invoice basis is similar to the accrual basis for financial accounting. The payments basis GST-registered persons may use the payments basis if they have annual taxable supplies of less than $1.3 million or are a non-profit body. Output tax is accounted for to the extent that payment is received. Input tax deductions can be claimed to the extent to which payment has been made – subject to the deduction being supported by a valid tax invoice. Inland Revenue has a discretion to allow GST-registered persons who have a turnover of greater than $1.3 million to account for GST using this basis after taking into account the nature, volume and value of the supplies made. The hybrid basis GST-registered persons may choose to use the hybrid basis if they do not qualify to account for GST using the payments basis and do not want to use the invoice basis. No turnover limitations are imposed on who may account for GST using the hybrid basis. Output tax is accounted for in a similar manner as under the invoice basis. Input tax deductions are claimed in a manner similar to the payments basis. 2.12 Table 2 shows the general distribution of GST-registered persons over the three accounting bases. 15 15 Source: Inland Revenue. Information was compiled from GST 101 returns for the year end 31 December 2007. 10 TABLE 2: U SE OF THE ACCOUNTING BASES BY REGISTERED PERSONS Annual taxable supplies Payments Invoice Hybrid Up to $1.3 million 458,520 99,942 3,299 Over $1.3 million 13,230 24,145 462 Return filing 2.13 The last factor in accounting for GST is the frequency for calculating tax payable (including any refund) and filing the related return with Inland Revenue. 16 2.14 For administrative convenience, the activities of GST-registered persons are broken down into periods of time, or “taxable periods”. Depending on their size, as measured by annual taxable supplies, GST-registered persons generally have the choice of one of three taxable periods or filing frequencies. 17 The standard taxable period is two months, although shorter (monthly) and longer (six-monthly) periods may apply. At the end of every taxable period, GST-registered persons must assess whether they have GST to pay or are entitled to a refund. 16 The obligation to file a GST return and calculate the amount of “tax payable” is imposed under section 16. The calculation of “tax payable” (as defined in section 2 includes any refund) is done by reference to section 20. 17 The GST Act also requires other returns subject to the application of special supply rules, such as those in section 5(2). 11 Chapter 3 PROBLEMS WHEN NEUTRALITY IS NOT ACHIEVED 3.1 The credit-invoice method of collecting GST, while generally effective in achieving the objective of business neutrality, can present risks for both businesses and the government. For businesses, the risk is that if the GST consequences of a transaction are not properly taken into account, that could give rise to penalties or even produce a non-deductible GST liability. For the government, the risk is the possibility that Inland Revenue will refund an input tax deduction that may not be offset by an expected corresponding payment of GST. 3.2 This chapter describes these problems in more detail. Risks to businesses 3.3 Transactions that are not neutral to businesses can result in GST becoming a fixed burden on production. This can affect business margins, distort business decisions and alter perceptions about voluntary compliance. Non- neutral business-to-business transactions can also have wider economic implications if the tax has the potential to cascade. The “carrying” cost of GST 3.4 GST-registered businesses can face a cashflow cost if they are unable to immediately recognise input tax deductions when GST is paid on purchases. This cost is particularly relevant for exporters because zero-rated exports do not produce the usual offsetting cashflow benefits that arise by holding GST charged on supplies to customers until payment to Inland Revenue is required. 3.5 Another cashflow cost facing businesses that use the invoice or hybrid accounting bases arises if GST has to be returned to Inland Revenue in connection with supplies made over the taxable period in question, but payment has not yet been received from customers. 3.6 These costs are sometimes referred to as the “carrying” cost of GST. The GST Act attempts to deal with this cost by permitting a variety of accounting bases and filing frequencies. Other rules, for example, those applicable to the supply of “going concerns”, further help to mitigate the carrying cost of GST. 3.7 When these legislative solutions do not provide the required degree of relief, administrative solutions can provide assistance. For example, exporters, who make predominantly zero-rated supplies do not receive the benefit of holding GST charged on their supplies of goods and services. To deal with the carrying cost of GST on their purchases, Inland Revenue has a practice of ensuring that excess input tax deductions are promptly refunded to exporters 12 on the receipt of a valid GST return. Exporter GST returns are therefore processed well within the 15-working day requirement. 18 3.8 In other instances, Inland Revenue may permit the GST liability incurred by a GST-registered supplier on a transaction to be set off against the input tax deduction that would otherwise be available to the GST-registered recipient. 19 3.9 The New Zealand Customs Service may provide administrative relief to importers by allowing the payment of GST on imported goods to be deferred for up to seven weeks. 20 The deferral allows qualifying importers to claim input tax deductions for GST levied under section 12 before the GST payment needs to be made to Customs. Potential for over-taxation 3.10 Subject to a GST-registered person holding a valid tax invoice, a deduction of input tax is allowed when GST has been invoiced or paid or, in the case of imported goods, levied. It is important that these deductions are dealt with promptly, particularly when they give rise to a refund, so that GST does not become a cost of production rather than a tax on consumption, as intended. 3.11 If the input tax deduction arises by some other means – for example, from the purchase of second-hand goods or from adjustments for changes in use – Inland Revenue may need to give the deduction closer scrutiny. This is because these deductions do not arise from the payment of GST to another GST-registered person or to the New Zealand Customs Service and therefore do not immediately give rise to offsetting output tax. 3.12 Case law on the deduction of input tax by GST-registered persons has generally emphasised that legal ownership of the goods and services purchased is a prerequisite to deduction. 21 Businesses may therefore face problems when the legal entitlement to input tax cannot be established but the cost of the purchase has been incurred. For example, when a nominee provides consideration for a supply of goods and services to the vendor, but the contract treats the named purchaser – rather than the nominee – as the recipient, uncertainty can arise about the entitlement to deduct input tax and this can possibly even result in over-taxation. 3.13 Another area of uncertainty exists when a nominee provides the consideration for the supply of a “going concern”, but is not the identified recipient on the agreement for sale and purchase. This can affect whether the going concern is zero-rated or subject to GST under the usual rules. 18 See section 46. 19 GST offsets, or transfers of input tax deductions, may be made by the Commissioner under section 173M of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The facility is not available if the GST-registered recipient has outstanding returns or debt with Inland Revenue that limit the amount that can be used as an offset. 20 Customs Fact Sheet number 17, Deferred payment scheme, 17 August 2006, New Zealand Customs Service. 21 See Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Capital Enterprises Limited (2002) 20 NZTC 17,511 and Case T35 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,235. 13 3.14 These uncertainties add to compliance costs as well as affecting businesses’ ability to receive full input tax deductions. The risks of this uncertainty are exacerbated by the potential for short-fall penalties or use-of-money interest charges to apply if, for example, a decision to claim an input tax deduction or to zero-rate a supply ultimately proves incorrect. Supplies of going concerns 3.15 The circumstances in which the supply of a “going concern” may be zero- rated are defined by the GST Act. Whether or not a supply is of a going concern may, however, be uncertain. If this uncertainty is identified at the beginning, the parties may, as discussed earlier, seek a set off of the GST- registered recipient’s input tax deduction against the output tax owed by the GST-registered supplier. However, this may not always be possible. Company grouping rules 3.16 The GST grouping rules play an important role in alleviating potential distortions between the treatment of single entities, branch structures and company group structures. The rules reduce compliance costs arising from transactions within a group by ensuring that intra-group supplies sourced completely from within a group’s resources are not subject to GST unless the assets are used for private or exempt purposes. In this way, the GST grouping rules treat the group as if it were a single economic entity. 3.17 The grouping rules are, however, elective, and it may be the case that related entities who wish to group cannot do so because they are unable to satisfy one or more of the requirements in the GST Act. 3.18 The GST Act was recently amended in line with the principle of treating groups of companies as a single economic entity to deal with situations when the transfer of assets within a group gives rise to a GST liability because the recipient member of the group is not registered for GST. 22 However, despite this amendment, GST risks may still exist for businesses in entering into group transactions. Revenue risks for the government 3.19 GST presents an inevitable risk to the government by requiring the issue of refunds from input tax deductions that may not be offset by the payment of GST in circumstances when that would be the expected outcome. This can occur for legitimate reasons, in the case of liquidations or bad debts of the type that can be faced by any business. However, there are situations when this offset does not occur for other reasons – for example, if timing mismatches created by the choice of accounting bases and filing frequencies is exploited or if “phoenix” entities are used to create tax advantages. 22 See section 55(1) as amended by the Taxation (Savings Investment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006. 14 3.20 The risk associated with timing mismatches was highlighted by the series of cases involving Ch’elle Properties (New Zealand) Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue. 23 These cases concerned an arrangement that was designed to produce a refundable input tax deduction of $9 million to the purchasing company (Ch’elle) but defer the requirement to account for GST by the 114 separate companies supplying the land in question to Ch’elle. The deliberate operation of the vendor companies so as not to require GST to be accounted for using the invoice basis on the transactions, together with the wider features of the arrangement, led the courts to the conclusion that there was tax avoidance. 3.21 In Australia, a similar arrangement was held to be avoidance under Division 165 of the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (the equivalent of section 76 of the New Zealand GST Act). In VCE and Commissioner of Taxation 24 the sale of property modified and leased as a medical centre by a taxpayer to a company owned by the taxpayer and his spouse was considered to be a scheme that had the sole or dominant purpose of achieving a GST benefit. The features of the arrangement involved an agreed selling price of $770,000 (including GST), although the market value was $250,000, with periodic payments scheduled for 2008, 2013 and 2018. A deposit of $550 was payable but the taxpayer retained ownership until the company made full payment in 2018. The Australian Appeals Tribunal Authority considered that the tax benefit of the scheme was a tax refund that was larger than could reasonably be expected. 3.22 These cases illustrate that Inland Revenue is able to use the relevant anti- avoidance provisions in the GST Act to deal with non-neutral transactions. This may limit the choices available to taxpayers when deliberately attempting to operate outside the business-neutral framework. However, because anti-avoidance rules may be highly fact-dependent and litigation can be both time consuming and costly, other measures are needed to protect the integrity of the GST system. 3.23 In 2007 the government allocated $14.6 million over three years to strengthen Inland Revenue’s audit of property transactions. 25 From 2000 the number of persons registered for GST grew from about 500,000 to just over 660,000 for the year ended 1 April 2008. 26 Further, in the last financial year, Inland Revenue processed in excess of 3 million GST returns. Against such volumes, the effectiveness of current audit strategies can be tested. Further legislative solutions, as presented in this paper, are therefore worth exploring. 23 Ibid footnote 5. 24 \[2006\] AATA 821. 25 See Budget speech, 17 May 2007. 26 Including one-off returns. 15 Chapter 4 LEGISLATING FOR BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS NEUTRALITY 4.1 This chapter makes suggestions for improving the neutrality of certain business-to-business transactions. These are: • replacing the going concern rules with an expanded set of rules that are applicable to a wider range of transactions; and • ensuring input tax deductions are not denied for nominee and related transactions. The going concern rules 4.2 The supply of goods as a “going concern” may be zero-rated under the GST Act if the parties agree to treat the supply as such. 27 4.3 The purpose of the going concern rules is to: • remove the cashflow cost to businesses, in what are generally high- value transactions, of financing the GST component of the purchase price for the period between making payment for the goods and when the entitlement to deduct input tax arises; and • reduce the risk to the government of a GST-registered person charging GST on the sale of goods and retaining the tax component. 4.4 Despite these objectives, the application of the going concern rules has been an area of uncertainty – for example, most GST cases before the courts have concerned disputes about whether a going concern was supplied. 28 Changes made to the rules in 1995 and 2000 29 have improved the operation of the going concern rules and gone some way to reducing the number of disputes in this area. However, concerns about the rules remain.. For example, the definition of a “going concern” in section 2 of the GST Act requires that the supplier carries on, or is carrying on, a taxable activity, or part of a taxable activity that is capable of separate operation, up to the time of its transfer to the recipient. If the transaction does not comply with these requirements, the supplier can face an unexpected GST liability and the risk of shortfall penalties and use-of-money interest. These consequences have prompted some to suggest that the operation of the rules should be reconsidered. 30 27 See sections 2, 11(1)(m) and 78E. 28 See Appellate interpretation of New Zealand’s GST legislation: an initial survey: 1986-2005 (2005) 5(10), Australian GST Journal pp. 205 to 224, D White. 29 As amended by the Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1995 and the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000. 30 See “GST update” A Bullôt, 2007 New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants Tax Conference, 26 and 27 October 2007, p. 10. 16 Other options 4.5 These concerns suggest that the rules are unlikely ever to provide legislative certainty in all cases. Therefore the following suggestions for achieving and extending the policy behind the rules are considered: • suspending the liability for GST on certain transactions, with consequent denial of input tax to the purchaser; and • “domestic reverse charging” whereby the liability for tax is shifted to the purchaser, who would also deduct the self-assessed GST. 4.6 The options seek to ensure a GST-neutral outcome for both going concerns and a wider range of transactions involving significant assets when the risks associated with GST may be particularly high. Suspending GST liabilities on business-to-business supplies 4.7 Suspending the requirement to charge GST on a transaction would be similar in principle to the operation of a retail sales tax. GST would be suspended when goods and services are supplied between GST-registered businesses, with the effect that the tax is not charged and the GST-registered recipient is unable to deduct input tax (because no GST has been charged). 4.8 To prevent goods and services leaving the revenue base untaxed, there would be a need to verify and certify the status of the purchaser and retain evidence supporting the decision to suspend the charging of GST (for example, exemption certificates). Because these requirements could be onerous on businesses and because of the risk of evasion we do not favour this option. “Domestic reverse charging” – shifting the tax obligation onto the recipient 4.9 An alternative option, referred to in this paper as “domestic reverse charging”, involves shifting the obligation to charge GST from the GST- registered supplier to the GST-registered recipient. It would require the recipient of the goods and services, who would need to be registered for GST at the time of supply, to self-assess GST on the purchase and deduct, if entitled to do so, input tax in the same taxable period. 4.10 The advantage of domestic reverse charging is that GST neutrality is achieved in a manner consistent with the credit-invoice method. Businesses would benefit from a more certain rule and the carrying cost of GST would be reduced. For Inland Revenue, the risk of refunding an input tax deduction on a transaction when there is a risk that GST will not be paid would be similarly reduced. 4.11 A similar system has recently been implemented in the United Kingdom to deal with fraudulent transactions involving the supply of mobile telephones, computer components and other electronic goods. 17 Suggested change 4.12 It is suggested that the current “going concern” rules be removed. The wider domestic reverse charge mechanism would be introduced with application to transactions involving: • going concerns; • extremely high-value transactions – for example, supplies of goods and services when the value of the transaction exceeds, say, $50 million (excluding GST); and • improved or unimproved land irrespective of value. 4.13 These transactions have been identified because they may pose a cashflow risk to both GST-registered persons and the government. The suggested approach would have mandatory application to these transactions when both the supplier and the recipient were registered for GST. In the case of transactions between associates, we may need to consider the extent to which both the supplier and the recipient should be treated as registered for GST. 4.14 The objective of domestic reverse charging would be to eliminate the cashflow consequences created by GST and provide a mechanism to ensure that business-to-business taxable supplies between GST-registered persons are neutral. Accordingly, GST-registered recipients will not face a delay between paying GST on the supply and claiming the related input tax deduction. 4.15 It is also expected that the suggested approach would remove the need for GST-registered persons to obtain Inland Revenue’s approval to set off the supplier’s GST liability against the recipient’s input tax entitlement. 4.16 No exceptions or exclusions would be provided other than for cases when neutrality is not an appropriate outcome (for example, financial services, exports and supplies to final consumers). 4.17 Special time-of-supply rules are likely to be needed to determine the time when the purchaser would be required to self-assess GST. It is suggested that the time of supply should be treated as the settlement date for the transaction, although we are aware that this would need to be carefully defined. Consideration would also need to be given to valuation rules. Using the GST-exclusive value of the contract or agreement for the sale of the goods and services could be a good starting point. Submissions are invited on how these suggestions could be developed to provide sufficient legislative certainty. 4.18 The following example illustrates how the suggested domestic reverse charge mechanism might work. 18 Example: How the proposed domestic reverse charge mechanism might apply Company B acquires land from Company A with the intention of using the land to develop a new branch office to facilitate the supply of car parts to the upper South Island. Company A confirms that Company B is registered for GST, and the transaction is subject to the domestic reverse charge mechanism. The GST-registration numbers of the parties to the transaction and the fact that it is subject to the domestic reverse charge mechanism are confirmed in the agreement for sale and purchase. The agreed value of the land is $800,000 excluding GST. The contract is signed on 25 August 2010, and settlement occurs on 11 October 2010. As this transaction involves the sale of land, the domestic reverse charging applies. 11 October 2010 is the date that the time of supply is triggered for GST purposes. Under the reverse charge mechanism, Company A does not charge GST on the transaction. Instead, Company B records a liability for GST of $100,000 ($800,000 x 12.5%) in its GST return for October 2010. Company B claims a corresponding input tax deduction of $100,000 in the same GST return. Both parties maintain a copy of the agreement for sale and purchase to support the GST treatment adopted. The supplier’s obligations 4.19 Under the domestic reverse charge mechanism, the supplier would still be treated as making a taxable supply of goods and services in order to protect any input tax entitlements. 31 The supplier would be required to confirm that the purchaser is registered for GST and retain supporting documentation. 4.20 If the supplier was unable to verify the registration number of the purchaser at the time of supply, the supplier would need to charge GST under the normal rules. The purchaser’s obligations 4.21 As we have noted, the domestic reverse charge mechanism would shift the obligation to charge GST away from the GST-registered supplier to the GST- registered purchaser and the purchaser would be required to self-assess GST in the taxable period in which the transaction occurred. 32 The GST-registered purchaser would, subject to holding a valid tax invoice or other relevant documentation, be able to claim an input tax deduction in the same taxable period for goods and services that were acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. 31 Supplies made under this approach could be disclosed in box 6 (zero-rating) of the GST 101 or GST 103 return. 32 Supplies received under this approach could be disclosed in box 5 of the GST 101 or GST 103 return and an offsetting input tax deduction would be allowed under box 11 (subject to the tax invoice requirements). 19 Documentation 4.22 Regarding the documentation to support the domestic reverse charge, one option would be for the obligation to issue a tax invoice to remain with the supplier, notwithstanding the purchaser’s obligation to account for both output tax and input tax. Additional requirements would be that the registration numbers of both the supplier and purchaser are disclosed together with a statement that the transaction has been subject to the domestic reverse charge mechanism. If there was a delay in the issue of the invoice, however, the purchaser might suffer a delay in claiming the input tax deduction. This option may also have GST accounting system implications, and there is also the potential for error and confusion when the supplier is required to issue a tax invoice inclusive of GST but is not required to account for GST. 4.23 Another option is for the purchaser to create a buyer-created tax invoice to support the deduction of input tax. Again, the registration numbers of the supplier and the purchaser would need to be recorded on the invoice, together with a statement that the transaction was subject to the domestic reverse charge mechanism. This option would ensure that the purchaser had the documentation to support the deduction of input tax in the same taxable period in which the tax liability under the domestic reverse charge arose. 4.24 A further option is to dispense with the requirement for a formal tax invoice altogether and rely on the agreement for sale and purchase. If the agreement for sale and purchase contains the core details about the supplier and the purchaser (for example, registration numbers, names and addresses) and details about the transaction, including the value of the transaction and the date of settlement, this document could be sufficient to establish the supplier’s and purchaser’s obligations under the domestic reverse charge mechanism. This alternative would be broadly consistent with the proposal in the government discussion document Reducing tax compliance costs for small and medium-sized enterprises, 33 to use documents produced in the ordinary course of business to support the deduction of input tax. Additional provisions 4.25 As the domestic reverse charge mechanism would represent a departure from the usual operation of the GST system, additional provisions are likely to be required. These would address, for example, the situation where a GST- registered person accidentally charges GST on supplies that should be subject to the domestic reverse charge mechanism. 4.26 Other situations that may need to be addressed include those where goods and services supplied using the domestic reverse charge mechanism might be subject to a post-sale discount or are returned. 4.27 Submissions on these matters are welcome. 33 Chapter 5, Reducing tax compliance costs for small and medium-sized enterprises, December 2007. 20 Specific points for consultation – domestic reverse charge mechanism • Submissions are invited on the practicality of the suggested domestic reverse charge mechanism and any specific rules necessary to ensure its effectiveness. • Would the domestic reverse charge mechanism deal with the concerns identified in Chapter 3, including the cashflow impact GST has on high-value transactions? Ensuring input tax deductions in nominee transactions 4.28 In cases involving nominations, there may be uncertainty around who the recipient of the supply is and, therefore, who is entitled to deduct input tax. 34 For example, depending on the interpretation adopted, a transaction involving a nominee or an assignee may involve either one or two supplies for GST purposes. Where the nominee pays the purchase price under a contract between the supplier and contractual recipient, the two possible supplies for GST purposes are one from the vendor to the purchaser under the original contract, and one from the purchaser to the nominee under the nomination agreement. The same analysis potentially applies in connection with assignments. 4.29 Although the argument that there may be two supplies in these situations follows the GST rules, it does not reflect the economic reality of there being a single supply and may also be inconsistent with our neutrality argument. Suggested change 4.30 We are considering whether legislative clarification is needed for situations involving nominations and assignments. A change to the GST Act could be introduced for transactions involving nominations and assignments when the nominee or assignee pays the purchase price to the vendor. Under the suggested change, the goods and services would be treated as being supplied by the vendor to the nominee. As a result, the vendor would have to account for the GST, if any, and the nominee would have the right to demand a tax invoice from the vendor in order to deduct input tax on the value of the consideration paid for the supply. 4.31 The two-supply analysis would be treated as applicable in certain situations, such as when both the purchaser and the nominee have contributed to the purchase price or when the purchaser has already claimed an input tax deduction because a tax invoice has been issued by the vendor to the purchaser before the nominee becomes known. 34 For different opinions on the topic among practitioners, see G Bracken, GST, Nominations and Assignments New Zealand Tax Planning Report, No 1, May 2005 and G Olding, GST Issues with Nominations and Assignments – Another View New Zealand Tax Planning Report, No 2, August 2005. 21 Specific point for consultation – nominee transactions Submissions are sought on possible amendments to the GST Act to clarify the position for transactions involving nominations and assignments. 22 Chapter 5 FURTHER OPTIONS FOR MANAGING THE GOVERNMENT’S REVENUE RISK 5.1 A crucial element of the credit-invoice tax framework is the GST-registered person’s ability to obtain refunds when input tax deductions exceed the output tax charged in a given taxable period. Inland Revenue has an obligation to be vigilant in the payment of GST refunds, given the revenue risks that would otherwise arise. 5.2 An example of these revenue risks includes the use of “phoenix” entities (see Figure 1) to create input tax and “carousel fraud”, which has been a particular problem for governments in the European Union. 5.3 This chapter outlines, for comment, possible solutions (in addition to the domestic reverse charge discussed in paragraph 4) to address the risks such as: • treating legally separate entities as a single economic entity in specific situations; • using caveats to improve Inland Revenue’s information-gathering for certain types of transactions; and • increasing the time available to Inland Revenue to process refunds. Threats to business-to-business neutrality “Phoenix” entities 5.4 “Phoenix” entities can be problematic for the operation of GST because the purchase of assets from the failed entity by the “re-born” entity can give rise to an input tax entitlement without the corresponding payment of GST. This asymmetrical treatment is a cost to the government, but when it occurs because of a genuine business failure it is a recognised trade-off for the wider benefits that come from the comprehensive application of GST. On the other hand, if the entity becomes insolvent as a result of the conscious actions of its owners and/or the entity’s assets are transferred to an associated entity, the result may be inconsistent with the objective of providing business neutrality. 5.5 The government has recently responded to some of the general problems created by phoenix entities by changing the laws governing the appointment of liquidators and introducing a framework of “voluntary administration” to assist creditors of financially troubled companies. 35 Nevertheless, specific measures may be needed to deal with the GST concerns discussed in this paper. 35 See Part 15A of the Companies Act 1993. 23 F IGURE 1: ILLUSTRATION OF A POSSIBLE “PHOENIX” ARRANGEMENT A BC IRD 51%51% Goods and services plus tax invoice GST refund Third-party GST refund Goods and services Third-party Goods and services Notes: • Company B claims an input tax deduction in the usual manner in connection with its purchases from third parties and supplies goods and services to Company C. • Company C does not immediately pay Company B – who accounts for GST using the payments basis. Company C claims an input tax deduction on the basis of the tax invoice provided by Company B. • Person A decides to wind up Company B leaving an unpaid tax debt. • The transaction between companies B and C therefore creates an input tax deduction which is not met by a corresponding payment of GST from B. “Carousel fraud” 5.6 Internationally, there have been high-profile instances where government revenues have been affected by fraud and aggressive structures designed to exploit the refunds that can arise from input tax deductions. 36 These arrangements, commonly referred to as “carousel fraud”, are deliberately designed not to be neutral. 5.7 As reported in the European Union, carousel fraud works like this: • An entity (entity A) based in, say, Germany supplies goods to entity B, which is based in the United Kingdom. Entity A zero-rates the supply as it is an export. • As the supply is an intra-community transaction between European Union businesses, entity B is required to self-assess VAT using the relevant rate of VAT for that member state. Entity B would generally recognise an input tax deduction for self-assessed VAT in the same return period. 36 Ibid footnote 6. See also The serious research gap on VAT/GST: A New Zealand perspective after 20 years of GST, International VAT monitor, September/October 2007. Carousel fraud reportedly cost the United Kingdom an estimated £3 billion in 2005 to 2006. 24 • Entity B on-sells the goods to entity C, which is based in the United Kingdom. Entity B charges VAT on the transaction and ceases operation as soon as the goods are sold. Entity B retains the VAT charged and does not file a return. • Entity C claims a deduction for the VAT charged by entity B and exports the goods to entity A. The supply is zero-rated. • These steps are then repeated. 5.8 Technically, it is possible for carousel fraud to occur in New Zealand. While this has not been a significant concern to date, the possibility that it could occur should, in our view, be taken into account in developing any base protection measures. Current methods of managing GST risk 5.9 Aside from the general tax-neutral framework provided by the GST system, an important tool in managing GST risk is the Crown’s status as a preferential creditor in collecting tax payable that is unpaid at the time of a bankruptcy, liquidation or receivership. “Tax payable” is the net difference between GST charged and input tax deductions assessed by a GST-registered person for a taxable period. The Crown’s preference reflects that GST, while not held on trust like PAYE or other withholding payments, is charged by businesses on the goods and services they supply to their customers. GST charged can be used by GST-registered persons in their day-to-day cash management. The use of GST monies in this way means that the government does not have the benefit of the tax at the time it is charged. 5.10 The GST Act contains provisions that allow for refunds arising from excess input tax deductions to be set off against other outstanding tax debts owed by the GST-registered person. These rules are designed to apply before a GST- registered person encounters financial difficulties and is an efficient means of collecting the debts. 5.11 However, Inland Revenue’s current powers to enforce the payment of tax are premised on the entity having sufficient financial assets on which to make payment. In the case of phoenix and carousel fraud, the purpose is to leave the entities involved without any financial assets that could be subject to the Crown’s preference or the Inland Revenue’s powers to set off. 5.12 As the problems created by such fraud stem from the operation of the GST Act, tax-specific changes are needed in addition to the previously discussed changes to commercial law. 25 Options being considered 5.13 The domestic reverse charge discussed in chapter 4 will partially address our concerns with phoenix and carousel fraud but we have outlined in the remainder of this chapter some further possible measures. We acknowledge that legislative solutions for addressing fraud have their inherent limitations which can only be dealt with administratively. Enforcing business-to-business neutrality 5.14 When outstanding GST debts have been deliberately created to provide corresponding input tax deduction entitlements to closely associated entities, one option would be to treat such associated GST-registered suppliers and recipients as the same economic entity. That could be achieved by widening the set-off powers available to Inland Revenue for associated persons’ transactions. 5.15 The intention is to ensure that the net effect of transactions between close associates is neutral so that they do not create a GST liability or corresponding input tax entitlement, in much the same way that transactions between a group of companies should not result in GST consequences – change-in-use adjustments being the exception. We would not suggest, however, that close associates be made liable for each other’s tax debts or that Inland Revenue’s priority in the event that a supplier becomes insolvent be advanced. 5.16 Widening the current set-off powers would include: • Making a GST-registered company liable for GST if it acquires goods or services from an associated company that is unable to meet its tax liability. The supplier and the recipient would be treated as the same economic entity, and the input tax deduction claimed in respect of the transaction between the associated companies would be reversed. • Making an associated person (not a company) – for example a GST- registered trust 37 – liable for GST if it acquires goods and services from a GST-registered settlor that is unable to meet its GST obligations. The settlor and the trust would be treated as the same economic entity, and the input tax deduction claimed be similarly reversed. 5.17 In these situations, the set-off power would be specific to transactions between associated persons in which there had not been a genuine economic exchange and/or when Inland Revenue is the principal creditor. When the input tax deduction claimed by the recipient was reversed, a corresponding adjustment would be made to the supplier’s GST liability to ensure that the transaction between the two parties was neutral. 37 The term “trust” is used as a short-hand expression to describe the trustees of the trust. 26 5.18 To appropriately target this possible measure, a narrower definition of “associated persons” that focuses on entities under the control of the others, could be used. The suggested definition of “associated persons” that applies to land sales in the Income Tax Act 2007 would be a possibility. 38 We are considering an exclusion to the measure of widely held companies. Specific points for consultation – enforcing business-to-business neutrality • Do you agree with this option? • What are the likely costs and risks with this option? Power to impose caveats 5.19 Inland Revenue relies on the information collected from GST returns in determining its audit strategies. Much of the information contained in the return is aggregated and does not give Inland Revenue an insight into when certain types of property transactions are undertaken. 5.20 If Inland Revenue were given earlier notice of a property transaction it would be possible to detect transactions that might be viewed as detrimental to the GST base at a much earlier stage. 5.21 The intention of using caveats would not be to enforce the collection of GST, but to provide Inland Revenue with information that a transaction is likely to occur and that output tax is payable. Inland Revenue would have a discretion to lodge a caveat and would consider its application if the taxpayer had been engaged in activities that posed a risk to the integrity of the GST base. 5.22 The use of caveats could take a range of forms. For example, a caveat could be a notice that Inland Revenue lodges on the land title against the name of certain owner of land when that person acquires the land and claims a deduction either as input tax or as a change-in-use adjustment. The notice will ensure that Inland Revenue is informed when the land is sold. Subsequent to the sale, the notice would be removed automatically without the owner of the land having to contact Inland Revenue. 5.23 Alternatively, a caveat could take the strict legal form of being a restriction against dealing in land. Such caveats lodged by Inland Revenue would be removed once the owner had given Inland Revenue notice of an impending sale of property. Having received notice, Inland Revenue would direct the Land Registrar to remove the caveat, and the supplier would be able to proceed with the sale. 38 See the officials’ issues paper Reforming the definition of associated persons, Policy Advice Division and the Treasury, March 2007. 27 5.24 Since this option could otherwise result in significant compliance costs for taxpayers we have, as mentioned earlier, limited its scope. Limiting the scope of the option does, however, have the following disadvantages: • Knowledge that the GST-registered person poses a compliance risk: Inland Revenue may not always have the necessary information to make a reasonable decision about whether a particular GST-registered person poses a risk to the GST base. • Impact on the freedom to contract: Lending institutions may be reluctant to provide finance for transactions involving land subject to a caveat as they would know that the vendor may be a party to activities that could be the subject of a dispute between the GST-registered person and Inland Revenue. Specific points for consultation – power to impose caveats • Do you agree with this option? • Would it be preferable to use a caveat in the form of a notice or a caveat against dealing in land as a mechanism for Inland Revenue to be notified of a sale? • Do you agree that the proposal should only to transactions by those persons who are likely to pose a risk to the GST base? • What modifications would you make to the suggested changes? • What commercial implications would the proposal have? Extending the timeframe for the release of refunds 5.25 When the calculation of tax payable results in a refund of GST – that is, when input tax deductions exceed output tax – Inland Revenue is required to pay that refund within 15 working days from the day following Inland Revenue’s receipt of the relevant return. 39 The GST-registered person must be notified within 15 working days if Inland Revenue intends to investigate the return and withhold payment. Inland Revenue is not precluded from investigating a return after the 15-working day period – subject to the four-year time bar. 40 5.26 A working-day rule is used as it overcomes problems associated with public holidays that can occur using a test that is generally referenced to calendar days. 39 It is at the Commissioner’s discretion whether refunds may be used to offset other tax debts. 40 See section 108A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 28 5.27 Imposing a statutory timeframe for the payment of refunds is common international practice, with the average timeframe being 30 calendar days. 41 Longer periods are also not uncommon. 42 These timeframes are important as they give GST-registered persons the confidence that returns will be processed promptly. 5.28 Following the Seahunter cases 43 notice must be received by the GST- registered person within 15 working days. Inland Revenue’s policy is therefore that notices informing GST-registered persons that it is not satisfied with a return must be issued before the end of 10 working days from the date the relevant return is received. This means Inland Revenue now has less time than originally intended to be satisfied about the correctness of any GST return. 5.29 Timeframes that are too tight may provide Inland Revenue with insufficient time to respond to transactions that could affect the integrity of the tax base. 5.30 Given the need to ensure that notice is received by GST-registered persons in the statutory period, extending the period to 20 working days may be appropriate. This would allow Inland Revenue more time to investigate and to be satisfied with the payment of refunds in order to meet its tax administration obligations. Twenty working days is also broadly consistent with international norms. 5.31 We recognise that this approach could be perceived as having an effect on the carrying cost of GST for exporters. Any extension to the timeframe determining when refunds are released should not, however, affect the processing of the vast majority of GST-returns and should not preclude Inland Revenue from continuing to enhance its processes and systems to allow the earlier release of refunds. Current response periods, particularly those applicable to exporters, should be improved over time. On the other hand, GST-registered persons that have a documented history of non- compliance (including significant outstanding debt) are likely to experience delays if Inland Revenue considers a GST-return warrants greater scrutiny. Specific point for consultation What concerns would you have if Inland Revenue had 20 working days to notify that it intends to investigate a GST return and withhold payment and applied this in limited cases where there are possible tax base risks? 41 VAT refunds: A review of country experience, International Monetary Fund WP/05/218, November 2005, G Harrison and R Krelove. 42 For example, the French value added tax system provides a 90-day timeframe. An administrative performance standard that reduces the time to 30 days applies. 43 See Seahunter Fishing Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (2001) 20 NZTC 17,206 and Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Seahunter Fishing Limited (2002) 20 NZTC 17,478. 29 Chapter 6 ACCOUNTING FOR GST AND TIMING MISMATCHES 6.1 Chapter 2 broadly described the range of accounting bases that are available to GST-registered persons. These bases determine when registered persons are required to account for output tax and when they are entitled to deduct input tax. This chapter considers the effect of those choices and the opportunities they present in creating what we refer to as “timing mismatches” between GST-registered persons. 6.2 It also considers two options that would reduce these timing mismatches: • limiting the choice of accounting bases; and • strengthening the application of existing anti-avoidance measures. Timing mismatches 6.3 The consequences to the revenue base of providing a choice of accounting bases and, to a lesser degree, taxable periods has been well documented by the New Zealand courts, tax practitioners and the government. 44 What we refer to as “timing mismatches” involves a GST-registered person who accounts for GST using the payments basis making a supply to a GST- registered person who accounts for GST using the invoice basis. The payment basis supplier provides the invoice basis purchaser with a tax invoice. The purchaser claims an input tax deduction following receipt of the tax invoice, but payment of GST is deferred. In some cases, payment may be deliberately deferred for a significant period of time or even indefinitely. 6.4 In cases when the timing difference created by the arrangement is clearly inconsistent with the policy intent of the GST Act, the general anti-avoidance provision has been successfully applied. 45 Questions remain, however, about the long-term desirability of using the general anti-avoidance provision for this purpose and whether policy changes that would have more certain application are required. Several tax commentators have noted that the outcomes created by general anti-avoidance provisions have the potential to create uncertainty. 46 Uncertainty is unhelpful in promoting voluntary compliance. 44 See the Court of Appeal decision Shell New Zealand Holdings Co Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1993) 13 NZTC 10,136; “Dilemmas for GST tax policy designers – land transactions” G Harley, published in GST in retrospect and prospect, 2007 pp. 232 to 233; and GST: A review, New Zealand Government March 1999, pp. 65 to 66. 45 Ibid footnote 5 and see section 76. 46 See “Dilemmas for GST tax policy designers – land transactions”, G Harley, published in GST in retrospect and prospect, 2007, and “The role for a general anti-avoidance rule in a GST”, E Trombitas, published in GST in retrospective and prospect, 2007. 30 6.5 A more fundamental approach to business neutrality may therefore be required, with solutions not necessarily limited to transactions involving the supply of specific goods and services such as “going concerns”, extremely high value transactions and land, as discussed in Chapter 4. 6.6 One possible response to the problems presented by deliberate timing mismatches would be to move to a single compulsory basis of accounting for GST, coupled with a single taxable period. However, this could give rise to significant revenue losses for the government as well as increased compliance costs for taxpayers. It is possible that a combination of proposals in this paper will strike an adequate balance between tax base risks, revenue costs and compliance costs. Accordingly, the potential single accounting basis, single taxable period approach is not being explored further at this time. Submissions are, however, welcome on the issue. 6.7 Assuming the current position is retained whereby businesses are free to make their own decisions about the accounting bases and taxable periods that best suit them (within the confines of the GST Act), we have suggested other measures that could minimise the revenue risks connected with timing mismatches. 6.8 The relative advantages and disadvantages of the accounting bases permitted under the GST Act are discussed next. Policy objectives of the accounting bases 6.9 Day-to-day accounting for GST depends on the size of the GST-registered person and whether it is a retailer, a service provider, manufacturer, distributor, importer or exporter. Accounting practices may also vary depending on whether the GST-registered person is a non-profit body, a public sector organisation or a private enterprise. 6.10 The GST Act currently caters for these differences by allowing for a variety of accounting bases and filing frequencies, including a grace period before payment is required. The invoice basis 6.11 Of the three accounting bases allowed by the GST Act, the invoice basis is most closely aligned with the principle that GST should apply, and a deduction correspondingly be allowed, when the economic benefits of the goods and services have been transferred from the supplier to the recipient. The invoice basis reflects not only a GST-registered person’s present GST obligations and entitlements but also future GST commitments and benefits. 6.12 The basis is consistent with the rules that apply to businesses for the purposes of complying with income tax and with any external financial reporting requirements and assumptions. This means large businesses do not need to maintain dual accounting systems – one for GST and one for general accounting purpose. 31 6.13 The benefits of the invoice basis are also apparent for businesses that rely on the prompt recognition of input tax deductions, such as importers, who may be permitted by the New Zealand Customs Service to defer the payment of GST levied on imported goods, and exporters. The payments basis 6.14 Although the invoice basis recognises the economic consequences of transactions, for some businesses it can increase the carrying cost of GST, particularly when GST liabilities have to be recognised well in advance of the related payment being received. This earlier obligation to account for GST can present a problem if the regular terms of trade provide for a period of credit that is longer than the GST payment date. 6.15 This concern was recognised in 1986 by the Advisory Panel on Goods and Services Tax, which noted that dairy farmers, builders and non-profit bodies would be at a financial disadvantage if the obligation to pay GST to Inland Revenue was triggered by an invoice when payment from the customer was not immediately forthcoming. 47 The solution to this problem was the payments accounting basis, which allows GST-registered persons to account for GST on the basis of cash receipts and cash payments. 6.16 Apart from addressing the potential cashflow effects, the payments basis dispenses with the need to maintain debtors’ or creditors’ ledgers to complete the calculation of “tax payable” at the end of each taxable period. 6.17 Aligned to this, the payments basis is also the simplest basis for determining the time of supply for certain transactions such as agreements to hire and supplies that provide for periodic payment. The benefits offered by the payments basis in reducing the carrying cost of GST would be enhanced if the time of supply rules were replaced by using payment as a means of determining when supplies should be recognised in a taxable period. Special rules would in that case need to be retained for associated persons and other special transactions, such as gaming and gambling. 6.18 The main criticism of the payments basis is that it is less accurate than accrual accounting in measuring the majority of transactions that come within the GST Act. This concern is, in part, overcome by the GST Act requiring GST-registered persons to file more frequently than they do for income tax. The hybrid basis 6.19 In 1991, a further accounting basis was added to the GST Act, giving GST- registered persons the option of not maintaining a creditors’ ledger to complete their GST return. 48 47 Report of the Advisory Panel on Goods and Services Tax to the Minister of Finance, June 1985, pp. 12 to 13. 48 The change was implemented following the recommendations of the Tax Simplification Consultative Committee in its report, Tax simplification report of the Consultative Committee, July 1990. 32 6.20 The advantage of the hybrid basis is that it can approximate the accounting practice of some businesses whereby income is recognised at the time a transaction occurs and expenses are recorded when they are paid. The basis does, however, have the potential to increase the carrying cost of GST as it defers the recognition of input tax deductions until payment is made but brings output tax into account at the earlier time at which an invoice is issued or payment is received. Taxable periods 6.21 Taxable periods establish the frequency with which GST-registered persons are required to file GST returns. They are based on competing objectives that seek to minimise the effect of GST on working capital and balance compliance and administration costs. 6.22 Shorter return periods help to reduce the effect that GST has on businesses – for example, the need to find cash to settle GST liabilities or, in the case of refunds, minimise the carrying cost of GST. For this reason, filing monthly GST returns is a popular option for exporters and is a requirement for businesses with annual taxable supplies of $24 million or more. 49 6.23 Shorter return periods, however, increase compliance and administration costs because of the requirement to complete GST returns more often. For example, requiring all GST-registered persons to file GST returns every month would increase the annual number of GST returns from three million to nearly seven million. For GST-registered persons who are involved in seasonal activities or whose pattern of invoicing is intermittent, the requirement to file monthly returns would result in the completion of a large number of unnecessary nil returns. The option to file on a six-monthly frequency therefore reduces the need for unnecessary returns. 6.24 Longer return periods affect the government’s collection of revenue and pose a greater risk that GST will not be returned. For this reason, the six-monthly basis is generally limited to businesses whose activities are small-scale and involve annual taxable supplies of $250,000 or less. 50 Options being considered 6.25 As we have noted, using the accounting base options to create deliberate timing mismatches can have a detrimental effect on the tax base. Because GST applies to the gross value of transactions, non-compliance can also have a material effect on the competitiveness and profitability of those that do comply. We now outline some further options, beyond those outlined in Chapter 4 and 5, for dealing with these concerns. 49 See section 15(4). 50 The government is proposing to raise this threshold from $250,000 to $500,000. See Reducing tax compliance costs for small and medium-sized enterprises, New Zealand Government, December 2007, pp. 14 and 15. 33 Limiting the choice of accounting bases 6.26 One option that we have considered but do not favour is to make one of the three bases of accounting compulsory for all GST-registered persons. This option has the benefit of reducing deliberate timing mismatches, but it is not obvious that any single basis would suit the majority of GST-registered persons. For example, while the payments basis is widely used, with about 79 percent of all GST-registered persons electing to use it, larger businesses, which contribute a substantial portion of GST to the revenue base, as well as exporters, are likely to have a strong preference for the invoice basis. Ultimately, the strong preferences exhibited by GST-registered persons at either end of the business spectrum suggest that such a change would not be workable. 6.27 As an alternative, access to certain accounting bases could be restricted – for example, GST-registered persons with annual taxable supplies below a specified threshold could be required to account for GST using the payments basis. 6.28 We have not in this paper suggested any particular threshold because, at this stage, we are more interested in submissions on the idea in principle rather than the precise spectrum of taxpayers to which it could apply. We recognise that under any compulsory threshold level, however, exclusions would be needed for exporters and other GST-registered persons whose input tax deductions regularly exceed output tax. Exclusions would also need to be considered to preserve the operation of the GST grouping rules. 51 This may make the option unduly complex relative to the problem we are aiming to solve. 6.29 On the other hand, applying the payments basis to a wider range of businesses might reduce compliance costs for a number of GST-registered persons because businesses under the threshold would not have to complete accrual accounting adjustments for debtors and creditors for each taxable period. 6.30 If the change were made, affected GST-registered persons that did not wish to use the payments basis would still have the option of using the hybrid basis. Specific points for consultation – limiting the choice of accounting bases • If limitations were placed on who could account for GST using the invoice basis, what should those limitations look like? • In the context of these limitations, what special rules would be required for exporters and other business for whom input tax regularly exceeds output tax? 51 See section 55. 34 Strengthening the application of section 19D 6.31 A further option is to maintain the current choice of accounting bases but review the application of the specific anti-avoidance provisions, section 19D. Section 19D preserves the current options for accounting but seeks to restrain taxpayer choice when the application of the GST accounting principles could give rise to base maintenance risks. Specifically, section 19D requires GST- registered persons accounting for GST using the payments basis to use hybrid accounting principles when high-value transactions are involved. These are prescribed as being when the consideration payable for a supply of goods and services is $225,000 (including GST) or more and payment by the customer is deferred under the agreement for more than one year. By being quite prescriptive, the application of the section is limited. 6.32 Possible options for improving the application of section 19D include: • lowering the threshold when the section becomes effective – for example, from $225,000 to a lesser amount, say $90,000, and when payment is to be deferred for more than one year; or • altering the section so that it instead affects the rules governing the recognition of input tax deductions. Under this option, input tax deductions would be limited to one-ninth of the payments made by the recipient. The section would apply to transactions that exceeded $225,000 (or $90,000) and would continue to be limited to situations when the contract deferred payment for more than one year. 6.33 An increase in the current payments basis threshold – possibly to $2 million – would accompany any change to the application of section 19D. Increasing the payments basis threshold is discussed in more detail in Chapter 7. Specific point for consultation – strengthen the application of section 19D If section 19D were to be changed, which option do you prefer and why? 35 Chapter 7 THE PAYMENTS BASIS THRESHOLD 7.1 Chapter 6 introduced the possibility of what would in effect be a compulsory payments basis threshold for addressing GST base maintenance concerns. On the basis that significant tax base risk reductions will occur through the adoption of some of the other suggestions (such as the domestic reverse charge mechanism) outlined in this paper, this chapter considers whether changes to the payments basis threshold on the current non-compulsory basis should also be made. The payments basis 7.2 The operation of the payments basis was briefly detailed in Chapter 2 (see Table 1) and the policy reasons for its inclusion in the GST system set out in Chapter 6. 7.3 Briefly, the payments basis permits a GST-registered person to recognise a GST liability on the supply of goods and services when payment is received from the customer. Similarly, a registered person accounting for GST on the payments basis is allowed an input tax deduction on its purchases only when the registered person makes payment. 7.4 Generally, a GST-registered person may account for GST on a payments basis if, during any 12-month period, the total value of its taxable supplies does not exceed $1.3 million or it is a non-profit body. 52 Provision is also made for certain local authorities to account for GST using the payments basis. 53 7.5 The payments basis threshold was raised from $1 million to $1.3 million in 2000 to reflect movements in purchasing power since 1990 (when the threshold was last reviewed). 54 The increase to $1.3 million also included an amount for expected inflation to 2007. It is therefore timely that the current threshold be reviewed to ensure that it continues to meets its policy objectives. 52 See section 19A. 53 See the Goods and Services Tax (Local Authorities Accounting on Payments Basis) Order 2005. 54 Before 1990 the threshold was $500,000. 36 Base maintenance and increases to the payments basis threshold 7.6 One of the key concerns associated with increasing access to the payments basis threshold is base maintenance – as illustrated in the Ch’elle cases. 55 The absence of proposals dealing with the payments basis in the discussion document Reducing tax compliance costs for small and medium-sized enterprises 56 largely resulted from this concern. The simplification discussion document anticipated the completion of further policy work, which now forms the basis of this paper. 7.7 If the tax base concerns are addressed by the measures outlined in the previous chapters, there is little reason why access to the payments basis should not be offered to a greater number of GST-registered persons. (This would not of course be a logical consequence of our suggestion in chapter 6 to limit access to the invoice basis.) 7.8 The clear objective of extending the payments basis as an option to GST- registered persons would be to reduce compliance costs. Being optional, the extension would allow taxpayers greater flexibility to use an accounting base that best met their business needs. 7.9 The current threshold allows about 93 percent of GST-registered businesses to use the payments basis of accounting. Raising the threshold to $2 million would cover about 96 percent of GST-registered businesses. This coverage is consistent with the definition of “small to medium-sized enterprises” used by the Ministry of Economic Development. 57 7.10 The increase in the threshold will also help eliminate the costs associated with being forced to change the accounting basis to either the invoice or hybrid base in the taxable period immediately after reaching the threshold. Ongoing threshold increases would facilitate this further. 7.11 Ongoing increases will, however, need to be considered against the potential success of the options discussed in this paper and would also be subject to their fiscal sustainability. Specific point for consultation What benefits (or costs) would result if the current limitations on using the payments basis of accounting were adjusted? 55 Ibid footnote 5. 56 New Zealand government, December 2007. 57 See SMEs in New Zealand: Structure and Dynamics Ministry of Economic Development, July 2007. 37 Chapter 8 CHANGE-IN-USE ADJUSTMENTS 8.1 GST-registered persons may claim an input tax deduction for GST paid on goods and services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. 8.2 In some cases, goods and services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies may be used partly or entirely for another purpose, such as for private and exempt purposes (non-taxable purposes). 8.3 The GST Act treats the non-taxable use of goods and services as a taxable supply by the registered person, and output tax is charged accordingly. In this way, goods and services that are “self-supplied” are treated in the same manner as other supplies. 8.4 Conversely, goods and services acquired principally for a non-taxable purpose (for which the GST-registered person is not entitled to an input tax deduction) may be partly or entirely used to make taxable supplies. In these circumstances, the GST Act allows a deduction to reflect that taxable use. 8.5 New Zealand’s approach to change-in-use adjustments is based on the principle that GST needs to reflect the consumption of goods or services in a given period. The change-in-use rules therefore apply to those that make a mixture of taxable and exempt supplies – such as financial service providers and some property developers. The change-in-use rules also ensure that private use is taxed. For example, a luxury yacht used in a chartering business but also used privately is subject to the GST change-in-use rules to ensure that the parity of treatment exists with a similar yacht purchased and used exclusively for private purposes. 8.6 New Zealand’s adjustment approach is unique among countries with GST or VAT systems. Other countries adopt an apportionment approach to mixed use. The apportionment approach is not aimed at taxing consumption, but simply seeks to apportion the initial input tax deductions received by GST- registered persons for goods and services according to their actual use. Depending on how the adjustment or apportionment process is undertaken, the result of the two approaches is usually similar. However, there are some specific differences. 8.7 In this chapter we review the treatment of changes-in-use in New Zealand, comparing New Zealand’s rules with Australia’s, and suggest some changes to improve and clarify our rules. We also compare the change-in-use adjustment rules with the second-hand goods input tax deduction and suggest some changes in this area. 38 Overview of New Zealand’s change-in-use rules 8.8 New Zealand’s change-in-use adjustment rules are summarised in Table 3. TABLE 3: T HE CHANGE-IN-USE FRAMEWORK Test Input tax that can be claimed Adjustment required? Timing of any adjustment The goods and services are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. 100% of the GST paid may be deducted. Yes, if the goods and services are applied for a purpose of making supplies of non-taxable goods and services. At any one of the following times: – period-by-period – annually – one-off. The goods and services are not acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. No deduction is available. Yes, if the goods and services are applied for a purpose of making taxable supplies of goods and services. At any one of the following times: – period-by-period – annually – one-off if less than $18,000 or Inland Revenue agrees. Timing of change-in-use adjustments Changes from taxable to non-taxable use 8.9 The GST Act allows three timeframes for returning output tax when goods and services acquired principally for making taxable supplies are used for non-taxable purposes: • Periodic adjustments – output tax is imposed in every taxable period in which the goods and services are used in making non-taxable supplies. • Annual adjustments – output tax is imposed in every 12-month period in which goods and services are used in making non-taxable supplies. • A one-off adjustment – output tax is imposed once on the non-taxable use of the goods and services. Example: Adjustment frequency A motor vehicle purchased for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies is subsequently used (49 percent of the time) for private purposes. The cost of the vehicle was $20,000 and the depreciation rate is 21 percent. The adjustments required for the deemed supplies under each of the above methods are: (1) One-off adjustment: $20,000 x 49% = $9,800; $9,800 / 9 = $1,088 one-off GST payment. 39 (2) Periodic – for example, each two-monthly taxable period: ($20,000 x 21%) / 6 = $700 – depreciation value each taxable period; $700 x 49% = $343 – non-taxable portion of depreciation; $343 / 9 = $38.1 – two-monthly GST payment. (3) Annual: ($20,000 x 21% x 49%) / 9 = $229 annual GST payment. Changes from non-taxable to taxable use 8.10 In common with changes from taxable to non-taxable use, adjustments for changes from non-taxable to taxable use may be made on a period-by-period, annual or one-off basis. The one-off basis is, however, available only for goods and services that cost up to $18,000, or above that amount with Inland Revenue’s agreement. Calculating the value of the asset to be adjusted 8.11 Adjustments are calculated by treating goods or services as having been supplied to the extent that they are not used for taxable purposes (output tax adjustments) or are used for taxable purposes (input tax adjustments). Therefore, the value of the goods or services has to be determined. The GST Act stipulates that the value may be calculated on the basis of the cost or the market value of the goods or services – whichever value is lower. 8.12 For period-by-period adjustments, depreciation is generally used to approximate the value (based on the lower value of cost or market) of the change in use of the goods and services over the adjustment period. Allocation between taxable and non-taxable supplies 8.13 The GST Act provides for three methods of allocating input tax deductions between taxable and non-taxable supplies: • actual use; • turnover method; and • an alternative (or special) method. 8.14 In each case, the method of allocation used must result in a fair and reasonable allocation of input tax between taxable and other supplies. 58 58 See section 21A(3). 40 8.15 In certain circumstances, goods and services may be simultaneously used for taxable and non-taxable purposes. In Lundy Family Trust, 59 for example, the buildings and the land were simultaneously rented out (an exempt purpose) and available for sale (a taxable purpose). Therefore, the Court of Appeal considered that the properties were used 100 percent for taxable purposes and 100 percent for non-taxable purposes. The Court directed that a 50/50 apportionment of the depreciation on the building was appropriate. Adjustment approaches used in other countries 8.16 The apportionment approach used in other countries requires any non-taxable use to be reflected in the apportionment of the initial input tax deduction when the goods or services are acquired. Subsequent adjustments are made, as necessary, to reflect the actual use of the goods and services. 8.17 The apportionment approach looks backward and attempts to put GST- registered persons in the position where they would have been had they correctly predicted the extent to which they would use the goods and services for taxable and non-taxable purposes at the time they acquired them. Different countries adopt different variations of the apportionment approach. Apportionment rules were considered by the government in 1999 60 but were thought to have certain disadvantages, including: • the difficulty for GST-registered persons in predicting future use; • the complex treatment of apportioned goods and services on disposal; and • the fact that the apportionment approach did not adhere to the GST principle that GST should be a tax on consumption. 8.18 At that time it was agreed that there should be a further review of the change- in-use rules, and this is outlined in this chapter. 8.19 In July 2000, Australia introduced a GST tax system that includes a set of comprehensive rules using the apportionment approach. In Australia, the amount of the input tax deduction that a GST-registered person receives depends on the extent to which the acquisition or importation is for a taxable purpose. 61 Following the initial apportionment of input tax, the person may need to make subsequent input tax adjustments when there is a difference between the actual use and the planned use of the goods and services for a taxable purpose. 59 (2005) 22 NZTC 19, 637. 60 See GST: A Review, A government discussion document, March 1999, pp. 28 to 29. 61 See GSTR 2006/4 Goods and services tax: determining the extent of creditable purpose for claiming input tax credits and for making adjustments for changes in extent of creditable purpose, Australian Tax Office. 41 8.20 It might appear that the apportionment approach is conceptually simpler than the adjustment approach because it is based on the initial input tax deduction and cost of the goods and services that are being adjusted. This approach has its advantages, including being able to use a single valuation measure when making any adjustment. 8.21 However, making input tax adjustments under the apportionment method may not be as simple in practice. In Australia, in order to accurately calculate an entitlement to deduct input tax, a taxpayer must ascertain the extent to which the asset has been applied for a taxable purpose, from the time of acquisition until the end of the relevant adjustment period. These calculations may become progressively complicated with every subsequent adjustment for a particular asset and any ultimate sale or disposition of the assets. This complication, and the fact that GST-registered persons have to keep continuous records of the use of their assets from the date of acquisition (which is also a requirement under the New Zealand approach), may make adjustments under the apportionment approach compliance intensive. 8.22 For these reasons, we do not consider that the benefits of the apportionment approach outweigh the disadvantages. We do consider, however, that some of the elements of the apportionment approach can be used to improve the New Zealand approach. Problems with New Zealand’s adjustment approach 8.23 We have identified a number of concerns with New Zealand’s change-in-use adjustment rules. Some of these arise from the legislation itself. Additional concerns were highlighted in the decision of the Court of Appeal in Lundy Family Trust, 62 and it is useful to review whether aspects of that decision achieve the desired policy outcome. With this in mind, some potential problem areas are discussed below. The maximum amount of adjustments 8.24 Since adjustments may be made on the period-by-period or annual basis for an indefinite period, it is possible that the value of adjustments could accumulate to more than the original GST paid on the purchase of the property. 8.25 The Court of Appeal in Lundy Family Trust 63 has effectively rejected this possibility and suggested capping the maximum amount of the adjustments to the original amount of GST paid. Greater certainty is needed to deal with possible ambiguities in the legislation in this area. 62 Ibid footnote 59. 63 Ibid footnote 59. 42 Adjustments do not necessarily refer to the initial input tax deduction 8.26 As with the previous issue, the change-in-use adjustment approach may ignore the original input tax deduction claimed by the GST-registered person. Change-in-use adjustments may not relate to the amount of the initial input tax deduction, as the purchase of goods and services and their use for a non- principal purpose are treated as, in effect, separate supplies. Accordingly, the rules are intended to measure the current consumption of the goods and services. 8.27 Determining an open market value for every adjustment period could be quite compliance-intensive. For this reason, the GST Act allows GST-registered persons to use either the cost or market value of the goods or services, whichever is lower. 8.28 If it is accepted that the adjustment should make reference to the original deduction claimed, as occurs in the apportionment approach, the question of whether there should be a choice of valuation methods should be reviewed. Treatment of adjustments on return to the original taxable purpose 8.29 The Court of Appeal in Lundy Family Trust 64 held that when a GST- registered person who has been making output tax adjustments to reflect non- taxable use changes the use of the asset back to making taxable supplies, the GST-registered person may claim back any output tax adjustments that they paid. 8.30 The outcome of this decision is that the benefit that the registered person has received from the consumption of the goods or services for non-taxable purposes is ultimately disregarded. This outcome is generally inconsistent with the adjustment framework, which is based on taxing any non-taxable use of the goods and services in question at any point in time. One-off output tax adjustments 8.31 The GST Act requires a GST-registered person to base the timing of output tax adjustments on a period-by-period, annual or one-off basis. 8.32 Although a registered person may currently choose which of the three bases for adjustment to use, there may be circumstances when only the one-off adjustments basis may be suitable, such as when there is total change of use of the goods or services. 8.33 Currently, one-off output tax adjustments can be valued on the basis of the lower of cost or market value and are not limited to total changes in use. This may provide opportunities to reduce the amount of the adjustment. Since the adjustment effectively reflects that the asset is leaving the GST base (just as it would if the asset was sold), the choice of valuation method available to GST-registered persons should be reviewed. 64 Ibid footnote 59. 43 Suggested changes 8.34 The options below, which share some of the advantages of the apportionment approach, may deal with some of the uncertainty when using the change-in- use adjustment rules. We favour retaining the change-in-use adjustments approach, with some modifications to provide a closer link between the adjustments, initial input tax deductions and the cost of goods to the taxpayer. Recognising earlier output tax adjustments for appreciating goods and services 8.35 When GST was introduced the intention was that a GST-registered person’s output tax adjustments would be made for as long as the goods or services remain a part of its business activity, to reflect the consumption that occurs in each period. This principle was not accepted by the Court of Appeal in the Lundy Family Trust decision. 65 8.36 We agree with the outcome determined by the Court of Appeal because of the cashflow disadvantage that arises if market value is taxed before disposition to a third party. However, we are concerned that the legislation could be interpreted in a number of ways. Therefore, it is suggested that the legislation be modified in line with the Lundy Family Trust decision by capping the output tax adjustments to the amount of the original input tax deduction received by the registered person. 8.37 The cap would apply on the realisation of the asset only. 66 That would ensure that the goal of taxing consumption is achieved for as long as a person keeps a business asset in the tax base and uses it for non-taxable purposes. If the asset is realised and taken out of the GST base the GST-registered person will be able to use any adjustments paid in excess of the cap as a deduction in the calculation of “tax payable”. 8.38 Allowing registered persons to cap their output tax adjustments should provide them with certainty on their final liability for adjustments (if they choose to realise the asset). 8.39 Our suggestion to cap periodic output tax adjustments would not change the obligation to pay output tax on disposal of the asset. Valuation of supplies 8.40 In the case of goods and services that are consumed over a number of taxable periods or years, output tax adjustments are frequently made on the cost basis, by using depreciation as a measure of the use of those goods and services over the relevant period. While depreciation may not be a precise estimation of the actual consumption of an asset, it is a verifiable and reliable method to approximate the value of a consumed asset. In that regard, using the cost basis for valuing assets subject to periodic adjustments is less compliance-intensive than using the market value basis, under which the taxpayer must find the market price of the asset at the time of the adjustment. 65 Ibid footnote 59. 66 A one-off output tax adjustment for the whole of the asset would be treated as the realisation of an asset. 44 8.41 Therefore it is suggested that all valuations for the purposes of periodic output tax adjustments should be made using the cost basis. Requiring businesses to value goods and services on the cost basis should remove any uncertainty for them over what valuation method to use, and links the valuation method for change-in-use adjustments with the initial input tax received. Refunding output tax adjustments on return to the taxable purpose 8.42 In the Lundy Family Trust 67 decision, the Court of Appeal held that when a GST-registered person who has been making output tax adjustments changes the use of the asset back to the taxable purpose, the registered person may claim back any output tax adjustments that it paid. 8.43 This outcome seems inconsistent with the objective of taxing consumption, as it appears to treat the exempt or non-taxable supplies as having no value for GST purposes. We suggest that output tax adjustments paid in earlier taxable periods be treated as not refundable and that, if submissions consider it necessary, a clarifying legislative amendment be made. One-off output tax adjustments in relation to low-value mixed use assets 8.44 The purpose of the threshold is to remove the need to make compliance costly periodic adjustments when tax arising from adjustments would be relatively small. A threshold of $20,000 is suggested, to remove most consumable assets such as computers, office equipment and low-value cars from the need for regular adjustment. 8.45 The calculations required by the change-in-use rules impose compliance costs for, at times, very low amounts of revenue. For this reason, we suggest retaining the option of allowing registered persons to make one-off adjustments for low-value assets. One-off output tax adjustments in relation to total change-in-use 8.46 If a GST-registered person partly uses an asset that was acquired for a taxable purpose for a non-taxable purpose, the asset still forms part of the business activity of the registered person, and it is appropriate that periodic adjustments are made (either in each taxable period or annually). The situation is different when an asset acquired for a taxable purpose is used exclusively for a non-taxable purpose. In the latter situation, the asset stops being used in the registered person’s taxable activity and is, in effect, removed from the tax base. 8.47 To reflect this, GST-registered persons should be required to make one-off output tax adjustments when there is a total change-in-use of the goods or services. 67 Ibid footnote 59. 45 Valuation basis for one-off output tax adjustments 8.48 When a business deregisters, its assets are valued at market value. This treatment ensures that the output tax liability reflects the value that has been added by the registered person. It also ensures that supplies made by GST- registered persons to themselves are treated in an equivalent way to those made to another person. 8.49 In contrast, taxpayers may choose to value one-off output tax adjustments at the lesser of the cost of the goods or services or the open market value of the supply. In the case of a total change-in-use, however, the asset is removed from the tax base and an equivalence in treatment with a sale of the asset or business deregistration is warranted. 8.50 We therefore suggest that GST-registered persons should be required to value the goods and services entirely applied for non-taxable purposes at their market value. As we have noted, goods and services with a value of less than $20,000 could still be valued at the lower of cost or market value. One-off output tax adjustments and adjustment capping 8.51 We consider that if an asset that is subject to a one-off output tax adjustment for a total change-in-use is treated similarly to an asset that is realised in some other way, any previous periodic output tax adjustments in relation to that asset should be subject to the input tax deduction cap. This means that if a registered person has made periodic output tax adjustments in excess of the initial input tax deduction, the excess would be a deduction in the calculation of “tax payable”. The amount of the output tax received from the one-off adjustment on the total change-in-use of the asset, on the other hand, should be treated in the same manner as output tax received from the sale of the asset. Therefore this amount should not count for the purpose of calculating whether output tax adjustments exceeded the initial input tax deduction. Example: Making one-off output tax adjustments Alison purchased a building for use in her business and received an input tax deduction of $60,000. In subsequent years, she converted a part of the building to residential dwellings and rented them out. During that period, she made output tax adjustments on the exempt use of the building on a period-by-period basis, totalling $70,000. At the end of that period, she decides to use the asset 100 percent of the time for the purpose of providing residential accommodation. She makes a one-off output tax adjustment of $80,000, calculated on the basis of the market value of the asset. Since her periodic adjustments ($70,000) exceed the initial input tax credit ($60,000), Alison may use the excess amount ($10,000) as a deduction in the calculation of “tax payable”. Her final GST liability on the total change-in-use is therefore $70,000. Under the suggested rules, the same result would be achieved if, instead of a 100 percent change-in-use, Alison either sold the asset or deregistered her business. 46 Period-by-period and annual deduction (input tax) adjustments 8.52 For input tax deduction purposes, GST-registered persons will still be able to base their adjustments on the lower of the cost or market value. This divergence from the suggested valuation of periodic output tax adjustments (that is, the cost basis only) is necessary for practical reasons – registered persons may not have retained records of the original price of assets that were acquired for non-taxable purposes, and may not recall details of their acquisitions by the time the need for input tax adjustments arises. If the original price of an asset is not known, GST-registered persons will be able to calculate adjustments by reference to their market value. 8.53 On the other hand, consistent with the suggested change to the output tax adjustment rules, however, input tax adjustments should also be capped. It is suggested that the amount of the cap should depend on the valuation method adopted by the GST-registered person so that: • if the registered person chooses the cost method of valuing an asset, the input tax adjustments should be capped at an amount equal to the input tax deduction that the person would have been eligible for if it had acquired the asset for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies; and • if the registered person decides to value the asset on a market value basis, the cap would be equal to the amount of the input tax deduction that the person would have received if it acquired the asset at market value at the time the first deduction by way of change-in-use adjustment is made. 8.54 In contrast to the suggested treatment of periodic output tax adjustments where a person would be required to make adjustments until the asset is realised, the GST-registered person making input tax adjustments would be required to stop making input tax adjustments when the cap is reached. 8.55 When a person is making input tax adjustments on a periodic basis without exceeding the cap, and subsequently is able to make a one-off adjustment in relation to a 100 percent change in use of the same asset, both the periodic adjustments and the one-off adjustment would count for the purpose of the cap. Specific points for consultation • Do the suggested rule changes outlined in this chapter improve the operation of the change-in-use rules? • Do the suggested changes provide enough certainty about the consequences of a change in use? 47 Relationship with the second-hand goods input tax deduction 8.56 GST-registered persons are allowed to deduct input tax in connection with the purchase of second-hand goods from unregistered persons, even though GST is not directly charged on that supply. This deduction is intended to recognise the GST paid when the unregistered supplier acquired the goods. Allowing deductions removes the potential for double taxation during the lifecycle of goods acquired by unregistered persons. Previously, one of the risks of the deduction was that it allowed some GST-registered persons (particularly in transactions involving associated persons) to claim large GST refunds in various circumstances, including for goods on which GST had not previously been paid – for example, when the goods had been acquired by the unregistered vendor before the introduction of GST. 8.57 The problem was dealt with in 2000 by limiting the input tax deduction available in relation to supplies of second-hand goods between associated parties to the lesser of: • the GST component (if any) of the original cost of the goods to the supplier; • one-ninth of the purchase price; or • one-ninth of the open market value. The problem Disparity in treatment of associated and non-associated persons 8.58 One criticism of the current rules in relation to the input tax deduction for second-hand goods is that there is a disparity between the treatment of associated and non-associated person transactions. A GST-registered person buying second-hand goods from an associated unregistered person receives no input tax deduction if GST has not been paid on the original cost. On the other hand, a registered person buying the same second-hand goods from a non-associated unregistered person would receive an input tax deduction based on one-ninth of the amount paid to acquire the goods. Using change-in-use adjustments to increase input tax deductions 8.59 As outlined earlier in this chapter, when goods and services are acquired by a registered person principally for a non-taxable purpose, the person is not entitled to an input tax deduction. If, however, the goods and services are later used in making taxable supplies, the GST Act allows the registered person to make input tax adjustments that would reflect that taxable use. 8.60 In contrast to the rules governing the second-hand goods deduction, which may require a taxpayer to calculate a deduction on the basis of the GST component in the original cost of the goods to the supplier, the change-in-use rules provide GST-registered persons with the option of using a cost or market valuation basis. 68 68 Section 21E of the GST Act. 48 8.61 These inconsistencies between the input tax treatment of second-hand goods and the change-in-use adjustment rules can result in unintended tax consequences and even in some cases distort the behaviour of GST-registered persons in certain transactions. Possible solutions 8.62 The following changes are suggested in response to these problems: • The rules for associated-party supplies of second-hand goods, should apply only in connection with transactions involving the purchase of land. To deal with consistency concerns in the treatment of purchases between associated and non-associated unregistered persons, we suggest that purchases of land from non-associated persons also be brought within the scope of the changes made in 2000. The reason for treating land differently from other types of goods is the relative ease with which a person can find the cost of the land to the original supplier from records and land deeds. Requiring taxpayers to find original costs for other types of goods and provide this information to the purchasers of those goods would be impractical. • For purchases of second-hand goods from unregistered persons (associated or un-associated) that do not involve land, the deduction available would be calculated on the basis of the lesser of the tax fraction of the purchase price of the goods or their open market value. • These changes will also be reflected in the rules that provide the deductions for changes in use. Thus, change-in-use adjustments for land would be based on the lesser of the original cost of the goods to the supplier, the tax fraction of the purchase price of the goods, or the tax fraction of the open market value of the supply of the goods. 8.63 If these suggestions were to be implemented, GST-registered persons would be treated equally whether buying second-hand goods from associated or non-associated unregistered persons. The changes would also deal with transactions involving land that make use of the change-in-use rules to obtain a more favourable tax treatment than that applicable to a deregistration or sale. Specific points for consultation • Do you agree that the treatment of second-hand goods acquired by associated and unassociated persons should be aligned in the manner suggested? • What are the costs or benefits connected with suggested changes? 49 Chapter 9 ACCOMMODATION 9.1 In October 2006, Inland Revenue released a draft interpretation statement about the exemption of GST for accommodation provided in a dwelling. 69 The draft statement set out the Commissioner’s preliminary, but considered, interpretation of the relevant provisions in the GST Act concerning the supply of accommodation in a “dwelling” or in a “commercial dwelling”. 9.2 Inland Revenue received a number of comprehensive submissions on the exposure draft, many of which requested that the policy underlying the GST treatment of accommodation be reviewed. 9.3 Most submissions were concerned that the current legislative framework did not give taxpayers enough certainty about when the supply of accommodation should be treated as a taxable or exempt supply. The correct treatment of small-scale or non-commercial activities involving the supply of accommodation was also raised in submissions. 9.4 As part of the normal consultation process, the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel has reconsidered the draft statement in light of the submissions received. In response to these submissions, officials have reviewed the policy underpinning the GST treatment of accommodation. This chapter suggests two options that would clarify the boundary between taxable and exempt supplies of accommodation. The treatment of small-scale or non- commercial accommodation is also discussed. 9.5 Work on the exposure draft is not being advanced for the present, to provide an opportunity for the options presented in this chapter to be developed. It is likely that the suggestions in this chapter, if implemented, will largely supersede the draft statement. Policy intent as reflected in the GST Act The boundary between taxable and exempt supplies of accommodation 9.6 When accommodation is supplied by a GST-registered person, the GST Act determines which supplies should be treated as exempt and which should be treated as taxable by using two definitions – “dwelling” and “commercial dwelling”. 69 IS0049 GST Exempt Supply: Supply of accommodation in a dwelling, released by Inland Revenue on 19 October 2006. 50 9.7 Accommodation provided by GST-registered persons is generally taxable unless it is expressly treated as an exempt supply. 70 Section 14 exempts the supply of accommodation in a dwelling. The exemption is reinforced by section 6(3), which removes from the definition of “taxable activity” any activity to the extent that it involves making exempt supplies. Persons engaged in activities that entirely involve making supplies of residential accommodation are unable to be registered for GST. 9.8 Accommodation of this nature was described in the White Paper as “residential rental accommodation” 71 and was not included in the GST base because of concerns if GST applied to rents, that it would give owner- occupiers of residential dwellings a tax preference over tenants who reside in rental properties. 9.9 The exemption for accommodation provided in a “dwelling” is determined by reference to the use of the dwelling and applies if the purpose of the accommodation is to provide a residence or abode to an individual. 9.10 “Short-term accommodation”, as described in the White Paper, on the other hand, is included in the GST base. That is, the services associated with providing short-term accommodation are taxable. This policy is encapsulated in the definition of “commercial dwelling”, and special provision is made if the accommodation exceeds four weeks by limiting the application of GST to goods and services that are ancillary to the provision of accommodation. Commercial dwellings 9.11 The GST Act defines the term “commercial dwelling” as: 72 “(a) Any hotel, motel, inn, hostel, or boardinghouse; or (b) Any camping ground; or (c) Any convalescent home, nursing home, rest home, or hospice; or (d) Any establishment similar to any of the kinds referred to in paragraphs (a) to (c) of this definition;— but does not include— (e) A hospital except to the extent that that hospital is a residential establishment: (f) A dwelling situated within a retirement village or within a rest home, where the consideration paid or payable for the supply of accommodation in that dwelling is for the right to occupy that dwelling:” 9.12 The supply of accommodation in a commercial dwelling is not exempt from GST predominantly because goods and services other than accommodation are likely to be provided. Operators of commercial dwellings are therefore treated in the same way as other businesses. 70 See section 14. 71 Ibid footnote 10, p. 36. 72 See section 2. 51 9.13 Long-term accommodation (accommodation that exceeds a period of four weeks) in a commercial dwelling is taxable, but the value of the supply is reduced. 73 The purpose of the valuation rule is to recognise that the supply of this type of accommodation could, in principle, be similar to the supply of residential rental accommodation. Therefore supplies of “domestic goods and services” 74 in these establishments, and defined as “the right to occupy” – including the supply of cleaning and maintenance, utilities and chattels – are taxed at up to 60 percent of the normal taxable value. 9.14 Operators of commercial dwellings therefore do not have to incur the otherwise substantial compliance costs associated with apportioning the taxable and potentially exempt components of providing long-term accommodation, but can still preserve their input tax entitlements. Problems with the current GST treatment of accommodation The taxable/exempt boundary 9.15 Following concerns raised in submissions in response to Inland Revenue’s exposure draft, we have reviewed the legislative framework governing the GST treatment of accommodation. The problem is how the GST Act should define the boundary between taxable and exempt accommodation so that the various policy objectives described in Chapter 1 can be met with as much clarity and certainty as possible. Small-scale or non-commercial activities involving the supply of short-term accommodation 9.16 We are also concerned that the current GST treatment of accommodation may be causing some taxpayers to GST-register activities that are of a minor nature, either because of uncertainty or because of the ability to deduct input tax. Providing an input tax deduction in connection with the private use of goods and services is inconsistent with the objective of taxing final consumption. Options being considered The taxable/exempt boundary 9.17 The current legislation governing the supply of accommodation could mean the application of GST is based on the functional nature of the premises in which the accommodation is provided, rather than on the intention of the supplier and the recipient in regard to the use of the property. 73 See section 10(6). 74 See section 2. 52 9.18 Consistent with the objective that GST applies to the widest range of goods and services supplied, the exemption for accommodation provided in a dwelling should be narrowly defined. The definition should apply only to situations where there is a reasonable level of substitutability between renting and owning a home. This substitutability is more appropriately based on the use of the accommodation rather than the functional nature of the premises. 9.19 In recent years, there have been observable changes in the way tourist accommodation is provided in New Zealand, including greater demand for “boutique” or luxury accommodation provided in stand-alone dwellings. This would again support a test based on the use rather than the function of the premises. In these situations, the use of the accommodation is generally short-term rather than residential rental accommodation. Excluding this accommodation from the GST base because of its function would affect the entitlement to input tax deductions and would be inconsistent with the principle of the GST system not being a direct fixed cost on business. 9.20 Two options are suggested to help define the taxable-exempt boundary for accommodation. These options start from the viewpoint that the accommodation is supplied as part of a taxable activity, unless the accommodation is expressly exempt. 75 9.21 Both options respond to changes in the way that tourist accommodation is currently provided in New Zealand. The options recognise that boutique or luxury accommodation provided in stand-alone dwellings competes against more traditional forms of commercial accommodation such as hotels, motels and camping grounds. Option 1 9.22 The first option would involve making relatively minor changes to the current terms “dwelling” and “commercial dwelling”. 9.23 The definition of “dwelling” could be revised so that it is defined by reference to the residential use of the accommodation instead of as a “place”. 9.24 The definition of “commercial dwelling” could also be amended by making specific reference to a greater range of premises in which short-term accommodation may be supplied (such as bed-and-breakfasts, serviced apartments and homestays or farmstays). This could be achieved by amending the list of premises included in the definition of “commercial dwelling” and inserting descriptive criteria to cover accommodation that is not expressly provided for in the list but is nevertheless short-term. 76 The problem with this type of schedular approach is that: • the policy objective can become obscured by the meaning or characteristics of the items listed in the definition; and 75 See section 14. 76 This would most likely involve retaining paragraph (d) of the definition but in a modified form. 53 • the list could start to become less relevant as a result of market-place changes, which could result in inappropriate omissions or inclusions in the GST base of certain supplies of accommodation. Option 2 9.25 A second option would involve replacing the current legislative framework with terms that are more descriptive of the normal use of the premises. For example, the term “commercial dwelling” would be replaced with the term “guest accommodation”. Accommodation provided in a hospice, rest home or similar – but not including a hospital or a dwelling in a retirement village – would be treated as “care accommodation”. The supply of “guest accommodation” and “care accommodation” would be taxable. 9.26 The treatment of long-term accommodation exceeding four weeks either as guest accommodation or care accommodation would broadly remain the same as it is currently under the term “commercial dwelling”. Long-term stays in hospitals (excluding those that form part of a “residential establishment”) would therefore continue to remain outside the scope of the reduced valuation rule. Hospitals have a different function from providing accommodation and would therefore be excluded. 9.27 “Guest accommodation” would be given its ordinary meaning and would broadly encompass situations when hospitality is extended to an individual. The term would imply that the provider of the accommodation has greater control over the use of the premises compared with a tenancy situation. Although “guest accommodation” will not be extensively defined in the GST Act, it would generally extend to accommodation in the types of premises currently included in the definition of “commercial dwelling”. 9.28 “Care accommodation” would include accommodation that is connected with the services provided within a hospice, rest home, convalescent or nursing home. Accommodation provided in a retirement village or complex would also be included, with the exception of the provision of residential rental accommodation in such a village or complex. 9.29 “Care accommodation” would also include any “residential establishment”. 77 Residential establishments are facilities that provide an established community for individuals to whom “domestic goods and services” are supplied. The current requirement that 70 percent or more of the individuals reside or are expected to reside for four weeks or more and receive “domestic goods and services” would be retained. 77 See section 2. 54 9.30 Exempt accommodation supplied to an individual would be described as “residential accommodation”, and would broadly follow the suggested change to the definition of “dwelling” described under option 1. The intention, however, would be to ensure consistency with the terminology suggested under option 2. 9.31 Table 4 illustrates the scope of the terms suggested under option 2. TABLE 4: S UGGESTED GST TREATMENT OF VARIOUS TYPES OF ACCOMMODATION Description Includes Application of section 10(6) Does not include Residential accommodation Any premises used predominantly as an abode or residence by an individual. N/A – supply is exempt from GST. Guest accommodation or care accommodation. Guest accommodation Accommodation provided to guests on any premises. Applies from the 1 st day after the fourth week of a continuous stay. Care accommodation. Care accommodation Accommodation provided in a convalescent home, nursing home, rest home, hospice or retirement complex and includes a “residential establishment”. Applies from the 1 st day after the fourth week of a continuous stay. A hospital not included in a “residential establishment” or guest accommodation. Residential rental accommodation supplied in a dwelling situated within such a facility, home or complex. Specific points for consultation – the taxable/exempt boundary • Do you agree that the rules governing the supply of accommodation need changing? • If so, which of the two options discussed do you prefer and why? • Are there alternative legislative solutions? If so, please describe these alternatives and explain why they are suitable. Small-scale and non-commercial activities involving short-term accommodation 9.32 The options described in this chapter may still result in some uncertainty about when activities involving the supply of accommodation should be treated as taxable supplies. This uncertainty could lead to decisions to register for GST to avoid the possibility of shortfall penalties and use-of- money interest when the activity is of a very small-scale nature or non- commercial. It could also lead to a greater number of GST registrations in order to obtain input tax deductions, and so doing, create the requirement to make regular and ongoing change-in-use adjustments for any private or non- taxable use. 55 9.33 For these reasons, we suggest excluding from the definition of “taxable activity” activities involving the supply of commercial accommodation (either in a “commercial dwelling” or as “guest accommodation”) to individuals when the taxable supply from these activities is less than a specified threshold – for example, $10,000 in any 12-month period (including the relevant current taxable period). Affected supplies would be treated as not being a “taxable activity” or an excluded part of a “taxable activity”. Submissions are invited on where the specified threshold is best set and whether there are any competition concerns associated with introducing an explicit threshold of this nature. The measure would not apply to care accommodation. 9.34 Table 5 illustrates the range of possible outcomes that could apply to businesses that supply accommodation when making the decision whether to register for GST under the options presented in this chapter. TABLE 5: D ECISION MATRIX FOR REGISTERING FOR GST Option 1 Option 2 Taxable supplies in any 12-month period Activity involves the supply of accommodation in a “commercial dwelling” Activity involves the supply of accommodation in a “dwelling” Activity involves the supply of “guest accommodation” Activity involves the supply of “care accommodation” Activity involves the supply of “residential accommodation” Over $40,000 Required to register for GST. Unable to register for GST. Required to register for GST. Required to register for GST. Unable to register for GST. Between $10,000 and $39,999 May voluntarily register for GST. Unable to register for GST. May voluntarily register for GST. May voluntarily register for GST. Unable to register for GST. Under $10,000 Unable to register for GST or required to deregister for GST. Unable to register for GST. Unable to register for GST or required to deregister for GST. May voluntarily register for GST. Unable to register for GST. 9.35 The suggested changes would not affect the income tax treatment of taxable income arising from accommodation-related activities. 9.36 Businesses that incur GST as part of developing an activity that involves or will involve the supply of commercial accommodation would still be able to register for GST and claim input tax deductions. However, the business would be required to deregister if, in a 12-month period, the turnover from that activity fell, or was likely to fall, below the specified threshold. Businesses required to deregister for GST under this suggestion would be required to return GST on the open-market value of any assets held at the time of deregistration. 56 9.37 If the supply of short-term accommodation is part of a wider taxable activity, only the short-term accommodation would be excluded from being part of a “taxable activity”. So, for example, a person who had a $9,000 turnover from renting out a holiday home and a $31,000 turnover from other business activities may have previously registered for GST in respect of both activities. Under the suggested measure the person would only need to choose whether or not to register in respect of the other business activities. Transitional rules 9.38 We are aware that the suggested changes in this chapter could result in GST being payable on unrealised assets. Consistent with the announcement by the Minister of Revenue in October 2006, when the Inland Revenue draft interpretation statement was released, we are considering legislative options that would seek to preserve the status quo for GST-registered persons who had registered for GST and claimed GST for expenses associated with the accommodation before final decisions are made by the government. 9.39 We invite submissions on the transitional rules that should be introduced to assist GST-registered persons who may be affected by the changes suggested in this chapter. Specific points for consultation – small-scale and non-commercial activities involving short-term accommodation • Do you agree that small-scale and non-commercial activities involving the supply of accommodation should be excluded from the definition of “taxable activity”? • Do you agree with the idea of a threshold for these activities, and if so, where do you think it should be set? • What transitional rules should be taken into account if small-scale and non- commercial activities are required to deregister as a result of this suggestion?

The National Interest Analysis for the treaty is appended to this report. EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 3 Appendix Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in respect of the Netherlands Antilles for the Exchange of Information with respect to Taxes Executive Summary 1 The purpose of the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in respect of the Netherlands Antilles for the Exchange of Information with respect to Taxes (“the TIEA”) is to enhance the ability of tax officials to detect and prevent tax avoidance and evasion. Specifically, it will enable New Zealand tax officials to request information from the Netherlands Antilles (such as tax records, business books and accounts, bank information, and ownership information). The Netherlands Antilles will be able to request similar information from New Zealand. The information will be used by tax officials of the requesting jurisdiction to ensure that the correct amount of tax is being paid by that jurisdiction's tax residents. The TIEA requires the Parties to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request. Date and nature of proposed binding treaty action 2 The TIEA was signed in Canberra on 1 March 2007. It is proposed that the TIEA enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and the Netherlands 1 (“the Parties”), in which each Party will notify the other of the completion of their respective domestic constitutional and legal procedures for the entry into force of the TIEA (Netherlands so notified New Zealand on 1 November 2007). The TIEA will enter into force on the date of the last (i.e. New Zealand's) notification, and its provisions will have effect from 1 January next following entry into force. In New Zealand, the domestic constitutional and legal procedures for entry into force comprise the successful completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process and incorporation of the TIEA into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. These procedures are expected to be completed in early 2008. 3 The Netherlands Antilles is about to undergo constitutional reform. Information now available indicates that the constitutional reforms will take effect on 15 December 2008. The Netherlands Antilles as an entity will then no longer exist. The islands of Curacao and St Maarten will become autonomous countries with the Netherlands responsible for their international relations, and the remaining islands of the Netherlands Antilles will become part of the Netherlands. It is understood that Curacao and St Maarten will take on the international obligations previously undertaken by the Netherlands Antilles. New Zealand's key concern in entering into the TIEA with the Netherlands Antilles was to extend information exchange arrangements to Curacao, which is a significant financial centre. 1 The Netherlands Antilles is an overseas territory of the Netherlands and as such does not have capacity to enter into this treaty independently. Accordingly, this treaty is between New Zealand and the Netherlands in respect of the Netherlands Antilles, hereafter referred to as being between New Zealand and the Netherlands Antilles EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 4 Bringing the TIEA into force with the Netherlands before the constitutional reforms will give New Zealand more certainty that the obligations in the Treaty will continue in respect of Curacao and St Maarten. Reasons for New Zealand taking the treaty action 4 To fully enforce their respective tax laws, and to better detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion, many countries (including New Zealand) are striving to build networks of treaties that authorise exchange of information on tax matters. In the absence of specific treaty authorisation, countries are typically constrained from assisting other states to enforce their tax laws. 5 The most common type of treaty which feature exchange of information provisions are double tax agreements (DTAs). New Zealand currently has 33 DTAs in force. However, DTAs are generally only concluded between trading and investment partners. To cater for other situations, the OECD, in 2002, produced a model agreement that provides solely for the exchange of information on tax matters. The TIEA with the Netherlands Antilles is New Zealand's first agreement to be negotiated on the basis of the 2002 OECD model. It represents a significant step forward for New Zealand in terms of extending its exchange of information arrangements beyond the DTA network. Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the treaty action 6 The TIEA will enable New Zealand tax officials to request information from the Netherlands Antilles (such as tax records, business books and accounts, bank information, and ownership information). Access to this previously unobtainab1e information will enhance the ability of the Inland Revenue Department to detect and prevent the avoidance or evasion of New Zealand tax. Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. 7 The TIEA is reciprocal in nature, meaning that the Netherlands Antilles is also able to request information from New Zealand. New Zealand is likely to raise more requests for information than the Netherlands Antilles but, to the extent that requests for information are received from the Netherlands Antilles, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in obtaining and providing the requested information. However, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand's existing 33 DTAs, and the administrative costs of responding to requests from the Netherlands Antilles are only expected to be marginal. In addition, the TIEA provides that “extraordinary costs” (such as the cost of hiring translators or interpreters) must be reimbursed by the requesting Party. 8 The TIEA provides a comprehensive set of rules to support the exchange of information. These rules are designed to ensure that requested information is provided in a timely and effective manner. Interference from bank secrecy and domestic tax interest rules is specifically prohibited as an obstacle to effective information exchange. Other rights and safeguards, however, which are secured to residents of either country by domestic law or administrative practice, remain in effect. For example, the Parties are required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request. Such information may only be disclosed to authorised persons and may only be used for specific EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 5 purposes (principally the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Party). 9 The TLEA closely follows the 2002 OECD model. There are some wording differences but, with one exception, these have non-substantive effect. The exception relates to the taxes covered by the agreement. The TJEA will only enable the Parties to request information in respect of income tax, 2 whereas the 2002 OECD model generally contemplates the exchange of information in respect of all taxes. Therefore, New Zealand will not be able to request information relating to, for example, a New Zealand goods and services tax assessment. This is not expected to be a significant disadvantage for New Zealand as the primary concern the TIEA addresses is avoidance or evasion of income tax. (Many of New Zealand's DTAs only permit exchange of information in relation to income tax.) 10 On balance, it is in New Zealand's interest to conclude a TIM with the Netherlands Antilles, and to do so prior to the constitutional reforms proposed for December 2008. Experience gained from the exchange of information arrangements already entered into under New Zealand's existing 33 DTAs indicates that the benefits arising from the enhanced ability to reduce tax avoidance and evasion outweigh the administrative costs incurred from having to respond to incoming requests. Obligations which would be imposed on New Zealand by the treaty action, the position of reservations to the treaty, and an outline of any dispute settlement mechanisms 11 The TIEA places a reciprocal obligation on each Party, upon request, to obtain and provide information that is forseeably relevant to the administration and enforcement of the taxes covered by the Agreement. 12 The obligation to obtain and provide information extends to all information in the possession or control of persons within that Party's jurisdiction. However, there is no obligation to provide information where: ∑ the requesting Party would not be able to obtain the information under its own laws; ∑ complying with the request would disclose a trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process (although bank secrecy and domestic tax interest rules receive no protection under this exception); ∑ the information is subject to legal professional privilege; ∑ disclosure of the information would be contrary to public policy; ∑ the information is requested in order to administer or enforce a discriminatory tax law. 2 For the Netherlands Antilles, the actual taxes specified am the income tax (inkomstenbelasting), the wages tax (loonbelasting), the profit tax (winstbelasting) and the surtaxes on the income and profit taxes. Collectively, however, these taxes are equivalent in scope to New Zealand income tax. EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 6 An information request must be supported by sufficient detail to enable the requested Party to efficiently comply with the request or (if applicable) to determine that one or more of the above exceptions applies. 13 The Parties are required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request. Such information may only be disclosed to authorised persons and may only be used for specified purposes (principally the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Party). 14 The requesting Party is required to reimburse the requested Party for “extraordinary costs” (such as the cost of engaging an interpreter or translator) incurred in responding to the request. Otherwise costs are to be borne by the requested Party. 15 Reservations are not provided for under the TIEA. 16 Article 11 of the TIEA provides that any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the agreement are to be resolved by mutual agreement between nominated persons (the “competent authorities”). The Parties may also agree on other forms of dispute resolution. Measures the Government could or should adopt to implement the treaty action, including the specific reference to implementing the legislation 17 Subject to the successful completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA will be implemented under New Zealand domestic law in accordance with section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004. 18 Section BH 1 authorises the giving of effect to certain tax agreements under New Zealand domestic law by overriding Regulation. That is, the Governor-General may declare by Order in Council that an agreement to which section BH 1 pertains will (within certain specified limits) override the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982, and the Privacy Act 1993. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of tax agreements, including this TIEA. 19 After the Order in Council has entered into force, New Zealand will notify the Netherlands by diplomatic note that all domestic constitutional and legal procedures for giving effect to the TIEA are complete. The Netherlands notified New Zealand by diplomatic note on 1 November 2007 that it has completed its domestic constitutional and legal procedures for giving effect to the TIEA. The TZBA will enter into force on the date of the last notification (i.e. New Zealand's). Its provisions will then have effect from 1 January next following entry into force. Economic, social, cultural and environmental costs and effects of the treaty action 20 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 7 The costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty 21 New Zealand will be required to reimburse the Netherlands Antilles for extraordinary costs (such as the cost of hiring translators or interpreters) that may arise from a New Zealand request. However, an administrative (less-than-treaty status) arrangement on costs to be entered into between the Parties will provide for consultation if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed US$1,000. This arrangement will ensure that New Zealand will only progress information requests giving rise to significant reimbursement costs if the need to obtain the information justifies the expenditure. 22 New Zealand is likely to raise more requests for information than the Netherlands Antilles but, to the extent that requests for information are received from the Netherlands Antilles, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in complying with those information requests. As noted above, however, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand's existing DTA network. The administrative costs of responding to requests from the Netherlands Antilles are therefore expected to be marginal. 23 All costs arising to the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department as a result of the operation of the TIEA will be met within existing baselines. Completed or proposed consultation with the community and Parties interested in the treaty action 24 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Treasury have been consulted and concur with the terms of the TIEA. No private sector consultation was entered into. Subsequent protocols or amendments to the treaty and their likely effects 25 No future amendments are anticipated. However, if the need arises to amend the TIEA, this would be done by way of a Protocol. Withdrawal or denunciation provision in the treaty 26 Article 13 of the TlEA provides that either Patty may, after the expiration of two years from the date of entry into force, terminate the TIEA by giving six months’ written notice through the diplomatic channel. Adequacy statement 27 The Inland Revenue Department has prepared this extended national interest analysis and has assessed it as adequate in accordance with the Code of Good Regulatory Practice.

However, there is no obligation to provide information where: ∑ the requesting Party would not be able to obtain the information under its own laws; ∑ complying with the request would disclose a trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process (although bank secrecy and domestic tax interest rules receive no protection under this exception); ∑ the information is subject to legal professional privilege; ∑ disclosure of the information would be contrary to public policy; ∑ the information is requested in order to administer or enforce a discriminatory tax law. 2 For the Netherlands Antilles, the actual taxes specified am the income tax (inkomstenbelasting), the wages tax (loonbelasting), the profit tax (winstbelasting) and the surtaxes on the income and profit taxes. Collectively, however, these taxes are equivalent in scope to New Zealand income tax. EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 6 An information request must be supported by sufficient detail to enable the requested Party to efficiently comply with the request or (if applicable) to determine that one or more of the above exceptions applies. 13 The Parties are required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request. Such information may only be disclosed to authorised persons and may only be used for specified purposes (principally the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Party). 14 The requesting Party is required to reimburse the requested Party for “extraordinary costs” (such as the cost of engaging an interpreter or translator) incurred in responding to the request. Otherwise costs are to be borne by the requested Party. 15 Reservations are not provided for under the TIEA. 16 Article 11 of the TIEA provides that any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the agreement are to be resolved by mutual agreement between nominated persons (the “competent authorities”). The Parties may also agree on other forms of dispute resolution. Measures the Government could or should adopt to implement the treaty action, including the specific reference to implementing the legislation 17 Subject to the successful completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA will be implemented under New Zealand domestic law in accordance with section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004. 18 Section BH 1 authorises the giving of effect to certain tax agreements under New Zealand domestic law by overriding Regulation. That is, the Governor-General may declare by Order in Council that an agreement to which section BH 1 pertains will (within certain specified limits) override the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982, and the Privacy Act 1993. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of tax agreements, including this TIEA. 19 After the Order in Council has entered into force, New Zealand will notify the Netherlands by diplomatic note that all domestic constitutional and legal procedures for giving effect to the TIEA are complete. The Netherlands notified New Zealand by diplomatic note on 1 November 2007 that it has completed its domestic constitutional and legal procedures for giving effect to the TIEA. The TZBA will enter into force on the date of the last notification (i.e. New Zealand's). Its provisions will then have effect from 1 January next following entry into force. Economic, social, cultural and environmental costs and effects of the treaty action 20 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 7 The costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty 21 New Zealand will be required to reimburse the Netherlands Antilles for extraordinary costs (such as the cost of hiring translators or interpreters) that may arise from a New Zealand request. However, an administrative (less-than-treaty status) arrangement on costs to be entered into between the Parties will provide for consultation if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed US$1,000. This arrangement will ensure that New Zealand will only progress information requests giving rise to significant reimbursement costs if the need to obtain the information justifies the expenditure. 22 New Zealand is likely to raise more requests for information than the Netherlands Antilles but, to the extent that requests for information are received from the Netherlands Antilles, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in complying with those information requests. As noted above, however, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand's existing DTA network. The administrative costs of responding to requests from the Netherlands Antilles are therefore expected to be marginal. 23 All costs arising to the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department as a result of the operation of the TIEA will be met within existing baselines. Completed or proposed consultation with the community and Parties interested in the treaty action 24 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Treasury have been consulted and concur with the terms of the TIEA. No private sector consultation was entered into. Subsequent protocols or amendments to the treaty and their likely effects 25 No future amendments are anticipated. However, if the need arises to amend the TIEA, this would be done by way of a Protocol. Withdrawal or denunciation provision in the treaty 26 Article 13 of the TlEA provides that either Patty may, after the expiration of two years from the date of entry into force, terminate the TIEA by giving six months’ written notice through the diplomatic channel. Adequacy statement 27 The Inland Revenue Department has prepared this extended national interest analysis and has assessed it as adequate in accordance with the Code of Good Regulatory Practice.

The National Interest Analysis for the treaty is appended to this report. EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 3 Appendix Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in respect of the Netherlands Antilles for the Exchange of Information with respect to Taxes Executive Summary 1 The purpose of the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in respect of the Netherlands Antilles for the Exchange of Information with respect to Taxes (“the TIEA”) is to enhance the ability of tax officials to detect and prevent tax avoidance and evasion. Specifically, it will enable New Zealand tax officials to request information from the Netherlands Antilles (such as tax records, business books and accounts, bank information, and ownership information). The Netherlands Antilles will be able to request similar information from New Zealand. The information will be used by tax officials of the requesting jurisdiction to ensure that the correct amount of tax is being paid by that jurisdiction's tax residents. The TIEA requires the Parties to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request. Date and nature of proposed binding treaty action 2 The TIEA was signed in Canberra on 1 March 2007. It is proposed that the TIEA enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and the Netherlands 1 (“the Parties”), in which each Party will notify the other of the completion of their respective domestic constitutional and legal procedures for the entry into force of the TIEA (Netherlands so notified New Zealand on 1 November 2007). The TIEA will enter into force on the date of the last (i.e. New Zealand's) notification, and its provisions will have effect from 1 January next following entry into force. In New Zealand, the domestic constitutional and legal procedures for entry into force comprise the successful completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process and incorporation of the TIEA into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. These procedures are expected to be completed in early 2008. 3 The Netherlands Antilles is about to undergo constitutional reform. Information now available indicates that the constitutional reforms will take effect on 15 December 2008. The Netherlands Antilles as an entity will then no longer exist. The islands of Curacao and St Maarten will become autonomous countries with the Netherlands responsible for their international relations, and the remaining islands of the Netherlands Antilles will become part of the Netherlands. It is understood that Curacao and St Maarten will take on the international obligations previously undertaken by the Netherlands Antilles. New Zealand's key concern in entering into the TIEA with the Netherlands Antilles was to extend information exchange arrangements to Curacao, which is a significant financial centre. 1 The Netherlands Antilles is an overseas territory of the Netherlands and as such does not have capacity to enter into this treaty independently. Accordingly, this treaty is between New Zealand and the Netherlands in respect of the Netherlands Antilles, hereafter referred to as being between New Zealand and the Netherlands Antilles EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 4 Bringing the TIEA into force with the Netherlands before the constitutional reforms will give New Zealand more certainty that the obligations in the Treaty will continue in respect of Curacao and St Maarten. Reasons for New Zealand taking the treaty action 4 To fully enforce their respective tax laws, and to better detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion, many countries (including New Zealand) are striving to build networks of treaties that authorise exchange of information on tax matters. In the absence of specific treaty authorisation, countries are typically constrained from assisting other states to enforce their tax laws. 5 The most common type of treaty which feature exchange of information provisions are double tax agreements (DTAs). New Zealand currently has 33 DTAs in force. However, DTAs are generally only concluded between trading and investment partners. To cater for other situations, the OECD, in 2002, produced a model agreement that provides solely for the exchange of information on tax matters. The TIEA with the Netherlands Antilles is New Zealand's first agreement to be negotiated on the basis of the 2002 OECD model. It represents a significant step forward for New Zealand in terms of extending its exchange of information arrangements beyond the DTA network. Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the treaty action 6 The TIEA will enable New Zealand tax officials to request information from the Netherlands Antilles (such as tax records, business books and accounts, bank information, and ownership information). Access to this previously unobtainab1e information will enhance the ability of the Inland Revenue Department to detect and prevent the avoidance or evasion of New Zealand tax. Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. 7 The TIEA is reciprocal in nature, meaning that the Netherlands Antilles is also able to request information from New Zealand. New Zealand is likely to raise more requests for information than the Netherlands Antilles but, to the extent that requests for information are received from the Netherlands Antilles, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in obtaining and providing the requested information. However, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand's existing 33 DTAs, and the administrative costs of responding to requests from the Netherlands Antilles are only expected to be marginal. In addition, the TIEA provides that “extraordinary costs” (such as the cost of hiring translators or interpreters) must be reimbursed by the requesting Party. 8 The TIEA provides a comprehensive set of rules to support the exchange of information. These rules are designed to ensure that requested information is provided in a timely and effective manner. Interference from bank secrecy and domestic tax interest rules is specifically prohibited as an obstacle to effective information exchange. Other rights and safeguards, however, which are secured to residents of either country by domestic law or administrative practice, remain in effect. For example, the Parties are required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request. Such information may only be disclosed to authorised persons and may only be used for specific EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 5 purposes (principally the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Party). 9 The TLEA closely follows the 2002 OECD model. There are some wording differences but, with one exception, these have non-substantive effect. The exception relates to the taxes covered by the agreement. The TJEA will only enable the Parties to request information in respect of income tax, 2 whereas the 2002 OECD model generally contemplates the exchange of information in respect of all taxes. Therefore, New Zealand will not be able to request information relating to, for example, a New Zealand goods and services tax assessment. This is not expected to be a significant disadvantage for New Zealand as the primary concern the TIEA addresses is avoidance or evasion of income tax. (Many of New Zealand's DTAs only permit exchange of information in relation to income tax.) 10 On balance, it is in New Zealand's interest to conclude a TIM with the Netherlands Antilles, and to do so prior to the constitutional reforms proposed for December 2008. Experience gained from the exchange of information arrangements already entered into under New Zealand's existing 33 DTAs indicates that the benefits arising from the enhanced ability to reduce tax avoidance and evasion outweigh the administrative costs incurred from having to respond to incoming requests. Obligations which would be imposed on New Zealand by the treaty action, the position of reservations to the treaty, and an outline of any dispute settlement mechanisms 11 The TIEA places a reciprocal obligation on each Party, upon request, to obtain and provide information that is forseeably relevant to the administration and enforcement of the taxes covered by the Agreement. 12 The obligation to obtain and provide information extends to all information in the possession or control of persons within that Party's jurisdiction. However, there is no obligation to provide information where: ∑ the requesting Party would not be able to obtain the information under its own laws; ∑ complying with the request would disclose a trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process (although bank secrecy and domestic tax interest rules receive no protection under this exception); ∑ the information is subject to legal professional privilege; ∑ disclosure of the information would be contrary to public policy; ∑ the information is requested in order to administer or enforce a discriminatory tax law. 2 For the Netherlands Antilles, the actual taxes specified am the income tax (inkomstenbelasting), the wages tax (loonbelasting), the profit tax (winstbelasting) and the surtaxes on the income and profit taxes. Collectively, however, these taxes are equivalent in scope to New Zealand income tax.
