Impact Summary: Income tax treatment of leases subject to NZ IFRS 16 | 1 IN CONFIDENCE Impact Summary: Income tax treatment of leases subject to NZ IFRS 16 Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA), except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Officials do not hold operating lease payments data for all IFRS 1 taxpayers. Estimating the total amount of annual operating lease payments for all IFRS taxpayers was necessary to determine the fiscal cost of the proposals. We identified the population of IFRS taxpayers and extracted operating lease information on the approximately 43% (by value of income tax payable) of IFRS taxpayers where it was available. This was then used to estimate lease payments for the balance of the population on the assumption their lease payments would be in the same proportion to their income tax payable. This identified total operating lease payments for all IFRS taxpayers of approximately $2.5 billion per annum. Two other factors that influence the fiscal co st are the average lease term (higher cost for longer terms) and the interest rate (higher cost for higher rates). We could not identify data on average lease terms so estimated these for a variety of situations then checked their reasonableness with external stakeholders. The interest rate on leases will differ from lease to lease and taxpayer to taxpayer; whereas the forecasting model requires a single interest rate. We chose the NZ dollar BBB+ rated corporate 5-year fixed term interest rate on 20 Ju ne 2019 which was the date the calculation was performed. In costing the proposals we have assumed that lease payments will remain static over time. A more realistic assumption is that, due to inflation and economic growth, lease payments will slowly grow over time. If this was factored into the costing there would be a small ongoing cost to the proposals; however, this cos t would be very small so has been disregarded on a materiality basis. We have also assumed that, for the preferred option, all eligible taxpayers will elect to follow their accounting treatment for eligible leases. This is the most conservative assumption, but we expect the proportion will be very high. We have not attempted to estimate the exact percentage expected to elect. 1 In ternational Financial Reporting Standards – The requirement to prepare accounts under IFRS varies but the most common is having total assets in excess of $60 million or total revenue in excess of $30 million. In 2017 the External Reporting Board (XRB) identified 2,575 entities with IFRS reporting obligations based on 2015 data. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 11:48:01 Impact Summary: Income tax treatment of leases subject to NZ IFRS 16 | 2 IN CONFIDENCE While changes in these assumptions or the final values will affect the fiscal calculations, officials consider these are sufficiently accurate that they can be relied upon to make decisions on the underlying principles considered. Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Income tax treatment of leases subject to NZ IFRS 16 RIA and considers that the information and analysis summarised in it meets the quality assurance criteria of the Regulatory Impact Analysis framework.

A lease involves one person (known as the lessor) who owns (or otherwise holds) an asset providing it to another person (known as the lessee) to use in exchange for payment over the term of the lease. For entities with IFRS 2 reporting obligations, the accounting treatment was previously determined under New Zealand Equivalent to International Accounting Standard 17 Leases (NZ IAS 17). This standard has been replaced by New Zealand Equivalent to International Financial Reporting Standard 16 Leases (NZ IFRS 16 or IFRS 16) for years starting on or after 1 January 2019. 3 Accounting treatment under NZ IAS 17 Under NZ IAS 17, there was a difference in the accounting treatment between operating and finance leases. NZ IAS 17 defines the distinction as follows: A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership. A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership. For example, a lease would be classified as a finance lease if the lessee leased the asset for the majority of its estimated useful life then had the right to purchase it from the lessor for a fixed price at the end of the lease. In contrast, a lease would be classified as an operating lease if the lessee only leased the asset for a short portion of the estimated useful life then at the end of the lease it was returned to the lessor to lease or sell to someone else. Current tax treatment The Income Tax Act 2007 contains two separate sets of rules for finance and operating leases. These definitions are similar but not identical to the NZ IAS 17 definition. The largest difference is that all leases of real property 4 are operating leases for tax purposes. For finance leases, the lease payments are taxed under the financial arrangements rules and are treated like the repayment of a loan with interest. For operating leases, the lease payments are currently spread equally over the life of the lease. This treatment is similar to the NZ IAS 17 accounting treatment which reduces the need for tax adjustments. No changes to the tax treatment of tax finance leases are considered in this RIA. Accounting changes moving from NZ IAS 17 to IFRS 16 For lessees, IFRS 16 removes the distinction between operating and finance leases for accounting purposes. Under IFRS 16, lessees are required to recognise on their balance sheet a new asset, being the right to use the leased asset for the lease term, and a lease liability representing the obligation to pay rentals. 2 Refer to footnote 1 for an explanation of who is required to follow IFRS 16. 3 IFRS 16 can also be applied for earlier periods for entities that choose to do so and meet certain other criteria. 4 Real property is not specifically defined but generally relates to land and buildings. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 11:48:01 Impact Summary: Income tax treatment of leases subject to NZ IFRS 16 | 4 IN CONFIDENCE This RIA does not attempt to explain how accounting expenditure is calculated under IFRS 16; however, there is usually a slight acceleration of deductions compared to accounting under NZ IAS 17. This can be shown in the following si mplified example for a 5-year lease, that was an operating lease under NZ IAS 17, with $100,000 per year of lease payments and a 3.7237% 5 discount rate: Year NZ IAS 17 Expenses IFRS 16 Expenses 1 100,000 106,439 2 100,000 103,337 3 100,000 100,120 4 100,000 96,783 5 100,000 93,322 Total 500,000 500,000 The NZ IAS 17 treatment matches the cashflows of the lease, whereas IFRS 16 more closely matches the economic cost of the lease. The IFRS 16 treatment can be thought of similar to a typical fixed-rate mortgage where total payments are consistent over time, but the interest expenditure is higher in earlier periods when the loan is higher, and the interest expenditure is lower (and therefore capital repayments are higher) near the end of the loan when the amount outstanding is lower. Capital repayments are not deductible; however, for an IFRS 16 operating lease, the capital has been applied to acquire the right to use the asset which is deductible as depreciation over the term of the lease. IFRS 16 does not significantly change the accounting treatment of leases for the lessor. The lessor will continue to reflect the leased asset on their balance sheet for operating leases. This RIA does not consider changes to the tax treatment of the lessor. Policy opportunity The introduction of IFRS 16 provides an opportunity to more closely align the tax treatment of lessees’ operating leases with the new accounting treatment. This has two main objectives: • Efficiency - As finance leases and debt used to purchase assets is already taxed under the financial arrangements rules deductions are accelerated similar to the IFRS 16 example above. Aligning the tax treatment of operating leases with the IFRS 16 treatment will make the tax treatment of all three methods of asset acquisition more similar which will reduce the tax incentive to choose one method over another to obtain a tax advantage. • Compliance costs - Unlike when entities followed NZ IAS 17, an entity following IFRS 16 will need to make tax adjustments to remove accounting deductions and claim tax deductions. By following IFRS 16 for tax the number of adjustments required could be reduced and therefore compliance costs would be lower as would be the possibility of inadvertent error. 5 This is the same rate used to forecast the fiscal impact of the proposals as discussed in the Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis section of this RIA. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 11:48:01 Impact Summary: Income tax treatment of leases subject to NZ IFRS 16 | 5 IN CONFIDENCE Timing cost As shown in the example above, total deduct ions under both NZ IAS 17 and IFRS 16 are identical; however, when broken down they are slightly higher in earlier years and slightly lower in later years under IFRS 16. Accelerating the timing of deductions in this way results in a permanent fi scal cost to the Crown. The appendix to this RIA provides an example to explain how this cost arises. 2.2 Who is affected and how? Businesses seeking to acquire an asset have a choice of financing structures including outright purchase (often funded by borrowing), finance leases and operating leases. IFRS 16 6 provides an opportunity to more closely align the tax treatment of operating leases with how finance leases and debt funded asset purchases are treated. This will reduce the tax incentive for businesses to acquire assets under a particular str ucture due to their different tax treatment. More closely aligning tax and accounting treatments also reduces the compliance costs of having to make tax adjustments and reduces the chances that these adju stments will inadvertently be made incorrectly. All IFRS taxpayers consulted supported alignment of tax with accounting for these reasons, provided it was on an optional basis. 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? There is a distinction in the tax treatment between operating and finance leases and there was previously a (slightly different) distinction in the accounting treatment between operating and finance leases. The adoption of IFRS 16 has removed this distinction for accounting purposes. Officials consider the tax distinction between operating and finance leases is well understood and working as intended so removing or amending this boundary has not been considered. Instead, the project has been limited to changes aimed at simplifying the tax treatment of leases that would have previously been, and will continue to be, classified as operating leases for tax. While there are undoubtedly benefits of aligning tax with IFRS 16 for affected taxpayers, early discussions with stakeholders identified that taxpayers wanted alignment to be optional rather than compulsory. As this project is intended to be a taxpayer favourable simplification all of the options in this RIA are for optional alignment rather than applying t o all IFRS taxpayers. While this will marginally reduce efficiency, officials do not expect this to be material, especially given the small number of IFRS taxpayers expected not to elect. 6 Refer to footnote 1 for an explanation of who is required to follow IFRS 16. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 11:48:01 Impact Summary: Income tax treatment of leases subject to NZ IFRS 16 | 6 IN CONFIDENCE While allowing non-IFRS taxpayers to follow an IFRS 16-type treatment for tax would also offer efficiency benefits, officials have not considered extending this treatment to non-IFRS taxpayers. This is because IFRS 16 calculations are relatively complicated a nd are not required for accounting purposes for non-IFRS taxpayers so requiring or allowing them for tax would require complex calculations s olely for tax purposes. This would have a high compliance cost that would outweigh any efficiency benefit available. Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options have been considered? The following criteria were used to assess the options considered: • Efficiency: the option should align with the economic substance and the accounting treatment of tax operating leases as much as possible. • Sustainability: the option should follow existing income tax deductibility principles and should not offer a more favourable treatment compared with that available to non- IFRS taxpayers. • Compliance costs: the compliance cost should be minimised as far as possible. Option 1: Status quo This option would retain the existing cashflow treatment of operating leases for lessees who are IFRS taxpayers. Once IFRS taxpayers adopted IFRS 16 they would be required to make tax adjustments to reverse accounting expenses and claim deductions consistent with the current treatment. This would not provide any of the benefits of alignment. Compliance costs may (depending on specific decisions and taxpayer circumstances) be lower than under some variants of option 3 but would be higher than under option 2 or option 4. Option 2: Full alignment This option would allow lessees to claim tax deductions equal to their accounting expenditure under tax operating leases. This would provide the highest level of efficiency, and compliance cost savings, as it would fully align tax and accounting. However, it would not be sustainable – it would offer a signifi cant more favourable treatment that that available to non-IFRS taxpayers and would have a significant fiscal cost (estimated at approximately $400 million 7 ). 7 As with the cost estimates for Option 3 and Option 4 th is cost is the total cost of this option over all time periods. The time period is dependent on the transitional period chosen which has agreed to be 5 years. Changing the transitional period changes the period the cost arises over but doesn’t change the total cost. There are no costs beyond this transitional period. Refer to the appendix of this RIA for a more detailed explanation. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 11:48:01 Impact Summary: Income tax treatment of leases subject to NZ IFRS 16 | 7 IN CONFIDENCE Option 3: Full alignment with adjustments This option would allow lessees to mostly claim tax deductions equal to their accounting expenditure under tax operating leases but would require them to make adjustments to recognise the tax principle that tax deductions should (generally) be available only when expenditure is incurred. This is in contrast to a number of items included in IFRS 16 lease expenditure, such as fair value impairments 8 – which are closer to a provision and provisions are not usually deductible – and make good costs 9 – which are spread over the (remaining) term of the lease rather than when the expenditure is incurred. This would have similar, or slightly lower, sustainability than option 4. However, it would have a fiscal cost of approximately $89 million assuming all IFRS taxpayers elected to align tax and accounting. It would significantly increase compliance costs as the calculation of adjustments would be complex and would have to be regularly updated. This increase in compliance costs would likely result in many taxpayers choosing not to align tax and accounting as the compliance costs could outweigh the benefits. If the proportion of taxpayers choosing to align tax and accounting was similar to option 4 then this option would have higher efficiency (due to the coverage of more leases); however, due to the increased compliance costs its likely less taxpayers would choose to align resulting in lower efficiency than option 4. Option 4: Partial alignment with adjustments This option is the same as option 3 except it would exclude operating leases for real property which would continue to be deductible under the current tax treatment. Real property is a term within the leasing rules and takes its ordinary legal meaning. It can be thought of as land and buildings. A lease of real property cannot be a finance lease for tax purposes even when the terms of the lease would otherwise make it so. Many businesses will have more non-real property leases than real property leases. However, real property leases are typically for longer terms and over higher value assets, so the total value of real property leases is expected to be far higher. This option does not capture the full efficiency benefits due to its narrower scope of covered leases so is worse than option 2 based on this cri terion but still higher than option 1 (which does not align at all) and option 3 (due to the expected low take-up of the optional alignment). This option has significantly lower compliance costs than option 3 as most of the adjustments that would be required under option 3 would not frequently arise in non-real property leases (for example, businesses often must restore a commercial building at or before the end of the lease whereas they don’t have to do this with a vehicle lease). It is the most sustainable as it is not significantly more favourable compared with the treatment by non-IFRS taxpayers and also has the lowest cost (approximately $9 million) of any option other than the status quo. 8 Fair value impairments are recorded as an accounting expense when the value of the asset to the business is less than that recognised in the accounts. For example, when a business is contracted to keep making lease payments on a building but no longer wants to operate from that site. 9 Make good costs are the estimated costs of restoring an asset before it can be returned to the lessor. For example, rem oving fitout from a building. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 11:48:01 Impact Summary: Income tax treatment of leases subject to NZ IFRS 16 | 8 IN CONFIDENCE 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? Option 4 is the preferred option. It will align tax and accounting for the greatest number of leases given the constraints of not creating a significantly more favourable set of rules for IFRS taxpayers that is not available to other businesses. This option will minimise compliance costs to the extent possible as it is expected that a high proportion of eligible taxpayers will elect to follow it. We have not attempted to estimate what proportion would choose to align tax and accounting but as the rules will reduce compliance costs and marginally bring forward deductions there will be few reasons not to elect to align. The forecasts conservatively assume that 100% of eligible taxpayers will elect to do so. There are no areas of incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’.

None identified. Section 5: Stakeholder views 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? Officials undertook targeted consultation with large corporates who enter into operating leases, their advisors, and relevant representative groups. Stakeholders were supportive of the simplification benefits of more closely aligning tax and accounting for operating leases for IFRS taxpayers provided this was on an optional basis (as the preferred option does and as discussed in section 2.3 above). Stakeholders generally sought a full alignment with few, and preferably no, adjustments from the accounting position on the basis this would minimise compliance costs. For the reasons 10 This cost is permanent to the Crown as it considers the economy as a whole where new leases are always entered into (refer to the appendix of this RIA for more explanation). In contrast, taxpayers enter individual leases where the benefit is only the slight acceleration of deductions but the same total deductions over the life of the lease, so this has only a timing benefit. Expected benefits of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Lessees who follow IFRS and elect to follow the accounting treatment for tax Removal of need to adjust between accounting and tax deductions Timing benefit from deductions being brought forward so tax will be paid slightly lat er 10 Reduction in tax incentive to enter into different acquisition structures Medium Medium Medium Inland Revenue Reduction in monitoring of tax adjustments for operati ng leases Low – some adjustments will still be required but the number of adjustments will be significantly reduced. Total Monetised Benefit None N/A Non-monetised benefits Marginal acceleration of lease deductions Reduction in compliance costs for lessees to comply with tax obligations and reduction in administration costs for Inland Revenue reviewing this treatment. Figure unable to be quantified on an individual lesse e basis Medium 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 11:48:01 Impact Summary: Income tax treatment of leases subject to NZ IFRS 16 | 10 IN CONFIDENCE set out above we do not recommend a full alignment. However, the exclusion of real property leases is likely to significantly reduce the number of adjustments that will be required. There have been varying degrees of support from individual stakeholders on the decision to exclude real property. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 11:48:01 Impact Summary: Income tax treatment of leases subject to NZ IFRS 16 | 11 IN CONFIDENCE Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? The proposals will require amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 which could be included in the next available tax omnibus bill expected to be introduced in early 2020. This bill is unlikely to be enacted before late 2020 or early 2021 which is after the application date of IFRS 16 – on or after 1 January 2019. For the earliest possible balance date that IFRS 16 would apply to, of 31 December, the first tax year following IFRS 16 will end on 31 December 2019. This is the 2019/20 tax year and the relevant return will be due to be filed by 31 March 2021 for taxpayers with an extension of time for filing their returns. Therefore, in most instances, affected taxpayers will have started their first-year accounting under IFRS 16 before the enactment of the bill containing the proposals but will not file a tax return until shortly after the enactment of that bill. For a taxpayer who chooses not to elect to align tax and accounting in the 2019/20 year, they should be able to elect to do so in any subsequent year. But all taxpayers, once they elect to align tax and accounting treatment, should be required to do so in all future years where they follow IFRS for accounting purposes. When a taxpayer chooses to elect to follow the accounting treatment for tax purposes this will usually result in a one-off deduction (arising from deductions that would have been available had the taxpayer been able to follow IFRS 16 in previous periods but were not available under the previous treatment). In order to manage the fiscal cost of this transition to the Crown, we suggest this deduction is spread over the year of adoption and the following four years. Consulted stakeholders have been supportive of this approach. Inland Revenue will release details of the Cabinet decision once it is made and further detail will be provided in a commentary released when the Bill is introduced and will also be included in the Tax Information Bulletin after the Bill is enacted. Inl and Revenue will be responsible for the ongoing monitoring and enforcement of the rules. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 11:48:01 Impact Summary: Income tax treatment of leases subject to NZ IFRS 16 | 12 IN CONFIDENCE Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? No specific data collection or monitoring is expected. Inland Revenue maintains a close relationship with many of the small number of affected large taxpayers and has a specific contact for IFRS issues. Any issues with the proposals or their post enactment implementation are expected to be identified through these channels or through contact with Policy staff. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? • How will the arrangements be reviewed? How often will this happen and by whom will it be done? If there are no plans for review, state so and explain why. • What sort of results (that may become apparent from the monitoring or feedback) might prompt an earlier review of this legislation? • What opportunities will stakeholders have to raise concerns? The final step in the Generic Tax Policy Process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post implementation review of legislati on, and the identification of remedial issues. A post implementation review could occur around 12 months after implementation. Any recommended changes identified from the review would be considered for potential inclusion on the Government's tax policy work programme. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 11:48:01 Impact Summary: Income tax treatment of leases subject to NZ IFRS 16 | 13 IN CONFIDENCE Appendix: Timing cost example As referred to in section 2.1, this example explains how a permanent reduction in tax revenue arises from the acceleration of lease deductions even where total deductions for each lease are unchanged. Assume, each year a three-year lease is entered into with $100 of deductions each year. The total deductions will be $300 each year as follows: Year 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Lease 1 100 100 100 Lease 2 100 100 100 Lease 3 100 100 100 Lease 4 100 100 100 Lease 5 100 100 100 Lease 6 100 100 Lease 7 100 Total 300 300 300 300 300 Instead, assume the timing of deductions is changed to $105, $100 and $95 for all leases starting from lease 4. Year 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Lease 1 100 100 100 Lease 2 100 100 100 Lease 3 100 100 100 Lease 4 105 100 95 Lease 5 105 100 95 Lease 6 105 100 Lease 7 105 Total 300 305 305 300 300 This shows that annual deductions start at $300 and return to $300 in year 6 onwards but in years 4 and 5 increase to $305. This $5 increase in deductions, if taxable at 28%, would permanently decrease tax revenue by $1.40 for both year 4 and year 5. If, in a future year, leases were no longer entered into this cost would reverse as there would be less deductions available. However, on an economy wide basis it is reasonable to assume that leases will continue to be entered into so this cost should be treated as permanent. Detail decisions such as whether to apply to existing leases or to spread a transitional adjustment over multiple years will affect the year the fiscal cost arises in but will not alter the total cost of the decisions in this RIA. Due to inflation and economic growth it would be more accurate to assume a small increase in lease payments each year rather than this example’s static lease payments. The consequence of such an assumption would be to create a small ongoing cost from an acceleration of lease deductions. However, this effect is not expected to be significant so has been omitted from the analysis. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 11:48:01
Impact Summary: Mycoplasma bovis tax issue | 1 IN CONFIDENCE Impact Summary: Mycoplasma bovis tax issue Secti o n 1: G en er al in fo rmati on Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Impact Summary, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing key policy decisions to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Range of options considered A more long-term generic process or provision for handling severe adverse events and future biosecurity incursions affecting livestock has not been considered. Given the timeframe for addressing the current Mycoplasma bovis issue (taxpayers that are clients of tax agents with a valid extension of time are due to file tax returns for the 2018/19 income tax year by 31 March 2020) a specific solution is required as it would not be possible to fully consider a longer-term solution. Consultation Consultation has been focussed on discussing the issue and potential solutions with Federated Farmers and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ). Given the timeframe for addressing this issue other groups have not been consulted at this stage. Officials will consider whether other groups should also be consulted as we work through the detailed design of the proposal before legislation is introduced and at the select committee stage.

Overview Some farmers that have had their livestock culled owing to the Government’s attempts to eradicate Mycoplasma bovis from New Zealand have faced an unexpected and significant tax liability as a result. This tax liability may impede their ability to replace their culled herd and is contrary to a key principle of the Biosecurity Act 1993 that no person is made better or worse off owing to the Crown’s use of its powers under that Act. Background Mycoplasma bovis is a bacterium that can cause a range of serious conditions in cattle. The disease may be dormant in an animal – causing no symptoms at all. But in times of stress (for example, calving, drying-off, transporting, or being exposed to extreme weather), the animal may shed bacteria in milk and nasal secretions. As a result, other animals may be infected and become ill or carriers themselves. The presence of Mycoplasma bovis in New Zealand was first detected in 2017. The Government, in partnership with the dairy and beef sectors, has decided to try to eradicate Mycoplasma bovis from New Zealand. As a result, Biosecurity New Zealand can require all the stock on a farm where Mycoplasma bovis has been found to be culled. In exchange, the Government pays compensation to the affected farmers for the difference between the normal market value of the stock and the amount received when the stock is slaughtered. This compensation is intended to leave farmers in no better or worse position than a person whose property is not directly affected by the exercise of the powers. To date, around 200 properties have been cleared of stock with a similar number being monitored for the presence of Mycoplasma bovis. These have been predominantly dairy farms although Mycoplasma bovis is increasingly being found on beef farms that acquired young stock from affected dairy farms before the disease was identified. Of the total 90,000 stock culled and compensated for by the end of January 2020, 52,000 were dairy cattle and 38,000 were beef cattle, with the bulk of the beef cattle being from fattening operations rather than breeding operations. 1 For income tax purposes livestock must be valued annually to establish its opening and closing values as part of determining the cost of sales. A farmer has the choice of several valuation options. Many use the national standard cost (NSC) scheme which values the animals at: • a standard cost (determined by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue), if the animal is homebred, for the respective age and type of animal that reflects average home breeding costs; or • at its purchase cost if the animal is purchased. 1 Fattening operations involve the growing of animals for meat. Such operations have much quicker turnover of stock than breeding operations as the stock will be slaughtered within 1-2 years. Conversely, breeding operations involve the rearing of animals for the ultimate replacement of existing herd animals and the sale of any excess. The quicker turnover of stock for fattening operations means the tax issue discussed in this impact summary is less significant for fattening operations. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-05-21 13:11:55 Impact Summary: Mycoplasma bovis tax issue | 4 IN CONFIDENCE A few farmers also use the self-assessed cost scheme which involves farmers using their own farm costs rather than standard costs. Policy problem in detail When breeding livestock has been valued under either the NSC scheme or the self- assessed cost scheme, culling the herd can result in a significant and unexpected tax liability that can impede a farmer’s ability to restock their farm. This is because the compensation payments plus slaughter receipts are income, and there is no immediate comparable deduction in relation to the replacement stock to offset that income. The replacement stock value for NSC and self-assessed cost purposes is its purchase price and this stock value is only gradually written down (over the next five or so years) as the stock ages and is itself replaced from homebred animals. Although this is a tax timing issue, there are potential cash flow problems and interest costs for farmers in the meantime that can impede the recovery process. Simplified example Cow A with a market value of $1,500 is culled because of Mycoplasma bovis. The farmer receives $1,500 for the cow from a combination of compensation and slaughter receipts. For tax purposes, as cow A was valued under the NSC scheme at $700, there is taxable income of $800 from its cull. The $1,500 is used to buy replacement cow B. Under NSC, cow B is valued at its purchase price of $1,500. Cow B remains in the herd for five years before being slaughtered and is replaced by a cow bred up through the herd (cow C) which has a NSC of $700 (its homebred cost). There is a tax deduction of $800 at that point, being the difference between the cost of cow B and the cost of cow C. If there had been no Mycoplasma bovis cull, cow A would have remained in the herd and been replaced by the equivalent of cow C with no NSC implications given that both cow A and cow C have a NSC value of $700. As farmers will have a herd made up of different age cows that will be progressively slaughtered the single $800 deduction in this example will result in a deduction each year when considered on a whole of herd basis. For fattening stock valued under the NSC scheme or self-assessed cost scheme, the tax issue is less acute as the livestock turn-over much more regularly so that normal tax rules should apply. In that case, or when other valuation methods (such as the herd scheme) are used to value the herd, the income equalisation deposit scheme should provide sufficient flexibility to manage any tax issues. The income equalisation scheme enables the recognition of income to be deferred by up to five years if the income is deposited into the scheme. The income equalisation scheme will not provide sufficient flexibility to deal with the tax issues created by the culling of breeding animals that are valued under NSC or self-assessed cost because the deposit would need to be withdrawn to pay for replacement stock, at which point the income is recognised. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-05-21 13:11:55 Impact Summary: Mycoplasma bovis tax issue | 5 IN CONFIDENCE 2.2 Who is affected and how? The affected parties are farmers that use the NSC scheme or the self-assessed cost scheme to value their breeding stock on hand for tax purposes and have had their herds culled and replaced because of Mycoplasma bovis. Overall, possibly up to 50 farmers to date could have unexpected tax liabilities because they value their dairy and/or beef breeding animals under the NSC or self-assessed cost schemes. The impact is most severe for those with a high proportion of mixed-age cows as, under normal circumstances, they would be relying on holding those animals for several years and on using them to breed replacement stock. Sharemilkers would be particularly affected as their main asset is livestock. Since very few farmers use the self-assessed cost scheme, because of its complexity, it may be that none of the farmers affected by Mycoplasma bovis are using it. However, if they have there would be a sizeable tax liability as a result of the cull. Federated Farmers wrote to the Minister of Revenue in December 2019 asking for this issue to be addressed. Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ) also supports the proposals. 2.3 What are the objectives sought in relation to the identified problem? A core principle of the Biosecurity Act 1993 is that no person should be any better or worse off because of the Crown’s use of its powers under that Act. The objective of the proposal is to ensure that farmers are not made worse off because of a tax liability arising from the culling of Mycoplasma bovis infected livestock. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-05-21 13:11:55 Impact Summary: Mycoplasma bovis tax issue | 6 IN CONFIDENCE Secti o n 3: O p ti on s id en ti fi cati o n 3.1 What options have been considered? The following criteria have been used to assess the options: • Equity – the option should result in farmers using the NSC or self-assessed cost scheme not being made worse off as a result of their herds being culled or better off than farmers who have used other valuation methods. • Timeliness – the option should be able to be enacted as soon as possible to provide certainty to farmers with culled and replaced herds • Compliance and administration costs – the option should be as simple as possible. Option 1: No law change (Status quo) The status quo would not be an equitable option as farmers using the NSC scheme would face a significant and unexpected tax liability owing to their herds being culled because of the presence of Mycoplasma bovis. This is contrary to the principle of the Biosecurity Act 1993 that no person should be made better or worse off owing to the Crown’s use of its powers under that act. Option 2: Spreading the additional income (preferred option) Under this option, the additional taxable income arising from culling and replacing a herd would be able to be spread evenly over subsequent income years. This would allow the income to be offset each year by the increased deductions arising from the reducing cost of the stock on hand. The ideal length of this spread for farmers would be between 5 and 7 years depending on the profile of their herds. Therefore, for simplicity the length of the spread would be 6 years, starting from the income year after the income originally arose. Certain requirements would need to be met for the income to be spread: • The business would need to be subject to Biosecurity Security New Zealand requiring a cull of Mycoplasma bovis affected stock. • Stock would need to be substantially replaced with equivalent stock within a reasonable timeframe, say twelve months. Farmers that choose not to replace their stock after a cull are in a similar position to a farmer that sells their stock to exit the industry. • The business would need to be a dairy or a beef breeding operation, with the breeding stock valued under the NSC or self-assessed cost schemes. • Only the income derived from the culling of the breeding stock valued under the NSC or the self-assessed cost schemes could be spread. Income derived from culling fattening stock would not be able to be spread as the tax issue is less acute owing to the more frequent turnover of stock. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-05-21 13:11:55 Impact Summary: Mycoplasma bovis tax issue | 7 IN CONFIDENCE • The replacement stock must continue to be valued using, as relevant, NSC or self-assessed cost. This is to ensure that farmers cannot enter the herd scheme on more advantageous terms than those not affected by Mycoplasma bovis. Analysis of option This option increases equity as it would ensure affected farmers do not suffer from an unexpected tax burden and associated cash flow issues. This is consistent with the core principle of the Biosecurity Act 1993 that no person should be made better or worse off owing to the Crown’s use of its powers under that act. This option would also be a more timely solution to the problem as it could be announced by the Minister of Revenue prior to the 31 March 2020 due date for 2018/19 income tax returns for clients of tax agents with a valid extension of time. This will help to provide certainty to farmers and their tax advisers. This option is not expected to have a significant impact on compliance costs for affected farmers. Farmers intending to spread the additional income will be required to advise Inland Revenue when filing their returns so that their files can be manually adjusted. Given the relatively low number of affected farmers, the costs associated with administering this option for Inland Revenue should be minimal and could be absorbed within existing baselines. Option 3: Offset the taxable income against the cost of replacement stock This option would involve offsetting the taxable income against the cost of the replacement livestock, which would essentially write down the purchase price to what the NSC would have been had the incident not occurred. While this option would conceptually achieve the desired outcome, it would be complex to achieve in practice as it would require an exact matching of the culled stock with the replacement stock, and rules about adjustments where that did not arise. Therefore, this option was not preferred as the option of spreading the income evenly over a number of income years is simpler. Option 4: Amending the income equalisation scheme This option would involve enabling deposits made in relation to Mycoplasma bovis to be withdrawn from the income equalisation scheme without being treated as income. This option would compromise the integrity of the scheme and is, therefore, not preferred. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-05-21 13:11:55 Impact Summary: Mycoplasma bovis tax issue | 8 IN CONFIDENCE 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? The proposed approach is spreading the additional income arising from culling and replacing a herd affected by Mycoplasma bovis. Spreading the income over the six subsequent income years offsets the income against the expected increased deductions, in effect leaving the farmer in a similar position to if no unexpected income had arisen. This is the proposed approach as it is the only option that can be implemented in a timely manner and is consistent with the principle of the Biosecurity Act 1993 that no one is made better or worse off owing to the Crown’s use of its powers under that Act. The proposed approach is compatible with the Government’s “Expectations for the design of regulatory systems”. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-05-21 13:11:55 Impact Summary: Mycoplasma bovis tax issue | 9 IN CONFIDENCE Secti o n 4: I mp ac t An al ysi s (Pr o po sed ap p r o ach) 4.1 Summary table of costs and benefits NB. Monetary impacts are calculated by assuming the proposal will result in a fiscal loss of $1.5 million in 2020/21 offset by a gain of $300,000 in each of the following 5 years (as returns are being adjusted the fiscal loss and first year of income being spread will occur in the same fiscal year). A 6% discount rate has been used.

No other impacts have been identified from the proposed option. Federated Farmers and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ) will continue to be consulted on the detailed design of the proposal to ensure there are no unintended impacts. Secti o n 5: Sta keh o ld er vi ew s 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? This issue was raised by Federated Farmers in a letter sent to the Minister of Revenue in December 2019. Since then officials have worked with Federated Farmers and CA ANZ on developing a solution to the issue. Federated Farmers and CA ANZ both consider that an immediate solution is required and support the proposed income spreading option. Officials, CA ANZ and Federated Farmers have established a working team to work through the detailed detail of the proposed spreading option. Given the urgent timeline for addressing this issue the focus has been on consulting with Federated Farmers and CA ANZ. However, officials will consider whether other groups should also be consulted as we work through the detailed design before legislation is introduced and at the select committee stage. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-05-21 13:11:55 Impact Summary: Mycoplasma bovis tax issue | 11 IN CONFIDENCE Secti o n 6: I mpl em en tati o n an d op er ati o n 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? The proposal will require amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007. These amendments would be included in a Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) to an omnibus taxation Bill scheduled to be introduced in April 2020. The SOP would be released at the Finance and Expenditure Committee stage in time for submissions to be made on the proposed amendments. Guidance material will be published on the amendments following the Bill’s enactment. Following Cabinet approving the proposed option the Minister of Revenue will issue a press release advising of Cabinet’s decision and the process for affected 2018/19 returns due by 31 March 2020. This will help to provide certainty for farmers and their tax advisers. Already filed returns Although the bulk of the impact to date will be in relation to 2018/19 income tax, as the culls began in late 2017, this option would be backdated to include the effects of the cull in the 2017/18 income year. Affected farmers who have already filed returns for 2017/18 or 2018/19 would have the option of applying the spread retrospectively and having their returns reassessed. However, some may instead choose to leave their returns as is as there may be some impact on farmers social assistance entitlements and liabilities if the additional income is now spread. For this to be effective, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will have to be allowed to make associated adjustments to the farmers’ tax positions. Secti o n 7: M o ni tori n g, eval uati o n an d r evi ew 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue will monitor the outcomes to confirm that they match the policy objectives. This will be facilitated by farmers who choose to spread their additional income being required to advise Inland Revenue of their intention to do so. The proposed option has been developed alongside Federated Farmers and CA ANZ. Officials expect that, once the proposals are enacted, these two groups will raise any concerns affected farmers are having with the rules in practice. Any necessary changes identified as a result would be recommended for addition to the Government’s tax policy work programme. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The review will be the monitoring described in section 7.1 above. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-05-21 13:11:55
Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 1 IN CONFIDENCE Impact Summary: Changes to the PIE regime Sec tio n 1 : G en er a l in fo r ma tion Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Statement, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Timing The system development and testing required to make changes to the Inland Revenue tax administration system START mean that decisions need to be made in advance of the time these changes take effect from. In order for the proposed changes to be able to take effect for the 2019-20 tax year, it is necessary to include any changes in a tax bill at the earliest opportunity. The Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill (the KiwiSaver Bill) is currently before the Finance and Expenditure Committee (FEC) and submitters have raised the issue of non-refundability of overpaid PIE tax under the current rules. To ensure that policy decisions are taken, and legislation passed in this timeframe, this has created a constraint on the time available to analyse options. Despite this, officials are confident that the proposed approach would be the most effective option to address the problem definition. Consultation and testing Inland Revenue has undertaken targeted consultation with PIEs (mainly KiwiSaver scheme providers) in relation to a related proposal already in the KiwiSaver Bill. However, as a result of time constraints, wider public consultation has not been carried out. Assumptions underpinning impact analysis Assumptions have been made in estimating the number of people who are likely to change their prescribed investor rates (PIRs) as a result of Inland Revenue’s administrative actions. These assumptions have been based on the amount of PIE tax an investor has over- or underpaid and general behavioural assumptions. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:06 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 2 IN CONFIDENCE Responsible Manager (signature and date): Mike Nutsford Policy Lead Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 18 September 2019 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:06 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 3 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 2 : Pro b le m de fin itio n an d o bjec tiv es 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? The PIE tax rules apply to collective investment vehicles where investors combine resources to make different types of passive investments, for example a managed fund. There are several types of PIEs, each with different tax requirements. In practice most PIEs are multi- rate PIEs. A multi-rate PIE attributes income, losses and tax credits to investors. The tax rate applied to these types of PIEs varies from investor to investor. There are locked-in PIEs where the funds are locked into the scheme (for example all KiwiSaver PIEs and some other locked-in retirement schemes and superannuation funds) and other PIEs that are not locked in. Under current law, a person investing in a multi-rate PIE elects a tax rate, referred to as their PIR, which approximates their marginal tax rate based on (the lower of) one of the previous two tax years. A person’s marginal tax rate is the tax rate that applies to the last dollar they earn. If a person earns more than $70,000 their marginal tax rate would be 33%. However, while marginal income tax rates can be up to 33%, PIE rates are capped at 28%. The investor notifies their elected PIR to their PIE providers. The PIE provider pays tax on the investment income of each investor based on the PIR the investor has notified. If an investor does not provide their PIE with their elected PIR, they default to the highest PIR of 28%. There are three PIRs: 10.5%, 17.5% and 28%. To determine the correct PIR, an investor in a PIE needs to look at what their taxable income and their PIE income were for the last two income years before the tax year in which the PIR is to be applied. If they have considered the two previous income years and would qualify for two different rates, the PIR is the lower rate. The following table outlines how to work out the PIR to be applied to PIE income: Taxable income (in either of the last two income years) was... and the total income Taxable income plus PIE income (in either of the last two income years) was... before the relevant tax year for ... the PIR is ... $0 – $14,000 $0 - $14,000 Either year 10.5% $0 – $14,000 $14,001 - $48,000 Either year 10.5% $48,001 - $70,000 Either year 17.5% $14,001 – $48,000 Up to $48,000 Either year 17.5% $48,001 or more Over $48,000, but under $70,000 Both years 28% Any amount $70,001 or more Both years 28% When the correct PIR has been used or where a too high rate has been used, the income from PIE investment is excluded income 1 , which means it is a final tax and the PIE income does not flow through to the investors’ individual income tax return and assessment. 1 Certain types of income are expressly treated as “excluded income” by specific provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007. Excluded income is omitted from a person’s calculation of income tax for an income year. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:06 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 4 IN CONFIDENCE Therefore, where an investor has elected a rate that is too high, or they have defaulted to the highest PIR but could have elected a lower PIR, the overpaid tax on their PIE income can’t be refunded. To use a PIR below 28% and therefore potentially be affected by the non- refundability, people must have had taxable income of less than $48,000 in at least one of the two previous income years. However, where tax on PIE income has been underpaid because the investor has notified a rate that is too low, the PIE income ceases to be excluded income and is required to be included in the investor’s income. It is taxed at the investor’s marginal tax rate. A tax credit is given for the PIE tax that has already been paid. This is intended to incentivise the investor to notify the correct PIR as they can be subject to a marginal tax rate of up to 33%, while the top PIR is capped at 28%. The difference between the treatment of over- and underpaid PIE tax raises equity concerns, in particular in relation to the non-refundability of overpaid tax on PIE income. Data analysis enabled by Inland Revenue’s new technology platform START estimates that approximately 1.5 million people have used incorrect PIRs for the year ended 31 March 2019. Inland Revenue is working on a range of administrative initiatives to help ensure people are on the correct PIRs. This involves proactively contacting investors who are on an incorrect rate and suggesting they contact their PIE provider to change their rate. Under current legislation Inland Revenue has the power to notify a PIE provider of the PIR that should be used where someone has notified the wrong rate. However, because of the way the legislation is worded, this is limited to people who have notified their PIE provider of their rate as opposed to people who have not provided a rate and therefore have defaulted to a 28% rate. Inland Revenue is unable to determine from the information held in its systems, whether a person on a 28% rate has notified that rate or defaulted to it and therefore cannot notify PIE providers of the PIR for anyone on the 28% rate. Change currently proposed in the KiwiSaver Bill A legislative change proposed in the KiwiSaver Bill, which is currently being considered by the Finance and Expenditure Committee, would allow Inland Revenue, when it holds sufficient information about an investor’s income for the previous two income years, to directly notify the PIE provider of the PIR that should be used in all cases where an incorrect PIR is being used. This proposed change would apply from 1 April 2020. This change will not remove the issue that overpaid PIE tax is not refundable. Inland Revenue advising the PIE provider directly to change to a correct rate where Inland Revenue systems identify that an incorrect PIR is used is expected to significantly reduce the numbers of people on a wrong rate (too high or too low). However, there will still be some situations where an incorrect PIR is used resulting in over- or underpayment of tax. For example, where people who have to provide income information to Inland Revenue have an extension of time to provide that information, they may not be required to provide that additional information until 31 March of the following year. This information could be received too late to allow Inland Revenue to take it into account when providing PIRs to PIE providers. This could mean that their PIR was only based on the earlier of the two relevant previous. If they earned less income in the more recent year, they might be entitled to use a lower PIR 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:06 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 5 IN CONFIDENCE than the one Inland Revenue might be able to provide. Without legislative change Inland Revenue would not be able to provide a refund in those cases. Also, for new members of PIEs , there would have to be one incidence of using a wrong PIR for the new investor, before Inland Revenue could determine that the rate used is incorrect and can notify the PIE of the correct PIR. When an investor exits a PIE, this triggers a calculation and payment of their PIE tax at that time. There is a risk that some investors could exit from their PIE investment before the correct rate had been able to be provided by Inland Revenue and could over- or underpay PIE tax. There is also a small risk that Inland Revenue could provide an incorrect PIR if it held incorrect information. This should only happen when a person has not provided required information. 2.2 Who is affected and how? Inland Revenue Inland Revenue cannot currently refund overpaid PIE tax and has limited ability to provide correct PIRs to PIE providers. PIEs PIEs are not currently provided with correct PIRs by Inland Revenue. They are often not notified of their investors’ PIRs and therefore have to use the 28% default rate. PIE investors PIE investors are currently required to notify their PIE provider of their correct PIR. This requirement is not effective for a large number of PIE investors. Rather than changing PIE investor behaviour, it is more effective to widen Inland Revenue’s ability to directly provide PIRS to PIE providers and for PIE providers to use the provided rate. 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? No constraints were identified. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:06 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 6 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 3: O p tio n s id e n tifica tio n 3.1 What options have been considered? The following criteria were used to assess the options considered: • Equity: the option should ensure that all PIE investors pay the correct amount of tax on their PIE income. • Sustainability: the option should ensure that the PIE regime is certain and predictable for both PIE providers and investors. The PIE regime should be seen as being fair for investors. • Compliance: compliance cost should be minimised for investors and PIE providers as far as possible. • Administration: implementation and administration costs for Government departments should be minimised as far as possible. Option 1: Status quo Should the proposed legislative change already in the KiwiSaver Bill be enacted, this would enable Inland Revenue to advise PIE providers directly to change to a correct rate where Inland Revenue systems identify that an incorrect PIR is used. This is expected to significantly reduce the number of people on a wrong rate (too high or too low). Some PIE investors would still have incorrect PIE tax deducted before Inland Revenue could determine the PIR used is incorrect and advise the PIE provider of the correct PIR to be used for their investors. The status quo would not remove the issue that some PIE investors would have been on the wrong PIR and may have overpaid PIE tax. Any amount of overpaid PIE tax would continue to not be refundable. The inconsistent treatment of under- and overpaid PIE tax under the current law is not equitable and the difference potentially threatens the sustainability of the PIE tax regime can be thought of as being unfair. The status quo does involve some increase in compliance and administrative costs compared to previous years due to Inland Revenue providing PIRs directly to PIE providers where people are on incorrect PIRs (and notifying people that their PIR has been changed) and the need for PIE providers to process increased numbers of PIR change requests. Option 2: Mirror the existing treatment of underpayment of PIE tax for overpaid PIE tax This option would mirror the existing legislative rules for PIE investors who have notified their PIE provider with a rate for their PIE income which is lower than their correct PIR. This would mean that if an incorrect rate had been used, either lower or higher, the PIE income would cease to be excluded income. The income would then be required to be included in the individual investors’ income tax return. It would be taxed at the investor’s marginal tax rate for the tax year. A tax credit would be given for the PIE tax that has already been paid. This option would in some cases result in an inequitable outcome. This is because while the PIR approximates the investor’s marginal tax rate, it is based on (the lower of) one of the 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:06 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 7 IN CONFIDENCE previous two tax years. In some cases an investor who has their PIE income taxed at their current year’s marginal tax rate because they have overpaid the tax on their PIE income using a too high PIR, may still have a tax bill when their marginal tax rate is higher than both their correct PIR and the rate used. As well as being inequitable, the cases where a person would have to pay more tax at their marginal tax rate when they had been on too high a PIR could also reduce the sustainability of the PIE regime. Potential media coverage of such situations could reduce public and political trust in the PIE regime. This option would be more complex to implement in Inland Revenue’s systems than option 3 due to the need to identify where a person has been on an incorrect rate before making the adjustment to their taxable income. It would therefore have a level of additional administrative cost (this cost hasn’t been estimated). As with all options, there would also be some increase in compliance and administrative costs compared to previous years. This is due to Inland Revenue providing PIRs directly to PIE providers where people are on incorrect PIRs (and notifying people that their PIR has been changed) and the need for PIE providers to process increased numbers of PIR change requests. Option 3: Ability to proactively provide PIRs to PIES effective from 1 April 2020 and a year-end square-up a. with application of the year-end square-up from the 2019-20 tax year b. with application of the year-end square-up from the 2020-21 tax year This option would enable Inland Revenue to pro-actively provide PIRs for all investors to the PIE providers where Inland Revenue holds sufficient information to determine the PIR applicable for the tax year. Inland Revenue would also advise the investors that their PIR had been changed. This would mean that investors would largely be placed on the correct PIR which PIE providers would use to calculate tax during the tax year. There would still be a risk that some investors could exit from their PIE investment before the correct rate had been able to be provided. These investors could under- or overpay PIE tax. There is also a risk that Inland Revenue could possibly provide an incorrect PIR if it held incorrect information. An additional year-end square-up applying the correct PIRs would address any over- or underpayment of PIE tax during the tax year. All PIE income would have the correct PIR applied to it in the year-end square-up, regardless of whether it has been correctly, over- or under-withheld during the tax year. It would not be relevant whether a correct, too low or too high PIR has been notified. This would be a change compared to the current treatment for investors who have notified a PIR that is too low, as their PIE income would no longer be subject to their marginal tax rates, but to their correct PIR. The year-end square-up would involve Inland Revenue taking a person’s PIE income and applying their correct PIR to it to determine the PIE tax payable. The PIE tax that had been deducted would be a tax credit against the PIE tax payable. Any refund due or tax payable would be added to the person’s end of year tax position and would either be refunded, 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:06 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 8 IN CONFIDENCE payable or reduce the person’s tax payable. For most individual investors the square-up would happen automatically and they would not be required to do anything. It would be an automated process similar to and alongside the year end auto-calculation process for income tax. Investors would have additional PIE information added to their income profile information. For investors who are required to file an income tax return, the PIE income information Inland Revenue holds would be pre-populated into their income tax profile to be available when they file their income tax return. For them the PIE income calculation would happen alongside the income tax process once they have filed their tax return for the tax year. While the timing of the PIE square-up would be aligned with that of the general income tax year-end process for each individual, the PIE square-up would be a separate process, using current PIRs and thresholds. That is, a PIE square-up would be undertaken and the difference, if any, would be included in the income tax year-end process. The difference would either increase a person’s refund, reduce tax payable, reduce the refund or increase the amount payable. Refunds would be made directly to the individual investors and not to the PIEs. Similarly, PIE tax payable would be paid by the investor and not out of their PIE funds. The PIE square-up would not affect a person’s provisional tax liability. This is because any PIE tax payable or refundable would be added after the calculation of the person’s residual income tax (which is the basis for a person’s provisional tax liability). The first measure would get most people onto the correct PIR before any PIE tax is deducted during the tax year. In situations where this did not occur the second measure, the year-end square-up, would ensure that the person still only paid the correct amount of PIE tax. The combination of the two measures, therefore, gives the most equitable outcome. This option would preserve the current PIRs based on one of the previous two tax years, including the maximum tax rate for PIEs being 28% and the current thresholds for investors in these PIEs. It would also ensure that all people are taxed at their correct PIR so would give consistent and understandable outcomes. These factors support the sustainability of the PIE regime. This option would involve some initial compliance costs as the PIE providers would have to adjust their systems to be able to receive and apply PIRs from Inland Revenue in more situations than just for corrected PIRs where the rate the investor had notified is incorrect. This is not expected to be materially greater than the additional compliance costs that would be caused under the status quo and option 2 by Inland Revenue providing PIRs directly to PIE providers where people are on incorrect PIRs and notifying people that their PIR has been changed and the need for PIE providers to process increased numbers of PIR change requests. There would be some one-off administrative costs in developing the year end square-up which Inland Revenue will absorb within existing Business Transformation baselines. Option 3 a This sub-option would ensure that these benefits would apply to the current tax year (2019- 20). Inland Revenue’s current efforts to notify people that they are on incorrect PIRs would reduce the number of PIE investors on an incorrect PIR but would still leave a large number 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:06 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 9 IN CONFIDENCE of people on incorrect rates during the 2019-20 tax year. Officials have estimated that approximately 830,000 people would still be on a rate that is too high. The proposed year-end square-up would have a one-off fiscal cost if applied from the 2019- 20 tax year. This is because it would correct the PIE tax position for the 830,000 people estimated to be on a rate that is too high. This sub-option would have immaterial fiscal costs for the following years as the changes already in the KiwiSaver Bill that would allow Inland Revenue to inform PIE providers of the correct PIRs for their investors would mean that almost all PIE investors will be on the correct PIR in the 2020-21 tax year. Option 3 b This sub-option would mean that approximately 830,000 people (who have earnt less than $48,000 of taxable income in one of the two previous income years) would pay too much PIE tax in the 2019-20 tax year without the ability to get the overpaid tax refunded. As such it is less equitable than sub-option 3 a. If the PIR changes are enacted with application from 1 April 2020, Inland Revenue would be able to significantly reduce the number of PIE investors on an incorrect rate for their PIE income during the 2020-21 tax year. This would mean that the application of the year-end square-up to that tax year would not have an effect on many people and therefore would have immaterial fiscal costs. 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? The preferred approach is option 3 a which: • Provides Inland Revenue with the ability to proactively provide PIEs with their investor’s PIRs during the tax year where Inland Revenue holds sufficient information to determine the PIR applicable for the tax year. • Square up all PIE income at the end of the tax year using the PIE investors’ correct PIR based on the information Inland Revenue holds about the previous two income years with application from the 2019-20 tax year. Of the considered options, option 3 a would be most effective in assuring that people are on the correct PIR and refunds of overpaid PIE tax for people on PIRs that were too high are allowed. It is also the most coherent and equitable option as it will ensure that most investors have the correct amount of tax deducted from their PIE income from the start. All investors will pay the correct amount of tax on their PIE income through a year-end square-up process, including those who have over- or under-paid tax during the year. Option 3 b would mean that approximately 830,000 people (who have earnt less than $48,000 of taxable income in one of the two previous income years) would pay too much PIE tax in the 2019-20 tax year without the ability to get the overpaid tax refunded. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:06 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 10 IN CONFIDENCE Option 3 a would address unfairness concerns for the current tax year, however it does have a one-off fiscal cost. It is the option that is the least complex and is therefore easiest to understand for investors, as all PIE income, whether correctly, over-, or undertaxed, has the same year-end process. It is the option that is easiest to implement in Inland Revenue systems. Officials recommend option 3 a as it gives an equitable outcome for PIE investors and has manageable compliance and administrative costs given the benefits being delivered. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:06 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 11 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 4: Imp ac t An a ly s is (Pr opo se d ap pr oa ch) 4.1 Summary table of costs and benefits Affected parties (identify) Comment: nature of cost or benefit (eg ongoing, one-off), evidence and assumption (eg compliance rates), risks Impact $m present value, for monetised impacts; high, medium or low for non- monetised impacts Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties (PIE providers, PIE investors ) PIE providers PIE providers may have to adjust their systems to be able to receive and apply their investors’ PIRs provided by Inland Revenue as opposed to current law where they would only be required to receive PIRs from Inland Revenue for those investors that have notified them with an incorrect rate or have defaulted onto the default PIR and could have elect a lower rate.

Where an investor in a locked in PIE such as KiwiSaver went back to their PIE provider and asked to be put back on a PIR that was too high, the year-end square up would enable them to get a refund of money that should have remained in their locked-in PIE investment. While this is a cash in hand benefit for the investor it is also a future disadvantage for them as it will reduce their retirement savings and it undermines the reason for their PIE fund being locked- in. Investors may go back and may notify a lower rate than their correct PIR to their PIE provider to receive a time value of money advantage during the year until the end-of-year square-up. Previously investors were incentivised not to notify a rate that is too low, as in those cases the PIE income becomes part of the investor’s income tax assessment and is then taxed at the investor’s marginal tax rate. A person’s marginal tax rate is the tax rate that applies to the last dollar they earn. If a person earns more than $70,000 their marginal tax rate would be 33% (whereas the top PIR is 28%). Notifying a lower PIR than the correct PIR would mean that more money would be paid into the person’s PIE investment but also that they would subsequently have to pay more tax at the end of the year. If the PIE was a locked in PIE, such as KiwiSaver, they would effectively be making a further contribution to their retirement savings as they would have to fund the PIE tax that they would have to pay at the end of the year from their other income. Officials propose to monitor whether people are manipulating the rules to their advantage to determine whether any specific action is required to prevent this. Sec tio n 5: Stak e h old er vie ws 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? Inland Revenue has undertaken targeted consultation with KiwiSaver PIE providers around the initial proposal to widen the ability to provide PIRs for all PIE investors where Inland Revenue holds sufficient information. PIE providers are generally supportive of the proposal to enable Inland Revenue to provide PIEs with their investor’s correct PIR. As previously stated, this is widening the Commissioner’s existing ability to provide the PIE with their investor’s correct PIR where the investor has notified the PIE with an incorrect rate. However, submissions by PIE providers and their representatives to the Finance and Expenditure Committee in response to the proposal on correcting PIRs already contained in the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill highlight the need for sufficient lead in time to allow PIEs to change their systems to incorporate rate changes notified by Inland Revenue. General consultation with PIE investors has not been undertaken. However, the proposals are beneficial to PIE investors as most investors will have tax on their PIE income deducted 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:06 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 15 IN CONFIDENCE using their correct PIR and all investors will have their PIE tax squared for a tax year using their PIR. Media attention in mid-2019 and a Parliamentary petition also raised fairness concerns around the non-refundability of overpaid tax on PIE income. The Parliamentary petition also requests, amongst other points, to place an annual obligation on Inland Revenue to notify all KiwiSaver PIE providers what their members’ PIRs should be. The main concern the petition is trying to address is that many New Zealanders (particularly those auto-enrolled into KiwiSaver) are over-taxed and unaware. At the time this Regulatory Impact Assessment was written, the petition was still open for signatures and had 348 signatures. One submission to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill suggests that a mechanism should be introduced to provide a form of refund for an over-taxed PIE investor. The Treasury have been consulted on the proposals and support them. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:06 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 16 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 6: Imp le men ta tio n a n d op er a tio n 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? The proposals would require amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. One submission the Finance and Expenditure Committee received on the KiwiSaver Bill raises concerns that as introduced it does not contain a proposal that will enable a refund for people who have overpaid PIE tax. It was submitted that a mechanism should be introduced to provide a form of refund for an over-taxed investor. Amendments to the KiwiSaver Bill would be proposed in the officials’ report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee for the Committee’s consideration. However, this will not allow for public opportunity to comment. The changes would come into effect from 1 April 2020. This would align with the date the proposal on allowing the Commissioner to correct all PIRs contained in the KiwiSaver Bill as introduced which was timed to align with the transfer of the administration of KiwiSaver from Inland Revenue’s FIRST operating system into its new START operating system. Inland Revenue would proactively advise PIE providers of the correct PIRs for their customers on incorrect PIRs. The PIE providers would need to be able to receive and apply the PIRs and this is likely to mean that PIE providers will need to make systems changes. Inland Revenue has begun discussions with PIE providers about how the correct PIR information could be provided and will work with PIE providers to ensure that the information is passed in a way that can be used by them. The square-up of PIE tax would apply from the 2019-20 tax year and would happen for the first time around June 2020 for individuals who do not have to file a tax return. For all others the PIE tax square-up will happen when they file a tax return and their income tax assessment is completed. The square-up would not require any change to the information that is currently being provided by PIE providers. The Minister of Revenue would make an announcement, on the proposal when the Finance and Expenditure Committee has reported back the KiwiSaver Bill. Inland Revenue would be responsible for the on-going administration of the new arrangements. Aligning implementation of the proposals with Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme and annual income tax refresh, would mean the cost of system changes would be absorbed into existing Business Transformation baselines. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:06 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 17 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 7 : M o n itor in g, ev a lua tio n a n d re v ie w 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue would monitor the outcomes of the proposals pursuant to the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTTP) to confirm that they match the policy objectives. Inland Revenue already collects data on PIE income and tax paid on that income. This data would be used to assess the effectiveness of the changes. The number of year-end square-ups that gave rise to an amount of PIE tax payable or refundable would show the effectiveness of the proposed changes to get PIE investors on the correct PIRs. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The final step in the GTTP is the implementation and review stage, which involves post- implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues. Post- implementation review is expected to occur around 12 months after implementation. In relation to KiwiSaver PIEs, all KiwiSaver scheme providers have an on-going relationship with Inland Revenue, which includes an annual meeting to discuss policy and operational issues that have arisen over the past year. This would provide an opportunity for scheme providers to give feedback about the effectiveness of the proposed approach to providing them with their investor’s PIR. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:06
Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation 1 Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Supplementary Analysis Report (SAR), except as otherwise explicitly indicated. The purpose of this report is to explain the policy rationale and development behind the “purchase price allocation” proposal contained in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020-21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill, as a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) was not required for the proposal. It is a modified version of the approach set out in an officials’ issues paper – Purchase price allocation – which was released for public consultation in December 2019 with Cabinet’s approval. The issues paper functioned as an interim RIA when it was considered by Cabinet and a final RIA was not required as policy decisions were made by the Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue under delegated authority from Cabinet. Therefore, this SAR has been produced to improve transparency and understanding of the policy as the amendments go through the legislative process. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis A limitation on the analysis is the absence of precedent for the proposed approach in foreign jurisdictions. However, there is one instance of the approach in current New Zealand statute, and it appears to have worked without problem for many decades. Officials are confident that the approach will achieve the desired outcome, acknowledging that aside from the aforementioned instance, it is untried and therefore less certain. Responsible Manager (signature and date): Casey Plunket Special Policy Advisor Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 27 May 2020 Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation 2 To be completed by quality assurers: Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Purchase Price Allocation Supplementary Analysis Report prepared by Inland Revenue, and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Supplementary Analysis Report meets the quality assurance criteria. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: The reviewer’s comments on earlier versions of this draft have been incorporated into the final version. Although this SAR will not be presented to Cabinet it has still been reviewed consistent with the quality assurance framework. Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation 3 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? When business assets are bought or sold, they may be subject to different tax treatments. Some assets, such as land or goodwill 1 , are generally held on capital account and are not taxable or deductible. Other assets, such as trading stock 2 and financial arrangements 3 , are held on revenue account and are both taxable and immediately deductible. Still other assets – capital assets that are expected to decline in value over time (‘depreciable property’) – are only deductible over a number of years, in line with their estimated useful lives (if the asset is sold for more than its depreciated value, the excess deductions are clawed back as taxable income). Parties to a sale of two or more assets with different tax treatments (a ‘mixed supply’) are required to allocate the total sale/purchase price between the various assets for tax purposes. The allocation determines the vendor’s tax liability from the sale, and the purchaser’s cost base for claiming deductions in the future. To correctly account for the business going forward, the owner must maintain a schedule for any depreciable assets – which have different depreciation rates – and a register of all the other assets, some of which may be bought or sold separately. The policy problem is that currently, vendors and purchasers are able to adopt different price allocations that minimise their own tax liabilities, resulting in an overall loss to the revenue base. Moreover, in a small number of cases, parties have been found to adopt different allocations in their tax returns despite having agreed an allocation during the sale process. The problem stems from the existing legal framework governing purchase price allocation. Under the Income Tax Act 2007, parties are generally required to ascribe market values to the assets transferred. But market value is a range rather than a single value and the parties are not required to use the same market values, other than for trading stock (the specific instance alluded to earlier where a rule akin to the proposed approach – discussed in the next section – is already used). There is also some doubt about how the law applies to a purchaser of depreciable property. Consequently, the vendor can allocate lower amounts to depreciable property and financial arrangements, which are taxable, and higher amounts to non-taxable capital assets, to reduce its tax liability, while the purchaser can allocate higher amounts to depreciable property and financial arrangements in order to maximise its deductions over time. Since the law does not require consistency, it is difficult for the Commissioner to challenge different allocations that are both based on market values, despite the result being a loss to the tax base. Investigations undertaken by Inland Revenue into a number of large commercial property transactions have revealed discrepancies between vendor and purchaser allocations resulting in overall revenue losses in the millions of dollars. Given the cost and uncertainty of disputes, these losses are often unable to be eliminated. If the status quo continues, such outcomes are likely to recur. 1 Any excess of the total sale price above the aggregate value of all the assets being sold, attributable to the established reputation of the business. 2 Items bought and sold regularly in the course of a business, such as books in a bookstore. 3 Arrangements under which a person receives money in exchange for providing money at a future time, such as loans. Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation 4 Officials do not consider these discrepancies to be justifiable. In a normal commercial transaction, the vendor and purchaser will take different views of the value of an asset. The vendor will not sell the asset unless it thinks the asset is worth less than the purchaser is willing to pay for it, and the purchaser will not buy the asset unless it thinks the opposite. But the asset is sold and bought for a single price, and that price is the amount taken into account in the tax returns for both parties. There is no obvious reason to depart from this “single price” principle where multiple assets are sold together. 2.2 Who is affected and how? The purchase price allocation amendments affect vendors and purchasers in mixed supplies – particularly those that do not agree an allocation under current law. Compliant parties to a sale are generally not opposed to alignment between sale and purchase prices but often do not support structured rules that increase compliance costs. 2.3 What are the objectives sought in relation to the identified problem? The policy objective is to prevent revenue loss arising in mixed supplies – i.e. promote “revenue integrity” – while keeping any additional compliance and administration costs and disruption to natural commercial dynamics as small as possible. Since the only way to prevent revenue loss is for the vendor and purchaser to use the same purchase price allocation, the objective of revenue integrity can also be represented as “consistency”. Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation 5 Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options have been considered? • Option 1 – Status quo • Option 2 – Party allocation (vendor first) • Option 3 – Commissioner allocation • Option 4 – Operational approach Options 2 and 3 are the main legislative approaches considered by officials, and relate to how an allocation is made if the vendor and purchaser do not reach an agreement between themselves. Officials have always considered that if the parties agree an allocation, they should not be able to adopt separate, more favourable allocations in their tax returns. Officials have also been of the view that the allocation should always be based on relative market values (market values proportionate to the total purchase price) – in line with the current law – and that the Commissioner should be able to challenge an allocation that she considers is not so based. Other elements that did not differ between options 2 and 3 during policy development were: • Granularity of allocation: parties should not be required to agree an allocation to every individual asset, but rather asset categories with unique tax treatments – e.g. depreciable property, buildings, land, revenue account property etc. While this may leave some scope for arbitrage between different write- down rates for depreciable property, for example, the compliance cost of working out and agreeing a value for every single asset might be unrealistic for many taxpayers. • Notification of allocation: parties should be required to notify the Commissioner if they have not agreed an allocation. • De minimis: transactions falling below certain value thresholds should not be subject to the consistency requirement for purchase price allocation, as the scope for tax manipulation is not great enough to present a material risk to the revenue base. The thresholds should be a total purchase price of $1 million, or an allocation to taxable property by the purchaser of $100,000. Option 4 is the operational approach generally favoured by stakeholders. The criteria against which the options were assessed are: - Compliance costs: compliance costs for taxpayers should be minimised. - Administration costs: administration costs for Inland Revenue should be minimised. - Neutrality: the tax rules should not distort economic outcomes by incentivising business behaviours that do not make commercial sense, and are only adopted for tax reasons. They should not advantage one party over another. Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation 6 Option 1 – Status quo Vendors and purchasers can continue either to agree an allocation or to make their own separate allocations. The Commissioner can challenge allocations that she considers are not at market, but cannot require parties to adopt the same allocation. Revenue would continue to be lost where vendors and purchasers adopt separate allocations that minimise their own tax liabilities. Pros Parties would not have to change their behaviour, therefore compliance costs would be low. Cons There would likely be an ongoing substantial loss of revenue, meaning the objective of revenue integrity/consistency would not be achieved. Inland Revenue would continue to incur the administration costs associated with identifying inconsistent allocations through audit, and attempting to resolve inconsistencies without a legal basis to require resolution. Moreover, the status quo is not economically neutral, because parties adopting different allocations are relying on an effective subsidy from the revenue base to support their commercial transaction, when the transaction should stand on its own. Option 2 – Party allocation (vendor first) If the vendor and purchaser do not agree an allocation, they must step through a short sequence of rules that allow one of the parties to determine the allocation. For two months after transfer of the property, the vendor is required to determine the allocation, and must notify the purchaser and the Commissioner of it. However, the vendor cannot allocate amounts to taxable property that result in an additional loss on the sale of that property (other than for part year depreciation). 4 If the vendor fails to notify an allocation within the two-month window, the purchaser must determine the allocation, and notify the vendor and Commissioner of it. Whether the vendor or the purchaser determines the allocation, both parties must follow it in their tax returns. The allocation must be at market, and the Commissioner can challenge the allocation if she considers that it is not. If neither party notifies an allocation, the vendor is treated as disposing of the assets for market value, and the purchaser is treated as acquiring the assets for nil consideration. The effect of this is that the purchaser is unable to claim any deductions in relation to the property until it has made an allocation. This incentivises the purchaser to make and notify an allocation, which is key to achieving consistency. 4 The vendor will not be able to satisfy this rule if the total purchase price is lower than the vendor’s aggregate carrying cost of the taxable property . In this case, therefore, the minimum allocation to taxable property will be its carrying value reduced (pro rata) in proportion to the difference between the aggregate carrying cost of the taxable property and the purchase price. Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation 7 Pros This option achieves the objective of revenue integrity/consistency by driving parties towards using a single allocation. It has low administration costs, as it is the parties who must allocate, not the Commissioner. Importantly, the parties will have much better knowledge of the transaction and the assets in it than the Commissioner, and are therefore better placed to make the allocation. Cons This option appears less neutral between the vendor and purchaser, as it allows the vendor to determine the allocation in the first instance. This may be perceived as unfair by some purchasers, or may be an additional source of tension in the negotiations, which could mean increased compliance costs. However, as the purchaser will be aware of the rule when negotiating the sale, an unfavourable or undisclosed vendor allocation could be answered by a reduced purchase price. Moreover, the vendor is constrained by not being able to allocate amounts to taxable property that would result in an additional loss. Option 3 – Commissioner allocation If the vendor and purchaser do not agree an allocation, they must request an allocation from the Commissioner. The Commissioner may choose the vendor’s allocation, the purchaser’s allocation, or any other allocation within a market value range. Both parties must then follow that allocation in their tax returns. The Commissioner’s allocation cannot be challenged. The Commissioner may or may not decide to seek an external valuation to determine the allocation. Pros This option ensures revenue integrity/consistency by driving parties towards using a single allocation. It has low compliance costs, because if the parties cannot agree, it is the Commissioner who determines the allocation. The uncertainty of what the Commissioner will decide to allocate also provides a strong incentive for both parties to reach an agreement between themselves. Since neither party is given the opportunity to allocate before the other, this option is relatively neutral in its impact on the commercial dynamic. Cons The administration costs of this option could be high. The Commissioner has to dedicate resources to making an allocation every time parties fail to agree one. To avoid costly disputes, the Commissioner’s allocation has to be unchallengeable, but this is likely to be seen as unfair by aggrieved parties – particularly if the Commissioner’s position is not supported by an independent valuation. This might lead to attempts to chall enge an allocation regardless of any legal provisions, for example through judicial review. Option 4 – Operational approach The vendor and purchaser can continue either to agree an allocation or to make their own separate allocations. In the latter case, the parties are required to notify the Commissioner that they have not agreed, and to provide both the Commissioner and the other party with Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation 8 copies of their respective allocations. Penalties will apply to parties who are found not to have complied with this requirement. If the Commissioner takes issue with one or both of the parties’ allocations, she can enter into a dispute with both parties simultaneously, leveraging the associated costs as an incentive for the parties to agree an allocation. The Commissioner will issue clear guidance to the effect that vendors and purchasers should agree a purchase price allocation or risk a dispute with the Commissioner. She will also clarify the existing legislative provisions governing allocations. There will be no other changes to the legislation. Pros This approach may be seen as more subtle and targeted at the concern area – a relatively small number of large transactions where there is deliberate and substantial tax planning. It may seem fairer to vendors and purchasers than enforced legislative rules, and more neutral on transactions. Cons The Commissioner cannot require the desired outcome of consistency, because there is no legal basis for her to do so. Parties may be deterred by the costs of dispute, but they may not, and then an operational approach is ineffective at resolving the revenue risk. The Commissioner has failed to achieve consistency in a number of real disputes, and it is unlikely that this would change simply through administrative guidance. 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? The proposed approach is option 2. Officials consider that it is the best option on balance, for the reasons outlined below. Legal foundation Option 2 provides a strong legal requirement for consistency, which does not currently exist. This enables the Commissioner to mandate consistency, not merely expect it. While the operational approach (option 4) may be seen as less intrusive, it is also likely not to lead to the desired outcome in some cases. Expertise Where the parties do not agree an allocation, it is better to keep the responsibility to allocate with the parties rather than transfer it to the Commissioner, because the parties are directly engaged in the transaction and have a much better understanding of the assets being sold, and their value. The Commissioner is detached from the transaction, has no particular valuation expertise, and is largely indifferent to what allocation is chosen provided it is a single allocation and is tethered to market values. An allocation determined by the Commissioner will be seen as at least as arbitrary – if not more arbitrary – than an allocation chosen by the vendor or the purchaser, and to avoid the possibility of costly disputes that would ultimately have to be funded by the Government, the Commissioner’s Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation 9 determination has to be unchallengeable. Stakeholder feedback has indicated that this would not be popular. Neutrality The main criticism of the proposed approach is that it favours the vendor, since, if the parties do not agree an allocation before filing their returns, the vendor is given the power to determine it first. Thus, the vendor is not incentivised to agree an allocation, and the rules disrupt the neutrality of the commercial dynamic. However, officials consider that this concern is overstated for the reasons outlined below. In the first place, if the allocation is important to the purchaser, the purchaser can insist on agreeing the allocation with the vendor as a condition of the deal. If the vendor is not prepared to agree the allocation, the purchaser may either refuse to go ahead with the transaction, or lower its price. These strategies operate as a counterbala nce to the vendor’s perceived advantage. Even if the vendor gets the opportunity to determine the allocation, it is constrained by not being able to allocate amounts to taxable property that result in an additional loss. This means that the purchaser’s cost basis for claiming deductions in the future cannot be lower than the vendor’s basis would have been had the transaction not occurred. It also means that if the vendor considers the value of taxable property to be lower than its current carrying value, it is incentivised to agree an allocation with the purchaser to avoid paying more tax on the transaction than it thinks is appropriate. Thus, the ability for the vendor to determine the allocation is only advantageous if it thinks the taxable property is worth more than its carrying value. Probabilistically, it seems reasonable to assume this might only be the case half of the time. Finally, the Commissioner can challenge an allocation that she considers is not based on market values. If the amounts allocated by the vendor to taxable property are unjustifiably low (even taking into account the aforementioned constraint), and the transaction is sufficiently large, the Commissioner may intervene and substitute an allocation that is more favourable to the purchaser. Awareness of the rules Another related concern with the proposed approach is that parties may not turn their minds to the tax implications of the transaction until after the sale and purchase is completed, and then the vendor has the power to allocate. This may occur in multiple bid scenarios, or where parties are distressed. If parties neglect to consider tax until filing their returns, then the result will be either that the purchaser must settle for the vendor’s market values or the vendor for the purchaser’s, if more than two months have elapsed since the property was transferred. However, officials consider that this is unlikely to occur if the parties are well advised and the rules are signalled so that taxpayers and advisors are aware of them. Officials anticipate that taxpayers will adapt sale and purchase practices to ensure there is sufficient time for an allocation to be agreed before the transaction is completed. Moreover, for the reasons given in the previous section, officials do not think purchasers will be significantly disadvantaged by a vendor-determined allocation.

Other parties Total Monetised Benefit Estimated $154 million over forecast period Non-monetised benefits Medium Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation 11 4.2 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? Some sale and purchase transactions may take longer as a result of a single allocation having to be used. This may place more pressure on some purchasers in multi-bid deals where there is competition with foreign purchasers that are not subject to the consistency rule. Officials note, however, that purchasers from different jurisdictions may be on an unequal footing already for a variety of reasons that are unrelated to purchase price allocation. Section 5: Stakeholder views 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? Officials engaged in targeted consultation with the Corporate Taxpayers Group (CTG), Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ), KPMG, PwC, Deloitte and Russell McVeagh, and an official’s issues paper – Purchase price allocation – was released for public consultation in December 2019. Submissions on the issues paper were received from the above stakeholders as well as Business NZ, Bell Gully, the New Zealand Law Society, nsaTax, Chapman Tripp, and EY. Almost all stakeholders support the proposition that parties to a mixed supply should adopt the same purchase price allocation. A number of advisors have noted that they always advise their clients to agree an alloc ation, as it is considered best practice from a tax perspective. However, clients do not always follow this advice. A few stakeholders disagree with the central premise that parties should always be required to agree on the value ascribed to an asset, as parties could legitimately take different views of its value (officials acknowledge this reality but do not think it is a valid reason to treat the asset as being sold for two different values for tax purposes). Nearly all stakeholders disagreed with the proposals set out in the issues paper for legislative reform. Many felt that legislative measures were unnecessary or overly burdensome, and that the policy objectives could instead be achieved operationally through better enforcement of the existing law and the publication of additional guidance for businesses on price allocations. The strongest concern expressed by most stakeholders was that the approach set out in the issues paper gave too much power to the vendor, by allowing the vendor to determine the allocation if the parties could not reach agreement. Stakeholders were not convinced that the purchaser would always have the negotiating power to insist that the vendor agree an allocation with it, or that the parties would always turn their minds to tax during the negotiation, and once the transaction was completed, the purchaser would have no recourse. In response to these concerns, officials made a significant modification to the proposal: the vendor cannot allocate amounts to taxable property (depreciable property, revenue Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation 12 account property, financial arrangements) that result in an additional loss on that property. Therefore, the vendor cannot, for example, allocate to an item of depreciable property an amount that is less than its adjusted tax value. This constraint protects the purchaser from an unreasonably low vendor allocation that may not be challenged by the Commissioner. It also means that the purchaser cannot end up with a lower cost basis for deductions than the vendor would have had if the transaction had not occurred. This enhances the neutrality of the rules. The modification went some way to allaying stakeholder concerns, but stakeholders are still in disagreement with the proposals. The majority are of the view that legislation is unnecessary, and thus would not agree with the amendments in any form. Officials explored the possibility of an operational solution early on, but determined that it would not be effective, as ultimately the Commissioner would have no legal basis on which to require the desired outcome of revenue integrity/consistency. Parties might choose to agree an allocation, but that is the case under the status quo, and the lack of an obligation for them to do so is the problem perpetuating the loss of revenue. Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation 13 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? The new rules will be legislated via the Taxation (Annual Rates 2020-21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill, and will apply to agreements for the disposal and acquisition of property entered into on or after 1 April 2021. In conjunction with the enactment of the legislation, Inland Revenue will publish guidance on the new rules so that taxpayers and advisors are aware of them and have time to prepare. Officials note that the basic requirement for parties to make a purchase price allocation is not new, so a long lead-in period is not necessary. For vendors and purchasers in mixed supplies that agree an allocation, nothing will be different, other than that they will now be obliged under income tax law to follow the agreed allocation in their tax returns (which happens in almost all cases in any event). For parties that do not agree an allocation before filing their returns, but determine that the transaction falls below at least one of the two de minimis thresholds – a $1 million transaction value or a $100,000 allocation to taxable property by the purchaser – nothing will be different. Officials envisage that these thresholds will exclude many rental property sales (as residential buildings cannot be depreciated by the purchaser and are therefore not counted towards the taxable property threshold), as well as some small business sales. Where parties do not agree an allocation and both de minimis thresholds are exceeded, whichever party unilaterally allocates under the new rules will have to notify both the other party and the Commissioner of its allocation. This will tell the other party what values it must use to complete its tax return, and will give the Commissioner visibility of the allocation, so that she is in a position to ensure the other party follows it, and to challenge it if necessary. The notification procedures are set out in section 14 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Compliance with the new rules will be monitored through routine audit and through evaluation of any allocations notified to the Commissioner by the parties. Overall, implementation risks are low, provided the rules are well-signalled, as they are intended to be. Supplementary Analysis Report: Purchase Price Allocation 14 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Officials will engage with the tax advisory community and Inland Revenue investigators again when the rules are in force to seek feedback on how the rules are working for vendors and purchasers. Officials considered requiring all vendors and purchasers in mixed supplies to notify the Commissioner of their allocation, regardless of whether they agreed the allocation or not, however this would increase compliance costs for taxpayers and officials expect the monitoring methods outlined above to be sufficient. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? Policy officials maintain strong communication channels with stakeholders in the tax advisory community, and these stakeholders will be able to correspond with officials about the operation of the new rules at any time. If problems emerge, they will be dealt with either operationally, or by way of legislative amendment if needed.
Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 1 IN CONFIDENCE Impact Summary: Lowering the student loan repayment threshold for non-salary and wage income and repealing withholding changes for student loan income Sec tio n 1 : G en er a l in fo r ma tion Purpose Inland Revenue is responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Statement, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice have been produced for the purpose of informing key (or in-principle) policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis The key limitations on the analysis are as follows. T h r e s h o l d ch a n g es In preparation for the transition of Student Loans repayments to IRD’s new systems and process, an issue has been discovered. If not addressed, the issue would affect the integrity of the system and introduce inequity. The administration of Student Loans is due to go live as of April 2020, so it is necessary to address this issue immediately. This urgency has imposed a limitation on analysis. No consultation with external stakeholders The timing around the identification of this issue has meant that no consultation has occurred with borrowers or representative groups. However, only approximately 25 borrowers per year are expected to be affected. Scale of the problem and impact on borrowers The scale of the problem is low. The proposal is limited to borrowers whose total income is above the $19,760 repayment threshold and who have between $500 and $1500 of non- salary and wage income. From information Inland Revenue holds, the total number of borrowers who earned over the loan repayment threshold and had non-salary and wage income between $500 and $1500 was 25 borrowers for the 2018 income year. In terms of the impact on borrowers, the maximum increase in repayment obligations will be $179 per annum. If borrowers pay this amount, then the time it will take them to repay their loan will be reduced slightly. If borrowers do not pay, then the amount will be capitalised back onto their loan and the loan balance and term of the loan will remain the same. No penalties will be imposed for non-payment. Impact of proposals on the student loan valuation The benefits from the proposal will not have a material impact on the student loan valuation None of the limitations materially affect the analysis. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:19 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 2 IN CONFIDENCE W i t h h o l d i n g c h a n g e s In the process of consultation on the implementation of changes previously passed into law, officials have been made aware that the change to require student loan repayments to be withheld from schedular, casual agricultural, and election day income earned by borrowers would impose significant compliance costs on employers. These issues were not raised previously in public consultations on the policy proposals or in submissions to select committee. This urgency does not materially affect the analysis. Responsible Manager (signature and date): Martin Neylan Principal Policy Advisor Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 18 September 2019 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:19 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 3 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 2 : Pro b le m de fin itio n an d o bjec tiv es 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? T h r e s h o l d ch a n g e s The student loan scheme currently has a $1500 threshold for non-salary and wage income for New Zealand-based borrowers, above the annual repayment threshold. Borrowers who earn $1500 or less of non-salary and wage income (including schedular, casual agricultural, and election day income) in a year are not required to notify Inland Revenue of this income for student loan purposes and do not have to make student loan repayments on it. If a borrower earns more than $1500 of non-salary and wage income, they are required to make repayments on the full amount. This threshold was introduced when most salary and wage earners were not required to file a tax return and recognised the additional compliance costs associated with borrowers advising Inland Revenue of their income for student loan purposes only. However, from 1 April 2019, legislative changes were made to the administration of individual’s income tax. Now all taxpayers either file a return or have their income tax automatically squared up at the end of the tax year based on information from third parties reported during the year or information provided for tax purposes at the end of the year. As a result, there is no longer a significant compliance cost for borrowers in advising Inland Revenue of their non-salary and wage income. Therefore, the current threshold is set at a level that is higher than the compliance costs involved in providing this information to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme is now moving the repayment of student loans into the new computer systems and processes. This process has highlighted the issue of the $1500 threshold being set at a level that does not reflect the compliance costs involved in providing information to Inland Revenue. It is also an opportune time to reduce the threshold and any changes to the threshold would be included in this transformation process. W i t h h o l d i n g c h a n g e s Legislation currently enacted and due to take effect from 1 April 2020 would require Student loan deductions to be made from schedular, casual agricultural, and election day income each pay day. This change would affect approximately 33,000 borrowers and approximately 11,000 employers. These changes were intended to address non-compliance by some borrowers earning this income. They would impose compliance costs on employers and potentially reduce compliance costs on borrowers. The changes do not affect the borrower’s overall student loan repayment obligations but would have changed the way that these are met. Rather than make two interim payments and have an end-of-year square-up, borrowers would instead have deductions made from their income with an end-of-year square-up. Consultation as part of Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme has indicated that this change would impose significant, unforeseen, compliance costs on employers. These costs vary depending on the size of the employer and the complexity of their systems, but consultation has indicated that these costs are typically relatively large, both initially and on an ongoing basis. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:19 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 4 IN CONFIDENCE 2.2 Who is affected and how? T h r e s h o l d ch a n g e s The proposal is to reduce the threshold would affect borrowers with non-salary and wage income of between $500 and $1500 above the $19,760 repayment threshold. The number of borrowers likely to be affected is 25 borrowers per year. The maximum additional repayment amount resulting from lowering the threshold would be $179 per annum per borrower payable with their end of year tax return. Those borrowers with non-salary and wage income either above $1500 or below $500 would not experience a change in their current treatment. Retaining the current threshold level increases inequity between borrowers with salary and wage income (who make repayments on all income above the repayment threshold) and those with non-salary and wage income (who have an additional $1500 above the $19,760 repayment threshold before repayments apply). This change would mean that approximately 25 affected borrowers each year would be required to make repayments and if payments are made, these would reduce the term of their loans. If the affected borrowers do not make payments, provisions in the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 allow unpaid amounts of less than $334 to be capitalised back onto the loan balance, so no borrowers whose total non-salary and wage income is between $500 and $1,500 will be subject to penalties if they do not make repayments and the debt to the Government will not increase. W i t h h o l d i n g c h a n g e s The change to student loan deductions on schedular, casual agricultural, and election day income would impose compliance costs on employers and seeks to reduce non- compliance by recipients of these payments. Repealing these provisions would avoid these compliance costs being imposed. 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? The need for a quick response to this issue and the integrity issues mean that only three options are available for consideration – retaining the current $1500 threshold (the status quo), lowering the threshold to zero, or lowering the threshold to $500 (which is the option preferred by officials). Sec tio n 3: O p tio n s id e n tifica tio n 3.1 What options have been considered? 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:19 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 5 IN CONFIDENCE T h r e s h o l d ch a n g e s There were three options considered, namely: to retain the current threshold; to reduce the threshold to zero; or to reduce the threshold to a lower amount of $500. The following criteria have been used to assess the options: • Efficiency • Equity between borrowers • Compliance costs • Economic (maintaining the value of the loan asset) Retaining the existing threshold This option would: Pros • Not result in any change for borrowers or Inland Revenue or require any legislative change Cons • gives an unintended financial benefit to borrowers with non-salary and wage income under the $1500 threshold as they are not required to make loan repayments on this income • treat borrowers under the $1500 threshold differently to other borrowers • the student loan scheme becomes inconsistent with how other taxes are administered • the term of borrowers’ loans would be longer than necessary • the government would carry this student loan debt for longer. Reducing the threshold to zero. These borrowers would pay the increased obligation as part of their end-of-year assessment process. This option would: Pros • remove the financial benefit to borrowers with non-salary and wage income compared to other borrowers • improves loan repayments/reduces the term of the loan • reduces the period the government carries the debt Cons • this option would introduce another inequity as the threshold would be set at a level that is lower than similar compliance cost reduction thresholds used for the administration of income tax (where outstanding amounts of less than $50 are not pursued). • Compliance costs would be incurred by affected borrowers in understanding the changes and making repayments, but these would be similar to the costs incurred by other borrowers with repayment obligations. • Consultation has not occurred with affected borrowers. • Legislative changes are required to give effect to this proposal Reducing the threshold from $1500 to $500 (The preferred option) Reducing the threshold to $500 would equate to $60 of loan repayments. This is very close to the $50 threshold for income tax owed from an automated assessment, where amounts less than $50 owed are written off. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:19 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 6 IN CONFIDENCE These borrowers would pay the increased obligation as part of their end of year assessment process. This option would: Pros • Set the threshold at a level that is similar to other thresholds used to administer income tax (where outstanding amounts are not pursued). • remove the financial benefit to borrowers under the threshold compared to other borrowers • improve equity among borrowers (between those with non-salary and wage income of $1500 or less and other borrowers) • increased equity increases the integrity of the loan scheme. • improve loan repayments/reduce the term of the loan • reduce the period the government carries the debt Cons • Compliance costs would be incurred by affected borrowers in understanding the changes and making repayments, but these would not be material as they would be incurred in complying with their income tax obligations. • Consultation has not occurred with affected borrowers. • Legislative change is required W i t h h o l d i n g c h a n g e s For the changes to the student loan withholding requirements, the option that has been considered is to repeal the provisions, so that these changes do not come into force and that the current arrangements continue. Options briefly considered and rejected were to defer the application date or to make the changes optional for employers. Making the changes optional would create greater complexity and uncertainty for borrowers, employers and Inland Revenue. Deferring the application date would give employers more time to implement the changes but is unlikely to reduce the compliance costs. 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? T h r e s h o l d ch a n g e s The preferred option is to reduce the threshold level to $500. This would increase equity among borrowers and reflect the original intent that borrowers who are not subject to high compliance costs should make loan repayments. W i t h h o l d i n g c h a n g e s For the changes to the student loan withholding requirements, the preferred option is to repeal the provisions as this minimises compliance costs. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:19 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 7 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 4: Imp ac t An a ly s is (Pr o po se d ap p r oa ch) 4.1 Summary table of costs and benefits Affected parties (identify) Comment: nature of cost or benefit (eg ongoing, one-off), evidence and assumption (eg compliance rates), risks Impact $m present value, for monetised impacts; high, medium or low for non- monetised impacts T h r e s h o l d ch a n g e s Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties (borrowers with non-salary and wage income between $500 and $1500) Compliance costs: The ongoing compliance costs are not expected to be material as they would be incurred in complying with income tax obligations. One-off cost may be incurred in understanding the changes. These would be short lived. Financial Impact: The maximum financial impact on the affected borrowers (approximately 25 borrowers per year) is increased repayments of $179 per annum for borrowers who are over the $19,760 repayment threshold. If a borrower is under the repayment threshold, they would not have to make any repayments. As the repayment obligation is based on the borrower’s income, we expect that most would be able to make the additional repayment. If borrowers are unable to make the additional repayments, they would not be subject to any penalties and so would not be made worse off.

Total Monetised Cost Low Non-monetised costs Low Expected benefits of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties (borrowers with non-salary and wage income between $500 and $1500) Borrowers who pay the increased repayment will slightly reduce the term of the loan. Borrowers who do not pay will have the amount added back to their loan. They will not incur any penalties for non- payment and the term of their loan will remain same.

T h r e s h o l d ch a n g e s Officials have not identified other impacts as a result of the proposal. There is uncertainty around borrower behaviour towards these loan repayments and the extent to which these amounts will be repaid. Some borrowers will pay, some will have their loan repayments amalgamated with other tax obligations, and others will not pay. W i t h h o l d i n g c h a n g e s Removing the withholding requirements is likely to mean that compliance rate for the borrowers effected may remain lower than the wider population of student loan borrowers. Inland Revenue are considering ways that this can be addressed operationally. Non-monetised costs Low Expected benefits of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties (borrowers earning these types of income and their employers) Employers have indicated that there are significant compliance costs to implement the changes, so repealing these changes will mean that they do not face these costs.

T h r e s h o l d ch a n g e s Consultation with representative groups has not occurred to date. Consultation will occur with representative groups as part of Business Transformation stakeholder engagement activities in implementing the changes. W i t h h o l d i n g c h a n g e s The proposal to repeal the earlier withholding changes is a direct response to concerns raised by employers during recent consultation that they would face significant and unforeseen compliance costs unless the previous law changes were repealed before the take effect on 1 April 2020. These issues were not previously identified in earlier public consultation on the policy proposals or in submissions to select committee. Sec tio n 6: Imp le men ta tio n a n d op er a tio n 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? T h r e s h o l d ch a n g e s Lowering the threshold requires a legislative change to the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011. It is intended that this change be included at the Select Committee stage of the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill. The change will apply from 1 April 2020, which is the same date that other student loan changes apply from. Inland Revenue will be responsible for the ongoing operation of this threshold. The change will be implemented as part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation Release 4 changes which incorporate the repayment of Student Loans into the new systems and processes. The risks associated with this proposal are being managed as part of the wider risks to do with the Transformation programme. Information on the change will be incorporated with other communications to affected borrowers once the legislation is enacted. W i t h h o l d i n g c h a n g e s Repealing the withholding changes will not require any implementation as this maintains current arrangements. As part of educating employers before release 4, Inland Revenue would ensure that it is clear that these provisions are intended to be repealed so that no employers make changes to their systems to comply with the repealed provisions. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-01-12 19:02:19 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 11 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 7 : M o n itor in g, ev a lua tio n a n d re v ie w 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored?

Full Impact Statement Template | 1 \[SENSITIVE\] Coversheet: Introducing a new top personal income tax rate Advising agency Inland Revenue Decision sought Agreement to introduce a new top personal income tax rate of 39 percent for income over $180,000 Proposing Ministers Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue Summary: Problem and Propos ed Approac h Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? As signalled in the Labour party’s 2020 Election Manifesto, the Government has committed to introducing a new top personal income tax rate of 39 percent on income over $180,000. This is to meet two objectives: • A revenue objective: The Government is raising extra revenue to reduce the fiscal impact of higher operating allowances proposed in its fiscal strategy. • A distributional objective: The Government is seeking to raise this additional revenue in a way which has as little as possible impact on low- and middle-income earners and thus increases the progressivity 1 of the tax system. This Impact Statement analyses how to implement the new rate in a way that best meets the Government’s revenue and distributional objectives while minimising unintended impacts. 1 Progressivity of income tax refers to the degree to which the tax system taxes a larger share of an individual’s income as it increases. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-11-26 13:53:20 Full Impact Statement Template | 2 \[SENSITIVE\] Summary of Preferred Option or Conclusion (if no preferred option) How will the agency’s preferred approach work to bring about the desired change? Why is this the preferred option? Why is it feasible? Is the preferred approach likely to be reflected in the Cabinet paper? The proposal is for a new marginal tax rate and threshold to raise the top personal income tax rate. The options identified in this Impact Statement analyse the other potential changes that could be made to complement and/or buttress the introduction of a 39 percent tax rate on income exceeding $180,000. Option 5 is for the 39 percent personal rate to be implemented alongside a corresponding increase in the trustee income tax rate (the trustee rate) and with consideration of integrity measures, , over the next year. This is Inland Revenue’s preferred option. This is the preferred option as it will reduce opportunities to avoid the 39 percent personal income tax rate through the use of trusts. For example, without increasing the trustee rate, income can be taxed in a trust at a rate of 33 percent and then distributed tax-free to a beneficiary of the trust. Increasing the trustee rate eliminates this possibility for stepping around the 39 percent rate. Alignment of the top personal income tax rate and the trustee rate, with integrity measures being investigated over the next year, will ensure that both the revenue objective and the distributional objective are best met when introducing a new top personal income tax rate. Option 4, which increases the top personal rate without increasing the trustee rate but involves consideration of integrity measures, will be less effective than Option 5 at preventing structuring activity with the purpose of avoiding the top tax rate due to continuing misalignment of tax rates. Inland Revenue expects Option 4 and Option 5 to be raised in the Cabinet paper as alternative options, with timing variation options for raising the trustee rate also being presented. Inland Revenue’s preferred approach is Option 5. Section B: Summary Impacts : Benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? In general, all taxpayers not subject to a new top personal income tax rate will benefit from higher government expenditure or lower expected tax rates on their income in the future. Assuming Option 2 (raising the top personal rate with no change to the trustee rate), the introduction of a new top personal income tax rate will generate more revenue for the 2r4hxlcklw 2020-11-26 13:53:20 s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) Full Impact Statement Template | 3 \[SENSITIVE\] Government. This is likely to be used to reduce the fiscal impact of higher operating allowances proposed in the Government’s fiscal strategy. Introducing a new top personal rate of 39 percent applying to income over $180,000 (without any other changes to tax settings) is expected to raise $2.22 billion over the forecast period as shown in Table 1: Table 1: Estimated revenue from a 39 percent tax rate on income above $180,000 2 Fiscal year 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 Total over forecast period Estimated tax revenue ($m) 95 160 830 540 595 2,220 These revenue estimates are highly uncertain. This uncertainty arises because: • The revenue estimates are sensitive to assumptions about how much people change their behaviour in response to the tax (e.g. reducing hours, diverting income into another entity). There is significant uncertainty in these assumptions and changing them results in substantial changes in revenue. • The full impact of COVID-19 on the income distribution is not yet clear. This proposal will raise additional tax revenue from some high-income earners with no direct impact on low- and middle- income earners. It is likely to increase the progressivity of the tax system and reduce measured after-tax income inequality. The Treasury estimates that a 39 percent top personal rate applying to income above $180,000 (without any other changes to tax settings) will reduce the Gini coefficient 3 for individual after-tax income by an estimated 0.2 percentage points (from 0.493 to 0.491). This small impact reflects the relatively few people earning above $180,000 and, consequently, the relatively small impact this tax increase has on the overall income distribution. This is a very imprecise impact as it assumes no behavioural response and does not account for shifting of income into other (lower-taxed) entities. 4 The benefits of the proposal will reduce to the extent that the 39 percent tax rate can be sidestepped by taxpayers e.g. by earning income through a trust. Therefore, options which reduce the scope for this behaviour will increase the benefits of the proposal. As shown in Table 2, raising the trustee rate at the same time as the top personal rate (Option 5) is expected to raise $3.7 billion in total over the forecast period. 2 The figures in Table 1 and Table 2 are affected by the timing of provisional and final tax payments. The revenue has a lumpy profile due to the timing of provisional and terminal tax of non-wage earners. Initially, non-wage earners are forecast to pay the higher top personal rate through terminal tax, which is measured with a lag as returns for 2021/22 are filed during the 2022/23 fiscal year. Subsequently, they pay the higher top personal rate through provisional tax payments also impacting the 2022/23 fiscal year. This results in a spike measured within the 2022/23 fiscal year. 3 The Gini coefficient is one measure of income inequality ranging from zero (perfect equality; a uniform income distribution) to one (maximal inequality; one person derives all income). 4 Unless effective integrity measures are adopted, it could be regressive at the highest income levels where people earning amounts just over $180,000 pay a marginal tax rate of 39 percent and people earning very high incomes from businesses and investments pay a marginal tax rate of 33 percent. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-11-26 13:53:20 Full Impact Statement Template | 4 \[SENSITIVE\] Table 2: Estimated revenue from a 39 percent tax rate on income above $180,000, and an increase in the trustee rate to 39 percent Fiscal year 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 Total over forecast period Estimated tax revenue ($m) 95 355 1,390 890 975 3,705 Where do the costs fall? Introducing a new top personal income tax rate as designed in this proposal will directly impact those people earning above $180,000 of personal income. This includes salary and wage earners, investors holding assets and shares directly, as well as sole traders and partners in partnerships. The additional expected tax paid by this group is noted in the section above ($2.22 billion over the forecast period if the 39 percent rate is introduced without any other changes). An increase in the trustee rate would impose the 39 percent tax rate on taxpayers who benefit from income in trusts, resulting in total tax of $3.7 billion over the forecast period. Table 3 below shows the number of people potentially impacted by the introduction of a higher top personal rate and the additional tax they would pay. The table assumes no change in the income distribution as a result of COVID-19-related shocks.

If more structuring activity than expected occurs as a result of people avoiding the 39 percent rate, then the revenue generated by this proposal will be less than forecast. This has non- monetary impacts as well, such as eroding public confidence in the tax system and voluntary compliance. This would have a negative impact on tax integrity. The Cabinet paper proposes that Inland Revenue will collect more information on trust assets, liabilities, and distributions. This will increase compliance costs for trustees on top of recent changes to the Trust Act 2019, but it is necessary to ensure the effectiveness of the policy and it will be an important part of monitoring any systemic issues. These costs will be mitigated by endeavouring to collect the information in the most efficient manner, but a lack of consultation may mean that lower-cost options to collect the information are missed. The cost is likely to be material because of the large number of trustee tax returns (245,000) Inland Revenue collects annually. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts? How significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? The unintended impacts of the proposal can generally be categorised as economic impacts or integrity impacts. The main risk of the proposal is that the tax revenue collected from the proposal may be less than expected due to structuring arrangements. Unintended economic impacts include the efficiency costs from higher taxes on individual investment and savings, business investment, and human capital and labour markets. These are inevitable (but unintended) downsides of a new higher top marginal tax rate. The costs are likely to be higher per dollar of revenue raised the easier it is for high-income earners to sidestep the new higher tax rate. If it is particularly easy to step around paying higher rates of tax, the additional revenue raised falls while total costs increase as more people change their behaviour, even if the cost to any individual is small.

Given that the Government has committed to introducing a new top personal income tax rate, Inland Revenue is recommending an option that minimises the unintended economic impacts through ensuring alignment of the top personal rate and the trustee rate as well as further investigation of integrity measures. Unintended integrity impacts include impacts resulting from structuring to avoid the 39 percent rate. Inland Revenue considers the risk of these impacts to be significant and the preferred approach for mitigating these risks is to increase the trustee rate as well as investigating integrity measures. The integrity risks can be mitigated in two ways: • By imposing a 39 percent rate on trustee income, since trusts are the primary vehicle that high-income taxpayers are most likely to use to divert income that would otherwise be taxed at their 39 percent personal rate. 5 • By investigating specific integrity measures . These would necessarily be less effective than taxing the entities themselves at 39 percent. A more substantial discussion of these impacts is included later. Section C: Evidence certainty and quality ass urance Agency rating of evidence certainty? Tax policy settings and the impact of tax rate changes have been comprehensively studied both nationally and internationally. Theoretical effects of tax rate changes are well- established and are mostly supported by empirical research. Inland Revenue collects comprehensive data on relevant parameters concerning tax rate changes, such as on distributions of taxable income, on self-employment data, on trustee income, and other measures. Inland Revenue is confident that it can assess the likely qualitative and directional impacts of the proposal. However, it is recognised that there is significant uncertainty in attempting to quantify the magnitudes of these impacts. This is largely because it is difficult to forecast the aggregate behavioural response to an increase in the top personal income tax rate. This uncertainty will become even greater over time as more people consider whether they can successfully step around the new rate via a structuring arrangement. There is also a risk to the expected benefit associated with a high level of uncertainty surrounding the revenue estimates. This is a further consequence of being unable to accurately predict the overall behavioural response to the proposal. This uncertainty has been emphasised in advice provided to the Government. 5 This would still allow taxpayers to divert income to a company, which would be taxed on that income at 28 percent. That income would then be subject to a further 11 percent of tax when distributed to the shareholder. This reduces the attractiveness of companies to avoid the 39 percent rate compared to trusts. However, it does not eliminate it, as the company could still be sold by the taxpayer without any further tax impost. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-11-26 13:53:20 s 9(2)(f)(iv) Full Impact Statement Template | 7 \[SENSITIVE\] To be completed by quality assurers: Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Quality Assurance Panel with representatives from Inland Revenue and the Treasury. Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance Panel considers that the information and analysis summarised in the RIS partially meets the quality assurance criteria. This is because some key elements of the proposals have not been consulted on and will not be consulted on prior to being implemented. As noted in section 2.4, stakeholders are likely to raise concerns with the lack of consultation on proposed changes to increase the trustee tax rate and to introduce new information reporting requirements for trusts. Under these proposals additional tax and compliance costs would be imposed on a large number of trustees – Inland Revenue receives approximately 245,000 income tax returns from trustees per year. The absence of consultation means Inland Revenue currently has a limited understanding of the compliance costs that trusts will face with the proposed new information requirements and how large these costs are. The RIS was therefore unable to determine whether the potential integrity benefits from the proposed trust information disclosure outweighed the compliance costs it would impose. However, as noted in section 7.2, Inland Revenue will conduct a post-implementation review of the proposed information requirements for trusts in 2021 which will include consultation with the affected trustees to determine the compliance costs associated with the new requirements and to identify if any changes could be made to reduce these compliance costs. In addition, the lack of consultation was a constraint imposed on the policy process in order to implement the proposal for the 2021/22 tax year, and the risks caused by this lack of consultation are clearly spelt out in the RIS. The RIS does not consider the options presented in the Cabinet paper for collecting past- year information from trusts and for collecting trust information for purposes other than the proposed 39% personal tax rate. If these options are taken by Cabinet, the compliance costs imposed by these options should be included in the post-implementation review of the trust information measure. Section 2.4 also notes that Inland Revenue intends to consult with stakeholders on the other proposed integrity measures over the first half of 2021 so that they can be legislated for 1 April 2022. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: 2r4hxlcklw 2020-11-26 13:53:20 s 9(2)(f)(iv) Full Impact Statement Template | 8 \[SENSITIVE\] Impact Statement: Introducing a new top personal income tax rate Section 1: Ge neral informati on 1.1 Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Statement, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice have been produced for the purpose of informing key policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet. This Impact Statement analyses the Government’s proposal to introduce a new top personal income tax rate of 39 percent on incomes over $180,000. This was the Labour party’s main tax policy in its fiscal plan released ahead of the 2020 General Election. A number of different options are considered in this Impact Statement for the purposes of introducing a new top personal income tax rate. 1.2 Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis The key limitations and constraints applying to the analysis in this Impact Statement are as follows: • Restricted range of options considered: The Government has already announced its intention to introduce a new top personal income tax rate of 39 percent on income over $180,000 as part of the Labour party’s 2020 Election Manifesto. The approaches considered in this Impact Statement are limited to options that could better ensure (based on traditional tax policy criteria) that this proposed top rate applies to taxpayers as broadly as intended while minimising negative impacts. It does not consider any other ways of achieving the Government’s objectives given the pre-election announcement. • Time constraints: Ministers have decided to plan for the introduction of the new top personal income tax rate from the 2021–22 income year onward (1 April 2021 for most taxpayers). With that commencement date in mind, the proposals must be included in legislation introduced before 31 December 2020 to allow payroll software providers and employers enough time to update their systems. That leaves a significantly shortened amount of time to undertake sufficient analysis of this proposal. • Uncertainty surrounding magnitude of impacts: Inland Revenue has a strong evidence base to determine the expected qualitative effects of a higher top personal income tax rate but cannot easily quantify the magnitudes of these effects. Revenue estimates throughout this Impact Statement are sensitive to assumptions about how much people change their behaviour in response to the new rate (e.g., reducing hours, diverting income into another entity). One assumption underlying the estimates is that there is no change in the income 2r4hxlcklw 2020-11-26 13:53:20 Full Impact Statement Template | 9 \[SENSITIVE\] distribution because of current and future COVID-19-related shocks. There is significant uncertainty in these assumptions and changing them results in substantial changes in revenue. Hence, some estimates provided in this Impact Statement are subject to a wide margin of error, while other impacts are unable to be estimated at all. • Consultation: The speed at which this proposal is being advanced has meant that no active consultation has taken place. However, the intention to introduce a new top personal income tax rate was announced to the public prior to the 2020 general election, so taxpayers have been notified of the intended policy change. Inland Revenue also recommends implementing integrity measures alongside introducing a new top personal income tax rate. It would seek to consult on these measures in 2021 with implementation for 1 April 2022 (a year after the introduction of the new top personal tax rate). Inland Revenue will seek feedback on the proposed information reporting requirements for trusts following their implementation. This will occur in lieu of formal consultation before the requirements come into effect but will allow Inland Revenue to evaluate post- implementation whether the benefits of the requirements outweigh the compliance costs imposed upon trustees. 1.3 Responsible Manager: Phil Whittington Chief Economist Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 18 November 2020 2r4hxlcklw 2020-11-26 13:53:20 Full Impact Statement Template | 10 \[SENSITIVE\] Section 2: Problem defi nition and objectives 2.1 What is the current state within which action is proposed? New Zealand’s tax system is based on a broad-base low-rate framework. This means that the system seeks to minimise exemptions/concessions (broad-base) while mitigating any distortionary effects arising from absolutely or relatively high taxes (low-rate). This ensures that substantial amounts of revenue can be raised by the Government without having high tax rates. This provides two benefits: • Tax-induced distortions between different activities are minimised by having the widest possible base. • The widest possible base means a lower rate of tax is sufficient to collect required revenue. This lower rate of tax minimises any distortions between any remaining non-taxed and taxed activities. Within this framework, New Zealand has a progressive personal income tax scale. This means that the system taxes a larger share of an individual’s income as it increases. There are currently four rates and thresholds within the New Zealand personal income tax system: For each dollar of income between: Marginal tax rate: $0 to $14,000 10.5% $14,001 to $48,000 17.5% $48,001 to $70,000 30.0% $70,001 and upward 33.0% These rates have been in place since 1 October 2010. New Zealand had a top personal income tax rate of 39 percent from 1 April 2000 to 31 March 2009 (and an effective 38 percent rate from 1 April 2009 to 30 September 2010). The progressiveness of the personal income tax scale affects several other areas of the tax system, including secondary earnings and extra pay codes, fringe benefit tax, resident withholding tax, resident land withholding tax, and employer superannuation contribution tax. New Zealand’s tax system taxes trustee income at a rate of 33 percent, and distributions of trustee income from complying trusts to beneficiaries are non-taxable. Beneficiary income is taxed at the beneficiary’s marginal rates 6 (subject to the minor beneficiary rule). Portfolio investment entities (PIEs) are collective investment vehicles that pool contributions from many people for investment purposes. Income from PIEs is taxed at rates that approximate personal income tax rates. One of the key differences is that the top PIE rate is 28 percent (rather than 33 percent in the personal income tax scale). This was set due to a concern that, unless the top PIE rate matched the company rate (28 6 Whether income is treated as trustee income or beneficiary income depends on when it is distributed. Income is beneficiary income if it is distributed by the trust to the beneficiary within six months from the end of the income year in which the income is derived. Any income accumulated by a trustee for longer than this is taxed as trustee income. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-11-26 13:53:20 Full Impact Statement Template | 11 \[SENSITIVE\] percent), taxpayers would use unit trusts (unit trusts are taxed at the company rate) and avoid dividend taxation at their personal rate by having the managers of the unit trusts buy back their units. Buy-back arrangements like this are not treated as dividends and the taxpayer’s profit from the buyback is usually a non-taxable capital gain. Other important tax rates in New Zealand include a company rate of 28 percent and GST of 15 percent. Changes to these settings are out of scope for this Impact Statement. 2.2 What regulatory system(s) are already in place? The tax system is a key regulatory system in New Zealand. Tax enables the government to fund its desired spending. The tax system has a regulatory role of raising revenue in an efficient and fair way. It is desirable that the tax system is easy to comply with and hard to avoid or evade. The tax system is mostly administered by Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue is responsible for administering several different Acts and Legislative Instruments. The key tax legislation is contained in the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? The primary role of tax policy is to raise revenue for the government to spend on its functions. Good tax policy seeks to raise revenue in a way that is efficient (at a low cost to the economy as a whole) and fair (for example, taking into account distributional objectives). Inland Revenue understands that the Government wishes to raise extra revenue to reduce the fiscal impact of higher operating allowances proposed in its fiscal strategy, and that this revenue collection should have as little an impact as possible on low- to middle- income earners and add to progressivity. As signalled in the Labour party’s 2020 Election Manifesto, the Government has committed to introducing a new top personal income tax rate of 39 percent on income over $180,000. This is to meet two objectives: • A revenue objective: The Government is raising extra revenue to reduce the fiscal impact of higher operating allowances proposed in its fiscal strategy. • A distributional objective: The Government is seeking to raise this additional revenue in a way which has as little as possible impact on low- and middle-income earners and which thus increases the progressivity of the tax system. This Impact Statement analyses how to implement the new rate in a way that best meets (using traditional tax policy criteria) the Government’s revenue and distributional objectives while minimising unintended impacts. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-11-26 13:53:20 Full Impact Statement Template | 12 \[SENSITIVE\] 2.4 What do stakeholders think about the problem? The personal income tax system directly affects all New Zealanders, whether that is through each individual taxpayer being liable for an amount of income tax or through the Government’s spending as a result of income tax collection, or both. Any way of raising additional revenue that falls on some taxpayers and not on others is likely to be of most concern to those who are directly affected. A July 2020 Newshub-Reid Research poll found that 50 percent of those polled 7 supported an additional higher income tax bracket. 8 In contrast, an August 2020 BusinessNZ survey found that only 9 percent of the 1,193 business respondents supported increases in personal tax rates to address the fiscal challenges of COVID-19. 9 Inland Revenue has regular engagement with tax practitioners on policy issues/proposals and is aware of comments made in the media by parts of the sector regarding this proposal. 10 There is concern that, without corresponding increases in the trustee rate and the top PIE rate, the 39 percent rate will apply to wage/salary earners but investment income will be able to be earned through companies, PIEs, and trusts at lower rates. 11 There are concerns that this would be unfair and reduce the integrity of the tax system. The proposal would exacerbate existing tax system pressures associated with unaligned rates. 12 Because of these reasons, many commentaries are forecasting that the introduction of a new top personal income tax rate will raise less revenue than the $550 million estimated by the Labour party in its 2020 Election Manifesto. One public viewpoint is that the proposal comprises only a small adjustment to tax rates given the number of people it affects and the extent to which it affects them. The proposal can be perceived as a signal that redistribution to meet the Government’s wider objectives might happen through channels outside of the tax system. 13 Other public commentary on the policy has expressed an opinion that there have long been deficiencies in the redistribution of income, and so the proposal is a step in the right direction to fix that problem. At the same time, some people believe that this problem will exist after the implementation of the policy as well since they believe it does not go far enough. 14 7 No sample size provided, though Newshub-Reid Research polls tend to have a sample size of 1,000. 8 See https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/08/newshub-reid-research-poll-half-of-kiwis-support-taxing- biggest-earners-at-higher-rate.html 9 See page 8 of https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/nz/Documents/public-sector/businessnz-2020- election-survey.pdf 10 See, e.g., https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/122708323/labours-ultracautious-tax-policy-will-be-a-relief-to-the- wealthy; https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/123131106/labours-promised-tax-hike-may-create-rush-to-tax-lawyers 11 See, e.g., https://thespinoff.co.nz/business/16-09-2020/labours-dead-end-tax-policy-is-straight-out-of-last- century/ 12 See, e.g., https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/122712011/wealthy-could-mostly-get-around-the-39-top-tax-rate- experts-say 13 See, e.g., https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/election-2020-labours-balanced-tax-plan-draws-flak-from-political- allies-and-rich-lister/GL4F6L7GPA456TUXLNKZPPVCDY/ 14 See, e.g., https://thespinoff.co.nz/politics/13-09-2020/labour-and-national-promise-to-lock-in-existing- unfairness-in-nzs-tax-system/ 2r4hxlcklw 2020-11-26 13:53:20 Full Impact Statement Template | 13 \[SENSITIVE\] Some people have noted the pre-election statements that the trustee rate would not be increased. They recognise that there is an existing problem regarding misalignment between companies/PIEs and the top personal rate/trustees, and that this problem is exacerbated by not increasing the trustee rate. At the same time, it was noted that Inland Revenue will be expected to crack down on any aggressive structuring that seeks to exploit the discrepancies between the tax rates of different entities. 15 Given the short timeframes for developing and implementing this proposal, Inland Revenue has not undertaken any active consultation to date on introducing a new top personal income tax rate. Inland Revenue intends to consult with stakeholders on the possible integrity measures over the first half of 2021 so that they can be legislated for 1 April 2022. Inland Revenue considers that the success of these integrity measures depends on sufficient engagement with stakeholders given their potential complexity compared to the introduction of the new top personal rate alone. Although these measures would still come into effect quicker than preferred, Inland Revenue believes that the benefits of consultation during 2021 outweighs the potential integrity benefits of implementing these measures in 2021 with no consultation. If options other than Option 2 are progressed, the lack of consultation on issues to do with the trustee rate will likely be raised as a particular concern. However, if the Government raises the trustee tax rate, consultation may still be able to occur to provide useful information on potential over-taxation problems, with any solutions being able to resolve problems in the future, or potentially with retrospective effect if the design of solutions allows that. The absence of consultation is likely to result in Inland Revenue having a limited understanding of the compliance costs that trusts will face with the new information requirements and how large these costs are. Inland Revenue will conduct a post- implementation review of the proposed information requirements for trusts, which will include consultation with the affected trustees to determine the compliance costs associated with the new requirements and to identify if any changes could be made to reduce these compliance costs. 2.5 What are the objectives sought in relation to the identified problem? There are two objectives sought in relation to the issues discussed: • A revenue objective: The Government is raising extra revenue to reduce the fiscal impact of higher operating allowances proposed in its fiscal strategy. • A distributional objective: The Government is seeking to raise this additional revenue in a way which has as little as possible impact on low- and middle-income earners and is progressive. The analysis will focus on how well each proposed option meets these revenue and distributional objectives by applying traditional tax policy criteria which provide an analytical framework to assess strengths and weaknesses of individual options. 15 See, e.g., https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/nz/Documents/tax/Tax-alert/2020/nz-en-tax-alert- november-2020.pdf 2r4hxlcklw 2020-11-26 13:53:20 Full Impact Statement Template | 14 \[SENSITIVE\] Section 3: Opti on ide ntificati on 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? This options analysis looks at several packages of key design options for introducing a new top personal income tax rate of 39 percent for income over $180,000. The options identified here differ in two ways – those are whether or not they incorporate: • Alignment of the top personal income tax rate and the trustee income tax rate. 16 • Integrity measures designed to minimise opportunities for structuring activity with the purpose of avoiding the new personal rate. The analysis investigates each of the following options: • Option 1: Status quo. • Option 2: Introducing a new top personal income tax rate of 39 percent for income over $180,000 (no alignment and no integrity measures). • Option 3: Option 2 plus increasing the trustee income tax rate to 39 percent (alignment with trustee rate but no integrity measures). • Option 4: Option 2 plus investigating integrity measures to buttress the new higher personal income tax rate (no alignment but integrity measures). • Option 5: Option 2 plus both increasing the trustee income tax rate to 39 percent and investigating integrity measures to buttress the new higher personal income tax rate (alignment with trustee rate and integrity measures). These options are assessed against five criteria: • Efficiency: The options should minimise the excess burden or economic efficiency cost of the tax system (i.e., the cost of raising tax from New Zealanders which is over and above the tax revenue actually raised). This ensures that tax is doing as little as possible to distort labour supply, savings and investment, and entity decisions. • Equity: The options should ensure that taxpayers with similar levels of income pay similar levels of tax (horizontal equity) and that taxpayers on higher incomes pay higher levels of income tax in a way which reflects the Government’s views on how progressive the tax system should be (vertical equity). In Inland Revenue’s assessment of the options, the phrase “improves vertical equity” is used if a measure better meets the Government’s distributional objective of increasing the progressivity of the tax system. 16 Alignment of rates in tax contexts can also include the company rate. No change to the company rate is contemplated as part of this Impact Statement because a change to this rate is considered to be out of scope of the Government’s proposal. The company tax rate has impacts beyond its role taxing New Zealanders, including impacts on foreign investment. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-11-26 13:53:20 s 9(2)(f)(iv) Full Impact Statement Template | 15 \[SENSITIVE\] • Complexity: The options should minimise the introduction of complexity as much as possible. Generally, complexity should be minimised so that tax laws are easy to comply with and difficult not to. This encourages voluntary compliance over time, which benefits both the tax take as well as paying tax at rates intended by the Government. • Integrity: The options should maintain protection against taxpayers using other vehicles taxed at lower rates to avoid the proposed top personal income tax rate. Integrity in the tax system ensures that taxpayers cannot access methods or vehicles to avoid paying tax at rates applicable to them given their economic circumstances. This also leads to greater collection of tax revenues as well as high-income individuals paying their full amount of tax without being able to successfully engage in avoidance behaviour. This improves the fairness of the tax system and is an important factor that supports voluntary compliance. • Revenue raised: The options should be effective at raising the intended amount of revenue for the Government. Using this criterion is important to ensure the primary function of tax collection is achieved by the policy settings. The analysis of the five options against these five criteria follows. Option 1: Status quo. This option involves doing nothing. It therefore fails to achieve the Government’s fundamental revenue objective. It retains the distributional and progressivity outcomes resulting from the current personal income tax settings. Efficiency: There is no gain or loss in efficiencies associated with leaving the top personal income tax rate at 33 percent for incomes over $70,000. This is a notably low upper tax rate compared to the highest rate imposed in other jurisdictions. However, it applies at a low threshold. Equity: The status quo has no impact on any dimension of equity in the tax system. Complexity: The status quo has no impact on complexity. The existing settings are well understood publicly. Integrity: The status quo has no impact on integrity but there are already existing concerns with taxpayers undertaking arrangements that seek to avoid the application of the current top personal income tax rate of 33 percent. This is partly a function of the existing misalignment between that rate and the company rate. For example, dividend avoidance arrangements can allow a shareholder taxed at 33 percent to derive income from a company that is only subject to the corporate tax rate of 28 percent (with no 5 percent top-up tax). Revenue raised: No change in revenue raised under the status quo. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-11-26 13:53:20 Full Impact Statement Template | 16 \[SENSITIVE\] Option 2: Introducing a new top personal income tax rate of 39 percent for income over $180,000 (no alignment and no integrity measures). This option constitutes the existing commitment contained in the Labour party’s 2020 Election Manifesto regarding a new higher top personal income tax rate. It will also include consequential changes to secondary earnings and extra pay codes, fringe benefit tax, resident withholding tax, resident land withholding tax, and employer superannuation contribution tax (and this will be true for all options except for the status quo). No integrity measures would be implemented to guard against avoidance activities. However, there would still be data monitoring by Inland Revenue. This would include Inland Revenue collecting more information on trust assets, liabilities, and distributions (and again, this will be true for all options except for the status quo). This will increase compliance costs for trustees, but it will be an important part of monitoring any systemic avoidance issues. The consequential changes to other tax types and trust information collection will not constitute part of the analysis between options since they hold true for all options bar Option 1. Efficiency: The introduction of a higher top personal income tax rate, all else being equal, will create further disincentives to earn income above the level at which that new rate applies from. This change is likely to have a number of efficiency costs including through its impacts on labour supply, savings, and through influencing the allocation of investment. The efficiency costs are likely to be high per dollar of additional revenue raised compared to alternative ways to raise that revenue (including Option 3, Option 4, and Option 5) because of increased tax-induced activity of people circumventing higher rates of tax (an efficiency cost), and consequential lower amounts of additional revenue raised. If it is particularly easy to step around paying higher rates of tax, the additional revenue raised falls while total costs increase as people change their behaviour, even if the cost to any individual is small. This results in the costs per dollar of revenue raised being high, because the numerator (costs) likely grows while the denominator (revenue) falls. Equity: Introducing a new top personal tax rate will support the Government’s objective of raising additional revenue in a way that adds to progressivity without impacting on low- or middle-income earners. Individuals earning above $180,000 will have a greater amount of tax collected from them. However, incentives to structure around the new rate may result in a decrease in horizontal equity and a reduction in the progressivity benefits. Some people will find it too costly/difficult to structure to avoid the new rate (e.g., salary/wage earners), whereas other high-income earners will choose and be able to structure around the rate when they might not have under the status quo. This would decrease horizontal equity between people earning over $180,000. It could also be regressive within the group of taxpayers earning over $180,000. This is because people earning a little over $180,000 may be unwilling (due to the cost of setting up structures compared to the tax saving) or unable (due to their income being wages and salary) to reduce their marginal tax rate from 39 percent to 33 percent. However, taxpayers earning a lot more than $180,000 are more likely to derive income that can be diverted into structures (primarily trusts) that will allow them to effectively have a personal income tax rate of 33 percent, while also being more likely to have such structures. Therefore, the wealthiest will be taxed at a lower rate than those earning just over $180,000. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-11-26 13:53:20 Full Impact Statement Template | 17 \[SENSITIVE\] Complexity: The introduction of a new rate alone will increase complexity to the extent that it raises questions and induces compliance activity about whether structuring around the rate constitutes tax avoidance. It will impose compliance costs on taxpayers that need to make systems changes to accommodate the new rate. However, the absence of new integrity measures under this option also means that, outside of the question of what does and does not constitute tax avoidance, it is not significantly complex. Integrity: This option has the worst integrity outcomes. It is worse than the status quo; under existing settings, the top personal rate is the same as the trustee rate and 5 percentage points higher than the company rate and the top PIE rate. Under this option, that discrepancy would increase to an 11 percentage-point discrepancy between the top personal rate versus the company rate and the top PIE rate, and it would introduce a 6 percentage-point discrepancy between the top personal rate versus the trustee rate. This will create significant incentives for entering into arrangements to avoid the 39 percent rate. The difference between the top personal rate and the trustee rate is particularly significant, as earning income through a trust is the easiest way to avoid the top personal tax rate. The existing general anti-avoidance provision can provide some integrity protection, but this will be incomplete due to the fact-specific nature of the inquiry required to apply anti-avoidance provisions as well as the requirement to demonstrate a more-than-merely-incidental purpose of tax avoidance. Revenue raised: This option will raise more revenue than the status quo but the least compared to the other options due to the opportunities for structuring around the top personal income tax rate, as well as trustee income continuing to be taxed at 33 percent rather than 39 percent Option 3: Option 2 plus increasing the trustee income tax rate to 39 percent (alignment with trustee rate but no integrity measures). This option recognises the significant integrity concerns associated with Option 2 and attempts to mitigate some of them by aligning the trustee rate with the proposed new top personal income tax rate. The top personal rate and trustee rate would both be 39 percent (though the top PIE rate and the company rate would remain unaligned at 28 percent). No integrity measures would be investigated to guard against structuring activities. Potential downsides of this option include taxing some income accruing in trusts at 39 percent that may be attributable to lower-income beneficiaries. There are ways to mitigate this, such as distributing income to beneficiaries on lower rates as beneficiary income (so it is taxed at their marginal rates) rather than accumulating it in the trust. However, these will have their own costs and may not always be feasible (for example, the trust deed may call for restrictions on the distribution of income to beneficiaries such as before they reach a certain age). It would be possible to consult after the increase and then try to address over-taxation with any remedy having potentially retrospective effect, though this would not be an ideal consultation process. Efficiency: There will be some efficiency costs, which are an inevitable part of raising the top marginal tax rate. By raising more revenue, the total efficiency costs are likely to be higher than Option 2. However, the efficiency costs per dollar of revenue raised are likely to be lower than Option 2 because it will mean that the higher top marginal tax 2r4hxlcklw 2020-11-26 13:53:20 Full Impact Statement Template | 18 \[SENSITIVE\] rate is less able to be circumvented 17 . This is because trusts are one of the key vehicles for high-income individuals to use when a gap between the top personal rate and the trustee rate exists, which is nullified under this option. Equity: Increases in the top personal rate and the trustee rate will do a better job of raising additional tax revenue in a way that supports the Government’s vertical equity objectives than Option 1 or Option 2 as the changes will ensure a broader range of income will be taxable at the new 39 percent rate. Increasing both of these rates will be perceived to be fairer from a horizontal equity perspective compared to only introducing the new personal rate. However, opportunities for structuring will still reduce horizontal equity, making this option worse than the status quo on horizontal equity. Complexity: This option involves two rate changes but, in Inland Revenue’s view, would be less complex than having the top personal rate at 39 percent and the trustee rate at 33 percent. Not developing integrity measures under this option also means it would not be significantly complex compared to other options. Integrity: By aligning the trustee rate with the top personal rate, this option improves on the integrity concerns associated with only introducing a new top personal rate. Companies and PIEs would still be potential vehicles for stepping around the 39 percent rate, but this option would leave taxpayers with significantly fewer avenues for tax-driven restructuring (and would eliminate the easiest way to sidestep the rate). From an integrity perspective, it would lack any further measures to buttress the higher rates, which are present in some of the other options. Revenue raised: Increasing the trustee rate to 39 percent will increase revenue in addition to the revenue collected through the 39 percent personal rate. This option will also ensure less leakage from the personal tax system by mitigating structuring opportunities, meaning that more people earning income above $180,000 will pay the 39 percent rate compared to Option 2. Of these two channels, the majority of the revenue increase arises through the first (higher rate on trustee income). Option 4: Option 2 plus investigating integrity measures to buttress the new higher personal income tax rate (no alignment but integrity measures). Under this option, the introduction of the new top personal income tax rate is not matched by a corresponding increase in the trustee rate. Instead, integrity concerns are addressed to an extent by investigating and developing specific integrity measures to minimise opportunities for tax-motivated structuring activity in the absence of rate alignment. Integrity measures alone are less ideal than alignment for countering structuring arrangements. They are more complex and Inland Revenue would expect them to be less effective than rate alignment in preventing income earned by a 39 percent taxpayer from being taxed at 33 percent. The measures themselves require more development and Inland Revenue would prefer that these measures were not 17 It is possible that Option 3 could have higher aggregate efficiency costs compared to Option 2 (since the 39 percent rate would apply to more structures used for earning labour and capital income). It will also raise more revenue than Option 2 so that the efficiency cost per dollar raised is lower. This means, for example, if Option 2 and Option 3 were compared, and the rates for each chosen so that they raised the same amount of revenue, Option 3 would have a lower efficiency cost. This means Option 3 is the better policy choice from an efficiency perspective. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-11-26 13:53:20 Full Impact Statement Template | 19 \[SENSITIVE\] brought in until 1 April 2022 to allow for sufficient consultation. Efficiency: Again, this would involve the inevitable efficiency costs associated with raising the top marginal tax rate. It is likely to involve lower efficiency costs per dollar of revenue raised than Option 2 but higher efficiency costs per dollar of revenue raised than Option 3 as it would be a less effective way of preventing the top marginal tax rate from being circumvented. Total efficiency costs will depend on the nature of the integrity measures and the aggregate revenue they raise, though this is unable to be quantified. Equity: Introducing integrity measures may be perceived to be closing tax loopholes and therefore better meets horizontal equity objectives compared to Option 2 (as the measures will prevent some instances of taxpayers structuring their way out of the 39 percent rate). However, it is still worse than the status quo in terms of horizonal equity because opportunities for avoidance will still remain open to some taxpayers. The Government’s vertical equity objectives are likely to be better met than under Option 1 and Option 2, as the 39 percent rate is more enforceable with the integrity measures compared to without them. However, the misalignment of rates under this option may still present some taxpayers with opportunities to use entities to avoid the new top personal rate, thus resulting in unequal treatment among the group of taxpayers earning more than $180,000. Complexity: Investigating and developing integrity measures are likely to introduce significant complexity to the proposal. Any rules are likely to be new or not well known. These problems will be mitigated through a consultation process where stakeholders can have input into the development of integrity measures. Some arrangements that would be acceptable under any new rules may not be undertaken by taxpayers due to uncertainty as to how some integrity measures may apply, while other arrangements may be in breach of any new rules despite no malintent by the parties entering into that arrangement. This will create significant uncertainty for taxpayers. These effects will be mitigated through providing advice on how these measures would be applied/enforced on the Inland Revenue website and in the Tax Information Bulletin. Inland Revenue will also face administrative costs in enforcing any new rules, particularly if they are unfamiliar measures. Integrity: The integrity measures are less ideal than alignment of tax rates but are also an improvement on having no integrity measures at all. So long as rates are not aligned, it is likely that some taxpayers will seek to enter into structures or arrangements that enable them to bypass the 39 percent rate. Revenue raised: Although there is no alignment under this option, the introduction of a new top personal income tax rate combined with supporting integrity measures to counter structuring behaviours will lead to higher tax revenues than both Option 1 and Option 2 but lower tax revenues than Option 3 . 2r4hxlcklw 2020-11-26 13:53:20 s 9(2)(f)(iv) Full Impact Statement Template | 20 \[SENSITIVE\] Option 5: Option 2 plus both increasing the trustee income tax rate to 39 percent and investigating integrity measures to buttress the new higher personal income tax rate (alignment with trustee rate and integrity measures). This option involves the most comprehensive reform in tandem with the proposal to introduce a new top personal income tax rate. It combines both the alignment of the trustee rate in Option 3 and the investigation of integrity measures in Option 4. This is to ensure that the proposed introduction of a new top personal income tax rate is as effective as possible by reducing avenues for that new rate to be avoided. Potential downsides of this option include taxing some income accruing in trusts at 39 percent that may be attributable to lower-income beneficiaries. As noted above there are ways to mitigate this, but these will have their own costs and may not always be feasible. Efficiency: Again, this would involve the inevitable efficiency costs associated with raising the top marginal tax rate. It is likely to involve the highest aggregate efficiency costs because of the amount of revenue it raises, but lower efficiency costs per dollar of revenue raised than any of the other options by being the most comprehensive way of preventing the top marginal tax rate from being circumvented. Equity: The combination of alignment and integrity measures will ensure the most robust equity outcomes. This option would be the most difficult for people on incomes over $180,000 who are trying to structure around paying the 39 percent rate, leading to improvements in both vertical equity (compared to Options 1 to 4) and horizontal equity (compared to Options 2 to 4). Complexity: Given alignment between the new top personal rate and the trustee rate, it is likely that fewer integrity measures would be needed under this option than under Option 4. Consequently, this is likely to be a less complex option than Option 4, though it will still be more complex than the other options. The same concerns regarding taxpayer uncertainty and reluctance to undertake potentially aggressive transactions will exist, though not to the same extent as if rates were not aligned and more integrity measures were required. Integrity: This option reduces avoidance opportunities the most for the 39 percent rate. Alignment of the trustee rate with the top personal rate ensures that trusts cannot be used to avoid the new top personal rate, This option will result in the least long-term pressure on the tax system regarding rate alignment and anti-avoidance rules, resulting in the best tax integrity outcomes. Revenue raised: This option will raise the most revenue of any of the options. The corresponding increase in the trustee rate will raise extra revenue alone (as with Option 3) and the integrity measures will raise additional revenue. This measure is also the most comprehensive at minimising structuring behaviours to avoid the new top personal rate. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-11-26 13:53:20 s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) Full Impact Statement Template | 21 \[SENSITIVE\] 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? The two objectives of the tax policy reform considered in this proposal are the distributional objective and the revenue objective. These objectives encapsulate why the introduction of a new top personal income tax rate is being proposed. The criteria for analysing the options (efficiency, equity, complexity, integrity, and revenue raised) were chosen because they are some of the most important criteria for measuring the success of tax policy and directly determine how well the objectives are achieved. The importance of each of these measures for evaluating tax policy was described earlier. These criteria can conflict with one another; for example, options that rank high on integrity may tend to rank poorly on complexity (since implementing more rules reduces loopholes but creates complexity). This analysis does not consider there to be any individual criterion that will trump the others in all cases of criteria conflict. The overall evaluation and comparison of each option should be a holistic exercise based on all of the criteria in their entirety and taking note of how well each option achieves the two overarching objectives. 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? The tax policy settings under practical consideration in this Impact Statement include the top personal income tax rate, the trustee income tax rate, and the investigation of integrity measures to support any rate increases. One tax policy setting of potential relevance is aligning the company tax rate. Changes to this setting were not under consideration for the analysis in this Impact Statement because this is out of scope of the Government’s proposal. Unlike the personal and trustee rates, the company rate affects the taxation of foreign investment in New Zealand. There are also other potential tax policy reforms that could serve to achieve the distributional and revenue objectives posited in this Impact Statement, such as increasing the rate of GST while giving tax relief or other support to those on lower incomes (so the net tax increase falls on those with higher incomes) or adjusting existing tax rates/thresholds (in contrast to introducing a new one). These options and others were not discussed in this Impact Statement as they were considered to be too far removed from the current proposal. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-11-26 13:53:20 s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) Full Impact Statement Template | 22 \[SENSITIVE\] 2r4hxlcklw 2020-11-26 13:53:20 s 9(2)(f)(iv) Full Impact Statement Template | 23 \[SENSITIVE\] Section 4: Impa ct Analysis Marginal impact: How does each of the options identified in section 3.1 compare with taking no action under each of the criteria set out in section 3.2?

Inland Revenue’s analysis of the options presented in this Impact Statement concludes that Option 5 is the best package for advancing the Government’s proposal to introduce a new top personal income tax rate of 39 percent on income over $180,000. This involves both increasing the trustee rate and investigating integrity measures to buttress the new top personal income tax rate. Inland Revenue concludes that Option 5 is best because it comprises a package that implements the new 39 percent rate in a way that best meets the Government’s revenue and distributional objectives while minimising unintended impacts: • Inland Revenue considers both alignment with the trustee rate and investigating integrity measures to be key complementary decisions to support the effective introduction of a new top personal income tax rate. Option 5 incorporates both these features. Other options omitted either alignment, integrity measures, or both and, as a result, will have reduced revenue and distributional benefits. • The efficiency benefits from removing misalignment distortions as well as minimising opportunities for avoidance means that Option 5 best meets the revenue objective, by reducing the total cost of achieving the objective. • Ensuring alignment of rates alongside investigating integrity measures will likely have the strongest impact on integrity and equity within the tax system, meaning that the distributional objective is best met by this option. This Impact Statement noted that the analysis undertaken was constrained by several factors, including a restricted range of options available for consideration, time constraints, uncertainty surrounding magnitude of impacts, and insufficient consultation. Although there is a strong evidence base for the general impact of tax rate changes, the point of insufficient consultation to date will be particularly significant for the integrity measures to buttress the new higher personal income tax rate. To mitigate this, Inland Revenue’s preference is for these measures to be consulted on over the first half of 2021 so that they can be legislated for 1 April 2022, despite the likelihood that the introduction of a new top personal income tax rate could occur as early as 1 April 2021. Inland Revenue also notes that many aspects of this analysis are qualitative due to significant uncertainty around estimating fiscal costs/revenues for the various options. Given a divergence of views across New Zealand society on the optimal level of progressivity for the tax system, there will be significant numbers of people that both agree and disagree with the recommendation of this Impact Statement. Some stakeholders will hold a more direct interest in the practicalities of a tax change, such as payroll software providers who will want enough time to make the requisite changes to their products. Inland Revenue notes that its recommendation of Option 5 is one of the options that it expects the Government to seriously consider. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-11-26 13:53:20 Full Impact Statement Template | 26 \[SENSITIVE\] 5.2 Summary table of costs and benefits of the preferred approach (Option 5) 18 This only includes revenue attributable to the introduction of the 39 percent rate.

These economic and integrity impacts are considered in turn. Unintended economic impacts include the efficiency costs from higher taxes on individual investment and savings, business investment, and human capital and labour markets. These are inevitable (but unintended) downsides of a new higher top marginal tax rate. The costs are likely to be higher per dollar of revenue raised the easier it is for high-income earners to sidestep the new higher tax rate. Individual investment and savings impact Taxation has economic costs when it distorts the allocation of investment due to different investments being taxed at different rates. An increase in the top personal rate would thereby impose economic costs by increasing the existing distortions in the allocation of individuals’ savings under the current tax system, which favour investment into certain under-taxed assets (such as land) over fully-taxed investments (such as interest-earning assets). Furthermore, having different entities taxed at different rates may also impose economic costs if it affects the allocation of savings, for example, due to restrictions on which investments are allowed for particular entities (e.g. PIEs cannot control a business), or imposes additional compliance costs. In terms of the housing market, a higher top tax rate would be expected to place some upward pressure on the ratio of property prices to rents, although the effects are uncertain. 19 The effect will partly depend on whether the “marginal investor” in the housing market is subject to the higher top tax rate. The effect may be small owing to the small proportion of taxpayers that will be subject to the proposed new tax rate. The impact of a higher top tax rate on the level of household saving is uncertain as there are competing effects. Affected individuals with a savings goal in mind may save more so as to save the same amount after tax, while a higher tax rate on savings income may discourage savings. Most evidence suggests that there would be a small negative impact on aggregate household saving. Business investment A higher top personal rate is likely to only have a relatively small impact on the level of business investment. This is because New Zealand can access capital from foreign investors and, for foreign investors, the company tax rate is the rate that determines the amount of tax paid on investment income. However, there may be a small impact on business investment to the extent that domestic saving influences domestic investment. A higher top rate would likely matter more in sectors where the ability of New Zealand firms to access foreign capital is limited (particularly small businesses, unlisted businesses, and rental property investments). 19 Because housing is favourably taxed (for capital gains), the value of housing as an investment should increase relative to other investments where tax has increased. This means investors are willing to accept a lower rate of return; the rent-to-price ratio should fall by either the price rising or rents falling or some combination of those effects. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-11-26 13:53:20 Full Impact Statement Template | 29 \[SENSITIVE\] Human capital and labour market impacts The introduction of a new top personal tax rate would likely have a small negative effect on labour supply overall through its effects on hours worked and job choice. There is also a risk that an increase in the top personal rate would reduce the number of highly skilled workers in New Zealand and reduce the efficiency of the allocation of labour. These impacts would arise through the following channels: • Migration. Personal taxes affect after-tax incomes, and international evidence indicates this affects migration decisions. 20 The impact is greater for mobile, high-income, and highly skilled workers. • Human capital accumulation. A higher top personal tax rate would reduce the financial returns from education and upskilling, and may discourage human capital accumulation. The international evidence regarding the impact of taxation on human capital accumulation is mixed, and Inland Revenue expects the impact of this channel to be relatively small overall. • Allocation of labour. A potential mismatch between the top personal rate and the tax rate for trusts and companies will lead to many self-employed workers being able to access a lower tax rate than employees. This will favour self-employment over standard employment arrangements which may reduce the efficiency of the allocation of labour. Introducing a new top marginal tax rate will inevitably have some efficiency costs. However, a top marginal tax rate of 39 percent is not high compared with other OECD countries, and other countries have been willing to accept the efficiency costs of their top marginal tax rates when they have traded off those efficiency costs against their distributional objectives. There are other possible reforms that would have a lower efficiency cost per dollar raised relative to the current proposal, such as having a smaller increase in all income tax rates or raising GST. However, these options may not meet the Government’s distributional objectives. The efficiency costs of the current proposal would be mitigated somewhat by the possible integrity measures discussed in this Impact Statement. Unintended integrity impacts include impacts resulting from structuring to avoid the 39 percent rate. These include reduced revenue, but also a negative impact on voluntary compliance if taxpayers have a view that avoidance is widespread. Inland Revenue considers the risk of these impacts to be significant and the preferred approach for mitigating these risks is to increase the trustee rate and to investigate supporting integrity measures. Some of the integrity impacts arise from a misalignment between the top personal tax rate and the company tax rate. Even with a top marginal tax rate of 39 percent, the gap between the company tax rate and the top personal rate of 11 percentage points would be smaller than the gap in most OECD countries. However, New Zealand is particularly vulnerable to a gap between the company tax rate and the top personal marginal tax rate because of the absence of a general tax on capital gains. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-11-26 13:53:20 Full Impact Statement Template | 30 \[SENSITIVE\] There are already existing concerns arising from the differences between entity and personal rates in the current system.

The bunching of self-employed people at the new threshold after 2000 shows that there was substantial movement by the self-employed to avoid the higher top personal rate. Measures were taken to mitigate the avoidance of the top rate, including court cases 22 and new income tax rules. 23 The measures reduced the use of the relevant structures to some extent. Officials are concerned that increased structuring could have unintended integrity impacts on: • Revenue. Tax collected from a higher top personal rate will be reduced due to structuring activity. This is due to the direct impact of taxpayers being able to earn their income through lower-taxed entities, such as trusts and companies. It is also because an inconsistent rate structure makes it harder for courts to find tax avoidance when the different rates mean it is difficult to determine whether a structure undermines what Parliament contemplated. • Social capital: Perceptions of arbitrary outcomes, such as when some taxpayers can structure to avoid the 39 percent rate, will erode public confidence in the integrity of the tax systems and the feeling that all taxpayers are treated fairly. • Horizontal and vertical equity: In the absence of integrity measures, more income of high-wealth individuals and others with substantial capital income is likely to 21 This figure is drawn from Nazila Alinaghi, John Creedy and Norman Gemmell, Estimating Elasticities of Taxable Income and Adjustment Costs from Tax Kink Bunching: Evidence from Register Data for New Zealand (2019). 22 For example, the decision in Penny and Hooper v CIR \[2011\] NZSC 95 limited the ability of taxpayers to use trusts to avoid paying themselves a market salary and therefore avoid the top personal rate in certain circumstances. 23 An example is the tightening of the personal services attribution rules. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-11-26 13:53:20 Full Impact Statement Template | 32 \[SENSITIVE\] flow to lighter-taxed entities. This suggests that a new top personal tax rate in itself will have little effect on taxing the income of the very wealthiest but will instead fall on less wealthy salary and wage earners. • The tax system. Substantial misalignment between the top personal rate and the rates for companies, trusts, and PIEs will raise broader questions about the coherence of New Zealand’s tax policy settings. There is likely to be considerable pressure on the integrity of the tax system over the long term in the absence of more substantive reform, as taxpayers take advantage of the opportunities to pay tax at lower rates on their income. The integrity risks can be mitigated in two ways: • By imposing a 39 percent rate on trustee income, since trusts are the primary vehicle that high-income taxpayers are most likely to use to divert income that would otherwise be taxed at their 39 percent personal rate. 24 • By investigating specific integrity measures These would necessarily be less effective than taxing the entities themselves at 39 percent. All of these unintended economic and integrity impacts are heavily influenced by taxpayers’ reactions to the introduction of a new top personal income tax rate. The uncertainty in trying to predict this response means there is an overarching risk that the tax revenue collected from this proposal may be less than expected. 24 This would still allow taxpayers to divert income to a company, which would be taxed on that income at 28 percent. That income would then be subject to a further 11 percent of tax when distributed to the shareholder. This reduces the attractiveness of companies to avoid the 39 percent rate compared to trusts. However, it does not eliminate it, as the company could still be sold by the taxpayer without any further tax impost. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-11-26 13:53:20 s 9(2)(f)(iv) Full Impact Statement Template | 33 \[SENSITIVE\] Section 6: Impl eme nta tion a nd operati on 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? The proposal to introduce a new top personal income tax rate is to be legislated via a taxation bill that is likely to be introduced in December 2020. The new personal tax scale would apply from 1 April 2021. A separate taxation bill would likely be required to implement any integrity measures recommended for development under Option 5. Inland Revenue recommends that these measures come into effect from 1 April 2022. The proposal is high profile and Inland Revenue does not anticipate any confusion about the introduction of a new top personal tax rate or the alignment of rates under Option 5. The complexity of potential integrity measures is likely to be the most confusing aspect of the recommended option. There is likely to be uncertainty about whether some arrangements are permitted under these measures. For all aspects of the proposal, guidance will be communicated through normal channels, such as through the Inland Revenue website and the Tax Information Bulletin. Inland Revenue is responsible for the administration and enforcement of the tax system, including the implementation and operation of this proposal. Inland Revenue has not identified any concerns with its ability to implement the proposal with respect to the Government’s “Expectations for regulatory stewardship by government agencies” aside from a short timeframe in which to undertake the initial work required. This short timeframe justifies why Inland Revenue does not recommend integrity measures being implemented on 1 April 2021 given the significant work and consultation still required to develop these measures. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? Because of the one-year difference in recommended implementation dates between the introduction of a new top personal income tax rate and the recommended implementation of integrity measures, the risk for structuring activity will be greatest in the 2021–22 income tax year under Option 5. Inland Revenue recommends differing implementation dates because it believes there are worse consequences associated with accelerating the implementation measures for effect on 1 April 2021. Aside from this specific risk, an increase in tax rates will generally lead to more tax-induced structuring activity as it becomes relatively more appealing to taxpayers to try to circumvent the 39 percent rate. This will likely result in disputes with taxpayers seeking to avoid the new rate and possibly court cases. Inland Revenue already undertakes significant compliance activity to minimise avoidance and will be expecting that incentives created by higher taxes create more pressures in this area. Inland Revenue expects that implementation risks are mitigated by ensuring taxpayers have the least recourse for structuring around the new top personal rate. This is best achieved by Option 5. If the Government chooses to implement another package to buttress the introduction of a new top personal rate, then there are likely to be greater implementation risks with respect to avoidance and compliance activity. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-11-26 13:53:20 Full Impact Statement Template | 34 \[SENSITIVE\] For stakeholders that need to make technical/software changes, there is a risk that the legislation comes into effect too quickly for all of these stakeholders to have made the requisite changes to their systems. Businesses will generally require an amount of time to adequately prepare for significant tax changes such as adjustments to the personal income tax scale. The intention to introduce a new top personal income tax rate was announced in the Labour party’s 2020 Election Manifesto, so it is not expected that affected parties need to wait for detailed legislation to begin preparatory work to accommodate the reforms. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-11-26 13:53:20 Full Impact Statement Template | 35 \[SENSITIVE\] Section 7: Moni toring, evaluati on, and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? The revenue impact of this proposal will be estimated through tax collected by Inland Revenue. There are concerns as to the extent of any implications for structuring activities and how effective the package is at preventing those. In practice, it will be difficult to evaluate the effect that a given package has on minimising top-rate avoidance compared to the effect that another package might have had. However, investigations that rely on the proposed integrity measures will indicate how effective those measures are from a legal perspective. Inland Revenue routinely collects significant amounts of data through taxpayers filing their returns, through income payers withholding tax and providing information to Inland Revenue, and through other means. This information will be used to monitor and evaluate the impact of the changes to the personal income tax scale. Inland Revenue also records data on its customer compliance and customer support activities, so existing systems are already in place to record new administrative impacts arising from this proposal. Inland Revenue will collect more information on trust assets, liabilities, and distributions. This will increase compliance costs for trustees, but it will be an important part of monitoring any systemic issues. Due to the lack of consultation on the new information requirements, Inland Revenue will likely have limited understanding of the compliance costs that trusts will face with the new information requirements and how large these costs are. Inland Revenue’s policy function also has processes in place to review the impacts of the proposal based on data already collected. Inland Revenue will therefore be in a position to both provide follow-up advice to the Government as necessary and/or respond to any further directions from the Government on consequential tax reforms following the implementation of this proposal. Inland Revenue will report to the Government on the impacts of the proposal and the integrity of the system once data becomes available. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? Inland Revenue regularly reviews tax settings on an ongoing basis and provides advice/updates to the Government accordingly. As a result, there are currently no plans for a specific review of the 39 percent rate at some future point in time. The most concerning potential result following the implementation of the proposal would be if tax revenue collected on incomes above $180,000 is significantly less than expected. That may suggest that taxpayers are entering into arrangements that structure around the new top personal income tax rate. The risk of this being the case will be highest in the year prior to the recommended implementation of integrity measures to buttress the new top personal rate. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-11-26 13:53:20 Full Impact Statement Template | 36 \[SENSITIVE\] Inland Revenue wishes to consult with stakeholders on the detailed design of those integrity measures in the first half of 2021 subject to the Government’s agreement to those measures. This will help to ensure that those measures are fit for purpose. Inland Revenue expects that any wider concerns or feedback about the general proposals in this Impact Statement will be raised in that consultation. As part of this consultation, Inland Revenue will be seeking feedback on the implementation of the information reporting requirements for trustees. This will occur in lieu of formal consultation before the new requirements come into effect. The post- implementation review of the proposed requirements will be used to evaluate whether the expected benefits of collecting more information on trust assets, liabilities, and distributions justify the compliance costs that these requirements will impose on trustees. It will also be used to determine whether and how compliance costs imposed by the requirements could be reduced. 2r4hxlcklw 2020-11-26 13:53:20

The COVID-19 Response (Further Management Measures) Legislation Act (No 2) 2020 was enacted on 6 August 2020 and contains amendments to a range of cross- government COVID-19 response measures. Four taxation matters included in the new Act introduce amendments to: • the power of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to vary due dates and deadlines • support the implementation of the research and development loan scheme • the ability for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to remit use-of-money interest for some provisional taxpayers, and • the qualification periods for the in-work tax credit 2. This special report provides early guidance on these tax amendments. This information will also be published in the September 2020 edition of the Tax Information Bulletin. Remedial amendment to administrative flexibility (Sections 6H − 6I of the Tax Administration Act 1994) 3. This amendment to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s existing discretion allows her to shorten a due date or deadline or otherwise modify a time period or timeframe where this is advantageous to taxpayers. 4. This amendment is intended to ensure the Commissioner has appropriate administrative flexibility where taxpayers are affected or likely to be affected by COVID-19 in a way which makes compliance with current tax obligations impossible, impractical, or unreasonable. 5. Otherwise the power for the Commissioner to make a COVID-19 variation remains unchanged. Background 6. On 30 April 2020, as part of its response to the pandemic, the Government introduced legislation to increase the administrative flexibility for Inland Revenue to quickly modify due dates, timeframes or other procedural requirements for taxpayers impacted by COVID-19. 7. This flexibility provides the Commissioner with a more timely mechanism to assist taxpayers who encounter practical difficulties in complying or where compliance with certain requirements under the Inland Revenue Acts is impossible or unreasonable due to circumstances relating to COVID-19. The power came into force on 30 April 2020, with application from 17 March 2020. 6 8. Where taxpayers comply with a modified timeframe or requirement made under this power, they will be treated as if they complied with the relevant requirement that is set in legislation. Key features 9. The amendment allows the Commissioner to vary a due date, deadline, time period or time frame to shorten or otherwise modify the time-related requirement. 10. This provides the Commissioner with the ability to respond to some cases with appropriate flexibility by shortening timeframes, for example, by reducing the time before a taxpayer may choose a new approach, the time for an election to take effect, or before a taxpayer may benefit from a provision. Application date 11. The amendment applies from the date of application of the original legislation: 17 March 2020 in relation to requirements arising from this date. Detailed analysis 12. Time-related requirements may be shortened or otherwise modified 13. Section 6I(1)(a) is amended to allow the Commissioner to use the discretion to shorten, reduce or otherwise modify a time-related requirement specified in 6I(1). These are due dates, deadlines, time periods or timeframes within or in relation to which: • a person must comply with a requirement set out in the provision • a person must make an election under the provision, and • a person’s entitlements, rights or obligations are affected. 14. A new subsection 6I(1B) is inserted to clarify that for the purpose of the COVID-19 variations, “modify” is defined as including a reduction in a time period or time-frame. This is restricted to where the Commissioner considers such a reduction would be advantageous for persons generally, or for a particular class of persons. 15. In addition, the existing legislation provides that the COVID-19 variations are optional for taxpayers to apply; taxpayers may always choose to comply with the requirements as set out in legislation rather than any relevant COVID-19 variation. 16. A supporting change is made to section 6H(1) which describes the discretionary power and how it may be used. 7 Example 1 Onya Marx is a company that provides specialist timekeeping for sporting events. During the lockdown, live sporting events were cancelled, meaning a downturn in business for Onya Marx. Onya Marx has elected to file information to Inland Revenue quarterly, but could choose to adopt a half-yearly approach. However, taxpayers are not able to change filing options more than once a year – that is they must wait 12 months from the last election for any subsequent change of filing period to take effect. The Commissioner considers that the time restrictions on being able to change between filing options may be unreasonable to comply with due to circumstances relating to COVID-19. The Commissioner issues a COVID-19 variation reducing the time period that taxpayers like Onya Marx must wait between changing filing periods to three months. Amendments in support of R&D loan scheme (Section DF 1(1), YA 1, and schedule 21B part B clause 21 of the Income Tax Act 2007; schedule 7 part C clauses 23B and 38 of the Tax Administration Act 1994) 17. The amendments support the implementation of the R&D loan scheme intended to incentivise businesses to continue research and development programmes at risk in the current economic conditions. 18. Amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 ensure that expenditure funded by the loan scheme is subject to the normal income tax deductibility rules and that the loan does not affect a person’s entitlement to R&D tax credits. 19. An amendment to the Tax Administration Act 1994 enables information sharing between Inland Revenue, Callaghan Innovation, and the Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment (MBIE) to support the R&D loan scheme. It also adds Callaghan Innovation to the list of agencies with which Inland Revenue can share information if necessary for carrying out duties related to COVID-19. Background 20. The Government considers that lifting expenditure on R&D is necessary for the growth of the economy. However, the COVID-induced economic downturn has impacted many businesses in New Zealand, forcing them to cut down on expenditure to keep afloat. R&D programmes are particularly at risk of being cut or put on hold during the crisis. The Government has therefore provided funding through the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund for a temporary R&D loan scheme to encourage businesses to continue with their R&D programmes. 21. The R&D loan scheme is open to all R&D-performing businesses regardless of size. However, businesses are required to prove that they have suffered a significant loss in revenue or lack access to finance. The R&D loans scheme applies similar eligibility criteria to those used for the COVID-19 wage subsidy scheme. The loan can only be spent on R&D activity, and businesses are required to account for this. 8 22. Although there are some key differences, the R&D loan scheme is intended to operate similarly to the Small Business Cashflow Scheme, with a similar tax treatment. It is also intended to be compatible with the R&D tax incentive. The loans will be administered by Callaghan Innovation and will only be available for the 2020−21 fiscal year. 23. The amendments described here aim to ensure the efficient functioning and appropriate tax treatment of the loans scheme. Key features 24. The COVID-19 Response (Further Management Measures) Legislation Act (No 2) 2020 contains the following amendments to support the R&D loans scheme. • The amendment to section DF 1(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 exempts expenditure funded through the R&D loan scheme (defined in a further amendment to YA 1) from being subject to the rest of DF 1, which denies a deduction for expenditure or depreciation loss where the expenditure was funded through a government grant to a business. This ensures that expenditure funded through the loan scheme is subject to the normal income tax deductibility rules. • The amendment to schedule 21B part B clause 21 of the Income Tax Act 2007 exempts the R&D loan scheme from the exclusion on claiming expenditure for the R&D tax credit where the expenditure relates to a government grant. Without this amendment, expenditure funded through the R&D loan scheme would likely be ineligible for the tax credit, contrary to policy intent. • The amendments to schedule 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allow for increased information sharing between Inland Revenue, MBIE, and Callaghan Innovation for the purposes of administering measures related to R&D in general and the R&D loan scheme in particular. They also allow information to be shared with Callaghan Innovation where the information is necessary for Callaghan Innovation to carry out duties related to COVID-19. Application date 25. The amendments apply retrospectively from 1 July 2020, which is the date on which the R&D loan scheme became available. Detailed analysis Deductions not disallowed for expenditure funded through R&D loan scheme (section DF 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007) 26. Section DF 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 prevents a person from claiming a deduction for expenditure or depreciation loss where the expenditure corresponds to a payment in the nature of a government grant or subsidy to business. DF 1(2) prevents the person from claiming a deduction for expenditure to which the payment corresponds, while DF 1(4) reduces the person’s expenditure for the purpose of quantifying depreciation loss to the extent to which the person’s expenditure on items of depreciable property corresponds to the payment. 9 27. An exception exists where the payment is an amount of a loan made under the small business cashflow scheme (DF 1(1)(cb)). Expenditure that corresponds to a loan under the small business cashflow scheme is subject to the normal deductibility rules (that is, it is not disallowed under section DF 1). 28. The policy intent is that the R&D loans should be subject to the same tax rules as the small business cashflow scheme. An exception to the DF 1 rules for payments made under the R&D loan scheme thus ensures that these payments are subject to the normal deductibility rules. Expenditure funded through R&D loan scheme still eligible for R&D tax credit (schedule 21B part B clause 21 of the Income Tax Act 2007) 29. A person cannot claim R&D tax credits for expenditure or loss to the extent that the expenditure or loss falls into any of the categories described in schedule 21B part B of the Income Tax Act 2007. 30. Clause 21 of schedule 21B part B provides that expenditure or loss is not eligible R&D expenditure where the expenditure or loss is a precondition to, subject to the terms of, required by, or otherwise related to a grant made by the Crown or a local authority. The policy intent of the R&D loan scheme, however, is that a person should be able to claim both the loan and the R&D tax incentive for the same expenditure. The amendment to clause 21 therefore creates an exception for expenditure funded through the R&D loan scheme. This allows expenditure funded through the R&D loan scheme to be eligible for the R&D tax credit (provided it meets all the other eligibility criteria). Information sharing amendments (schedule 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994) 31. Section 18 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 prevents Inland Revenue from disclosing any sensitive revenue information unless the disclosure is a permitted disclosure. Schedule 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides for situations in which disclosure is permitted to certain persons or agencies. 32. Amendments have been made to the provisions in schedule 7. The general effect of the amended provisions is to enable information to be shared with Callaghan Innovation where the information is reasonably necessary to perform duties related to COVID-19, and to explicitly include the R&D loan scheme in the existing information sharing provisions between Inland Revenue, Callaghan Innovation, and MBIE for R&D incentives. These amendments ensure that Inland Revenue can share information to enable Callaghan Innovation to make faster and better-informed decisions about an applicant’s eligibility and to increase the efficacy of the scheme. 33. All legislative references below are to the Tax Administration Act 1994, schedule 7. Information sharing with agencies for COVID-19 response purposes (clause 23B) 34. Clause 23B enables the Commissioner to disclose information about a person or entity to a prescribed list of government agencies for performing duties in response to the pandemic and economic crisis. The list of government agencies with which Inland Revenue can share information for these purposes is provided in clause 23B(6). 10 35. An amendment adds Callaghan Innovation to the list of agencies in clause 23B(6), enabling Inland Revenue to disclose information to Callaghan Innovation where the information relates to performing duties connected with COVID-19. Information sharing with agencies for R&D purposes (clause 38) 36. Clause 38 provides the Commissioner with the ability to share information with various government agencies for specified purposes relating to developing and administering R&D incentives (in particular, the R&D tax incentive). Clause 38(2) enables the Commissioner to share information about a person or entity with Callaghan Innovation and MBIE where the information relates to offering R&D advice or government incentives. 37. New clause 38(2)(a) allows Inland Revenue to share information relating to several categories of government R&D incentive, including tax incentives, loans, grants, and any related measures. New clause 38(2)(b) specifies that Inland Revenue can share information relating to the grant and administration of loans under the R&D loan scheme. Use of money interest remission on terminal tax (Section 183ABAC of the Tax Administration Act 1994) 38. The amendment allows Inland Revenue to remit use of money interest (UOMI) accrued on an amount of terminal tax payable for the 2020−21 tax year where the taxpayer failed to pay the relevant portions of the amount by the provisional tax dates because their ability to reasonably accurately forecast their residual income tax has been significantly adversely affected by COVID-19. Background 39. UOMI is charged immediately when a taxpayer fails to make a payment of tax on time. It is also charged retrospectively when a provisional taxpayer who uses the standard or estimate methods does not pay amounts sufficient to cover their instalment amount or residual income tax, depending on which method they use. 40. The purpose of UOMI is to encourage taxpayers to pay their tax on time and compensate the government for the loss of use of money from taxpayers underpaying their tax. It applies to all tax types administered by Inland Revenue. In most cases UOMI is charged immediately when taxpayers make tax payments late. 41. Section 183ABAB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 was introduced as part of the Government’s response to the COVID-19 situation and gave the Commissioner the power to remit UOMI where the taxpayer’s ability to make a payment was significantly adversely affected by COVID-19. This will cover the situation where a taxpayer is charged UOMI immediately on a missed payment but not in the situation where UOMI is charged retrospectively as the UOMI is not charged in respect of a “payment” that could not be made it is charged on the basis of the unpaid tax at those dates. 11 42. When UOMI is charged immediately the amount of actual tax owing is certain as the taxpayer has usually filed a tax return establishing the liability. With provisional tax the actual liability is not known until a taxpayer files their annual tax return sometime after their year-end so provisional instalments are calculated with reference to prior years or the taxpayer’s estimate of their tax liability for the year. 43. Once a taxpayer files their tax return UOMI is charged retrospectively to compensate the government where a taxpayer underpays tax compared to their actual liability for the year or their instalment amounts depending on whether they use the standard or estimation methods. 44. A number of taxpayers have noted that because of the COVID-19 situation it is difficult for them to forecast their tax liability for the year. They know that the standard uplift multipliers of 105% of the prior year or 110% of the year before the prior year will likely be in excess of their liability for the 2020−21 year but there is uncertainty about what their tax liability may be for the year which could expose taxpayers, particularly small taxpayers, to UOMI. Key features Interest remission 45. New section 183ABAC allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to remit UOMI charged to taxpayers on an amount of terminal tax for the 2020−21 tax year if they: • are a provisional taxpayer in the 2020−21 tax year; • estimate their provisional tax; • use the standard method and don’t pay the amount of the standard instalment on the final instalment; • would be a safe harbour taxpayer but they did not pay their instalments in full; • have residual income tax of $1 million or less, and • the ability to make a reasonably accurate forecast of taxable income for the year has been significantly adversely affected by COVID-19 and that resulted in interest being charged. 46. For interest to be remitted the taxpayer must ask for it to be remitted and the Commissioner must be satisfied that the taxpayer has asked for the relief as soon as practicable and made the payment of tax. 47. This amendment is aimed at remitting UOMI for smaller business who have difficulty in accurately forecasting their residual income tax for the year and incur UOMI when their actual tax liability is higher than the amount they have estimated or paid. 12 Example 2 Discovery Traders Limited is an export company based in Twizel that sells high quality Manuka honey to China. Due to the closing of the borders under COVID-19 it is very uncertain when the shipping lanes to China will be fully opened to international trade and how the situation will impact sales by Discovery. Based on the information that Discovery has at the time it is due to make its first instalment of provisional tax for the 2020−21 tax year it estimates its tax liability for the year to be $80,000 and makes its first provisional tax payment accordingly. However, the trading lanes fully open a lot sooner than Discovery believed. They subsequently change their estimate and make increased payments at the second and third provisional tax instalment dates. Despite this, they incur UOMI on the underpaid first instalment. They seek remission of that UOMI on the basis that at the time they had no idea that the trading lanes would open so quickly. Discovery’s residual income tax is less than $1 million and because of the uncertainty created by the COVID-19 situation their ability to accurately forecast their income has been impaired. However, as soon as Discovery realised this, they amended their estimate accordingly. Discovery would be entitled to remission under new section 183ABAC. 48. The Commissioner is unlikely to remit UOMI where a taxpayer makes no effort to forecast their residual income tax for the year or where the taxpayer has resources available to accurately forecast their tax liability for the year. Example 3 Excelsior Exteriors Limited is a building company based in Tauranga. They have been affected by COVID-19 in two ways, firstly, there was the initial lockdown which meant that work on their current projects ceased until the alert level reduced to level 2 but then, secondly, since the reduction in alert level they have been inundated with new projects as people who cannot travel overseas decide to undertake renovations to their houses. This has seen their revenue increase over prior years. James, the owner of Excelsior, notes that the Commissioner can now remit interest on underpayments of provisional tax so decides to make no payments of provisional tax for the year on the basis that Excelsior will get this remitted when they file their tax return notwithstanding the increase in business during the year. In this case the Commissioner would not consider a remission of interest as Excelsior’s ability to forecast their income at each instalment has not been affected by COVID-19. It was clear that Excelsior was going to have a tax liability greater than zero, yet no effort was made to make tax payments to reflect that. 13 Example 4 Enterprise Bank Limited is a registered bank in New Zealand and has an annual turnover of $700 million. Its operations have been largely unaffected by COVID-19 and in some cases its profits have increased due to more lending being made to smaller businesses due to COVID-19. Enterprise has a subsidiary V’ger Limited which sells pet insurance to Enterprise customers. V’ger outsources its accounting functions including forecasting to Enterprise. V’ger has been affected by COVID-19 as fewer people are getting pets than in a normal year. V’ger estimates its provisional tax payable for the year, however, it incurs interest for underpaying its provisional tax compared with its actual tax liability for the year. V’ger underpaid as it made an error in their original estimate. Although V’ger has residual income tax of less than $1 million it has the ability to accurately forecast and adjust their provisional tax payments for the year and that ability has not been adversely affected by COVID-19. The Commissioner will not consider remitting interest for V’ger. Application dates 49. This provision has effect from the date of Royal Assent however it will apply for UOMI accrued for the 2020−21 tax year. Grace periods for the in-work tax credit (Sections MD 9 and MD 10 of the Income Tax Act 2007) 50. Amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 will allow families to continue to receive the in-work tax credit (IWTC) for a period of up to two weeks as earners transition between jobs, are unpaid for a period or leave their employment. Background 51. Section MD 4(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 sets out that a person is entitled to an IWTC for a child if the person meets the five requirements set out in sections MD 5 to MD 9. The fifth of these requirements (commonly referred to as the “in employment” test) requires IWTC recipients to derive income in each week they are eligible for the tax credit. 52. A longstanding issue with this requirement is that working families lose their entitlement to the IWTC over small unpaid periods even though the earner returns to paid work. Examples include teacher aides and other support staff in schools or universities employed only during the school term, workers on fixed-term contracts, and workers transitioning between jobs or taking unpaid leave. 53. As job losses increase due to the economic downturn, the amendments will ensure that families continue to receive the IWTC for two weeks as they transition between jobs, are unpaid for a period, or leave their employment. The change is intended to boost the incomes of low and middle-income working families while supporting them to stay off a main benefit as they transition between jobs or have small gaps in employment. 14 Key features Two-week grace period 54. New section MD 9(6) provides an exception to the “in employment” test for a person who previously met the test within the past fortnight. The amendment provides that a person is deemed to meet the test if they do not derive income or otherwise do not meet the in employment test but have met the test within the last 14 days. 55. The off-benefit rule in section MD 8 will still apply, meaning that payments of the IWTC will stop if the earner or their spouse, civil union partner or de facto partner goes on to an income-tested benefit. Definition of weekly periods 56. Section MD 10 defines the amount of IWTC entitlement and the number of weekly periods the earner is entitled for. The definition of “weekly periods” in section MD 10(3)(d) has been amended so that it includes whole one-week periods to which the new rule in section MD 9(6) applies. The amendment ensures that the earner is entitled to continue receiving the IWTC in each week that they have a grace period under section MD 9(6), up to a maximum of two consecutive weeks. Application date 57. The amendments will come into force on 1 April 2021.

This special report provides information on the amendments contained in the COVID- 19 Response (Taxation and Social Assistance Urgent Measures) Act 2020 enacted on 25 March 2020. The measures contained in this Act are aimed at assisting the Government’s response to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak. 2. The Act includes income tax amendments aimed at assisting the broader economic recovery from COVID-19 by incentivising businesses to bring forward investments and continue spending. These amendments include: • restoring depreciation deductions for non-residential buildings; • increasing the low-value asset write-off threshold; • increasing the provisional tax threshold; and • bringing forward the application date for the broader refundability rules for R&D tax credits. 3. The tax administration amendments include a new discretion for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to remit use of money interest on tax payments that are late because of COVID-19. This will provide relief to taxpayers financially impacted by COVID-19. In addition, the Act includes an amendment that allows Inland Revenue to share information with other government departments to assist those agencies in their response to COVD-19. This will assist the efficient and effective delivery of the Government’s COVID-19 response. 4. The third category of amendments relate to providing social assistance support to those financially impacted by COVID-19. These amendments include: • removing the hours test eligibility requirement for the in-work tax credit; • allowing people on a temporary visa to qualify for Working for Families if they are receiving an emergency benefit; • ensuring GST does not apply to payments of the COVID-19 wage subsidy and leave payments; and • reducing the winter energy payment rates to their previous levels from 2021 after a temporary increase in 2020. 5. Information in this special report precedes coverage of the legislation which will be published in the June edition of the Tax Information Bulletin. 6 INCOME TAX MEASURES Depreciation deductions for non-residential buildings (Sections DB 65, EE 31, EE 35, EE 37, EE 38, EE 60, EE 61, EE 64, EE 67, EZ 13, EZ 14 and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007) 6. These amendments reinstate a positive depreciation rate for long-lived non-residential buildings from the beginning of the 2020–21 income year. Background 7. The depreciation rate for long-lived buildings was set to zero from the beginning of the 2011–12 income year. Long-lived buildings have an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. Buildings with a shorter estimated useful life have continued to be depreciable. The adjusted tax value of these buildings remained in the owner’s tax accounts. 8. There was a transitional rule for building owners who had not previously separated out items of fit-out from the building. This rule allowed deductions for a portion of the building’s value each year. 9. New Zealand’s position of a zero-depreciation rate for almost all buildings is unusual internationally. International studies have generally found that buildings do depreciate. The Tax Working Group reviewed and recommended changes to these tax settings. The Government has accepted the Group’s recommendation to reinstate depreciation for industrial and commercial buildings. However, the Government did not support reinstating depreciation on residential buildings because the data shows these buildings have a slower rate of economic depreciation. Key features 10. Depreciation deductions for non-residential buildings are allowed from the beginning of the 2020–21 income year. The amendments apply to non-residential buildings owned at the beginning of the 2020–21 income year or acquired after the beginning of that year. This includes capital improvements. New definitions of “non-residential building” and “residential building” have been added. 11. The depreciation rate for a building with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more is 2% diminishing value or 1.5% straight line. Application date 12. The amendments apply for the 2020–21 and later income years. Detailed analysis 13. Setting a positive depreciation rate reinstates depreciation deductions for long-lived non-residential buildings from the beginning of the 2020–21 income year. While these 7 buildings have always been depreciable property, they were subject to a zero percent depreciation rate. From the beginning of the 2020–21 income year the depreciation rate for long-lived non-residential buildings is either 2% diminishing value or 1.5% straight line. Opening tax book value 14. The depreciation rate for long-lived buildings was set to zero from the beginning of the 2011–12 income year. The adjusted tax value of such buildings was effectively suspended at this point. Now a positive depreciation rate applies to long-lived non- residential buildings, owners of these assets can begin to claim depreciation deductions. 15. For buildings that were owned by the taxpayer in the 2010–11 income year, the tax book value for the beginning of the 2020–21 income year will be: • the adjusted tax value at the end of the 2010–11 income year, less fit-out deductions taken under the section DB 65 transitional rule (if applicable); plus • non-deductible capital expenditure incurred on that building from the end of the 2010–11 income year to the start of the 2020–21 income year. 16. For buildings acquired after the end of the 2010–11 income year, the opening value for the 2020–21 income year is the: • the cost of the building; plus • non-deductible capital expenditure incurred on the building from the time it was acquired until the beginning of the 2020–21 income year. Depreciation recovery 17. If a building is sold, the amount of depreciation recovery income continues to be calculated taking into account total depreciation deductions taken before 2011–12 (if any). As a result of these amendments, the depreciation recovery calculation for non- residential buildings disposed of after the beginning of the 2020–21 income year will also need to account for depreciation deductions in the 2020–21 and future income years. Non-residential buildings 18. Section YA 1 is amended. Two new definitions have been inserted and the definition of “building” has been repealed. A “non-residential building” is any building that is not a “residential building”. 19. A “residential building” is defined as: • a “dwelling” as defined in Section YA 1; and • a building in which accommodation is ordinarily provided for periods of less than 28 days at a time if the building, together with other buildings on the same land, has less than four units intended for separate occupation. 20. The definition of “dwelling” encompasses owner-occupied houses and apartments, and houses and apartments subject to residential tenancies. 8 21. The second limb of the definition of residential building ensures there is certainty that the definition of “residential building” includes buildings such as a bach that the owner uses but also rents out on a short-term basis, and also buildings used exclusively for short-term accommodation provided by owners such as Airbnb properties. These may be within the definition of “dwelling”, but this amendment puts beyond doubt that those buildings remain subject to the zero depreciation rate. The less-than four units provision excludes larger commercial premises such as motels from being treated as residential buildings. Repeal of the 2010 transitional rule 22. As a result of reinstating a positive depreciation rate for non-residential buildings, the transitional building fit-out rule introduced as part of the 2010 reforms is no longer required. Accordingly, section DB 65 has been repealed. As noted above, the adjusted book value of the building is required to be adjusted for past section DB 65 deductions. Special depreciation rate 23. The ability to apply for and be granted a special depreciation rate from the Commissioner has been restored for non-residential buildings. Increase in the provisional tax threshold (Sections RC 3, RC 4, RC 6, RC 9, RC 13, RC 14, RC 16, RM 12, and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007) 24. This amendment permanently increases the residual income tax threshold for being required to pay provisional tax from $2,500 to $5,000. As a result, a number of taxpayers are no longer required to make provisional tax payments throughout the year. This will assist those businesses with cashflow issues during the COVID-19 outbreak and beyond. Background 25. Section RC 3(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007 previously provided that a person whose residual income tax in an income year is more than $2,500 was required to pay provisional tax. This threshold is used several times throughout subpart RC and elsewhere, such as for dealing with: • voluntary provisional tax payments; • the standard uplift method; • provisional tax instalments; and • the GST ratio method. 26. The threshold referred to in these sections, and others, has been changed in accordance with the implementation of this measure (with the exception of a terminating provision in section RZ 1). 9 27. Provisional tax is paid in three equal instalments over an income year. The requirement to make these payments imposes compliance costs on taxpayers. It also has an impact on cashflow as provisional tax instalments comprise cash that a taxpayer is unable to use during the year before terminal tax is due. 28. This measure will remove around 95,000 taxpayers from the provisional tax regime. Key features 29. This measure changes the threshold for paying provisional tax so that less taxpayers are required to pay provisional tax instalments throughout the year. For taxpayers with residual income tax of between $2,500 and $5,000, instead of paying provisional tax throughout the income year, they will now only have to pay by 7 February following the end of the income year. Example 1: Increase in the provisional tax threshold Jenny is a tour guide who provides tours of the Lord of the Rings filming location sites around Wellington through her company Jenstar Tours Limited (JTL). She gets the majority of her customers from tourist ships visiting Wellington. In the 2019–20 income year, JTL’s tax liability was $8,000, but because of the recent changes to restrict tourist ships in response to COVID-19, JTL’s tax liability in 2020–21 is expected to be half of that amount. The Government’s change to the provisional tax threshold from $2,500 to $5,000 means that JTL is not a provisional taxpayer for the 2020–21 income year. Instead of paying tax in instalments throughout the 2020–21 income year, JTL will not have to pay tax until 7 February 2022, which improves its cashflow during the year. Application date 30. The amendment applies for the 2020–21 and later income years. Increase in the low-value asset write-off threshold (Section EE 38(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007) 31. This amendment temporarily increases the low-value asset write-off threshold from $500 to $5,000 in the short term before decreasing this threshold to $1,000 on a permanent basis. This allows taxpayers to immediately deduct expenditure on assets that cost up to $5,000 (and subsequently $1,000) rather than depreciating them over the life of the asset. This will decrease the tax liabilities of taxpayers in the short term and therefore assist with cashflow including during the COVID-19 outbreak. It may also encourage continued investment by businesses in the short term. Background 32. Since 2005, the threshold value in section EE 38(2)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2007 for low-value asset write-offs had been $500. Assets costing up to this threshold could be immediately expensed, which provides all of the tax benefit in the year the asset was purchased. 10 33. For example, capital expenditure on property that cost $2,000 exceeded the previous low-value asset write-off threshold and so was required to be depreciated over a number of years. Expenditure on an asset costing $300, however, could be immediately deducted so that all of the tax benefit was generated in the year of purchase, even if the asset lasts much longer than one year. Key features 34. This measure increases the value of property that is eligible to be written off in the year of purchase from $500 to $5,000, before decreasing that threshold to $1,000. This means that expenditure on assets costing up to the new threshold can be deducted immediately, so that all of the tax benefit is claimed up front. This will provide increased cashflow in the short term. Example 2: Increase in the low-value asset write-off threshold Capes Comics Limited (Capes) is a comic store that sells comics and comic-related merchandise. The store’s owner, Clark, wants to expand by investing in two new display cabinets worth $4,600 in total. Clark believes that this will increase his sales of high-value action figures. However, with the COVID-19 restrictions, he is anxious about investing $4,600, especially given that he can only deduct the cost of the cabinets over time through tax depreciation (rather than immediately). The Government’s change to the low-value asset write-off threshold means that Capes can claim an immediate deduction for the cost of the cabinets. This allows Capes to reduce its tax paid this year by $1,288 (28% of $4,600), instead of that amount being spread over a number of years. Application dates 35. The amendment to increase the low-value asset write-off threshold to $5,000 applies for property purchased on or after 17 March 2020. The amendment to subsequently lower this threshold to $1,000 will apply for property purchased on or after 17 March 2021. Research and development tax credits – broader access to refunds (Sections LA 5 and LZ 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007) 36. The amendment to section LA 5 brings forward the application date of new broader refundability rules, so that these can apply from the first year of the R&D Tax Incentive scheme. Background 37. COVID-19 has caused significant disruption to all businesses in New Zealand. There is a significant risk that this disruption could cause many R&D-performing businesses in New Zealand to reduce or stop their R&D. While ceasing R&D saves businesses money now, it means some New Zealanders will lose their jobs, fewer innovative products will be developed, and there will be a deeper and more protracted decline in 11 economic activity. This weakens our economy’s ability to recover once the global economy has stabilised. 38. The Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Act 2019 introduced an R&D Tax Incentive regime from the 2019–20 income year (“year 1”). The R&D Tax Incentive was developed under tight timeframes, so there was insufficient time to develop comprehensive refundability rules before the legislation was enacted. As a consequence, in year 1 of the Incentive, limited refundability rules (based on another R&D scheme, the R&D Tax Loss Credit) were put in place to provide refundable credits for a small portion of eligible R&D tax credit claimants (“year 1 limited refundability rules”). 39. The Government reviewed the R&D Tax Incentive’s refundability rules in 2019 and developed some new, broader refundability rules. These new rules were put into place by the recently enacted Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act 2020, and were originally intended to apply from the 2020–21 income year (“the year 2 broader refundability rules”). 40. To provide cash to businesses now and encourage them to continue with their R&D despite COVID-19, this amendment brings the application date of the year 2 broader refundability rules forward to the 2019–20 income year. This is intended to enable more businesses to access refundable R&D tax credits, and provide some businesses with larger refunds than they would have obtained under the year 1 limited refundability rules. Key features 41. The amendment to section LA 5 changes the rules for R&D tax credit refunds in the 2019–20 income year, to make refundable credits more accessible for businesses. It does this by bringing forward the application date of year 2 broader refundability rules to the 2019–20 income year (year 1 of the R&D Tax Incentive scheme). These rules would otherwise have applied from the 2020–21 income year (year 2 of the R&D Tax Incentive scheme). 42. Prior to this amendment, limited refundability rules applied in the 2019–20 income year, which only allowed businesses who met certain prescriptive criteria to access refundable credits. A $255,000 cap also applied to limit the total amount of credits that could be refunded. 43. The year 2 broader refundability rules, which now apply from the 2019–20 income year, remove the prescriptive refundability eligibility criteria and replace the $255,000 cap with a new refundability cap based on labour-related taxes. These new rules are aimed at enabling more businesses to access R&D tax credit refunds, and allowing more of these businesses to access greater amounts of refundable credits. 44. The year 2 broader refundability rules now apply by default to all claimants in the 2019–20 income year. Businesses have the option of using the previous year 1 limited refundability rules if they prefer. When filing an R&D supplementary return, each business will be asked to confirm which set of refundability rules they intend to apply to their claim. 12 45. From the 2020–21 income year onwards (year 2 of the R&D Tax Incentive scheme), all businesses are required to use the year 2 broader refundability rules. Detailed analysis 46. The amendment brings forward the application date of the year 2 broader refundability rules introduced in the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act 2020. Instead of applying from the 2020–21 income year, these new rules will apply from the 2019–20 income year. The broader refundability rules (default option) 47. The year 2 broader refundability rules now apply from the 2019–20 income year (sections LA 5(4B), (5B) and (5C)). They apply by default, unless a business chooses to apply the limited refundability rules in section LZ 14 (section LA 5 (5D)). 48. Under these rules, a loss-making business (or a business with insufficient income tax to pay to offset its R&D tax credits against) can be eligible for R&D tax credit refunds provided it is eligible for the tax credit more generally. It can obtain R&D tax credit refunds up to a new labour-related tax cap. The cap is made up of any labour-related taxes (PAYE, ESCT, and FBT): • paid by the business, and • paid by companies the business is controlled by or which sit within the same wholly-owned group, if these companies have allocated amounts to the business for the purposes of the cap. 49. No cap applies to refundable R&D tax credits paid to levy bodies, or derived from eligible expenditure on approved research providers. Transitional 2020–21 amount deleted 50. This amendment deletes the “transitional 2020–21 amount” portion of the refundability cap formula (see section 101 of the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans and Remedial Matters) Act 2020). The “transitional 2020–21 amount” is no longer needed because businesses can apply the year 2 broader refundability rules if they provide a better outcome for them in the 2019–20 income year. Eligibility of tax-exempt entities for refundability 51. The amendment to LA 5(4B) means that tax exempt entities that otherwise satisfy the R&D Tax Incentive’s general eligibility criteria may now be eligible for refundability in the 2019–20 income year. These entities and their associates were previously largely ineligible for refundability under the limited refundability rules. 52. Note that from the 2020–21 income year, entities which receive income that is tax exempt under sections CW 38, 39, 40, 41, 42 and/or 55BA of the Income Tax Act 2007 will be ineligible for the R&D tax credit. Refer to the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans and Remedial Matters) Act 2020 for more information on this exclusion. 13 The limited refundability rules 53. New section LZ 14 sets out the limited refundability rules, which businesses can choose to apply instead of the broader refundability rules if they prefer (section LA 5(5D)). A business can obtain R&D tax credit refunds under the limited refundability rules, provided it is a company and: • is in a tax loss position, or has insufficient income tax liability to utilise all of its R&D tax credits in the 2019–20 income year; • satisfies the R&D tax loss cash-out corporate eligibility and wage intensity criteria in sections MX 2 and MX 3; • does not derive exempt income (other than certain exempt income from dividends), and is not associated with a person who derives exempt income; • is not a listed company, and is not associated with a listed company; and • does not have an outstanding tax liability. 54. Only the first $255,000 of the business’s R&D tax credits is refundable, which is the equivalent of $1.7 million of eligible expenditure. Any remaining R&D tax credits may be carried forward to the 2020–21 income year if the entity is eligible for the Incentive that year and the shareholder continuity requirements in section LY 8 are met. Choosing between the year 1 and year 2 refundability rules 55. Businesses may choose to use the limited refundability rules or the broader refundability rules in the 2019–20 income year, but they cannot use both. Only the broader refundability rules are available from the 2020–21 income year. Example 3: Applying the broader refundability rules Moppy’s Chicken Factory (“Moppy”) has brought forward tax losses from the 2018–19 income year. It claims R&D tax credits in the 2019–20 income year, but does not have enough income tax to pay to use all of its credits. Moppy determines that it will be able to receive more refundable R&D tax credits if it applies the broader refundability rules, because it has $500,000 of surplus R&D tax credits and has paid $500,000 of PAYE in the 2019–20 income year (so its refundability cap is $500,000). Moppy files its income tax and R&D supplementary returns soon after 31 March 2020. It advises Inland Revenue that it would like to apply the broader refundability rules. Inland Revenue processes Moppy’s claim and refunds Moppy $500,000 of R&D tax credits. 14 TAX ADMINISTRATION MEASURES Use of money interest remission (Section 183ABAB of the Tax Administration Act 1994) 56. Use of money interest (UOMI) is charged when a taxpayer fails to make a payment of tax on time. There were some pre-existing legislative mechanisms that allow UOMI to be remitted, however, these are not fit for purpose to respond to an event such as COVID-19. 57. The amendment allows Inland Revenue to remit interest on a late payment if the taxpayer’s ability to make the payment on time was significantly adversely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. This would include both when a taxpayer is physically unable to make a tax payment on time and when a taxpayer’s financial capability to pay tax on time is adversely affected because of the economic nature of the COVID-19 outbreak. Background 58. The purpose of UOMI is to encourage taxpayers to pay their tax on time and compensate the Government for the loss of use of money from taxpayers underpaying their tax. It applies to all tax types administered by Inland Revenue, including income tax and GST. UOMI also applies to underpayments of tax that are withheld at source, such as PAYE and RWT. UOMI also applies to Working for Families debt. 59. In certain circumstances the Commissioner may remit UOMI on a late tax payment. For the remission of interest in response to emergency events, the pre-existing rules provided for an Order in Council process to allow the Commissioner to remit UOMI where a taxpayer is “physically prevented” from making a payment. However, the Commissioner could not remit interest for a taxpayer that was financially unable to make a payment on time because of the emergency event. 60. The pre-existing rules around remitting UOMI in emergency events were directed at situations or events where public safety is of paramount concern because of the risk of injury or death, typically due to a natural disaster. This statutory framework was not fit for purpose to respond to the nature of the economic shock of COVID-19 where a taxpayer may be financially unable to pay their tax on time. Key features Interest remission 61. New section 183ABAB allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to remit use of money interest if a taxpayer’s ability to make a tax payment on time is significantly adversely affected by an outbreak of COVID-19. This includes both where a taxpayer has been physically unable to make a payment on time, for example, because they have been quarantined and do not have the ability to make the payment electronically while 15 quarantined, and where a taxpayer’s financial capability to make a payment on time has been adversely affected because of the economic impacts of COVID-19. 62. For interest to be remitted the taxpayer must ask for it to be remitted and the Commissioner must be satisfied that the taxpayer has asked for the relief as soon as practicable and made the payment of tax as soon as practicable. The interest would not be remitted until the core tax debt has been paid. 63. Further guidance on how the Commissioner will determine if a taxpayer’s ability to make a payment on time has been significantly adversely affected by COVID-19 is available at https://www.ird.govt.nz/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/tax-relief/uomi Sunset provision 64. The Commissioner’s ability to remit interest only applies for the 24 months following the enactment date of 25 March 2020. However, this period can be extended by an Order in Council made on the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue. This Order in Council would need to be made within the initial 24 months during which the Commissioner can remit interest. 65. The extension to the time limit would expire after the period given by the order or 6 months after the order came into force if the order did not specify a time limit. However, the time limit could be extended further by subsequent Orders in Council so long as they are made before the date on which the preceding order would expire. 66. In recommending the making of an Order in Council, the Minister of Revenue would need to be satisfied that the ability of taxpayers to pay tax on time is likely to continue to be significantly adversely affected by COVID-19 beyond the expiry of the time limit. As such, it is unlikely that the time limit would be able to be extended by Order in Council once the COVID-19 outbreak has concluded. Application dates 67. The Commissioner’s ability to remit interest has applied since 25 March 2020. However, the Commissioner may remit interest that has accrued on tax payments due on or after 14 February 2020. 68. Unless extended by Order in Council, the Commissioner’s ability to remit interest will expire after 24 March 2022. Information sharing (Schedule 7, part C, clause 23B Tax Administration Act 1994) 69. Enabling Inland Revenue to share taxpayer information with other government departments to assist the efficient and effective delivery of the Government’s COVID-19 response. 16 Background 70. Currently, tax legislation requires Inland Revenue staff to keep taxpayer information confidential unless a specific legislative exception authorises the disclosure. There are a number of exceptions in the tax legislation enabling Inland Revenue to share information with other agencies. These existing exceptions will be used, where possible, to share information with other agencies to assist in the response to the COVID-19 outbreak. 71. However, there may be situations where, as a result of the outbreak, it is desirable for Inland Revenue to share information with other agencies with which Inland Revenue does not have any existing arrangements or where the existing arrangements are not flexible enough to allow the required sharing to occur. 72. A similar provision to this one applied during the Canterbury earthquake and allowed Inland Revenue to share information with other government agencies as part of the government’s response to the Earthquake. This amendment is modelled on that provision. Key features 73. The amendment inserts a new clause 23B into schedule 7 of the Tax Administration Act to allow Inland Revenue to share information with other government agencies in order to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak. This provision is targeted, time limited, and only used when existing legislative provisions are not adequate to share information. 74. The other agencies Inland Revenue could share information about persons or entities with are Government departments, the New Zealand Police, ACC, and Kāinga Ora – Homes and Communities. The information would only be shared for the purpose of enabling those agencies to provide assistance to individuals and businesses, to fulfil any obligation or function, or exercise any power in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The information shared would not be available for use in administering other assistance not related to COVID-19. 75. The information that could be shared would be both individual and non-individual information and may include, but is not limited to, identifying information, contact and location information, financial information, and family information. The provision would also enable information to be shared to enable the government agency to undertake compliance activity related to that COVID-19 assistance. 76. This provision will be used, for example, to share information with the Ministry of Social Development to assist in determining employers’ entitlement to the wage subsidy and in auditing claims to counter fraud. 77. Currently, tax legislation requires those persons who have access to taxpayer information to keep that information confidential and not disclose or use it for a purpose other than that for which it was provided. This requirement would also apply to the information sharing to assist the response to the COVID-19 outbreak. 17 78. As a safeguard, Inland Revenue retains a discretion as to whether to share information and sharing would only occur where the information is readily available, it is reasonable and practicable to share, and it is not undesirable to share the information. Application dates 79. The amendment would apply from the date of announcement of the change, being 17 March 2020. 80. The amendment will apply for a period of two years only unless extended by an Order in Council. This would allow the Government to continue sharing information, if required, in response to COVID-19 after the two-year period. 18 SOCIAL ASSISTANCE MEASURES Removal of hours-test from the in-work tax credit (Sections MA 7, MD 9, MD 10 & YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007) 81. The In-Work Tax Credit is an income-tested cash payment to working families with children of $3,770 per year (plus an additional $780 per child for 4th and subsequent children). This amendment would remove the requirement for recipient families to normally be working at least 20 hours per week as a sole parent or a combined 30 hours per week as a couple. Background 82. Currently, families that work a fluctuating number of hours from week-to-week or are unable to increase their hours of work do not receive the In-Work Tax Credit for weeks that they do not work – 20 hours for sole parents or 30 hours for couples. The number of families working reduced hours, or an unpredictable and varying number of hours, will increase as New Zealand’s economy responds to COVID-19. The effect of removing the hours-test will be to allow all Working for Families recipients that have income from employment and do not receive an income-tested benefit or student allowance to receive the In-Work Tax Credit regardless of the number of hours they work. Application date 83. The amendments apply from 1 July 2020. Detailed analysis The hours-test 84. Recipients of the In-Work Tax Credit are currently required to normally be working at least 20 hours per week as a sole parent or a combined 30 hours per week as a couple. This can result in families losing their entitlement to the In-Work Tax Credit in weeks where they’re hours have been reduced or families with unpredictable and varying hours, such as shift workers and those with multiple jobs, only being eligible for the credit in some weeks. COVID-19 85. COVID-19 is resulting in an unprecedented disruption to employment in New Zealand. Reduced and varying hours of employment have become increasingly prevalent as New Zealand employers adjust to the changing economic and public health situation. Removal of the hours-test will ensure families across New Zealand that have their hours-worked affected by COVID-19 will continue to receive the In-Work Tax Credit if they do not go onto an income tested benefit or student allowance and are earning some employment income. 19 Example 4 Janice is a sole parent who works two jobs and receives the In-Work Tax Credit. She is employed for 15 hours per week in one job, and 10 hours per week in another, working a combined 25 hours per week. Janice’s second employer ceases operations and she is now only working 15 hours per week for the foreseeable future. From 1 July 2020 onwards, Janice would continue to receive the In-Work Tax Credit despite her weekly hours of work being reduced below 20. Working for Families tax credits entitlement for emergency benefit recipients (Section MC 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007) 86. The amendment allows people on a temporary visa who would not otherwise meet the Working for Families (WFF) residency criteria, to qualify for WFF, if the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) has granted them an emergency benefit. This ensures that people on a temporary visa who are granted an emergency benefit will qualify for the same WFF components as other beneficiaries. Background 87. Prior to the amendment, emergency benefit recipients with dependent children and who are on a temporary visa, did not qualify for WFF tax credits. This was because they did not meet the residency criteria for WFF. The result was a difference in the financial support that these families could access, compared with other main benefit recipients with children. 88. In general, to receive a main benefit (including an emergency benefit) a person must be a New Zealand citizen or permanent resident and have resided in New Zealand for at least two years since becoming a citizen or resident. However, MSD has discretion to grant an Emergency Benefit in other circumstances 1 when those residency criteria are not met. The WFF legislation did not contain any comparable discretion. 89. The WFF residency requirements can be met by the child or the parent. 90. The WFF residency requirements can be met by the child if: • the child is ordinarily resident in New Zealand; and • is present in New Zealand for the period of entitlement. 91. The WFF residency requirements can be met by the parent if: • the parent is ordinarily resident in New Zealand; and • has been in New Zealand for 12 months continuously at any time. 92. Those on a temporary visa are specifically excluded from the definition of New Zealand resident for WFF. This exclusion was intended to prevent short-term visitors 1 These circumstances can include not being eligible for another benefit, that they are in hardship and unable to earn a sufficient livelihood. 20 from accessing WFF. It was not intended to prevent those in exceptional circumstances from accessing WFF. 93. The amendment ensures that families on a temporary visa who are granted an emergency benefit are able to access a comparable level of financial support to other recipients of main benefits. Key features 94. If MSD grants an emergency benefit, to a person on a temporary visa, that person will qualify for the same WFF payment as other beneficiaries. That is, they could qualify for the family tax credit and Best Start, assuming they meet the other qualifying criteria. They will not qualify for the In-Work Tax Credit or minimum family tax credit because these payments are not available to a person who is in receipt of a main benefit. Application date 95. The amendment applies from 1 April 2020. GST on COVID-19 related social assistance payments (Section 89 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985) 96. The amendment provides that payments made by the Ministry of Social Development in relation to wages or other income, or leave taken, as a consequence of COVID-19, are not to be regarded as taxable grants and subsidies for the purposes of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Background 97. The Goods and Services Tax (Grants and Subsidies) Amendment Order 2020 (2020/44) added two new COVID-19 related payments made by the Ministry of Social Development to the schedule of non-taxable grants and subsidies contained in the Goods and Services Tax (Grants and Subsidies) Order 1992. The purpose of this Order was to ensure that GST-registered businesses that received these payments from the Ministry of Social Development did not need to return GST on them. This Order came into force on 24 March 2020, and consequently did not apply in respect of payments made by the Ministry of Social Development before that date. 98. New section 89 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 is intended to ensure that GST-registered businesses that received these payments from the Ministry of Social Development before 24 March 2020 do not need to return GST on them. Application date 99. The amendment came into force on 25 March 2020, the date of enactment. The amendment applies retrospectively to payments made from 17 March 2020. 21 Winter energy payment (Schedule 4, Part 8, Clause (1)(a), (b) and (c) of the Social Security Act 2018) 100. This amendment reduced the rates of winter energy payment (WEP) for 2021 and later years to $450 for single people with no dependent children (down from $900) and $700 for couples or single people with dependent children (down from $1,400). This restored the 2019 rates after a temporary doubling in the rates for 2020. Background 101. In response to the economic impacts of COVID-19, the Government agreed that the annual rates of WEP payments for 2020 would be $900 for single people with no dependent children, and $1,400 for couples or single people with dependent children. The increase is double the normal rate and was only intended to apply for the 2020 winter period (1 May to 1 October) when the impacts of COVID-19 are likely to be most pronounced. Key features 102. The amendment ensures that the doubling of the winter energy payment rates for 2020 as part of the COVID-19 Recovery Package is only temporary. It reduces the rates back to their previous amounts of $450 and $700 for 2021 and later years. Application date 103. The amendments to the WEP rates come into force on 1 May 2021.

Resurgence Support Payments Bill introduced
===========================================

The [Taxation (COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payments and Other Matters) Bill](/bills/53-8)
 was introduced to Parliament today, and is expected to be passed under urgency.

The Bill enables Inland Revenue to administer the new COVID-19 resurgence support payments (CRSP) scheme, which is a one-off support payment to businesses in the form of a grant. The payment would consist of a base amount of $1,500 per applicant plus $400 per full-time equivalent (FTE) up to a cap of 50 FTEs.

The Bill also increases the minimum family tax credit (MFTC) threshold for the 2021–22 and later tax years from $29,432 to $30,576 per annum.

### Business support under COVID resurgence confirmed

Legislation will be introduced under urgency today to set up a new Resurgence Support Payment for businesses affected by any resurgence of COVID-19.

“Since the scheme was announced in December we have decided to make a change to the payment – reducing the time over which a revenue drop is assessed from 14 days to seven,” Grant Robertson said.

“We acknowledge the concerns of the business community about Alert Level rises and have made this change as we want to get money out the door quickly to affected businesses.”

Firms that experience a 30 percent drop in revenue over a 7-day period will be eligible. The payment would include a core per business rate of $1500 plus $400 per employee up to a total of 50 FTEs ($21,500).

“This payment recognises that some businesses face one-off costs or impacts to cashflow when we step up an Alert Level to follow public health advice. The payment is structured to provide most support to smaller firms who are most likely to face cashflow issues but will be available to all businesses and sole traders.

“A decision on whether this support will come into effect will be made if there is an extension to the seventy-two hour increase in alert levels announced on Sunday night. If it does come into effect it will cover the initial 72 hour Alert Level rise as well,” Grant Robertson said.

The Government has a package of support available, in addition to this payment, including:

*   A new **ShortTerm Absence Payment** to cover eligible workers needing to stay at home while awaiting a COVID19 test result. This is a one-off payment of $350 to employers to pay workers who need to stay home while awaiting a test or while someone who is their dependent is doing so, in accordance with public health advice. Further information about this payment is available on the MSD [website](https://www.workandincome.govt.nz/covid-19/short-term-absence-payment/index.html)
    .
*   The **Leave Support Scheme** helps businesses to help pay workers (including selfemployed) told to self-isolate because of COVID-19. It’s paid as a lump sum and covers two weeks per eligible employee at the rates of $585.80 for each employee working 20 hours or more a week and $350 for each employee working less than 20 hours a week. Information is available [here](https://www.workandincome.govt.nz/covid-19/leave-support-scheme/who-can-get-it.html)
    .
*   The **Wage Subsidy Scheme** will also be available nationally when there’s a regional or national move to Alert Levels three and four for a period of seven days. The support will be provided in two weekly payments for the duration of the alert level period, rounded to the nearest fortnight. The Wage Subsidy Scheme has been very effective in keeping people in work so far with more than $14 billion paid out to protect 1.8 million jobs.

Other support includes the enhanced loan products Business Finance Guarantee Scheme, which is available to June 2021 and Small Business Cashflow Scheme.

Government property announcements
=================================

Today the Government announced a range of measures addressing the supply and demand for residential properties. For the tax system, the Government announced:

*   an extension of the bright-line test for residential properties from five to ten years, and
*   a ‘change-of-use’ rule which will apply where the property was not used as the main home for more than 12 months at a time.

These two proposed changes will be included in a Supplementary Order Paper to the [Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020–21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill](/bills/52-273)
 that will be released today.

The Government also announced that it intends to remove interest deductions on residential properties (except for new builds), and will consult on the details of this measure.

### Govt housing package backs first home buyers

*   Bright-line test doubled to 10 years with an exemption to incentivise new builds
*   Interest deductibility loophole removed for future investors and phased out on existing residential investments
*   More Kiwis able to access First Home Grants and Loans with increased income caps and higher house price caps in targeted areas
*   $3.8 billion fund to accelerate housing supply in the short term
*   Govt to support Kainga Ora to borrow $2 billion extra to begin land acquisition programme to boost housing supply
*   Apprenticeship Boost initiative extended to further support trades and trades training

The Government has announced a housing package that will increase the supply of houses and remove incentives for speculators, to deliver a more sustainable housing market.

“This is a package of both urgent and long-term measures that will increase housing supply, relieve pressure on the market and make it easier for first-home buyers,” Jacinda Ardern said.

“The housing crisis is a problem decades in the making that will take time to turn around, but these measures will make a difference.

“New Zealand housing market has become the least affordable in the OECD. Taking action is in everyone’s interests as continuing to allow unsustainable house price growth could lead to a negative hit to the whole economy.

“Our package of measures will start to tip the balance away from property speculators towards first home buyers. Property investors now make up the biggest share of buyers in the market so it’s essential we take steps to curb rampant speculation.

“There is no silver bullet, but combined all of these measures will start to make a difference,” Jacinda Ardern said.

Grant Robertson said extending the bright-line test and removing interest deduction loopholes for investors will dampen demand and tilt the balance towards first home buyers.

“Our plan will decrease the incentives for speculators to buy residential property, while also encouraging investment in new builds,” Grant Robertson said.

“House price increases of the magnitude we have seen in recent months are not only harmful to affordability. Excessive volatility also represents a risk to economic stability.

“Bubbles are unstable by their very nature, and we cannot afford to put the current economic recovery at risk by allowing house prices to spiral out of control.

“The changes announced today include measures to strengthen the position of first home buyers, including reducing the competition they’ll face from speculators for typical first homes.

“Extending National’s bright-line test on investment properties to 10 years for existing houses will decrease speculative demand for those homes.

“This will give Kiwis a better chance at purchasing their first family home. I want to stress that the bright-line test does not and will not apply to the family home.

“To support our goal of increasing supply, we will keep the bright-line test for new build investment properties at the current five years,” Grant Robertson said.

The tax system favours debt-driven residential property investment over more fully taxed and more productive investments. To reduce investor demand for these investments, the Government will remove the advantage investors have over first home buyers.

“Cabinet has agreed to remove the ability for property investors to offset their interest expenses against their rental income when they are calculating their tax,” David Parker said.

Ministers are also considering closing a loophole on interest-only loans to speculators. The Reserve Bank will report back to Ministers in May on this and any proposals around Debt to Income Ratios, particularly for investors.

Housing Minister Megan Woods said the Government is speeding up the pace and scale of house building with a $3.8 billion Housing Acceleration Fund.

“Investment in infrastructure has been identified as the single biggest thing the Government can do to increase the supply of housing in the short term.

“This fund will jump-start housing developments by funding the necessary services, like roads to homes and water to taps, which are currently holding up development.

“We estimate the Housing Acceleration Fund will help greenlight tens of thousands of house builds in the short to medium term.

“Assisting Kainga Ora to borrow an additional $2 billion will assist in bringing a range of development forwards,” Megan Woods said.

First home buyers will also get more help to get into the housing market with increases to First Home Products’ income caps and changes to regional price caps.

In 2019 the Government changed the rules so people only need a 5% home deposit before they can apply for the help. Today that is being expanded to ensure more people are included. This expansion comes alongside the recent RBNZ Loan-to-Value Ratio changes announced that will see investors require a 40 percent deposit from May 1 2021.

“Income caps to get financial assistance will be lifted from $85,000 to $95,000 for single buyers, and from $130,000 to $150,000 for two or more buyers. The changes to the house price and income caps will take effect on 1 April 2021,” Megan Woods said.

By increasing the income caps, about 9,300 couples and 3,700 singles who are currently renting, will now qualify for the First Home Loan and Grant.

Changes to regional price caps on new build and existing properties will also reflect the increased price of housing.

“This package of measures will help first home buyers into the market and boost activity and create jobs in the construction sector, as we recover from the impacts of COVID-19,” Megan Woods said.

To ensure we have the people power required in the construction sector, the Government is extending the Apprenticeship Boost initiative by four months to further support trades and trades training.

It means employers who have apprentices starting over those extra four months can get some Apprenticeship Boost support as well, which could see more than 5,000 new apprentices able to benefit.

Since launching in August 2020, more than 10,000 employers have signed up and received almost $97 million in subsidies for more than 21,000 apprentices.

Interest deductibility consultation launched
============================================

On 23 March, the Government announced that deductions for interest expenses on rental properties will be restricted from 1 October 2021. The Ministers of Finance and Revenue today released a public consultation document seeking feedback on a range of design issues for implementing that proposal, including:

*   Interest on a mortgage on a residential investment property (acquired **before 27 March 2021**) will be gradually phased out between 1 October 2021 and 31 March 2025. Other interest would immediately cease to be deductible from 1 October 2021.
*   Land outside New Zealand would be excluded from the new rule as would a number of other types of properties.
*   Exemptions are proposed for property developers and for owners of new builds. In addition, initial or early owners of new builds would be subject to a five year bright-line test, rather than the ten year test.

The proposals do not affect a person’s main home. For more information, see:

Consultation on exemption of new builds from proposed tax rules
---------------------------------------------------------------

The Government has today confirmed new builds will be exempt from planned changes to the tax treatment of residential investment property.

Public consultation is now open on details of the proposals, which stop interest deductions being claimed for residential investment properties other than new builds.

“The Government’s goal is to encourage more sustainable house prices, by dampening investor demand for existing housing stock to improve affordability for first-home buyers. The proposals we are releasing today will help to achieve that goal,” Finance Minister Grant Robertson said.

“This is part of the Government’s move to cool the property market. A more sustainable housing market supports more first-home buyers to get into their own home but also protects our recovering economy. So we all benefit.”

Revenue Minister David Parker said: “The proposal to exempt property development and new builds should help boost supply by channelling investment towards increasing housing stock and away from direct competition with first home buyers and owner-occupiers for existing housing stock.”

“This consultation is focused on finalising the detailed design of the rules. The proposals will not affect the main home.”

Generally, it is proposed that residential property would be considered a new build if it is a self-contained dwelling (with its own kitchen and bathroom, and that has received a code compliance certificate). The Government is also considering whether subsequent owners should also be exempt from the interest changes, and for how long any exemption might last.

Consultation closes on 12 July 2021. The measures will be introduced into Parliament later this year but will apply from 1 October 2021.

The discussion document Design of the interest limitation rule and additional bright-line rules will be available at [https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2021/2021-dd-interest-limitation-and-bright-line-rules](/publications/2021/2021-dd-interest-limitation-and-bright-line-rules)
 and accompanying summary sheets at [taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz](/)
.

**Editor’s notes:**

The consultation document proposes:

*   Deductions for interest expenses on residential properties will be restricted from 1 October 2021.
*   Interest deductibility on a mortgage on a residential investment property acquired before 27 March 2021 will be gradually phased out between 1 October 2021 and 31 March 2025. Non-grandparented interest would immediately cease to be deductible from 1 October 2021.
*   Interest deductibility on a residential investment property acquired on or after 27 March would immediately cease to be deductible from 1 October 2021, unless an exemption applies.
*   Property development and new builds would be exempt from the interest limitation rules. In addition, new builds would be subject to a five year brightline test, rather than the ten year test.
*   Non-residential properties (for example commercial or industrial properties) would not be subject to the new rules. Also excluded would be employee accommodation, farmland, care facilities such as hospitals, convalescent homes, nursing homes, and hospices, commercial accommodation such as hotels, motels and boarding houses retirement villages and rest homes.
*   The main home would not be affected by the new rules. Interest related to any income-earning use of an owner-occupier’s main home such as a flatting situation would continue to be deductible.
*   Community housing providers will not be affected by the interest limitation rules if they are charities or otherwise tax exempt. The Government also proposes to exempt Kāinga Ora and its wholly owned subsidiaries from the interest limitation rules.

Government releases interest limitation proposals
=================================================

The Government has today released draft legislative proposals aimed at limiting the deductibility of interest incurred for residential property investments. The proposals are contained in Supplementary Order Paper No 64.

In summary, residential investment properties capable of being used for long term accommodation would be subject to the proposed rules. However, the following exclusions and exemptions are proposed:

*   an exclusion for the main family home
*   exclusions for several types of residential property, and
*   exemptions for new builds and for property development.

A set of information sheets is available providing general information about how the proposed rules are intended to work.

The Supplementary Order Paper also contains a proposed five-year new build bright-line test, a new option for calculating fringe benefit tax and a proposal to clarify the application of the business continuity test for carrying forward losses.

Parliament's Finance and Expenditure Select Committee will consider the proposals and is expected to call for public submissions. The proposals will generally have application from 1 October.

Media statement

**Details of interest deductibility rules released**

The Government has released the draft legislation outlining the details of the policy limiting the deductibility of interest costs on residential property investments.

Finance Minister Grant Robertson said the interest limitation proposals, announced in March, aim to stem investor demand for existing residential properties. They do not affect the main family home or new builds.

“Earlier this year we extended the bright-line test from five years to 10 to help reduce the incentive to invest in housing over other types of assets.”

Early indications suggest that enthusiasm for existing residential investment properties might be waning.

“The detailed proposals we are releasing today will further level the playing field for existing homes in favour of first home buyers,” Grant Robertson said.

“Tax is neither the cause nor the solution to the housing problem, but it does have an influence, and this is part of the Government’s overall response.”

Revenue Minister David Parker said the proposals, including the way the new build exemption would be applied, had been subject to public consultation. The proposals would limit the availability of deductions for interest expenses incurred by residential property investors from 1 October 2021.

“As we made clear when we announced the policy in March, for existing residential investment property acquired on or after 27 March 2021 deductions for the cost of interest will no longer be allowed.

“Interest deductions on borrowings drawn down before 27 March 2021 for existing residential property acquired before this date would be phased out over the period between 1 October 2021 and 31 March 2025,” he said.

“We want to curb investors’ appetite for existing residential properties but also want to stimulate investment in new housing. That’s why we’re also proposing an exemption for property development and for new builds, allowing interest deductions in full.”

“The Government is committed to boosting the supply of new housing. The exemptions for new builds and for property development will ensure the interest limitation rules do not reduce the ongoing supply of new housing,” Housing Minister Megan Woods said.

A property that received its code compliance certificate on or after 27 March 2020 will be eligible to deduct interest for up to 20 years from the time the property’s code compliance certificate is issued. The exemption will apply to both the initial purchaser of the new build and any subsequent owner within the 20 year period.

Megan Woods said that the new build exemption also applied to purpose-built rentals.

“Purpose-built rentals are large residential developments designed for ongoing rental, rather than sale. This is an emerging area and one where we see real potential to meet gaps in our rental market. I am expecting further advice on purpose-built rentals in coming weeks and will report back to Cabinet on whether there should be an extension beyond the 20 year period for some or all of this sector,” Megan Woods said.

David Parker said that generally speaking, private residential investment properties capable of being used for long-term accommodation would be subject to the rules.

“So hotels for instance, would not be affected by these rules as they are set up to provide short-term, and not long-term accommodation. The owner-occupier of a house with flatmates would not be affected either,” he said.

To help people understand the interest limitation proposals, a set of information sheets are available at taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz.

The changes would be set out in a Supplementary Order Paper that will be considered by the Finance and Expenditure select committee for inclusion in the current taxation bill.

He said that the Supplementary Order Paper also contained two other proposals. These are to provide employers with another option for calculating fringe benefit tax, and to clarify the application of the business continuity test for carrying losses forward.
\[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] FINAL Programme Business Case Addendum Business Transformation Implementing a digital revenue system March 2022 Version: FINAL IN CONFIDENCE Proactive release: This document has been released by Inland Revenue under section 18(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This release supports the purposes of the Official Information Act 1982 by increasing progressively the availability of official information to the people of New Zealand. Table of Contents Page 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Section Page Executive Summary 3 The Economic Case 5 The Commercial Case 19 The Financial Case 21 The Management Case 25 Appendices 29 Executive Summary Page 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Transformation has involved a combination of changes to policy settings, processes, technology, Inland Revenue’s operating model and organisation design, and people capabilities. A multi-year, multi-stage programme, transformation has been far more than an upgrade of technology and has meant changing every aspect of the way Inland Revenue operates. The intent was to deliver a modern, digital revenue system that made tax and payments simpler and more certain for customers. This has been achieved. New Zealand now has a revenue system: • Based around customers’ needs • Easy to understand and interact with • Using near real-time information • Digital and highly automated • Systems and software doing most of the work • More responsive, flexible, and certain for customers • Future proofed to accommodate change. The programme has been implemented on time, under budget, and has achieved its investment objectives. • Customers have online services that meet their expectations for being able to interact digitally with Inland Revenue and which give them certainty and visibility and make it easier for them to pay and receive the right amounts. • Effort has reduced for customers. Tax assessments are largely automated for individuals and businesses can use their own systems to calculate and pay their tax. • With its new analytical capabilities, it is quicker for Inland Revenue to identify when customers are getting things wrong and to work with them proactively. This is helping to ensure customers meet their obligations and receive the payments they are entitled to. • Government now has the ability to make policy changes far more quickly and cost-effectively, as demonstrated by Inland Revenue’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. • Inland Revenue’s systems are robust and reliable and available when customers need to use them. • Inland Revenue is working more efficiently and effectively and costs to the taxpayer have reduced. The investment made in transformation has created the systems and processes required to enable Inland Revenue to operate in the digital age. In total, Inland Revenue is handing back $441 million of the funding approved from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2024. What has been delivered. From 2017 to 2021, six releases across four stages were successfully implemented, progressively moving products to new systems and processes and making improved services available to customers. Digital services are enabling customers to do as much for themselves as possible in a way and at a time that suits them. Through their myIR account customers can file returns, make payments, advise Inland Revenue of changes in their circumstances, and apply for support online. Use of Inland Revenue’s digital channels has increased significantly in recent years, with user sessions for myIR trebling from 17 million for the year ended 30 June 2016 to 50 million for the year ended 30 June 2021. Over the same period, use of Inland Revenue’s website nearly doubled from 29 million to 57 million sessions. To support the successful migration of products, a co- existence solution was built to ensure heritage systems and processes would continue to run in parallel. This solution was adjusted for every release as products and data were shifted, enabling Inland Revenue to continue to provide services to customers without dropping the ball. Huge amounts of customer data was successfully moved from the old system to the new system. Over the 5 year period, Inland Revenue moved approximately 30 million accounts, 77 million returns, 470 million transactions and 770 million KiwiSaver contributions. Alongside migrating products, an extensive programme of policy changes was also implemented. Changes to policy settings were aligned with the movement of products to new systems and processes to minimise the change impacts for customers. For example, automatic year-end income tax assessments were introduced when income tax was migrated. This was the biggest change for individuals in approximately 20 years. Other significant changes to policy settings which enabled the move to automatic assessments included the move to payday filing for employers and changes to reporting requirements for payers of investment income. End-of-year refunds are automatically calculated and paid to individuals based on the information Inland Revenue holds about them. Since they were introduced for the tax year ending 31 March 2019, Inland Revenue has paid $1.8 billion directly into people’s bank accounts. Page 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Businesses can now choose to work out and pay tax as a by-product of normal business processes, rather than calculating and paying it separately. They can provide Inland Revenue with information from their own systems. Higher levels of automation and rules built into systems mean straight forward transactions are processed with no human intervention. For example, around 93% of GST returns are processed straight through, ensuring customers get valid refunds quickly. Compliance now happens in real time. Transformation has made things simpler for customers and there has been significant shift in both filing and payment compliance as a result. On time filing was at 85% at 30 June 2016, the year immediately before transformation began and as at 28 February 2022 was 96%. On time payments are up around 4% over the same time period. Over the last five years, the focus of compliance has moved from the end (enforcement after the event) to ‘Right from the Start’. The quality and frequency of the data Inland Revenue collects has improved and a significant investment has been made in analytics. The focus is now on real time integrity, providing opportunities to intervene earlier when customers get it wrong, either accidentally or deliberately. This reduces the need for post-return work, whether that is debt collection or audit and investigation. Compliance checks are increasingly occurring at the time a transaction takes place. Every return that can generate a refund is checked automatically and upfront checks have been built into application processes for COVID-19 related support. Inland Revenue is far more able to respond to government priorities. Throughout delivery of the programme, Inland Revenue has continued to support the Government’s priorities, including its response to COVID- 19. New Zealand now has a very responsive and robust revenue system, which has enabled relief packages such as the small business cashflow (loan) scheme and the resurgence support payment to be delivered within weeks. It is easy for customers to check their eligibility for support online and, if they are, payments arrive in their accounts within days. This would simply not have been possible before transformation. Mobile workplace technology has meant Inland Revenue could keep providing services during several significant disruptions in recent years, including the Kaikoura earthquake, long-term building closures due to seismic issues, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Inland Revenue would have been severely constrained in these situations prior to transformation. What has made transformation successful. Inland Revenue has reflected on the factors that made it possible to successfully implement a multi-year, multi- stage, highly complex programme. These include: • Investing in the right capability. Inland Revenue recruited an experienced team with a track record in delivering transformational change. • Choosing the right partners. Having the right partners is critical and Inland Revenue developed very strong partnerships with its delivery partners. Core technology decisions were made early. • Leading from the top. The Commissioner was the Senior Responsible Owner and a Deputy Commissioner had a sole focus on transformation. Transformation can’t be an add on to a busy day job. • Developing a clear vision and roadmap. The programme roadmap set out the starting point (GST) and overall phasing. Strong programme disciplines helped to ensure that transformation remained on schedule. Scope was managed tightly by strongly relying on out-of-the-box processes to avoid unnecessary configuration or customisation. • Establishing strong and effective governance. This was instrumental in establishing the disciplines needed for successful delivery and was supported by a robust approach to risk management and active financial management practices. • Building and maintaining stakeholder and customer support. Actively engaging with customers and stakeholders helped Inland Revenue to put customer needs at the centre of its thinking. • Adapting as you go. As a result of lessons learned, Inland Revenue actively changed its approach as the programme progressed. These insights were shared with stakeholders, including other agencies. • Taking people on the journey. From early on, Inland Revenue was open with its people about what the changes would mean, including being a smaller organisation at the end. A significant investment in capability development readied people for their next opportunity, whether with Inland Revenue or not. Although the programme will close by 30 June 2022, Inland Revenue will continue to transform by further leveraging the capabilities that have been delivered. Inland Revenue will continue to look for opportunities to further reduce effort for customers and improve their experiences. Page 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] THE ECONOMIC CASE Confirming delivery of the preferred way forward This section outlines what has been achieved as a result of transformation and confirms that the programme investment objectives have been met. The transformation programme has achieved the outcomes intended Page 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] In this final addendum, it is useful to start with a reminder of why Inland Revenue embarked on its business transformation programme. In the mid-to-late-2000s Inland Revenue was facing a number of significant challenges: • a risk of operational failure affecting tax and payments, • slow and costly policy implementation, • inability to meet customers’ expectations of modern services, and • inability to optimise information across the public sector. In March 2013, the government accepted that there was a “case for change” and agreed to modernise the revenue system through re -engineering business processes, supported by new technology. In November 2015, the government agreed to invest in transformation to reduce customer effort and cost, improve compliance levels, make policy changes faster and more cost effectively, improve systems resilience, and make Inland Revenue more efficient. Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme has involved a combination of changes to policy, process, technology, and people capabilities. It has been far more than an upgrade of technology and has changed every aspect of the way Inland Revenue operates. Transformation provided the opportunity to fundamentally review how the revenue system is administered to make tax and payments simpler and more certain for customers. The intent was to deliver a modern, digital revenue system that enabled customers to do as much for themselves as possible in a way and at a time that suited them. The objectives of transformation The transformation programme had six investment objectives: • Improving the customer experience by making it easier and simpler for taxation and social policy customers, with a particular focus on enhanced digital provision of services. • Delivering new and more effective services to improve customer compliance and help support the outcomes of social policies. • Increasing the secure sharing of intelligence and information to improve delivery of services to New Zealanders and improve public sector performance. • Improving agility so that policy changes can be made in a timely and cost effective manner. • Minimising the risk of protracted system outages and intermittent systems failure. • Improving productivity and reducing the cost of providing Inland Revenue’s services. These objectives have been achieved. The examples provided in this addendum are illustrative of the outcomes that have been achieved, rather than an exhaustive list of all the changes introduced by transformation. Please refer to Appendix A for a timeline of the major changes introduced by transformation. Throughout a period of significant change, customers have continued to have trust and confidence in Inland Revenue. As at 28 February 2022, 91% of customers said they had trust and confidence in Inland Revenue, compared to 88% as at 30 June 2016, the last full year before changes began to be implemented. Outcome 1: It is easier and simpler for customers to do what they need to do using digital services Customers now have digital services for all the taxes and social policies that Inland Revenue adminsters. Use of these services is growing. The percentage of individual income tax payments made digitally was 99% as at 28 February 2022. The percentage of returns received electronically has increased from 73% for the year ending 30 June 2016 to 99% as at 28 February 2022. Paper filing is now the exception with around 99% of employment information filed digitally. The changes introduced by transformation have meant that: • Many interactions with Inland Revenue are automated, for example end of year refunds. • Customers have more options available to them to keep themselves on track, for example being able to set up instalment arrangements through myIR. The transformation programme has achieved the outcomes intended Page 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • New products are designed with a digital first approach, for example the COVID-19 response products. End of year assessments for individuals are automated. Following the introduction of changes to employment and investment income reporting and a new year-end process, most individuals now don’t need to do anything at the end of the year to work out whether they have a refund or tax to pay. Inland Revenue does it all for them and customers can see the results in myIR. The year ending 31 March 2019 was the first time income tax assessments were automatically issued to individuals. For that year, Inland Revenue automatically refunded $650 million to 1.5 million customers. For the year ending 31 March 2020, 1.8 million individual customers automatically received $714 million in refunds. For the year ending 31 March 2021, $455 million had been refunded to 1.3 million customers as at 30 June 2021. Final figures are not yet available as customers have until April 2022 to file their 2021 returns. The year ending 31 March 2021, was the first full year Inland Revenue received more frequent employment and investment income information. This, combined with new analytical tools, has enabled Inland Revenue to intervene earlier where things aren’t right to help customers pay and receive the right amounts. As a result, average, end-of-year refunds and bills to pay are reducing as intended as shown in the diagrams below. Inland Revenue has improved its approach each year, including speeding up the issuing of assessments. Around two thirds of assessments, approximately 2.1 million, were issued within 11 working days in 2021. It is easier and quicker for customers to claim their donations tax credits refunds. Donations tax credit claims are now scanned and analytical tools verify receipts in straightforward cases. This means these straightforward claims are processed and paid with no human intervention. For the year ending 30 June 2021, 82% of claims were made digitally. Prior to transformation, this was a paper process with customers filling in a form and mailing it with their receipts to Inland Revenue. Receipts were keyed into Inland Revenue’s systems manually. Refunds could take weeks to get to customers. Online services are enabling greater self-management for customers. There are more options available to customers to manage their own affairs. For example, for the year ended 30 June 2021, customers set up 57,000 instalment arrangements themselves in myIR to pay off debt. This represented 41% of the total instalment arrangements set up. Previously, customers would have had to contact Inland Revenue to arrange this. The final stage of transformation went live in two releases in 2021, expanding the range of digital services available to customers. Since 1 March 2021, paid parental leave customers have been able to apply for and track the progress of their application, view next payment details, and view and maintain their personal details. Customers and their employers no longer have to provide an income estimate, The transformation programme has achieved the outcomes intended Page 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] as Inland Revenue pre-populates customers’ income for them as part of the application process. Inland Revenue only asks for information not already held and automates as many applications as possible. Previously, everything was paper-based and paid parental leave payments were not in myIR, Inland Revenue’s secure online service. It is easier for the owners of unclaimed money 1 to track their funds down and claim them, and for the financial institutions or agencies involved to comply with the rules. Owners are able to claim their money through myIR. This has reduced the information they need to provide as Inland Revenue already knows who they are and they just need to prove ownership. Previously, customers had to email or write to Inland Revenue. For duties and New Zealand foreign trusts, customers are able to manage their obligations through myIR, making it significantly easier for them to meet these obligations. Since October 2021, child support customers have had better visibility of their obligations and payments in myIR. They are also able to do more for themselves, including registering online and advising Inland Revenue of any changes in their circumstances. Information sharing and communication with other agencies has improved through the use of portals and secure file transfer. 1 Money (such as a bank deposit) which has become disconnected or detached from its owner. Unclaimed money is passed on from the holder The processing of payments and employer deductions has been streamlined and is helping to ensure that receiving carers get their child support as soon as possible after the due date. Payments now get to carers faster. From November 2021 onwards, child support payments are passed on by the 23 rd of the same month, as long as the liable (paying) parent has paid on time. Previously, payments were made on the 7 th of the month following the due date. In addition, Inland Revenue can now make payments directly to overseas bank accounts. Previously the department sent cheques, and since it stopped using cheques in March 2020 has used a series of work arounds to release funds overseas. In October 2021, Inland Revenue upgraded the online services all customers use. A more modern look and feel for myIR, and simplified presentation of information, is making it easier for customers to focus on what is relevant and important. The layout adapts to fit the size of any screen without loss of functionality, making it seamless to use myIR across different devices, including mobile phones. Simplified navigation is allowing customers to easily find and do what they need to do. Surveys after go-live showed that: • Overall, seven in ten individual customers found it quite or very easy to do what they need to do. • Around eight in ten business customers found it quite or very easy to do what they need to do. after 5 years to Inland Revenue as the custodian until the funds can be claimed. Owners have up to 60 years to claim their funds. • Overall, seven in ten intermediaries from smaller organisations and six in ten from larger organisations found easy to do what they need to do. As high users of myIR, intermediaries will have been very familiar with the previous version. This demonstrates of the benefits of choosing a commercial-off-the-shelf system as it is “evergreen”. This means that systems are updated on an ongoing basis so they are always up-to-date. An upgrade was not possible in FIRST, Inland Revenue’s heritage core processing system. Upgrades will become part of the normal cycle of events in the years to come so that customers and Inland Revenue itself benefit from the latest advances in technology and services. Small-to -medium sized businesses who use digital services say they make things quick and easy. Comments from Inland Revenue’s 2021 survey of small- to-medium sized businesses show that improvements to online services and Inland Revenue’s website and the ability to file from software are making a difference to those using them. “Linking GST to Xero accounting software has saved me a lot of time and calculations. End-of-year taxes are made easy with Xero.” The transformation programme has achieved the outcomes intended Page 9 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] “Being able to log in to myIR - I can access information quickly and do my GST returns easily. Sending email correspondence from here has also been handy.” “I find the website a great source of information. Anything I need to research is pretty easy to find so overall, it has been quite straightforward keeping up to date with all our tax obligations” COVID-19 products have been designed to make it easy for customers to apply for support. The small business cashflow (loan) scheme, resurgence support payment, loss carry-back scheme, and writing off interest on late payments have been designed to make it easy for customers to check their eligibility, apply for support, and receive the payments or relief they are entitled to. Digital services and upfront checks have provided customers with certainty as quickly as possible. The vast majority of applications have been made online with around $4 billion in funds paid out in total for the loan scheme and resurgence support payment within a day or two. Outcome 2: It is easier for customers to pay and receive the right amounts and harder not to The vast majority of Inland Revenue’s customers try to do the right thing. As a result of transformation, it is easier for customers to do so and this is evident in customers’ behaviour. The percentage of returns filed on time was 96% as at 28 February 2022, a significant increase on the 85% recorded for the year ended 30 June 2016. The percentage of tax payments made on time increased from 87% to 91% over the same period. The changes introduced by transformation have meant that new processes and new capabilities are making it seamless and low effort for customers to meet their obligations and receive the right entitlements. Inland Revenue is better able to use the information it holds to help customers pay and receive the right amounts. This is evident in the improvements made to the administration of Working for Families payments and prescribed investor rates. Analytical capabilities are enabling Inland Revenue to put checks in place upfront and to identify compliance risks more quickly and act on them in more targeted ways. This can be seen with the COVID-19 products and the bright- line property rule. Working for Families customers have certainty sooner. In February each year, Inland Revenue assesses entitlements for approximately 380,000 Working for Families customers which will apply from 1 April. This is known as rollover. This process is now faster and more accurate, providing certainty to customers sooner, following the move of Working for Families to new systems and processes in April 2019: • Previously, it took more than 12 hours to rollover entitlements in old systems and processes. Now, it takes around 30 minutes. • Previously, Inland Revenue notified customers over a 4 to 5 day period what their future entitlements would be. Now, notifications are sent as soon as entitlements have been calculated. • Based on what occurred for the 2021 rollover, Inland Revenue expects to let around 95% of customers know what their entitlements will be through myIR. This is up from around 80% previously. Increasingly, people are on the correct prescribed investor rates. When income tax moved to new systems and processes in April 2019, it became clear that approximately 1.5 million people were on an incorrect prescribed investor rate (PIR). Prior to this it was not possible for Inland Revenue to determine whether people were on an incorrect rate as an individual’s income details were not all held in one place. This was one of the limitations of Inland Revenue’s heritage systems and processes and, as a result, portfolio investment entity income was not associated with in dividual customers. People on a PIR that was too high could not get their overpaid tax refunded as it was a final tax and those on a PIR that was too low paid tax at their marginal tax rate (which was often higher than their PIR). Following changes to legislation, from 1 April 2020, Inland Revenue has provided portfolio investment entities with correct PIRs for people on an incorrect rate. From the year ending 31 March 2021, portfolio investment entity income is included in the end-of-year income tax assessment process and automated where The transformation programme has achieved the outcomes intended Page 10 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] possible. This means that people on a PIR that is too high have their overpaid tax refunded and those on a rate that is too low pay tax at the correct PIR rather than their marginal tax rate. Since April 2021, one of the new gateway services 2 available has been a PIR calculator that financial institutions can call on-demand and in volume to obtain their customer’s recommended PIR. These changes are helping to ensure that customers who don’t choose the correct PIR for their circumstances don’t unknowingly end up paying too much tax that they cannot get back as was historically the case. Inland Revenue is better targeting its activity to help support customers. Using its new analytical capabilities, Inland Revenue is better able to target activity based on customer need. For example, before the 2021 end-of-year square up for Working for Families customers Inland Revenue contacted all families new to the scheme to let them know what to expect. This is an example of proactively using the information already held about customers to help build their understanding. 2 Gateway services enable direct machine-to-machine interactions between systems Legislative changes to support the final release in the programme will make it easier for customers to pay the right amount of child support and stop debt compounding. Policy changes are being implemented progressively to reduce the complexity of child support, improve fairness, and increase compliance. Since 1 April 2021, Inland Revenue has not charged incremental penalties on late child support payments. Other policy changes came into effect when child support moved to new systems and processes on 28 October 2021. These changes are making it easier for liable parents to keep on top of their payments. For example, employer deductions are now compulsory for parents new to paying child support. Inland Revenue estimates that around 70% of child support deductions will be made through employers following this change. From 1 April 2022 there will be changes to how child support is assessed. For example, a wider definition of “income” will include investment income. Analytical capabilities are enabling Inland Revenue to better support customers to pay and receive the right amounts. The analytical capabilities in both the data and intelligence platform and START 3 , Inland Revenue’s new core platform, are making it easier for customers to 3 START stands for simplified tax and revenue technology and is the name Inland Revenue has chosen for the GenTax software provided by FAST Enterprises LLC. comply and harder not to. A significant amount of non- compliant activity can now be stopped at the earliest possible stage. • START Discovery Manager enables Inland Revenue to identify errors and issues requiring review. • Rules in START Integrity Manager prevent revenue loss by ensuring people only receive the payments they are entitled to and enable compliance activity to be better targeted. These rules can be adjusted very quickly when needed. • START Decision Support Manager helps Inland Revenue to make better decisions by providing data and analysis to support and recommend the most appropriate actions. • The data and intelligence platform is enabling the large variety of data Inland Revenue collects to be quickly collated and made sense of and made available to respond to emerging trends and inform decisions for customers. These capabilities complement each other and are enabling Inland Revenue to better support customers to get things right and better target its compliance activity for those who choose not to. Many straight-forward transactions are now automated, with rules in systems stopping those that need review. It is just as important to stop revenue going out the door The transformation programme has achieved the outcomes intended Page 11 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] when it shouldn’t be as it is to ensure people pay and receive the amounts they should. Every return that can generate a refund is checked automatically. All amended returns are checked and screened. Between 1 July 2020 and 30 June 2021, approximately 117,000 returns across all tax types were identified that had errors or potentially fraudulent with a value of just over $300 million. Please note this data is unaudited. For the year ending 30 June 2021, donations tax credit claims worth $16.7 million were identified that were either an error or potentially fraudulent. Of this, claims totalling $2.5 million were referred to Inland Revenue’s audit teams to investigate. Previously Inland Revenue would have had to increase its workforce significantly to identify these incorrect claims and to cope with the extra audit and debt work. More compliance effort is now upfront rather than waiting until the end of the year when customers may find themselves in debt. One of the benefits of new capabilities is that a high trust approach is not high risk. Inland Revenue can now find the right balance between looking at the applications for support or returns that need to be looked at without unnecessarily stopping those that should go through. Compliance checks have been built into application processes for COVID-19 products. Around 14,000 applications for the small business cashflow (loan) scheme totalling $200 million were stopped by upfront checks as at March 2022. This represents around 10% of the applications received. Approximately 135,000 applications for the resurgence support payment (RSP), around 15% of the applications received, had also been stopped at the same date. When the RSP was introduced in February 2021, Inland Revenue was able to build on its experiences with implementing the small business cashflow (loan) scheme to ensure appropriate checks were in place up front. This learning has continued as each RSP is activated. For example, when the RSP was activated for the Wellington region on 1 July 2021, the rules were adjusted based on some behaviour observed with the two rounds of payments activated for the Auckland region in February 2021. Customers with applications that are stopped by the upfront checks relating to location are now automatically sent a web message about their application, rather than having to wait for Inland Revenue to contact them. This is a much more efficient way of working and was not something Inland Revenue was able to do when the small business cashflow (loan) scheme was launched. Inland Revenue’s approach to compliance for the RSP took account of feedback from the Auditor General on the Ministry of Social Development’s approach to checking wage subsidy compliance. Applications that have been approved are randomly selected to validate that those customers who made it through the up-front checks were entitled to receive the RSP. Inland Revenue is working more efficiently to ensure compliance with bright-line obligations. Property compliance has been one of the first focus areas to benefit from the data and intelligence platform (DIP), with an initial focus on bright-line. Having built a data asset that brings together Inland Revenue data alongside Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) and commercial third party data, the DIP is beginning to provide a view of what is happening with property transactions throughout the country. Every property transaction since 2015 has been assessed to try to determine what kind of sale it was and therefore what tax rules apply. Every month, there are, on average, 3,000 transactions which are under the bright-line period and the DIP identifies those which are potentially subject to the bright-line rule. In November 2020, Inland Revenue sent information to customers (or their agent as directed) who had sold a property within the bright-line period and not indicated it as their main home. Since August 2021, this information has been sent to customers (or their agent) within a month of the sale. The information sent to customers is simply reminding them that if the sale is subject to income tax due to the bright-line property rule, then any profits from the sale must be declared in their income tax return when it becomes due. Where they do need to return the income, customers (or their agents) are asked to complete the property sale information form and submit it with their annual income tax return. Customers (or their agents) are The transformation programme has achieved the outcomes intended Page 12 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] also asked to let Inland Revenue know if the transaction is not subject to the bright-line rule. This approach is delivering results: • For the year ended 30 June 2020, 91 voluntary disclosures were received. • For the year ended 30 June 2021, 397 voluntary disclosures were received – a 300% increase compared to the previous year. By prompting more people to come forward and self- correct Inland Revenue’s compliance specialists are freed up to focus on the more non-compliant customers. Inland Revenue is now able to work more efficiently and effectively when transactions are identified that do require a closer look. Comparing cases selected by the DIP with those selected before the platform was in place shows the time saved in preparing bright-line cases for audit. The time spent preparing cases dropped from 15 hours to 10 hours and the time spent auditing decreased from 30 hours to 8 hours. However, effort for small-to -medium sized business has not yet reduced as much as expected. While the aim of the transformation programme was to reduce compliance effort for all customers, smaller businesses were expected to benefit to a greater degree. Approximately 90% of businesses have five or fewer employees and, typically, compliance tasks are performed by the owner/operator. Inland Revenue has regularly surveyed owners of small- to-medium sized businesses (SMEs) to understand how much time and effort they spend meeting their tax obligations. The 2013 survey is the baseline for measuring compliance effort reductions for SMEs. At that time, the median time SMEs spent on meeting their tax obligations was 36 hours a year. The 2021 survey showed that SMEs reported spending 5 fewer hours on compliance in 2021 compared to 2013. This is below the target Inland Revenue set itself of 15 fewer hours for the 2020/21 year. The COVID-19 pandemic has created very challenging business conditions, particularly for SMEs. While there has been a significant amount of Government support available to businesses affected by the pandemic, they need to apply for and demonstrate they are eligible for this support. In addition, Inland Revenue has been encouraging businesses to stay on top of their compliance obligations by filing on time, even if they are not in a position to pay the amounts owing. The graph below shows how perceptions of the time spent on tax compliance have changed since 2013. The introduction of mandatory payday filing from 1 April 2019 appears to have had an impact, with time spent complying with PAYE obligations being one of the main drivers of the increase in time since the 2018 survey. Although SMEs say they are spending more time on compliance, the acceptability of the time spent on tax has improved since 2018. In 2021, more SME owners agreed (60%) that the time their business spends on tax matters is acceptable to them than disagreed (17%). The percentage agreeing that the time is acceptable has increased since 2018 (when it was 55%). Reducing effort for SMEs will continue to be an ongoing area of focus for Inland Revenue. Outcome 3: The information Inland Revenue holds is more up-to-date and accurate and can be accessed more easily As a result of transformation, the range of participants in the revenue system has expanded significantly. Third parties are now able to connect to Inland Revenue’s systems to securely access, submit and share data to provide a broader range of services to their clients. This has enabled customers to interact with the revenue system through their natural systems of choice. The two examples given here show what it now possible. Gateway services are making it easier for third parties and Inland Revenue to exchange information. A suite of new gateway services was made available in April 2021. These were co-designed with software providers. Gateway services enable direct machine-to- machine interactions between external systems, The transformation programme has achieved the outcomes intended Page 13 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] “software”, and START (Inland Revenue’s new core processing system). They are a fast, high-volume channel and allow software providers to offer improved filing and client management services to tax agents in their chosen practice management software package. The new gateway services offer several advantages. They provide improved support for filing with the ability to retrieve filing obligations, pre-populate returns with data that Inland Revenue holds, retrieve the status of returns, and amend already submitted returns. This improved returns service, alongside the ability to access an extended set of notifications relating to the client and the return itself will enable tax agents to better manage and track their clients’ positions. Gateway services are two-way, enabling tax agents and Inland Revenue to exchange information. The gateway services that have been developed also provide the ability for other customers to file and update their information such as employers, banks and KiwiSaver scheme providers. Transitioning of KiwiSaver providers to new gateway services was completed during 2021. Three of the new gateway services enable KiwiSaver providers to query the KiwiSaver membership data and contribution history Inland Revenue holds in real-time. Previously, providers had to contact Inland Revenue by phone or email to request this information which usually took more than a week (often several) and required manual effort. Providers can now do this securely, in real- time, and at volume from their systems. The IRD number validation service is being used by banks, KiwiSaver providers, tax agents and payroll providers to ensure that their clients are correctly identified thus improving data quality and reducing error rates. The 7 new customer application programming interfaces (APIs) enable external partners to securely query and update the data Inland Revenue holds about customers in real-time from their systems. These APIs are heavily used by tax agents. The improvement in the accuracy and timeliness of this data benefits Inland Revenue, its partners, and the other government agencies with whom Inland Revenue shares data. Information is shared with MSD to support the administration of the wage subsidy scheme. Having more up-to-date employment income information as a result of employers moving to payday filing from 1 April 2019 has enabled Inland Revenue to effectively support the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) in delivering the COVID-19 wage subsidy scheme. Information about self-employed individuals, employers and employees is shared with MSD which enables many applications to be automatically approved. Many however need further clarification and initially a direct 0800 number was established for MSD staff to connect directly with Inland Revenue. A portal has been in place since 11 June 2020 and allows approved MSD people to access the information they need to verify applications directly, reducing the number of calls and the manual work, and ensuring applications are processed efficiently. To protect individuals' privacy, MSD users have read-only access to selected data, limited to the minimum data necessary in order to verify whether or not any particular wage subsidy scheme application should be approved. The portal benefits customers as their applications can be processed more quickly, benefits MSD through an improved ability to administer the subsidy scheme, and benefits Inland Revenue as far fewer calls are received from MSD to validate information. Outcome 4: Decision-makers have greater agility Government now has substantially improved agility for the products Inland Revenue administers. A number of new products, not originally within the scope of transformation, have been delivered by the programme. This includes the products introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For a full list of the additional scope delivered, please refer to appendix B. The department’s support of the response to COVID-19 demonstrates the speed with which new products have been developed and made available. Two products introduced in response to COVID-19 illustrate what is now possible: • The Small Business Cashflow (Loan) Scheme was announced by the Government on 5 May 2020. Applications opened on 12 May 2020. Inland Revenue had been working on the scheme since mid-late March 2020. • The Resurgence Support Payment (RSP) was announced by the Minister of Finance on The transformation programme has achieved the outcomes intended Page 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 15 December 2020 and went live for the first time on 23 February 2021 as a result of a resurgence of COVID-19 in Auckland. Since then, 10 rounds of the payment have been activated. In both cases, it took a little over a month to design, build and test the first phase. Experiences with implementing products previously in Inland Revenue’s old systems and processes suggest that delivering the RSP would have taken around 3 to 4 times longer. This level of agility can be preserved by having a system that deals with 90% of transactions, with exceptions handled by people. Implementing earlier components of the COVID-19 response provided a good basis for implementing the Resurgence Support Payment. To implement the RSP, Inland Revenue adopted established design patterns within START. Although the RSP may appear to be a different product, it shares a common design with the small business cashflow (loan) scheme. The reuse of existing patterns, and the fact that START is a commercial-off-the-shelf system will help to ensure that the RSP is able to evolve to meet the future needs of government and/or customers. To ensure that as many applications as possible could be automatically processed and those that should be stopped for review were, Inland Revenue drew on its experiences with implementing the small business 4 Applications closed on 13 January 2022 cashflow (loan) scheme and supporting MSD to administer the wage subsidy scheme. Decision Support Manager was used for the first time in the assessment of applications. The upfront integrity rules held in Decision Support Manager can be quickly adjusted if new issues emerge. A second resurgence of COVID-19 in Auckland in February 2021 meant the RSP was opened to a second round of applications on 8 March 2021. The original design anticipated there could be a need for further applications, with potentially overlapping timeframes, so very little configuration of the system was required. Further applications were available following a tourist to Wellington testing positive to COVID-19 on 23 June 2021. The Delta outbreak which began on 17 August 2021 resulted in successive rounds of resurgence support payments being made available. As at March 2022 4 , around 840,000 payments totalling $2.9 billion had been made to approximately 231,000 customers. Inland Revenue’s ongoing response to COVID-19 demonstrates the benefits of the investment made in transformation and the agility decision-makers now have. Outcome 5: Inland Revenue’s systems are robust and reliable All four stages of the transformation programme have now been successfully implemented in a series of releases from 2017 to 2021. All the products Inland Revenue administers are now running on START. Please refer to appendix C for the programme roadmap and to appendix D for information about the effort involved in migrating products from heritage systems to new systems and processes. Decommissioning of heritage systems is well underway. FIRST, Inland Revenue’s core heritage processing system, was switched off on 30 November 2021. In addition to START, and in line with the all-of- government strategy of moving to digital first and cloud- based solutions, Inland Revenue has adopted a number of other COTS applications: • Sitecore – manages the content of public facing websites, as well as the internal intranet. • Microsoft 365 – the platform on which Inland Revenue’s people operate. This enabled the roll out of laptops and tablets which allowed Inland Revenue to operate seamlessly during COVID-19 disruptions. It also ensures all information created by any staff member is stored securely centrally, thus reducing the risk of data loss. • Oracle cloud applications – a fully cloud based ‘as-a- Service’ solution supporting Inland Revenue’s finance and human resources functions, which has been named Ātea. • Oracle web centre content – supports Inland Revenue’s knowledge and document management platform, which has been named STAX. The transformation programme has achieved the outcomes intended Page 15 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • ServiceNow – Supporting the Inland Revenue-wide Service Desk. • SAS – a managed suite of products making up the data and intelligence platform (DIP). • Microsoft Sentinel – an information security repository allowing any information security risks or incidents to be managed. • One Identity Manager – a cloud-based service that enables identity governance and administration including privileged access management. • Atlassian (Jira, Confluence) – a suite of products supporting project delivery and risk and issue management. Systems are configured to Inland Revenue’s requirements with minimal customisation. Inland Revenue’s new infrastructure is performing very well as evidenced by its stability in coping with a significant increase in volumes. During 2021, the third round of automatic end-of-year income tax assessments for individuals saw Inland Revenue’s systems handle substantially higher loads than in 2020. Applications for COVID-19 support and relief further added to the load. Inland Revenue’s systems would simply not have been able to cope with the volumes experienced as recently as 2-3 years ago. System availability targets were consistently exceeded during 2020/21. The number of critical incidents Inland Revenue experiences has declined, with few if any affecting customer-facing services. Three disaster recovery exercises have been successfully run, with the most recent in November 2020. Inland Revenue has moved to a new workplace environment, where everyone is mobile-enabled. People being able to work effectively remotely enables Inland Revenue to respond quickly and smoothly to disruptions, such as COVID-19 and building closures. As a result, Inland Revenue’s organisational resilience has increased significantly. The evergreen nature of the services and products that are now used to deliver services, including technology infrastructure, means these are all delivered as-a-service and kept up to date by trusted partners and vendors. As a result, Inland Revenue’s services and products will always be up to date. The move to cloud computing has provided numerous benefits. Inland Revenue’s systems are now off-the-shelf and cloud-based. The benefits of this approach include: • Collaboration: Third parties can communicate and share information more easily with Inland Revenue. • Flexibility: Inland Revenue’s people can access tools and data from any location. • Improved business continuity: In the event of a natural disaster, data is stored in a secure location and is able to be accessed. • Currency/efficiency: Software is regularly updated and current. Outcome 6: Inland Revenue is working more efficiently High levels of automation, straight through processes that reduce effort for customers and Inland Revenue, and digital uptake have changed the nature of Inland Revenue’s work considerably. As customer effort has reduced, Inland Revenue’s work effort has reduced. The size of Inland Revenue’s workforce has reduced commensurately with an FTE profile as at 30 June 2021 that is 28% less than it was at 30 June 2016. Processing times have improved significantly, providing customers with certainty sooner. The following examples illustrate the speed with which Inland Revenue can now process transactions. KiwiSaver and student loans moved to new systems and processes in April 2020. KiwiSaver providers apply for the government contribution on behalf of their members after 30 June each year. In the first 5 days of July 2021, Inland Revenue processed more than 2.6 million claims for $904 million in total, representing the bulk of the claims. On 5 July 2021 alone, 1.2 million claims were processed overnight in 35 minutes. This was the first year Inland Revenue was able to keep up with incoming demand and process and pay claims on the same day. Error rates were well down on 2020, as the issues that were causing many of the errors have been addressed. The transformation programme has achieved the outcomes intended Page 16 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Previously, the quickest Inland Revenue managed to catch up on processing the backlog of errors was 12 days. Closing a student loan used to be resource intensive for Inland Revenue, resulting in delays for customers. The information needed to close a loan took time to arrive, as employer monthly schedules (replaced by payday filing in April 2019) were filed at the end of the following month. This meant the majority of loans were overpaid by the time Inland Revenue took any action to close them. In most cases, multiple contacts with customers were required to sort things out. This meant delays in closing the loan and refunding overpayments. Customers could wait months for overpaid amounts to be refunded to them, resulting in unnecessary frustration. Overall, each account took about 40 to 45 days to finalise and required considerable follow up with employers and customers. Now, the vast majority of loan closures are processed overnight. For example, between January and June 2021, 97% of straightforward closures were processed overnight. Child support moved to new systems and processes in October 2021. New systems and processes are far more efficient. This can be seen, for example, with the automated population of case information being sent to Services Australia for child support cases managed under the reciprocal agreement. The monthly schedule Inland Revenue sends to Australia outlining payments collected on their behalf can now be produced automatically in a matter of minutes. Previously it could take up to two days to produce and was highly manual. Inland Revenue now automatically notifies employers or the Ministry of Social Development when deductions need to be made from income or a benefit to pay a liable parent’s child support. Since go-live Inland Revenue has automatically set up over 6,000 deductions from income that would previously have been done manually and taken longer. These are deductions for newly liable parents, parents already paying by deduction and whose source of income has changed, and parents who have defaulted on their payments. Inland Revenue is better targeting its specialist resources to help support customers. Inland Revenue’s customer compliance specialists are able to focus on more complex, higher value customer interventions, such as audits or investigations. Imputation transactions provide a good example of this in practice. These transactions are often misunderstood by both agents and customers and are recorded incorrectly as a result. The data and intelligence platform enables risks and reporting anomalies to be quickly identified. This has significantly reduced the time (from potentially hours to a few minutes) needed to identify which cases should be reviewed by one of Inland Revenue’s compliance specialists. Specialists assigned a case can easily access a report which highlights the risk areas for review and includes all the detail required to review imputation returns. Inland Revenue’s organisation design has fundamentally changed. Organisation design changes were progressively introduced from February 2018 to support the move to a customer-centric, intelligence-led, agile and inclusive organisation. As part of the re-design, management layers were streamlined to support the move to broad-based roles, with leaders focusing on managing people rather than managing work or tasks. A new model for delegations has been adopted, empowering customer-facing staff to resolve more issues for customers at first contact. Working as part of a networked team is now standard practice across Inland Revenue. This was amply demonstrated by the way we responded to COVID-19. Networked teams bring people with different skills and experience together to implement new initiatives and to improve things or resolve issues for customers. The transformation programme has achieved the outcomes intended Page 17 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Tracking achievement of these outcomes. Achievement of the investment objectives is measured against a number of lead and lag indicators shown on the next page. For the 2020/21 year, Inland Revenue achieved seven out of the ten indicators for which there are quantitative measures. The measures not achieved were: • The percentage of customers who find it easy to comply. While this is increasing, this measure is tracking up more slowly than expected. Notwithstanding the significant changes introduced since 2017, 82% of customers say they find it easy to comply. • Reduction in compliance time for SMEs. The target for 2020/21 was not achieved, with a saving of 5 hours compared to a target of 15 hours. It appears that COVID-19 and payday filing are having an impact. However the cumulative value of the time saved is above target. Inland Revenue recognises that achieving the targeted time savings by 2023/24 will be challenging, and that an on-going focus on reducing effort for SMEs will be required. • Annual reduction in Inland Revenue’s administrative costs. This was not achieved for 2020/21 as decisions were made to delay some organisational changes in light of COVID-19. However the cumulative reduction in costs is above target and Inland Revenue is confident it will achieve the targeted savings by 2023/24. Although the transformation programme will close by 30 June 2022, Inland Revenue will continue to track and report against its benefit commitments through until 2023/24.

From 2018/19 onwards, Inland Revenue reports on the overall percentage of digital uptake measured in returns filed electronically. 6 Inland Revenue had intended to run the SME compliance cost survey again in 2020, however the impacts of COVID-19, especially on smaller businesses, resulted in a decision being taken to delay the survey until 2021. The 2018 survey has been used as an indicative result. 7 The additional revenue is already included in the government’s revenue forecasts. This indicator is rated as achieved based on increases in proxy measures. 8 These figures do not include investment decisions made by Ministers to support the Government’s response to COVID-19 of $36.9m in 2020/21, $26.5m in 2021/22, and $22.7m in 2022/23. Page 19 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] THE COMMERCIAL CASE Confirming arrangements for the services and products required for on-going operations This section outlines the commercial arrangements Inland Revenue has put in place for the post-transformation environment and the work that will continue beyond programme closure. Enduring commercial arrangements are in place Page 20 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Inland Revenue has moved from a build and maintain environment to using commercial-off-the-self (COTS) solutions. The heritage approach of on-premises perpetual licencing has given way to hosted as-a-service solutions. As a result, Inland Revenue is now more reliant on its key partners to enable services to be delivered to customers. This has necessitated a different approach to commercial relationships, one built on high-trust and collaboration rather than a more traditional service level agreement arrangement. During the implementation of transformation, relationships with key implementation partners were managed by the programme. The initial contracts covered the services and solutions needed to support implementation. As these relationships were always intended to be long-term and as the programme nears a close, the focus has shifted to the ongoing support arrangements needed with partners. The key long-term relationships for Inland Revenue include: • FAST Enterprises LLC (FAST) who provide the core processing platform and customer-facing digital services. • Oracle who provide the enterprise support services platform. • SAS who provide the data and intelligence platform. • Spark who provide data centre and hosting services. 9 Management of user accounts, roles, and access rights for individuals in an organisation. • Microsoft who provide Microsoft 365 and Azure cloud services. • AKQA who provide web services. • TeamIM who provide information knowledge management services. Management of these relationships has now transferred to their enduring home in Inland Revenue’s new organisation structure and appropriate commercial arrangements have been put in place. Work underway. There is a small amount of work to be completed prior to the closure of the transformation programme by 30 June 2022. Decommissioning of heritage systems and processes is proceeding at pace and will be completed by programme closure. Alongside this activity, commercial arrangements with the providers of heritage services and solutions are being terminated to enable Inland Revenue’s heritage data centres to be fully decommissioned. In December 2021, Inland Revenue terminated its mainframe agreement with Unisys and handed FIRST, its heritage core processing system, over to Unisys to begin decommissioning. This was a key milestone for the programme. Other work underway which will be completed before programme closure includes: • Privileged access management and identity governance services 9 is on schedule to replace the heritage identity management processes and systems in March 2022 to enable the exit from the data centres. Further work will be completed in April/May 2022 to conclude this work. • Mobile-Desktop-as-a-Service is an interim solution enabling Inland Revenue’s contact centre staff and FAST’s developers to work from home during pandemic related disruption. This arrangement will be required until Inland Revenue has a new contact centre solution in place. Enduring commercial arrangements are in place Page 21 THE FINANCIAL CASE Confirming the return of funding This section outlines the forecast total costs for transformation and the funding Inland Revenue will return to the Crown at the conclusion of the programme. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] The programme has come in under budget and is returning funding to the Crown Page 22 Confirming the return of funding. This section outlines the forecast total costs for transformation and the funding Inland Revenue will return to the Crown at the conclusion of the programme. With the programme closing on 30 June 2022, this financial case (prepared in March 2022) documents the near completed financial results for transformation, including: • A forecast cost outturn and the funding amount to be handed back to the Crown. • An update on the commitment made in the November 2015 business case regarding Inland Revenue’s funding contribution to transformation. • An update on the business case commitment regarding the size of Inland Revenue’s post-transformation operating baseline. The forecast amounts assume that all the transformation-related technical adjustments submitted through the Budget 2022 technical initiatives process are approved by Cabinet. The transformation programme will come in under budget. Inland Revenue can now provide an estimate of the cost to complete transformation with a high level of confidence. Forecast total capital and operating spend will be approximately $1,641 million over the 10-years from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2024, with an approximately further $450 million for depreciation and capital charge over the same period. This means forecast programme savings of $227 million (12%) across capital and operating expenditure and $214 million ( 32%) for depreciation and capital charge. The combined savings to be handed back to the Crown are therefore approximately $441 million (17%), with a further capital saving of nearly $23 million repurposed by Cabinet for other priority spending in Inland Revenue. The forecast savings could increase slightly once the programme is formally closed and final costs are known. The tables below and on the next page show the total forecast transformation spend for capital and operating and depreciation and capital charge over the 10-year period, broken down by: • Pre-design and design phases (1 July 2014 to 31 December 2015) • Implementation (1 January 2016 to 30 June 2022) • Residual activities 10 deferred due to COVID-19 (1 July 2022 to 30 June 2024) • On-going operating costs until 30 June 2024 • Depreciation and capital charge to 30 June 2024 (shown in separate table). ($ million) Pre-design & design Actual Implementation Forecast Residual activities Forecast One-off costs Forecast On-going to 30/6/2024 Forecast Total spend Forecast Approved funding Budget Forecast underspend Forecast Self-funding increase 11 Total savings handed back to Crown Forecast Capital - 463 21 484 - 484 590 (106) (21) (127) Operating 74 915 35 1,024 133 1,157 1,257 (100) - (100) Total capital & operating 74 1,378 56 1,508 133 1,641 1,847 (206) (21) (227) 10 The residual activities were deferred because the programme had to temporarily redeploy resources to priority COVID-19 initiatives. These activities include work to complete our future-proofed contact centre capability, the optimisation of START and enterprise support services as well as finish embedding new organisational capabilities. 11 Inland Revenue increased its internal capital contribution by self-funding the capital for the residual activities ($21 million). This freed-up an equivalent amount of externally funded capital which can now be returned to the Crown. Capital and operating savings handed back to the Crown thus increased from $206 million to $227 million. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] The programme has come in under budget and is returning funding to the Page 23 ($ million) Total spend Forecast Approved funding Budget Forecast underspend Forecast Depreciation 304 443 (139) Capital charge 146 221 (75) Total depreciation & capital charge 450 664 (214) Savings were achieved through a combination of: • Active commercial practices, with a dedicated team of procurement professionals with significant experience in managing complex, multi-vendor environments. • Tight scope management, with a strong reliance on implementation of out-of-the box processes and no unnecessary configuration or customisation. • A strong focus on delivery, with any delays short-lived and managed within internal contingencies. • Rigorous financial management practices, with regular reviews of budgets and forecasts to ensure we delivered value for money. • Active risk management including regular risk identification and mitigation as well as an annual update of the Quantitative Risk Analysis (QRA) for the cost estimates. Furthermore, Inland Revenue was able to make use of several ‘as-a-Service’ offerings that were not available in the market when the costs for transformation were modelled in the November 2015 business case. These offerings significantly reduced the amount of capital spending, with a corresponding reduction in depreciation and capital charge expenses. Some of the depreciation and capital charge underspend is also due to capital expenditure being incurred later in the programme than was assumed in the business case. 12 The assumption made is that the recommendation to hand back this funding will be approved in the Budget 2022 technical package. Most of the transformation underspend has been returned to the Crown as a saving, with a smaller amount redirected by Cabinet to another priority. Of total generated savings of nearly $464 million over the 10-year period ending 30 June 2024, Inland Revenue has returned nearly $441 million to the Crown. Cabinet agreed to repurpose a further capital funding saving of almost $23 million, through a capital to operating swap, to help manage increased demand and integrity issues related to COVID- 19 within Inland Revenue (CAB-12-MIN-008 refers). Of the total $441 million hand back to the Crown, $12 million was returned in the 2021 October Baseline Update, $160 million was returned in previous years and an amount of $269 million is being returned through the Budget 2022 technical package. The table below shows the amounts handed back over the life of the programme.

Expressed in a different way, this equates to a hand back of nearly 32% of the new Crown funding approved for transformation ($441 million of $1,384 million), i.e. this excludes the funding contributed by Inland Revenue. The commitment made in the November 2015 business case to self-fund a significant portion of the capital and operating costs of transformation has been achieved. In the November 2015 business case, Inland Revenue committed to contributing between 40% and 50% of transformation capital and operating funding from internal sources in the 10-year period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2024. This included a contribution from balance sheet capital reserves as well as savings from the operating baseline. As shown in the table below, Inland Revenue is forecasting to achieve this commitment, with approximately 47% of the capital and operating funding for transformation coming from internal sources. Self-funded cost ($ million) Self-funded amount Forecast Total spend Forecast Self-funded percentage Forecast Business case commitment Capital 280 484 58% Operating 478 1,157 41% Total capital & operating 758 1,641 47% 40% - 50% Inland Revenue’s contribution for the depreciation and capital charge costs was modelled at a minimum of 56% in the business case. As explained previously, the forecast final depreciation and capital charge costs are significantly lower than originally modelled, however the Inland Revenue dollar contribution remained the same as modelled at 13 E xcludes inflation to ensure comparability with the 2015 business case. 14 To ensure a like-for-like comparison between the two years, some adjustments have been made including the removal of time-limited new policy initiatives introduced in the interim as well as transformation design costs in 2014/15 and residual activities in 2022/23. $413 million. Inland Revenue’s percentage contribution to the depreciation and capital charge cost therefore increased to about 90%. In real terms, Inland Revenue’s post-transformation operating baseline is considerably lower than its pre-transformation baseline; this exceeds the department’s November 2015 business case commitment to achieve post-transformation baseline neutrality in real terms. Modelling for the November 2015 business case showed that administrative savings resulting from transformation would offset new operating costs including depreciation. Inland Revenue committed to delivering an operating baseline post-transformation that would be about equal in real terms to the pre-transformation baseline. This commitment has been exceeded. As shown in the table below, while the like-for-like nominal baseline is about the same (1% higher), the post-transformation operating baseline expressed in real terms 13 has reduced by 15%.

Enduring management and governance arrangements are in place Page 26 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Inland Revenue been making changes to its organisation design and policies and practices since 2017 to reflect changes in the nature of its work and to ensure the department could operate sustainably once the programme closes. In addition, a dedicated workstream was established as part of the final stage of the programme to ensure a smooth transition of the services, processes, frameworks and methods that will endure after the programme closes. Since the last addendum was prepared in October 2020, Inland Revenue has: • updated its governance arrangements • completed changes to its organisation design • updated its Enterprise Risk Management Framework and Risk Management Policy • agreed on-going benefit monitoring commitments. Governance arrangements Inland Revenue’s governance arrangements have continued to evolve to ensure they remain fit for purpose. Two new enterprise-level governance bodies have been established: • The Enterprise Priorities and Performance Committee (EPPC) was established in September 2020. EPPC governs Inland Revenue’s performance, health and delivery of key initiatives and activities, and ensures the focus is on the right areas to achieve the strategic direction set by the Strategic Governance Board. • The Data and Information Governance Authority (DIGA) became part of Inland Revenue’s executive-level governance system in August 2021. DIGA ensures Inland Revenue has transparent and accountable governance arrangements that provide oversight of the management and use of data. An updated governance structure for Inland Revenue is shown in the column on the right. Organisation design Inland Revenue is working more efficiently. Higher levels of automation and rules built into systems mean straight forward transactions are processed with no human intervention. For example, around 93% of GST returns are processed straight through, ensuring customers get valid refunds quickly. As customer effort has reduced, the nature of Inland Revenue’s work has changed. This has freed Inland Revenue up to focus on customers who need help and support and those who choose not to comply with their obligations. The size of Inland Revenue’s workforce has reduced commensurately, with 28% fewer full-time equivalents (FTEs) as at 30 June 2021 compared to 30 June 2016. The reduction of 1,556 in the number of FTEs was achieved by adopting a set of workforce management principles. This meant that redundancies were limited to around 450, some of which were voluntary, with the balance achieved through attrition. Enduring management and governance arrangements are in place Page 27 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] A full organisational redesign was completed, beginning in 2017 and concluded during 2021. The new operating model enables Inland Revenue to harness collective strengths and knowledge to solve issues, innovate and improve services using new digital capabilities and networked ways of working, and delegate decisions closer to the customer. Since 2017, Inland Revenue has created new capability-based roles, more flexible teams, and new leadership models.  Capability-based roles are focused on transferable skills such as customer service or digital literacy as well as new capabilities such as data analytics, enabling people to build their capabilities as work has changed. The first three new organisation groups were established in February 2018 to enable a stronger focus on meeting customers’ needs - two Customer & Compliance Services groups, one focused on individuals, families and micro-businesses and one on small, medium and significant enterprises, and the Information and Intelligence Services group. These were followed by new structures and models for Policy and Regulatory Stewardship in 2019 and the Tax Counsel Office in 2020. In 2021, the final organisation design changes resulted in new functions being established for the post-transformation environment. The Corporate and Enabling Services organisation design has resulted in a number of changes which became effective from 1 March 2021. These changes included the establishment of a number of new teams including: • The Planning, Design and Delivery (PDD) group prioritises, designs, schedules and implements changes to START and related business processes resulting from policy changes, government initiatives, budget changes, annual returns, system and service pack upgrades, continuous improvement or other change demand. This group reported to the Deputy Commissioner Transformation until 31 December 2021 and has now transitioned to become part of Customer and Compliance Services (CCS). The Deputy Commissioner, Transformation is providing support and mentoring until the programme closes at 30 June 2022. • The Enterprise Service Delivery team in the Enterprise Services business group has similar responsibilities to PDD for the systems that support the day-to-day running of Inland Revenue. • The Strategic Portfolio Stewardship team in the Enterprise Design and Integrity (ED&I) business group supports enterprise planning, risk management, performance monitoring and reporting, investment analysis, and a portfolio of change initiatives. • The Strategic Architecture team in ED&I ensures there is a clear link between strategy and implementation by translating strategy and policy into integrated, connected and feasible design, which is aligned with organisational frameworks, processes and systems. The team supports Inland Revenue’s decision making by providing system- wide thinking and an end-to-end perspective. When PDD was established it was made up of three business units - Design and Delivery, Capability and Outcomes (C&O), and Customer Experience Design (CXD). Detailed design was completed for the Design and Delivery team by March 2021 as part of the Corporate and Enabling Services design. Detailed design for C&O and CXD was completed in November 2021. Also In November 2021, Inland Revenue established the Compliance Strategy and Innovation team in CCS. This team provides an enduring home for the START analytics work and brings in compliance planning and intervention design work. Inland Revenue’s organisation design changes are now complete with new capability-based roles, more flexible teams and new leadership models. Mobile workplace technology is enabling Inland Revenue’s people to work from anywhere. Inland Revenue kept providing services during several significant disruptions that occurred during the implementation of the programme, including the Kaikoura earthquake, long- term building closures due to seismic issues, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Enduring management and governance arrangements are in place Page 28 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Risk management In October 2021, Inland Revenue updated its Enterprise Risk Management Framework to support accountability, ownership and stakeholder confidence that risks are identified and managed effectively. All risks at Inland Revenue are visible and transparent through the use of an Enterprise Risk Management tool with robust dashboard functionality. Inland Revenue’s Enterprise Risk Management Framework is consistent with the International Risk Management Standard (ISO 31000:2018) and is aligned to The Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of Treadway Commission (COSO) Enterprise Risk Management Framework 2017. In October 2021, Inland Revenue also updated its Risk Management Policy. This policy provides clarity on the objectives of risk management at Inland Revenue, and ensures roles and responsibilities are in place to collectively manage risks. The Strategic Governance Board oversees risk management and the Risk and Assurance Committee provides independent oversight. Progress tracking of benefit realisation Responsibility for reporting progress has been handed over from the programme to its enduring home in Inland Revenue’s new organisation structure. The Performance and Reporting team, part of Strategic Portfolio Stewardship in ED&I, is now accountable for ongoing track and reporting of Inland Revenue’s benefit commitments. To ensure visibility for stakeholders, progress against benefits and outcomes, including the table of lead and lag indicators, will be published in Inland Revenue’s Annual Reports for 2022, 2023 and 2024. Appendix A – High level transformation timeline Page 29 19 November 2015 Cabinet approved the detailed business case enabling implementation to begin. 2 June 2016 The Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill was enacted. This Bill contained legislative changes to support transformation by removing out-dated legislative requirements and simplifying some administrative processes. 7 February 2017 Stage 1 go-live (GST moved to new systems (START) and processes). Prior to this a number of key activities such as the establishment of new data centres were completed. 21 February 2017 The Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill was enacted. This Bill contained the legislative changes needed to support Stage 1 and measures to simplify tax processes. February 2018 The first three groups in Inland Revenue’s new organisation design were established: Customer & Compliance Services – Individuals, Customer & Compliance Services – Business, and Information & Intelligence Services; 3000+ staff move to new roles. 29 March 2018 The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Bill was enacted. This Bill contained measures to improve the accuracy of tax collected through the year, changing the reporting requirements for employment and investment income information. 17 April 2018 Release 2 go-live (withholding taxes, FBT, and gaming machine duty moved to new systems (START and processes; the accounting income method (AIM) for provisional tax and the automatic exchange of information with international tax treaty partners (AEOI) were implemented; payday filing was introduced on a voluntary basis). 7 September 2018 A pilot version of Inland Revenue’s re-designed website was released for customer feedback, focused on child support. 11 February 2019 The first phase of the new enterprise support services platform (Ātea) went live, moving budgeting and forecasting functions to new systems and processes. Early 2019 The new data and intelligence platform (DIP) was implemented. The DIP enables the vast and varied data Inland Revenue collects to be quickly collated and made of sense of. 1 April 2019 The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) was enacted. This Bill simplified how tax is assessed for individuals by issuing tax refunds automatically and made it easier for individuals to apply for tailored tax code. 26 April 2019 Release 3 go-live (income tax and Working for Families moved to new systems (START) and processes; a new year end process for individuals was introduced; payday filing became mandatory; new requirements for investment income reporting were introduced on a voluntary basis). 26 April 2019 Following the pilot, Inland Revenue’s redesigned website went live with new income tax, Working for Families and child support content. Content for other products was updated and moved over to the new website in line with releases. September 2019 The Policy & Regulatory Stewardship group was established as part of the new organisation design (previously the Policy and Strategy group). 1 October 2019 Second release of Ātea - finance, procurement and some human resources functions move onto the new platform. February 2020 The Tax Counsel Office (TCO) was established as part of the new organisation design (previously the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel). 31 March 2020 The Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans and Remedial Matters) Bill was enacted. This Bill contained legislative changes to simplify and modernise the administration of KiwiSaver and student loans repayments. 17 April 2020 Release 4 go-live (KiwiSaver, student loans and PAYE processing moved to new systems (START) and processes; investment income reporting changes became mandatory). \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Appendix A – High level transformation timeline Page 30 May 2020 First release of the new and improved tax technical website went live, with rulings, determinations, interpretation statements and other tax technical documents accessible on the new site. 7 September 2020 Third release of Ātea - sustainability and affordability functions go live. 1 March 2021 Stage 4, Release 1 go-live (paid parental leave, unclaimed money, duties and NZ foreign trusts moved to new systems (START) and processes). 1 March 2021 The final groups were established as part of our new organisation design– Enterprise Services and Enterprise Design & Integrity. 24 March 2021 The Child Support Amendment Bill was enacted. This Bill contained a range of measures to support the October release. 30 March 2021 The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020-21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill was enacted. This Bill contained measures to improve the administration of unclaimed money. 28 October 2021 Stage 4, Release 2 go-live (child support moves to new systems and processes (START), the online services customers use and the software Inland Revenue’s people use is upgraded). 30 November 2021 FIRST, Inland Revenue’s heritage core processing system, is switched off. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Appendix B – Additional scope delivered during transformation Page 31 Following decisions made by Cabinet, there have been additions to the scope of transformation since the Detailed Business Case was prepared in November 2015. The accounting income method (AIM) option for provisional tax. AIM was implemented as part of Release 2 in April 2018, enabling small businesses to better match their provisional tax payments to when they earn their income. AIM means businesses can pay smaller amounts of provisional tax more often and get refunds of overpaid provisional tax during the year. Until AIM, businesses paid provisional tax at set times of the year, regardless of when they earned their income. Implementation costs for AIM were included within the overall funding approved for transformation. The automatic exchange of information (AEOI) with international tax treaty partners. New Zealand is one of many jurisdictions that has committed to a global initiative led by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on the automatic exchange of financial account information (AEOI) using the Common Reporting Standard (CRS). Tax authorities will exchange this information to ensure everyone pays the right amount of tax. AEOI was implemented as part of Release 2 in April 2018. Additional funding of $32.2 million was provided to Inland Revenue as part of Budget 2016 to implement AEOI. In September 2016, Inland Revenue sought approval to drawdown $21.5 million of this amount. The decision to implement AEOI in START provided technology solution certainty and enabled costs to be revised. Best Start. Best Start payments are $60 per week per child for babies born on or after 1 July 2018. Families can choose to receive the payment every week, every fortnight or once a year, in line with other Working for Families payments. To meet delivery timeframes, Best Start was first implemented in Inland Revenue’s heritage systems and processes (for which additional funding was provided) then migrated to new systems and processes as part of Release 3 in April 2019. The costs for migrating Best Start to new systems and processes as part of Release 3 formed part of the overall funding approved for transformation. Research and Development Tax Incentive. The Research and Development Tax Incentive (RDTI) operates as a tax credit and features a 15% tax credit on up to $120 million of eligible expenditure. It has been available to eligible businesses since the 2019/20 income year. Inland Revenue is the administering agency of the RDTI, supported by Callaghan Innovation. The RDTI was delivered as part of Release 4. Additional funding of $4.3 million over 4 years was provided as part of Budget 2018 for one-off implementation costs for the R&D tax incentive. Hours paid. Collection of hours paid information was included as part Release 4 in April 2020 and did not require additional funding. This information is collected from employers who file through software and who already record their payroll on this basis. This will help to improve the administration of Working for Families and Child Support. These payments are partly determined by the hours people are paid for. COVID-19 response initiatives. Inland Revenue’s swift response to COVID-19 amply demonstrates the benefits of the investment made in transformation and the agility decision-makers now have. The initiatives were delivered while Inland Revenue was organising its people to work remotely, preparing for the implementation of Release 4 in April 2020 and the peak tax season, including the 2020 automatic income tax assessments. In early 2020, Inland Revenue was the lead agency on two COVID-19 response bills and prepared a Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) for another. These introduced a number of changes including: • Allowing Inland Revenue to share information with other government agencies to assist them in their response to COVID-19. For example, Inland Revenue \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Appendix B – Additional scope delivered during transformation Page 32 supported MSD to administer the wage subsidy scheme as it relies on data held by Inland Revenue to verify applications. Inland Revenue shared information about self-employed individuals, employers and employees with MSD which enabled many applications to be automatically approved. Initially, supporting Wage Subsidy applications was very labour-intensive. However in June 2020, Inland Revenue developed a portal to allow MSD to self- serve some queries. • Authorising the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, on behalf of the Crown, to lend money under the small business cashflow (loan) scheme. Following a resurgence of COVID-19 in early 2021, The Taxation (COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payments and Other Matters) Bill was enacted on 18 February 2021. The Resurgence Support Payment was announced by the Government on 15 December 2020 and made available for the first time on 23 February 2021. Revised eligibility criteria to make the small business cashflow loan scheme available to more businesses by also took effect from early February 2021. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Appendix C – Programme roadmap Page 33 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Appendix D – Release effort Page 34 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Stage 1 Stages 2 and 3 Stage 4 Feb 2017 Release 2 April 2018 Release 3 April 2019 Release 4 April 2020 Release 1 March 2021 Release 2 October 2021 Products migrated to START • GST • Co-existence • Withholding taxes • Fringe benefit tax • Payroll subsidy • Gaming machine duty • Income tax • Working for Families • KiwiSaver • Student Loans • Back-end processing of PAYE • Paid parental leave • Unclaimed money • NZ foreign trusts • Duties • Child support • Upgrade to online services • Version 12 major upgrade Customer readiness Seminars for customers 0 250 350 Face to face seminars replaced with webinars due to COVID-19 Webinars for customers 3 15 15 16 8 14 Customers contacted 630,000 368,000 2,000,000 1,091,000 14,300 1,000,000 Programme readiness Accounts migrated 880,000 1 million 19.7 million 7 million 7,000 570,000 Returns migrated 8.1 million 13 million 15 million 38 million 12,000 2.8 million assessments Transactions migrated 23.6 million 2 million 142 million 172 million 1.4 million 129 million Contributions migrated n/a n/a n/a 767 million n/a n/a Web logons updated n/a n/a 8.3 million n/a n/a n/a Time to load data into START 17 hours 11 hours 33 hours 54 hours 4 hours 35 hours Time to remove data from FIRST 12 hours 10 hours 30 hours 21 hours n/a 23.5 hours Number of cut-over tasks More than 350 More than 540 More than 1,150 More than 1,250 891 More than 1,150 Hours to cut-over 113 hours 93 hours 185 hours 168 hours 48 hours 140 hours Total tests completed 15 15,462 46,304 94,204 76,293 1,554 35,801 Business readiness Staff trained 2,700 2,700 3,600 3,800 520 3,600 15 There was a change in approach for testing from Stage 4, Release 1 in March 2021 as subsequent releases used as much of the already delivered design patterns as possible. Most of the testing effort was put into areas where the products had unique requirements. In practice, this meant less testing on functions common to all products, which allowed the focus to be on the areas of real complexity or risk.

The proposed changes: • Extend the bright-line test that applies to residential property. • Loosen the loss continuity rules by introducing a business continuity test. • Turn off the deemed income rule in certain circumstances for donations of trading stock made between 17 March 2020 and 16 March 2022 (both dates inclusive), as a COVID-19 response measure. • Further improve the administration of the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 to allow Inland Revenue to focus on reuniting owners with their unclaimed funds where there is the greatest likelihood of tracking down the owners. • Make a number of technical amendments relating to the 39% top personal tax rate introduced in the Taxation (Income Tax Rate and Other Amendments) Act 2020. The proposed changes would amend the Income Tax Act 2007, the Tax Administration Act 1994, the Taxation (Income Tax Rate and Other Amendments) Act 2020, and the Unclaimed Money Act 1971. This commentary provides information on the extension to the bright-line test and the business continuity test proposal. Detailed explanations of the other items included in the Supplementary Order Paper will be made available following enactment of the Bill. Extension of the bright-line test on residential property The Supplementary Order Paper proposes to extend the bright-line test, which taxes gains from residential property acquired and sold within a specified timeframe, from 5 years to 10 years. Access to affordable housing is one of New Zealand’s most persistent long-term challenges. The Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development’s (the OECD’s) Better Life Index 2020 suggests New Zealanders spend the largest proportion of their disposable income on housing costs in the OECD. From 1991 to 2019 (before COVID-19), our house prices had the highest real growth in the OECD at 266 percent. In 2020, the national median house price rose by a further 19 percent, despite COVID-19. Housing unaffordability is caused by a number of supply and demand-side factors. The proposals in this Supplementary Order Paper are a part of the Government’s response to reduce investor demand for property. Decreasing the tax advantage that property investors can receive will reduce the amount investors are prepared to pay for a given house and the number of houses they will buy. The measure is intended to support first home buyers and help lift New Zealand’s home ownership rates. 8 Summary of key features • Extension to bright-line: the Supplementary Order Paper proposes to extend the bright-line test from 5 years to 10 years. • Amendments to main home exclusion: the exclusion from the bright-line test for the “main home” would no longer apply on an all or nothing basis, but rather apply only for the period the property is actually used as the owner’s main home. A 12-month change of use “buffer” is proposed, within which a change of use to or from the property being the taxpayer’s main home does not need to be accounted for. • Amendments to the treatment of short-stay accommodation: an amendment to the definition of “residential land” is proposed to ensure property used to provide short- stay accommodation, where the property is not the owner’s main home, cannot be excluded from the bright-line test on the basis it is business premises. This amendment also ensures such properties are subject to the residential rental deduction ring-fencing rules. • Application date: the 10-year bright-line test and the associated rules referred to above would apply to residential property acquired on or after 27 March 2021 except if the property was acquired as a result of an offer made by the purchaser on or before 23 March 2021, provided the offer was not able to be revoked before 27 March 2021. The amendment in respect of the residential rental deduction ring-fencing rules applies from the 2021–22 income year onwards, regardless of when the property was acquired. Business continuity test New Zealand’s current loss continuity rules require at least 49% continuity of ownership of a company for losses to be carried forward to offset future taxable income. This test is an anti-avoidance measure intended to prevent loss trading. However, it can create an impediment for businesses obtaining capital in order to innovate and grow because doing so can breach the 49% threshold. While this is particularly an issue for start-ups, some businesses recovering from the economic impacts of COVID-19 will look to recapitalise and innovate in order to survive. The Supplementary Order Paper proposes to introduce a business continuity test for loss carry forward into the Income Tax Act 2007. This test would permit a company to carry forward losses as long as there is no “major change” in the company’s business activities for five years after a change in ownership. The core test is supported by specific anti-avoidance measures to ensure that the loss continuity rules are not manipulated in order to loss trade. 9 Extending the bright-line test 11 EXTENDING THE BRIGHT-LINE TEST (Clauses 5A, 13F, 25C, 33F, 37E, 37EB, 37F, 37FB, 38BA, 38BAB, 57B, 58(3B), 58(3C), 73B, 73C and 73D) Summary of proposed amendment The Supplementary Order Paper extends the bright-line test from 5 years to 10 years. Application date The extended bright-line test would apply to residential land acquired on or after 27 March 2021. However, it would not apply to property acquired on or after 27 March as a result of an offer made by the purchaser on or before 23 March 2021 (the date the measures were announced), provided that that offer was not able to be revoked before 27 March 2021 – in this case, the existing bright-line period of five years would continue to apply. Key features Extended bright-line test (new section CB 6A) The Supplementary Order Paper proposes to extend the bright-line test, which taxes gains from residential property acquired and sold within a specified timeframe, from 5 years to 10 years. Income arising under the bright-line test is taxed at a person’s marginal income tax rate. The other policy settings for the bright-line test remain the same, except for the changes to the main home exclusion in section CB 16A and the business premises exclusion in the definition of “residential land”, as outlined further in this commentary. Therefore, the following features of the 5-year bright-line test will continue: • The rules that determine when the property is acquired and disposed of, and when the bright-line period is counted from. • The definition of “residential land” covered by the bright-line test includes land that has a dwelling on it, land where the owner has an arrangement to build a dwelling on it, and bare land that may be used for erecting a dwelling under the relevant operative district plan. “Residential land” does not include farmland or land used predominantly as business premises (subject to changes to ensure property used to provide short-stay accommodation is treated as residential land and not excluded as business premises – see below). • The current exclusions and other forms of relief will continue to apply – that is: – the main home will continue to be excluded (subject to changes to ensure the exclusion only applies for the periods the property was used as a main home – see below) – transfers upon death, and any subsequent disposal by the beneficiary will continue to be exempt, and 12 – those who receive land under a relationship property agreement will continue to take on the bright-line start date (the date from which the bright-line period is counted) of the transferor. • The main home exclusion is available to properties held in trust. However, people cannot use the main home exclusion for multiple properties held through trusts. • The main home exclusion cannot be used if it has already been used twice in the two year period preceding the date of sale, and also cannot be used by a person, or group of persons, who has a regular pattern of buying and selling their main home. • Residential land withholding tax will apply to taxable bright-line sales by anyone who is an “offshore RLWT person” (defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007) – in short, a vendor who is living or established outside New Zealand. • Specific anti-avoidance rules remain, to counter companies and trusts being used to circumvent the bright-line test. • Vendors will continue to be allowed deductions for property subject to the bright-line test according to ordinary tax rules (subject to amended deductions as a result of changes to the main home exclusion – see below). • Losses arising from a sale under the bright-line test will remain ring-fenced so they may only be used to offset taxable gains from other land sales. Application date (clause 5A(2)) The extended bright-line test would apply to property acquired on or after 27 March 2021. However, it would not apply to property acquired on or after 27 March as a result of an offer made by the purchaser on or before 23 March 2021, provided the offer could not be revoked before 27 March 2021. An irrevocable offer is one that cannot be withdrawn before a certain time. For example, it is common as part of the tender process to sign a tender document that states the person cannot withdraw their offer until 5 working days after the tender has closed. Table 1 outlines some scenarios and whether the 5-year or 10-year bright-line would apply. Table 1: Extended bright-line test application date examples Example What bright-line test applies? The following scenarios deal with revocable offers Purchaser offers on 21 March 2021, seller accepts on 24 March. Sale and purchase agreement (ASAP) signed 24 March. 5- year test applies. As above, but the seller accepts the offer and signs the ASAP on 27 March. Extended 10-year test applies. Purchaser offers on 18 March 2021, seller verbally accepts on 24 March, but does not sign ASAP until 27 March. Extended 10-year test applies (for property transactions a verbal contract is not binding, and the purchaser does not have an equitable interest in the property at that point). 13 Example What bright-line test applies? Purchaser offers on 19 March 2021, seller counter-offers on 24 March, purchaser accepts on 25 March. 5- year test applies. As above, but the purchaser accepts the counter-offer on 27 March. Extended 10-year test applies. The following scenarios deal with irrevocable offers Purchaser submits offer as part of tender process that closes on 22 March 2021. The tender document states that the offer cannot be withdrawn until 28 March. Seller accepts offer on 27 March and ASAP is signed. 5- year test applies. Although the purchaser acquires the land on 27 March and therefore is prima facie subject to the extended test, the carve-out for offers made on or before 23 March applies. Purchaser submits an offer as part of a tender process that closes on 16 March 2021. The offer cannot be withdrawn until 22 March. Purchaser does not withdraw the offer, seller accepts on 27 March and ASAP is signed. Extended test applies. The carve-out does not apply because the purchaser was able to revoke their offer before 27 March. The following scenarios deal with conditional offers 1 Purchaser submits an offer subject to a building report on 18 March 2021. The vendor accepts the offer and the ASAP is signed on 24 March. On 2 April, the purchaser informs the vendor that the condition is satisfied and the agreement goes unconditional. 5- year test applies. The purchaser acquired the land when the binding agreement (subject to conditions) was entered into on 24 March, not on 2 April when the conditions were satisfied. As above, except the purchaser and seller agree on a reduced price on 2 April, each signing the change in the agreement. 5- year test applies. The binding agreement was entered into on 24 March, which is before 27 March. The 5-year bright-line test (section CZ 39) The 5-year bright-line test continues to apply in limited circumstances: • to residential land acquired on or after 29 March 2018 but before 27 March 2021 • to residential land acquired on or after 27 March 2021 as a result of an offer made by the purchaser on or before 23 March 2021, if the offer could not be revoked before 27 March 2021. The income charging provision for the 5-year bright-line test has been shifted from section CB 6A to section CZ 39. 1 The date of acquisition (when the person first acquired an estate or interest in the land) is relevant for determining which bright-line test will apply (the 5-year or the 10-year test). The acquisition date is generally when there is a binding agreement between the purchaser and the seller. This includes when the vendor accepts an offer with standard conditions to be satisfied (such as obtaining finance or a building report), not a later date when those conditions are satisfied or settlement occurs. Note that, in most cases, a different date is relevant for calculating the person’s period of ownership for the bright-line rules – the bright-line period is generally counted from the date the land is transferred under the Land Transfer Act 2017. 14 The current main home exclusion that applies for the purposes of the 5-year test has been shifted from section CB 16A to section CZ 40. Residential land withholding tax (section RL 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) and sections 54C–54E of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA)) Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) applies to sales of residential land made by an “offshore RLWT person” if the sale occurs within five years. This is provided for in section RL 1 of the ITA and section 54C of the TAA. With the extension of the bright-line test from five years to ten years, sections RL 1 and 54C will be updated so that RLWT will apply to sales of residential land made within ten years of acquisition (where the acquisition occurs on or after 27 March 2021 and the irrevocable offer carve-out does not apply). Section RL 1(2)(a) is being updated to include references to new sections CZ 39 and CZ 40, so that a five-year test will still be relevant for properties acquired before the application date of the 10-year test. Section 54E of the TAA provides that the Commissioner is able to issue an RLWT exemption certificate in limited circumstances – including where a seller is in the business of developing land, dividing land into lots, or erecting buildings; and where the property was the seller’s main home. RLWT exemption certificates will continue to be available where a property is used as a main home: • For properties acquired before 27 March 2021 (or subject to the irrevocable offer carve-out), this will be where it was the owner’s main home for more than 50 percent of the bright-line period (in current CB 16A which will become new section CZ 40). • For properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021 (excluding where the irrevocable offer carve-out applies), this will only be where it is used as the owner’s main home for the whole bright-line period, including days within the 12-month buffer that are counted as main home days (provided for in proposed new section CB 16A). The Supplementary Order Paper proposes to amend section 54E of the TAA to refer to both section CB 16A and proposed new section CZ 40 of the ITA (that is, both versions of the main home exclusion). Where RLWT has been withheld, section 54D of the TAA and section RL 6 of the ITA permit a taxpayer to file a form for their land transactions to obtain a refund if too much RLWT has been paid relative to their overall income tax liability for their land transactions. The Supplementary Order Paper proposes to update section 54D to refer to both CB 16A and proposed new CZ 40. Questions on the appropriateness of the RLWT settings more generally were not considered as part of this exercise. These may be considered as part of future work in the area. 15 AMENDMENTS TO THE MAIN HOME EXCLUSION (Clauses 5A, 5, 13F, 14B, 58(10ABA), 58(12BAB), 58(3B), 58(3C) and 58(3D)) Summary of proposed amendment The Supplementary Order Paper amends the “main home exclusion” from the bright-line test so that it no longer applies on an all or nothing basis, but rather applies only for the period the property is actually used as the owner’s main home. A 12-month buffer is proposed to allow the property to not be used as a main home without tax implications. Application date The amended main home exclusion applies to property subject to the 10-year bright-line test. That is, property acquired on or after 27 March 2021. However, it does not apply to property acquired on or after 27 March 2021 as a result of an offer made by the purchaser on or before 23 March 2021, provided the offer could not be revoked before 27 March 2021. The existing main home exclusion will continue to apply for such properties, as well as properties acquired before 27 March 2021. Key features • The main home exclusion is being amended so that it no longer applies on an all or nothing basis. Instead, it will only apply for the period(s) the property is actually used as the taxpayer’s main home. To be within the exclusion, there is still a requirement that the property has been used predominantly (on a floor area basis) as the taxpayer’s main home. • The proposed legislation provides that a property is excluded from the bright-line test if it is the owner’s main home for the full bright-line period. Days when the property is not used as the main home will be treated as main home days if: – the non-main home days are in a period of non-main home days of 365 days or less (the counted period), and – the counted period is immediately before or after a period where the property is the person’s main home. The effect of this is that there is a 12-month buffer, within which a change of use of a property to or from being the taxpayer’s main home would not need to be accounted for. In other words, the main home exclusion would still apply if the property was not used as a main home for periods of less than 12 months at a time. If the period that the property was not used as a main home exceeds 12-months, the main home exclusion will not apply. • If the full main home exclusion in proposed new section CB 16A does not apply, the amount the person derives from selling the property is income under section CB 6A. However, if the property has been used as the main home for some of the time it was owned, the proposed legislation provides that the taxpayer is required to pay tax only for periods where the property was not used as their main home, or not counted as their main home. Periods of 12-months or less where the property is not used as a main 16 home will be counted as main home days for the purposes of the calculation. The proposed legislation provides for this as follows: – New section CB 6A(6) provides that if the person has excluded days (that is, main home days) in the bright-line period, the amount of income the person derives from disposing of the land is reduced by reference to the formula in section CB 6A(7). – New section CB 6A(7) provides that the person’s income is reduced by the amount calculated by subtracting the value attributable to the period the property was used as a main home or counted as a main home (that is, the proportion of days the property was used/counted as a main home multiplied by sales price) from the sale price. This ensures that the taxpayer only has income attributable to the days the property was not their main home (provided the days are a period of more than 12 months). – New section DB 23C reduces the deduction the taxpayer can claim for the cost of the property (which includes the acquisition cost and any capital improvements), so that the deduction is only allowed for the period the property was not used as the main home (as this is the period in respect of which the gain is taxed). Background A person’s main home is not taxed under the bright-line test. Under current law the property is either fully in or fully out of the main home exclusion. For example, a person can currently qualify for the main home exclusion where the property is rented out for some of the time it is owned, provided it is used as the owner’s main home for more than 50 percent of the bright-line period. This all-or-nothing approach is simple and easy to apply, and made sense in the context of a shorter bright-line period. However, it would not be appropriate with a longer bright-line test as much more income could be involved. For example, without any changes to the way the main home exclusion works, a person would not have to pay tax under the bright-line test for a property that was rented out for four years if it was used as the taxpayer’s main home for five years. Detailed analysis Main home exclusion (new section CB 16A) The Supplementary Order Paper proposes to amend the main home exclusion so that it no longer applies on an all-or-nothing basis in relation to residential land acquired on or after 27 March 2021 (subject to the carve-out for irrevocable offers). The existing main home exclusion would continue to apply to properties acquired before the application date (or after but subject to the irrevocable offer carve-out). This has been shifted to proposed new section CZ 40. Table 2 outlines the existing section and the proposed change. 17 Table 2: Existing sections and proposed changes Current law Proposed change CB 16A: Section CB 6A does not apply to a person who disposes of residential land if, for most of the period \[the bright-line period\], 2 the land has been used predominantly for a dwelling that was the main home for the person... Proposed new section CB 16A: Section CB 6A does not apply to a person who disposes of residential land if, for all of the days \[in the bright-line period\], the land has been used predominantly for a dwelling that was the main home for the person... Section YA 1 definition of main home: means, for a person, the 1 dwelling – (a) That is mainly used as a residence by the person.... Section YA 1 definition of main home: means, for a person, the 1 dwelling – (a) That is used as a residence by the person... Example 1: Main home exclusion William purchased a property in 2023. He lived in it for five years and rented it for four years before selling it in 2032. William would qualify for the main home exclusion if the current settings for the exclusion were not changed because for most of the bright-line period (that is, more than 50 percent) the house was used as William’s main home. As a result, section CB 6A would not apply and William would have no tax to pay (though other aspects of the land sale rules, including the intention test, may still apply). Under the proposed change, the main home exclusion would not apply as it was not William’s main home for the full bright-line period. Instead, William would be subject to section CB 6A, but his income would be reduced to reflect the period for which the property was used as his main home (see quantification section below). Example 2: Main home exclusion Erica purchased a property in 2022. She lived in it with a flatmate until she sold it in 2027. Under both the current law and the proposed change, the main home exclusion would apply. This is because for all of the bright-line period the property was used predominantly as Erica’s main home. The “predominantly” test looks at whether, on a floor area basis, the property was used at least 50 percent as the person’s main home. 12-month buffer (new section CB 16A(6)) Despite the requirement that the property must be used as the person’s main home for “all of the days” in the bright-line period, a 12-month buffer is proposed under which any period of up to 12 months that the property is not used as the person’s main home is counted as a main home period, provided the period is immediately before or after a period during which the property was used as their main home. Therefore, the property would still qualify as the person’s main home if it was vacant or rented out for a period of less than 12 months before or after main home use. This is intended to provide leeway for moving in or out of a property (for example, there may be vacant periods between settlement and moving in, or between moving out and sale). It would also cover periods of up to 12 months where the taxpayer is not using the property 2 The bright-line period typically starts on the day the property is transferred to the owner and ends on the day the property is sold (when the sale and purchase agreement is entered into – not when the sale is settled). 18 as their main home (for example, if they rented the property out while overseas and it was no longer their main home for that period). If a period of non-main home use exceeds 12 months, the entire period for which the property was not used as a main home would be subject to tax. If the main home exclusion does not apply to take the property completely outside the bright- line test (that is, because there was a non-main home period that exceeded 12 months), any non-main home period exceeding 12 months will need to be taken into account in working out a taxpayer’s income. See quantification section below. Example 3: 12-month buffer does not apply Catherine purchased her home in 2023. She lived in it until she went on her OE from 2025 to 2027. When she returned, she lived in her home again until she sold it in 2030. The 12-month buffer does not apply here as the single period that the property was not used as Catherine’s main home (2025 to 2027) exceeds 12 months. As a result, the main home exclusion does not apply and Catherine must calculate her income under section CB 6A(6) (see quantification section below.) Example 4: 12-month buffer applies Gerald purchased his home in January 2022. He did not move in until six months later as he was overseas. He sold the property in 2026. The 12-month buffer applies as the period Gerald was overseas and not using the property as his main home was less than 12 months, and it was immediately followed by a period where Gerald used the property as his main home. Therefore, the main home exclusion applies despite Gerald not actually using the property as his main home for a 6-month period. Quantification (new section CB 6A(6)) Proposed new section CB 6A(6) would apply if a person has used their property as their main home for some but not all of the time it is held. Under section CB 6A(6), the person’s income from the disposal of the property is reduced by the excluded adjustment amount that is the amount calculated under subsection (7): 퐼퐼퐼퐼퐼퐼퐼퐼퐼퐼퐼퐼 푓푓푓푓 퐼퐼퐼퐼 푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑 퐼퐼푑푑푑푑푑푑 −퐼퐼푒푒퐼퐼푑푑 푒푒푑푑퐼퐼푑푑 푑푑푑푑푎푎푒푒푑푑 푎푎퐼퐼퐼퐼퐼퐼 푎푎 푑푑퐼퐼퐼퐼푒푒퐼퐼푎푎 This formula only needs to be used if the property is used as the person’s main home for some of the time it was owned. If the property is never used as the person’s main home, the person’s income is simply the amount they derive from disposing of the property. These persons are not required to apply the formula as it does not impact them. Quantification formula (CB 6A(7) to (11)) The formula for the excluded adjustment amount in proposed section CB 6A(7) is: 퐴퐴푑푑푎푎푒푒푑푑푎푎퐼퐼퐼퐼퐼퐼푎푎 푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑 푇푇퐼퐼푎푎푑푑푑푑 푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑 ×푈푈퐼퐼푑푑푑푑푎푎푒푒푑푑푎푎퐼퐼푑푑 푑푑퐼퐼퐼퐼푒푒퐼퐼푎푎 Adjustment days is the total number of days during the bright-line period where the property was used as a main home. It also includes days that are counted as main home days because the 12-month buffer applies. 19 Total days is the total number of days in the bright-line period. Unadjusted amount is the amount of income the person derived from disposing of the property. The effect of this formula is to evenly apportion the sale proceeds from the property over the period it is held. The amount attributable to the period the property was not used as the taxpayer’s main home then becomes income for tax purposes. There is no option to pay tax based on the actual valuations of the property at the start and end of the period the property was not the taxpayer’s main home. The following examples illustrate how the formula works: Example 5: Apportionment following change of use Everly bought a property for $1 million. It was transferred to her on 13 March 2030. She sold the property on 31 December 2037 for $1.8 million. She lived in the property and it was her main home from 13 March 2030 until 28 June 2035. Everly then rented it out until 31 December 2037. Her income is calculated as follows: Excluded adjustment amount in subsection (7): 1934 2851 ×$1.8 million = $1,221,045.25 Under subsection (6): $1.8 million − $1,221,045.25= $578,954.75 Therefore $578,954.75 is Everly’s gross income from the sale. A portion of the acquisition cost needs to be deducted to determine the net amount of income from the sale that is subject to tax (see below). Example 6: Apportionment and the 12-month buffer Shanti bought a property for $700,000. It was transferred to her on 20 May 2025. She lived in it from then until 2027, when she went overseas for nine months. While Shanti was overseas, the property was not her main home. When she returned, she lived in the property until 22 March 2029. Tenants moved in a few weeks later and Shanti rented the property out until 9 November 2033 when she sold it for $1 million. The days in the 9-month period when Shanti went overseas are counted as “main home” days, even though the full main home exclusion does not apply to her because she exceeded the 12-month buffer period when she no longer used the property as her main home (from the day after she moved out (23 March 2029) until when she sold the property on 9 November 2033). The total number of days between 20 May 2025 and 9 November 2033 (inclusive) is 3,096. Her main home days total 1,403 (between 20 May 2025 and 22 March 2029, inclusive). For the purposes of the formula, total days is 3,096 and adjustment days is 1,403. The unadjusted amount (the amount derived on the sale) is $1 million. Shanti’s bright-line income is calculated as follows: Excluded adjustment amount: 1403 3096 ×$1 million=$453,165.37 Gross income from the sale per proposed CB 6A(6): $1 million−$453,165.37=$546,834.63 Shanti’s gross income from the sale is $546,834.63. A portion of Shanti’s acquisition cost needs to be deducted to determine the net amount of income subject to tax (see below). 20 Cost of some residential land reduced (DB 23C) A person can claim a deduction for the cost of property subject to the bright-line test under section DB 23. Where proposed new section CB 6A(6) applies, proposed new section DB 23C reduces the deduction that can be claimed under section DB 23 as follows: 퐸퐸푒푒 퐼퐼푑푑푒푒푑푑퐼퐼푑푑 푑푑푑푑푎푎푒푒푑푑 푎푎퐼퐼퐼퐼퐼퐼 푎푎 푑푑퐼퐼퐼퐼푒푒퐼퐼푎푎= 퐴퐴푑푑푎푎푒푒푑푑푎푎퐼퐼퐼퐼퐼퐼푎푎 푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑 푎푎퐼퐼푎푎푑푑푑푑 푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑 ×퐼퐼퐼퐼푑푑푎푎 Adjustment days and total days have the same meaning as in CB 6A. Cost means the cost of the residential land. Example 5 continued: Cost of residential land reduced Continuing with Example 5 (Everly), Everly bought the residential land for $1 million, and it was transferred to her on 13 March 2030. Her total days is 2,851 and her adjustment days is 1,934. Using the formula in proposed section DB 23C(2), Everly’s excluded adjustment amount is: 1934 2851 ×$1 million = $678,358.47 Under proposed DB 23C(1), Everly’s deduction for the cost of revenue account property under section DB 23 will be: $1 million−$678,358.47=$321,641.53 Combined impact of proposed new CB 6A and DB 23C The Income Tax Act 2007 operates on a gross basis and the structure of income charging and deduction provisions in different subparts does not allow for the provision of one single mathematical formula. However, it is possible to mathematically simplify the formula as follows: (푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑 퐼퐼푑푑푑푑푑푑 푑푑푓푓푑푑퐼퐼퐼퐼 −퐼퐼퐼퐼푑푑푎푎 퐼퐼푓푓 푎푎ℎ퐼퐼 푑푑푓푓퐼퐼푑푑퐼퐼푓푓푎푎푑푑) × 푎푎퐼퐼푎푎푑푑푑푑 푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑 −푑푑푑푑푎푎푒푒푑푑 푎푎퐼퐼퐼퐼퐼퐼 푎푎 푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑 푎푎퐼퐼푎푎푑푑푑푑 푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑 Example 5 continued: Combined effect of CB 6A and DB 23C Continuing with Example 5 (Everly), Everly’s income under section CB 6A is $578,954.75 and her deduction for the cost of revenue account property under section DB 23 (and DB 23C) is $321,641.53. Her net income from the sale is therefore: $578,954.75 −$321,641.53=$257,313.22 Everly would therefore pay tax at her marginal rate on $257,313.22. Alternatively, using the mathematically simplified formula from above and the original information from Example 5: ($1,800,000−$1,000,000) × 2851−1934 2851 =$800,000 × 917 2851 =$257,313.22 21 TREATMENT OF SHORT-STAY ACCOMMODATION (Clauses 58(12BAC) and 58(16)) Summary of proposed amendment The Supplementary Order Paper proposes to amend the “business premises exclusion” in the definition of “residential land” to ensure that residential property used to provide short-stay accommodation, where the accommodation is provided in a dwelling that is not the owner’s main home, is subject to the bright-line test. The amendment will also ensure short-stay accommodation is subject to the residential rental deduction ring-fencing rules in subpart EL of the Act. Application date Bright-line test The amendment to the business premises exclusion from the bright-line test applies to property acquired on or after 27 March 2021. It does not apply to property acquired on or after 27 March 2021 as a result of an offer made by the purchaser on or before 23 March 2021, provided that offer could not be revoked before 27 March 2021. The existing business premises exclusion will continue to apply for such properties, as well as properties acquired before 27 March 2021. Residential rental deduction ring-fencing rules The amendment in respect of the residential rental deduction ring-fencing rules applies from the 2021–22 income year onwards, regardless of when the property was acquired. Background The bright-line test and residential rental deduction ring-fencing rules apply to “residential land” as defined in section YA 1. “Residential land” does not include land used predominately as business premises. It was not intended that a residential property used to provide short-stay accommodation via predominantly digital platforms as part of the sharing economy should be able to potentially qualify for the business premises exclusion and therefore be out of scope of the bright-line test and residential rental deduction ring-fencing rules. However, due to interpretive uncertainty this is not currently clear and a difference in tax treatment could distort a person’s decision to rent a property out on a long-term basis or list the property using a digital short-stay accommodation platform. 22 Key features Bright-line changes (paragraph (b) of the definition of “residential land”) The Supplementary Order Paper proposes to amend the definition of “residential land” to include land with a dwelling on it, if it is used predominantly for a business of supplying accommodation and the dwelling is not the main home of the owner. This is intended to ensure the bright-line test applies to short-stay accommodation properties (including a property that is rented out as part of the sharing economy on digital platforms, or a bach that is sometimes rented out when the owner does not use it) unless it is a bed and breakfast type facility where it is also the owner’s main home and they rent out rooms for short-stay accommodation. This ensures that the treatment is the same between a person who rents out a property on a long-term basis (that is, has tenants) and a person who rents out a property on a short-term basis – that is, both are subject to the bright-line test. There is a carve-out for bed and breakfast type properties (that is, where it is the owner’s main home) to ensure they are treated the same as a homeowner who rents spare rooms to flatmates – that is, neither are subject to the bright-line test. This is necessary because in a bed and breakfast situation the property may not be used predominantly as the owner’s main home. Residential rental deduction ring-fencing (paragraph (b) of the definition of “residential land”) The amendment to the definition of “residential land” discussed above also ensures that residential properties used to provide short-stay accommodation are subject to the residential rental deduction ring-fencing rules. Hotels, motels and other commercial accommodation Hotels, motels and other similar commercial accommodation are not “residential land” and are therefore not subject to the bright-line test or the residential rental deduction ring-fencing rules. This is because they are specifically excluded from the definition of “dwelling” in the Income Tax Act and the Supplementary Order Paper does not propose to change this treatment. 23 Business continuity test 24 BUSINESS CONTINUITY TEST (Clauses 16B, 25B, 28, 37E, 37F, 37H, 37I, 44DB to 44DU, 44FB, 44FC, 45B, 58(2B), 58(5CB), 58(CC), 58(10BA), 58(10BAB), 58(10BAC), 58(12BA) and 58(12C)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments would introduce a business continuity test to the Income Tax Act 2007 to loosen the loss continuity rules to help stimulate growth and innovation in the economy. The business continuity test would act as a secondary test permitting loss carry forward if there is a breach in ownership continuity of a company as long as there is no major change in the nature of the business activities of the company. The test would be accompanied by measures to support the policy objective: • A purpose provision setting out the objective of the test (promote growth and innovation while preventing loss trading). • Exclusion of dormant companies from the rules. • Anti-injection rules to prevent schemes that would permit the purchaser of a company to use up losses by diverting income into the company or by reducing expenditure of the company. • A rule to stop pre-emptive changes to the business being made before the change in ownership to defeat the purpose of the business continuity test. • Maintaining the current approach to loss grouping. Application date The proposed amendment would apply to breaches of ownership continuity occurring in the 2020–21 and later income years and to losses arising from the 2013–14 income year onwards. Key features Subpart IA of the Income Tax Act 2007 sets out the rules for when tax losses may be carried forward to a later income year to offset future income (the “loss continuity” rules) by requiring at least a 49 percent continuity of ownership from when a loss arises to when it is used. Proposed new subpart IB would provide an alternative loss continuity rule by introducing a business continuity test modelled on Australia’s “similar” business test. This would allow a company to carry losses forward after a breach of the 49 percent shareholder continuity rule as long as the business fundamentally continues without major change. Australia’s similar business test compares the similarity of the business immediately before the change in ownership to the business at the time losses are used. This comparison is made by evaluating the extent to which the assets, activities, operations, and identity of the business remain the same throughout this period. Some allowance is made for changes in these factors through natural development (changes which are normal and expected of a business seeking to maximise profits). 25 The business continuity test proposed as subpart IB starts with the presumption that a company can carry forward losses following a change in ownership unless there is a major change in the nature of its business activities, having regard to the assets used, within five years (or less if losses are used earlier) of the change in ownership. The proposal carves out changes which are just a consequence of natural development. As a whole, the test is intended to focus on the inputs a company employs and not its outputs to allow a business to pivot. The test specifically requires reference to assets as these are a key resource which a company uses to generate income and a significant change in the asset base could be a good indication that the fundamental business activities are not being continued post acquisition and there has been a major change. If a company is carrying forward losses comprising 50 percent or more bad debt deductions claimed under section DB 31(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 the five-year rule will not apply. Instead, the continuity period for these companies will run from the time immediately before the breaching change in ownership until the time the loss is used up. This feature is designed to prevent failed finance type companies from being acquired for loss trading purposes. To support the test and ensure it is not manipulated to enable loss trading the following measures are proposed: • A purpose provision setting out the objective of the test (that is, permit capital raising while preventing loss trading). • Exclusion of companies where the scale of activities in its business have reduced to nothing or almost nothing (dormant or “zombie” companies) from the rules. • Anti-injection rules to prevent schemes that would permit the purchaser of a company to use up losses by diverting income into the company or by reducing expenditure of the company. • A rule to stop pre-emptive changes to the business being made before the change in ownership to defeat the purpose of the business continuity test. • Maintaining the current approach to loss grouping. Companies acquired as part of a corporate group may continue to offset losses within that group, however, a company cannot be purchased and have its losses made available within a new group. Background Loss continuity rules in subpart IA 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007 determine whether a company can carry tax losses forward to offset income in a future year. New Zealand’s current loss continuity rules require 49 percent continuity of ownership. This was designed to guard against loss trading but can be an impediment to businesses obtaining capital to innovate and grow because, in doing so, they can breach the 49 percent threshold. While this is particularly an issue for start-ups, some businesses recovering from the economic impacts of COVID-19 may look to recapitalise and innovate in order to survive. 26 Example 7: Anonymised real-life example Starting Today Limited (STL) was founded in 2003 and operates in the electronics industry. In 2006, a venture fund invested $2 million for a 40% interest in the company. The investment was used by STL to fund further development to advance to the commercialisation stage. At the same time, 20% of STL’s shares were set aside for employees as part of an employee share plan in order for the company to retain those employees and align their interests and rewards with those of other shareholders. The founder retained a 40% shareholding. This 60% change of ownership resulted in the forfeiture of approximately $4 million of tax losses that had accrued since inception. In 2008, the company expanded into the US Market and received an initial capital investment of US$10 million, followed by further capital rounds over the following four years that resulted in a 60% change of shareholding and all tax losses, $6 million, from 2006 to 2009 being forfeited. In September 2019, the Government committed to publicly consulting on options to loosen the loss continuity rules to address the impediment with a view to increasing the productivity of the economy. On 15 April 2020, the Government announced that it would introduce a business continuity test modelled on Australia’s “similar business” test. While the Government had planned to loosen the tax loss continuity rules following a full consultation process a decision was made to accelerate work on the business continuity test as a COVID-19 response. It was announced that the test would be introduced after consultation with private sector representatives and apply retrospectively to the 2020–21 income year onwards so that taxpayers could capital raise in reliance on being able to carry some or all of their losses forward even if the change in ownership exceeds the 49 percent loss continuity threshold. A business continuity test works by assuming that if a business is carried on after a change in ownership the motivation for acquiring a company is a genuine commercial one. If the business is not so carried on, the motivation for acquiring the company could be loss trading (that is, acquiring a company with historic losses in order to reduce tax payable in relation to another business). The test works to prevent losses from being carried forward if loss trading could be the reason a company is acquired. The proposed changes remove an impediment to sensible business reorganisations, including recapitalisations while preventing loss trading. The details of the business continuity test have been developed with Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, the Corporate Taxpayers Group, and members of the New Zealand Law Society Tax Law Committee. Detailed analysis Purpose The proposed amendments would introduce the business continuity test as new subpart IB (Carrying forward companies’ loss balances: continuity of business activities) of the Income Tax Act 2007. The business continuity test is intended to loosen the current loss continuity rules so that a taxpayer can carry forward tax losses even where there has been a breach in ownership continuity. Proposed section IB 1 sets out the purpose of the business continuity test. This is to permit loss carry forward after a change in ownership in order to remove impediments to: 27 • innovation and economic growth • corporate reorganisations • changes in the direct or indirect ownership of companies • companies accessing new sources of share capital • corporate reorganisations (including changes in shareholding with no immediate sourcing of new capital), and • companies adapting their businesses in order to grow or be resilient. Importantly, the proposed section also makes clear that loosening the loss continuity rules by introducing this test is not to encourage loss trading. Loss trading is where there is little or no economic basis for the transaction in which a company is acquired. Its principal purpose is the purchase of losses that would otherwise not be used. This is done to offset income that the acquirer would otherwise have needed to pay tax on. Preventing loss trading is the reason loss continuity rules are part of the tax system. Overall, the purpose statement is designed to provide context to support the interpretation and application of the business continuity test, it is not itself a test for loss carry forward. It is expected that the proposed purpose statement would have value in cases at the margin where it is unclear how the proposed business continuity test will apply. Core test Proposed section IB 3 introduces the core business continuity test. This test can be relied on to carry losses forward if a company breaches the 49 percent ownership continuity threshold, as long as there is no major change in the company’s business activities that would suggest it is not being continued post-acquisition. The test would apply to all companies with the exception of mineral mining companies. There is tailored business continuity test already available to these companies in section IS 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Clause 44DU makes this treatment clear. Similar business: no major change A company will meet the business continuity test as long as there is no major change in the nature of the business activities carried on by the company (proposed subsection (2)(c)). In determining whether a particular change is a major change in the nature of the business activities the taxpayer would need to evaluate the extent to which the same business activities are undertaken to generate assessable income. Proposed subsection (4) specifically directs the taxpayer, to consider the extent to which the same or similar assets are used to generate assessable income. The phrase “business activities” is intended to consider the particular actions carried out by the business to generate income and the processes or methods by which they are carried out. For example, a bakery may predominantly bake its own products for sale, but may also buy in some specialty items that it resells. Likewise, the bakery may sell its products through its own retail outlet but may also sell direct to local supermarkets and cafes. The use of the phrase “business activities” is intended to deal with the situation where a company discontinues one business and starts another. It is normal for a company to establish new businesses as part of its growth. Absent a change in ownership a company is permitted 28 to do this while maintaining their losses and using them to offset income of both the old and the new businesses. The business continuity test also permits this as long as the starting of a new business is something that could reasonably be expected to have happened without a shareholding change. The test is not intended to be applied granularly on a business-by- business basis. Overall, elements to evaluate include: • the business processes • the scale of business activities • use of suppliers or other inputs • the markets supplied to • the type of products or services supplied, and • the assets used. “Assets” is intended to take an ordinary meaning and includes tangible and intangible (for example, goodwill) assets. It is accepted that some categories of asset require replacement. The phrase “same or similar assets” is used to clarify that the normal replacement of specific assets with similar assets would not be part of the assessment of whether there has been a major change. Example 8 If I Can Dream CGI Limited (I Can Dream) is a start-up company that produces CGI effects for television and movies. It has been operating for a number of years now and has had a number of successful projects. However, it really needs a cash injection from a new investor to take the business to the next level. It is in desperate need to update its ageing computer equipment to state of the art technology. The computer equipment represents around 95% of the assets of the company. Largely due to the initial cost of setting up a CGI effects company, I Can Dream has been in a loss position for a number of years and Kelvin, the owner, looks for a new investor. Ben has an interest in the film industry and decides to invest in the company, however, he wants to take a controlling interest due to some question as to Kelvin’s ability to run the company efficiently. After much discussion Kelvin agrees to an investment which will give Ben a 55% ownership stake in the company. Shortly after the share subscription, I Can Dream uses the additional funds to completely replace its assets with new cutting-edge computer equipment. The equipment essentially produces the same product, but the quality has increased significantly. Kelvin is concerned that the replacement of the assets will be a major change for the purposes of the business continuity test. For the purposes of assessing whether there has been a major change, section IB 3(4) requires a taxpayer to assess the extent to which the assets used in deriving the company’s assessable income have changed during the continuity period. In the case of I Can Dream the company has replaced all of its assets, however, those assets are essentially the same as the old assets albeit newer and shinier. The assets do the same functions as the old ones but in a more efficient way, producing a better product and they look better in the office. The policy intent is that such a replacement of assets with new versions of essentially the same assets should not be considered as a factor when evaluating if there has been a major change. Not every change will be a major change. Any change in business activities (including use of assets) must be considered against the unchanged business activities (including use of assets) employed by the company to generate income to establish whether the change is “major”. Generally, this is a question of scale (in other words, how significant is the change 29 in the context of the operations of the entire company). The test is not intended to give special weight to any particular factor. Example 9 Flip Flop and Fly Eggs (FFF Eggs) has been producing eggs to supply to supermarkets for 20 years. The eggs have always come from battery farmed chickens. Over the last 20 years this operation has become large scale with two large sheds, containing 45,000 chickens each, occupying the land. Consumers have started to become more conscious of the source of their food and the demand for battery eggs falls. Consumers prove to be more interested in animal welfare than in saving a few dollars per tray of eggs. FFF Eggs finds itself sustaining losses several years in a row as supermarkets buy less of their eggs and offer a lower price. FFF Eggs realises that it needs to change and decides to chase the free- range egg market. This requires an overhaul of its farm at a significant cost. A new investor is brought in who is keen to see the business become focused on animal welfare first. Ownership continuity is breached. The battery sheds are torn down and in their place grass is seeded, a roosting barn set up and a fence erected around the land. 60,000 chickens are given to rescue centres. This leaves the 30,000 chickens the land can support free-range. This dramatically reduces the number of eggs FFF Eggs can supply, but it is able to double its price. FFF Eggs can carry forward its pre-breach losses because, while a significant portion of the assets have changed, when weighting other factors there has not been a major change in the nature of the business activities. FFF Eggs has changed some but not all business processes, it still supplies to the same market (supermarkets and consumers of eggs), it uses the same suppliers to get chicken feed and replacement chickens, and there is no change in the type of product it is supplying. Proposed subsection (2)(a) limits the application of the business continuity test to losses arising from the 2013–14 income year onwards. It will also not apply if the company ceases to carry on business activities during the continuity period (subsection (2)(b)). Carve-outs from major change The proposed test is designed around the fact that changes to the inputs used to generate income indicates that the fundamental business is not being continued. However, some changes to business activities and assets will be a consequence of natural development that could have happened absent the change in ownership. This behaviour is not about tax but about a company being able to position its resources in a way that maximises returns. Where there is no loss trading motivation and the fundamental business is continued the business continuity test should allow losses to carry forward. Tax should not be a barrier to normal business development. To recognise this, proposed subsection (5) includes a number of carve-outs from what might be considered a “major change”. These carve-outs are intended to permit loss carry forward in spite of a major change where there is a genuine commercial reason for changing business activities or assets that is not related to the availability of losses. The carve-outs are not a list that defines what a major change is and only need to be referred to if there is a major change. In combination with the core major change test, the carve-outs ensure that the business continuity test has the intended input focus. The first carve-out covers changes made to increase the efficiency of the business activities. This contemplates changes that are made to decrease costs (without artificially moving costs, refer to proposed section GB 3BAC) or otherwise increase the efficiency of the company. 30 The second carve-out covers changes made to keep pace with developing technology. This contemplates situations, for example, where companies take advantage of new technology that becomes available or switch from a physical store to online. Example 10 Maowang Chan has developed a method to identify purebred cats from imposter breeds. This is important in the competitive world of exhibiting cats. His method uses a unique barcode that is tattooed at the base of the tail of the cat to identify the breeder of the cat and the family tree of the particular cat. This barcode is then read by a scanner and the code is located in a database of cat pedigree. His company Go-Cat-Go Limited (GCG) supplies the cat identification service which breeders use like a virtual certificate of a cat’s pedigree. The company both tattoos the cats and maintains the database. GCG has enjoyed some success with cat breeders, however, some breeders don’t like this method of identification as it is invasive on the cats and the barcode can only be read by shaving off some of the fur which makes it limited to appeals from competitions where someone suspects a non-purebred cat has been awarded a prize. Maowang wants to investigate other means of identifying the cats which are less invasive and make better use of technology. However, as the company has been incurring losses over the last few years, he needs a partner to help with funding the new ideas. Alex is a cat lover who has previously exhibited his 12 cats and sees a great opportunity to make some money from the ideas that Maowang has. He offers to invest in GCG and Maowang sells Alex 52% of his company which breaches shareholder continuity. In the year after the breach GCG works on developing a new technology which involves inserting a new microchip designed by GCG into the cats which can be read with a new patented scanner which GCG has manufactured. This has involved GCG replacing its old tattoo equipment with the new electronic scanners and microchip manufacturing equipment. The scanners and microchips are then sold to vets, who place the chips into client’s cats and can search them on the database on request. In that year GCG looks to use some of the tax losses brought forward after the breach. GCG has had a major change during the year as its assets have completely changed, and although its business activities have remained similar on balance there has been a major change so it will need to rely on a carve-out to use the losses. Section IB 3(5)(b) allows a major change which is made to keep up to date with technology. As GCG has changed its assets to keep up with advances in technology it will be able to use the carve out in subsection (5)(b). In the next year GCG discovers an even newer technology that utilises the cat’s tail as an antenna to broadcast the signal from the microchip to a central point to enable faster identification of the cats. GCG’s assets completely change again to produce the new microchip and receivers. Again, GCG has had a major change due to the change in the assets of the company being such a big part of the business, however, again GCG has made those changes to keep up with technology the underlying business of the company has not really changed. GCG will be able to rely on the technology carve-out to utilise its carry forward losses. The third carve-out covers increases in scale, including a company entering a different market for its products or services. The fourth and final category of carve-out covers changes in product or service type. Overall, this carve-out permits: • a company to pivot and drop a type of product or service and start producing or supplying another that has a close connection (for example, a restaurant operator switching to a cooking school), and • a company to be able to retain its existing product/service type but also add to it as opportunities arise, as long as there is a close connection (for example, a clothing manufacturer starting a range of commercial cleaning cloths using offcuts from the clothing). 31 Any new types of product or services need to relate to those already being produced in some way. This might be because they are made using mainly the same assets or processes, or there is some other close connection between those already being produced. Example 11 For the Heart Flour Co. Limited (HFC) has developed a revolutionary technique for adding high levels of quality protein into flour. This creates flour which is superior for bread making. HFC has been producing and suppling this flour to artisan bread makers for several years. Despite its rising business HFC has made losses over the last few years. Always on my Mind Foodstuffs Limited acquires 100% of HFC and continues its flour business. Three years in HFC discovers that their method of adding protein would have application in sport protein powders. HFC starts producing the protein powder and stops producing the flour This results in enough of a change in activities and assets to breach the major change test. Always on my Mind Foodstuffs Limited wants to know if a carve-out under section IB 3(5) will apply to allow HFC to carry forward its losses. Proposed section IB 3(5)(d) allows HFC to change the types of products produced if that involves the company using the same or similar assets or the product is closely related to a product that was provided immediately before the start of the continuity period. The protein powder uses the same IP surrounding the special technique that HFC developed and the old and the new product have a close connection in that they centre around the use of the IP to fortify something with high quality protein. This situation should pass. Likewise, if HFC decided to produce flour and the protein powder the situation should pass under (5)(d). HFC is using its existing resources to expand its product offering. The market for the protein powder shrinks and HFC sees an opportunity to simply sell up its assets and get into cryptocurrency mining – a new craze that the small group of shareholders have latched onto as the next big thing When compared to the time immediately before the breach in ownership until the time the loss has been used there has been a major change. In dropping the flour and eventually the protein powder, HFC sold off all its assets and acquired computers to mine for cryptocurrency. The product it is not related to any aspect of the HFC business before the change in ownership and it does not use any of the same assets. Even though HFC can cease to make its original product and retain the losses from the earlier enterprise, the rules do not permit it to make anything that it wants following an ownership change and still access those losses. There needs to be a clear connection between the replacement product and the original product. The carve-out for technology will not apply either because this is only intended to cover situations where different technology is used within the continued business, not where a business sees an opportunity in a new technology-based industry. Proposed section IB 3(7) provides that land (excluding fixtures to land) would be excluded from consideration when a company is looking at whether it can rely on the change in product/service carve-out. This is because land is a big enough asset to skew the way the carve-out is intended to apply. Example 12 Nikki owns and operates All I Needed Was the Rain Limited (ANR), a deer farm in the Wairarapa. Venison prices have been falling lately and ANR is carrying forward losses from the last three years. In 2023, Nikki sells ANR to David breaching ownership continuity. David takes stock of his new acquisition. The assets are the land, the fencing set up around large flat paddocks, an irrigation system, water troughs, and several storage sheds for farm equipment, plus 300 head of deer. David spends the rest of the 2023–24 year farming the herd of deer but not replacing any. In the 2024–25 year he sends off the last of the deer and buys sheep to start producing wool. At this point ANR has experienced a major change, the deer have been switched out for sheep, the product type has changed 32 from meat to wool, the customer has changed, and some suppliers have changed. His assets have changed somewhat but not totally. ANR has also had to do-up an old shearing shed situated on the land at a cost of $100,000. He also spends $150,000 on a flock of sheep. However, David is able to apply the subsection (5)(d) carve-out for change in the type of product. This is because, although he cannot include the land in his assessment, he uses mainly the same assets in the production of wool as he did for the venison. He leaves the fences, the troughs, and the irrigation system intact. The storage sheds still house farm equipment. All up, $1 million worth of non-land assets are still being used, while $250,000 worth of new assets have been added (including the shearing shed). In the 2025–26 year, David decides that dairy farming is the future. He sells the sheep and converts the farm. David must look at the business activities at the time he acquired ANR and compare them to the business as it is presently. ANR has experienced a major change in the nature of its business because of the switch from being a venison farm to a dairy producer selling within a cooperative. David again looks to the carve-out for product type. However, in this case the carve-out would not apply as he is not using mainly the same assets anymore. David cannot consider the land value when coming to this conclusion, but he can include other assets. The dairy conversion required a $1.5 million automated milking shed to be installed and the fencing to be replaced to create smaller paddocks centred around a new race system that the cows would use to get to the milking shed. The fencing and raceway cost $200,000 to complete. $400,000 is spent acquiring a herd of cows. ANR did use much of the same farm equipment and continued to use the storage sheds to keep it. However, these remaining assets only have a value of $500,000 combined. The shearing shed is no longer used. ANR will forfeit any losses carried forward after the change in ownership that were not used prior to the 2025–26 year. Measurement period for core test The core test must be met for the duration of the business continuity period in order for a tax loss component 3 included in a loss balance of a company to be carried forward. Proposed section IB 4 defines “business continuity period”. For most companies, the business continuity period requires there to be no major change from the time immediately before the breaching change in ownership up until the end of the fifth income year following the change in ownership. As the point of comparison remains the time immediately before the ownership change against the time an amount of the tax loss component is to be used, gradual change can amount to a major change over time. The five-year period is a maximum length of time that the major change test will have to be considered for most companies. When a tax loss component has been used by a company it no longer exists to be carried forward to a future year. The test therefore only ever considers whether a company can continue to carry forward existing tax loss components and has no bearing on the validity of losses already used. If all pre-ownership breach losses are used within the five years, the company will no longer have to consider the business continuity test as there are no existing tax loss components to which it would apply. Part year loss provisions in section IP of the Income Tax Act 2007 will continue to apply. Limiting the business continuity period is intended to reduce compliance and administrative costs while also ensuring that a business is not unduly constrained from making major changes indefinitely as this would impede innovation. It is costly to run a company as a 3 Tax loss component is defined in section IA 2(7) of the Income Tax Act 2007 as an amount included in a tax loss for the tax year (a net loss for the year and any additional amounts for the year). Section IA 5 provides that a tax loss component carried forward includes any unused tax loss component from an earlier year. 33 genuine business for five years simply to access its losses. This makes loss trading less of a concern at the end of the continuity period. Example 13 All Shook Up House Repilers Limited (All Shook Up) is a company that specialises in repiling and levelling older houses. They have been doing very well over the last number of years due to increased work from various earthquakes around the country. Bartholomew, the owner of All Shook Up has been looking for new ways to expand his successful business and sees an opportunity in acquiring a comparable business. Steamroller Blues Contracting Limited (Steamroller Blues) is a company that undertakes land works for domestic customers. It has not been doing very well in recent years as Talia, the owner of the company, has not been pricing jobs well. As a result, Steamroller Blues has carried forward tax losses of $5 million. Bartholomew purchases 100% of Steamroller Blues on 1 June 2021 and keeps the business operating but focuses on pricing the jobs more appropriately. In addition, the acquisition increases the customer base of the company. It is clear that Steamroller Blues has not had a major change during the business continuity period. At the end of the company’s 2026–27 income year (31 March) Steamroller Blues has $600,000 of the original tax losses still available. In the 2027–28 income year Bartholomew sees an opportunity in school classroom construction and wants to make some changes to the company by selling all of its assets and replacing these with heavy machinery to erect buildings. As Steamroller Blues is outside the five-year business continuity period the major change requirements will no longer need to be satisfied and therefore there are no tax restrictions on Steamroller Blues making changes to its business. The company will continue to be able to access the remaining losses. However, if instead Steamroller Blues uses $4 million of its carried forward losses but has a major change at the end of the 2025–26 income year, it would forfeit the $1 million of unused losses. The five-year business continuity period would not apply to all companies. For companies carrying forward losses consisting of significant deductions for bad debts claimed under section DB 31(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 proposed section IB 4(1)(a) provides that the business continuity period will remain until the losses carried forward are utilised. This condition is proposed to address concerns that a failed finance type company could be an attractive loss trading proposition. Failed finance companies may too easily satisfy the business continuity test even when they should not. A failed finance company may be acquired and, although the company is largely inactive, satisfy the test because the financial arrangement assets remain, and its activities are continued at a minimal level for five years to satisfy the business continuity test period. After five years the acquiror would be free to inject income into that company in order to use up the losses, for example, by transferring a profitable restaurant business into what was the finance company. Losses arising as a result of bad debt deductions are the primary concern. Bad debt deductions arise when a taxpayer is in the business of “holding or dealing” financial arrangements and that taxpayer writes off a debt as unrecoverable. These are the types of deductions that can result in the large losses failed finance companies carry forward. By applying the business continuity test until the pre-breach losses have been used the losses acquired are restricted for use within the business that generated them, and Inland Revenue will be able to apply anti-avoidance rules to any loss trading type activity. Proposed subsection IB 4(2) contains the formula to be used when calculating whether proposed subsection IB 4(1)(a) would apply, subsection IB 4(3) defines the items in the formula. In short, the calculation requires that all deductions in years a company records a loss that is included in its loss carry forward balance immediately before the breach in 34 ownership continuity starting from the 2013–14 income year to be totalled. This total deduction amount is compared to the amount of section DB 31(3) deductions taken in those loss years. Any income derived under section CG 3 as a result of the recovery of DB 31(3) bad debts should be subtracted from the total deductions and from the DB 31(3) deductions claimed in those years. If the formula results in 50 percent or more of the loss carried forward being attributed to DB 31(3) deductions then the business continuity test applies until the losses are used. Example 14 Always on my Mind Finance Limited (AMF) is a company that is in the business of holding or dealing in financial arrangements. It has incurred some losses relating to bad debt deductions under section DB 31(3) which relate to the amounts owing under financial arrangements. It has incurred these losses over four years as follows: Year Income Deductions (other than DB 31(3)) DB 31(3) deductions/ (recoveries) Net taxable income/(loss) 2016–17 5,000,000 1,500,000 6,000,000 (2,500,000) 2017–18 2,000,000 3,000,000 7,500,000 (8,500,000) 2018–19 1,500,000 600,000 600,000 300,000 2019–20 1,000,000 2,000,000 (200,000) (800,000) Total 9,500,000 7,100,000 13,900,000 (11,500,000) Way Down Mortgages Limited (Way Down) is a mortgage lending company which is looking toward expansion and although AMF has not been performing well, Way Down thinks that with the right management this business can be turned around as the remaining portfolio of the company is promising. AMF wants to understand how the new business continuity rules will apply to the tax losses carried forward by Way Down. It asks Lloyd the company’s accountant for some advice. Lloyd has a look at section IB 4 and also the tax returns for Way Down. Year Deductions (other than DB 31(3)) DB 31(3) deductions/ (recoveries) Total deductions 2016–17 1,500,000 6,000,000 7,500,000 2017–18 3,000,000 7,500,000 10,500,000 2019–20 2,000,000 (200,000) 1,800,000 Total 6,500,000 13,300,000 19,800,000 Lloyd advises that, because in the years that Way Down has made losses the ratio of DB 31(3) deductions to the total deductions is 67.2% ((13,300,000 ÷ 19,800,000) × 100), Way Down can carry forward its losses but the five-year rule will not apply to them. They will need to meet the requirements of the business continuity test until the losses are utilised. Application to corporate groups Currently, a company may offset its losses against other companies’ profits if it meets continuity of ownership requirements and has at least 66% common ownership with the companies when the loss is incurred. The loss will be made available to from the time the loss arose until the time it is used. 4 4 Subpart IC of the Income Tax Act 2007. 35 The proposal leaves the commonality requirements unchanged. Companies in the original group that are acquired together would meet the group test (for example, they were 100% commonly owned when the loss was made and remain 100% commonly owned when the loss is to be offset). The acquired group will also form a new group with the acquiring company/group, however, because the commonality rules would fail to allow loss offsetting within the “new” group the pre-acquisition losses cannot be offset with other companies in that “new” group. For the continuity requirements the proposal is that companies which meet commonality requirements immediately before and immediately after acquisition would be treated as a single company for the purposes of applying the business continuity test to carry forward pre-acquisition losses under proposed section IB 5. When assessing if there has been a major change the acquired group must be looked at as if it was a single company rather than separate entities. Consequential amendments are proposed to the consolidation and amalgamation rules to incorporate the business continuity test but no changes are proposed to how these regimes operate. Example 15 The Fame and Fortune Casino Group (FFG) is a group of companies operating a casino business. This Group is made up of a holding company and a number of subsidiaries which, as a whole, operate the casino business, one of these subsidiaries provides the finance function of the group. The finance subsidiary is carrying forward a loss. FFG is acquired by the Money Honey Casino Group (MHG), another casino operating group of companies. MHG has a finance company and, because it is inefficient to keep two finance companies, FFG’s subsidiary finance function is wound down after the acquisition. When MHG acquired FFG ownership continuity was breached. When applying the business continuity test to determine whether the losses of the FFG can be carried forward after the change in ownership the business activities of the whole group must be considered. When considered as a single company the Group carries on the same income generating business activities it did before being the casino. It also uses the same income generating assets to do so. On these facts FFG should be able to carry forward any pre-acquisition losses its members might have, and those losses will remain available to offset income within the FFG but not within the new group formed with the MHG because the commonality requirements are not met for those losses. Anti-avoidance A number of proposals have been developed to support the core test and ensure it does not open up opportunities for loss trading. The key purpose of the loss continuity rules remains to prevent this activity. Dormant company rule Proposed section IB 3(3)(a) would disallow the carry forward of losses if the change in ownership occurs at any time after the business activities of the company have ceased and before any revival of the business. The proposed rule does not require assessment of whether a company is completely dormant, but it should deal with companies that are no longer viable and really only have value in their stock of tax losses. Similarly, proposed section IB 3(2)(b) would disallow any further carry forward of losses where a company ceases to carry on any business activities (in effect becomes dormant after the change in ownership). 36 The dormant company rule does not apply to a temporary reduction in activity. A company may be seasonal or may have to temporarily suspend trading due to Government order but as long as the income earning infrastructure remains ready to be operational there is no cessation of the business that will trigger the dormant company rule. Likewise, the proposal does not consider low activity industries to trigger the rule. It does not matter that a company is being run by receivers or liquidators as long as there remains a sufficient level of business activity. Example 16 Golden Coins Ltd operates claw game machines to thirty shopping centres. It installs the machines and staff regularly visit the sites where they are installed to collect any money and replenish the supply of novelty stuffed animals. Buying and installing the machines was an expensive exercise, it also proves expensive to service and stock the machines. Golden Coins incurs significant losses over the two-year period it operates. The machines are poor quality and the claws constantly break. The number of players dwindles as the machines become known as unreliable and stingy with their prizes. Golden Coins decides not to stock or service the machines anymore and leaves them to slowly empty out. The shopping centres ask for them to be removed and they are all taken back to a warehouse that Golden Coins is leasing. After a month, the sole shareholder Jim, sells the business to his friend Rob. The machines are defunct and all that is left is the idea that maybe they could be refurbished and a lease for the warehouse where they are stored. There is otherwise no other activity happening. The policy intent is for the dormant company rule to apply in this situation to not allow the carry forward of losses as at the time of the change in ownership the business activities carried on by Golden Coins had ceased. Change in business activities prior to acquisition Proposed section GB 3BA is a specific anti-avoidance rule to prevent arrangements that are made between the purchaser and seller of a company prior to a transaction that are intended to defeat the business continuity test or the dormant company rule. If taxpayers are able to avoid the intended application of the test, then avenues for loss trading schemes could arise. Example 17: Change in assets Milkcow Blues Boogie Cheese Limited (MBBC) is a poorly managed manufacturer of cheese with significant tax losses to carry forward. The cheese MBBC is known to produce has a terrible reputation and the shareholders have decided to sell the company rather than fix it. Spinout Limited (Spinout), a manufacturer of very good pulled toffee, hears the shareholders of MBBC are looking to sell and that the company has significant losses. The assets MBBC currently has are not very useful for toffee, but the staff can probably be retrained. Spinout knows that replacing the assets of MBBC after the change in ownership is going to breach the major change test and arranges for MBBC to dispose of speciality cheese equipment and to acquire toffee machines before the sale of shares takes place. Section GB 3BA would apply to this situation to prevent MBBC from carrying forward its pre-acquisition losses because in the two years prior to the ownership continuity breach MBBC and Spinout entered into a verbal arrangement where the sale of shares of MBBC was made conditional on the assets being changed so that the business of Spinout could be carried out after the ownership change without breaching the core business continuity test. 37 Example 18: Change to a dormant company A Little Less Conversation Limited (ALLC) was a publishing company that put out a popular political magazine. However, the operations were mothballed when the chief editor quit and the content became less popular. ALLC sustained substantial losses. After three years, Judy, a shareholder with a 10 percent stake in ALLC had an idea to start a high fashion magazine. They approached the other shareholders in ALLC offering to purchase the remaining 90 percent of the shares if ALLC’s business was restarted and produced the magazines as requested by Judy for six months. ALLC began to produce the magazines. Six months later, as agreed, the remaining 90 percent of shares in ALLC were transferred to Judy who continued on with the fashion magazine. Section GB 3BA would apply to this situation to prevent the dormant company rule being circumvented by an arrangement to restart a business before the change in ownership. Anti-injection rules One way to engage in loss trading activity is to buy a loss company and inject some profitable activity or reduce its costs to soak up available losses. An acquirer may purchase a company and continue to run its business activities while also injecting amounts of income into the business or transferring costs out of the business that are small enough not to be regarded a major change. This is most likely to occur with an associated person. Proposed sections GB 3BAB and GB 3BAC are specific anti-avoidance rules and would only apply where a company is relying on the business continuity test to carry forward losses. The rules would not apply to companies more broadly. The anti-injection rules would apply if all of the following conditions are met: • The company is party to an arrangement. • The effect of the arrangement is that the company derives assessable income or is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss that, but for the arrangement, an associated person would have derived or incurred, would in all likelihood have derived or incurred, or might have been expected to derive or incur. • The sole or main purpose of the arrangement is tax avoidance. It would not apply where, for example, employment contracts are shifted to a group member and there is a recharge to the loss company or where efficiencies are made by using other group employees to now provide services to the acquired company rather than, say, use consultants that were previously providing the services (for example, a loss company uses a firm as tax advisors but the acquirer has a tax division who would now undertake that task). In the case of income injection, section GB 3BAB applies to deem the amount of injected income to be schedular income of the loss company. This results in tax to pay on that income (plus any associated shortfall penalties). In the case of cost shifting, section GB 3BAC applies to disallow the deduction for expenditure or loss in the profit company resulting in tax to pay on the income it offset (plus any associated shortfall penalties). The loss company is then treated as having incurred the amount of expenditure or loss. 38 Example 19 Moody Blue Boat Ltd (Moody Blue) is a failing manufacturer of fish finding equipment for boats. It has sustained significant losses over the last five years due to mismanagement. It’s Midnight Music Ltd (Midnight) buys and licences songs for use in events. It is a profitable business with no tax losses available to offset any income it derives. In August 2020, Midnight acquires Moody Blue and carries on manufacturing the standard fish finding equipment it is known for and ensures the business is properly managed. There is no major change in the activities or assets of Moody Blue and so it is able to carry forward its losses relying on the business continuity test. Midnight also sees an opportunity to assign some of its income to Moody Blue Co in order to take advantage of the available losses and reduce overall tax paid on the business of Midnight. In November 2020, an arrangement between Moody Blue and Midnight is entered into whereby some of Midnight’s licences are assigned to Moody Blue. This becomes a very small part of Moody Blue’s business and does not reach the threshold of major change. However, the section GB 3BAB anti-injection rule applies to prevent the injected income from being offset with any remaining losses in that year. This applied because Moody Blue had a tax loss component it was carrying forward in reliance of the business continuity test, and but for the arrangement Midnight would have derived the income from the licencing activity, and the income was injected with the sole purpose of tax avoidance – Midnight entered the arrangement to reduce tax on its own business activities. Example 20 Patch It Up Paint Ltd (Patch It Up) does painting and decorating for domestic clients. In recent years it has run into difficulty – it is poorly managed, and staff do not work efficiently or neatly. The client list slowly begins to shrink and Patch It Up suffers significant losses from 2016–2019. Patch It Up has found itself on the edge of failure and Barbara, the owner of the business, starts looking for a buyer. Di owns and operates Rip It Up Decorators Ltd (Rip it Up). Rip It Up also does painting and decorating for domestic clients and has been very successful. In the 2020 year, Di secures the ownership interests in Patch It Up for a bargain price. This breaches ownership continuity but Di relies on the business continuity test to carry Patch It Up’s losses forward. Di thinks there is an opportunity to unlock the value of the losses by moving some costs to Rip It Up. It seems logical to Di for Rip It Up to secure all the paint for both companies. A deduction for the paint arises in Rip It Up, Patch It Up no longer incurs this cost. In addition, Patch It Up has a loan with a bank that is resulting in deductions for interest payments. Di arranges for Rip It Up to pay the loan back on behalf of Patch It Up, but funds this repayment with a loan from another bank. Deductions for interest payments now arise in Rip It Up. The combination of these two arrangements results in Patch It Up returning to profit and therefore using its losses. Rip It Up wants to use the deductions for interest payments and paint acquisition to reduce its own tax. However, Rip It Up’s accountant notes that section GB 3BAC applies to disallow these deductions. This is because there has been an arrangement between related parties which resulted in deductions that would have been incurred by Patch It Up being incurred by Rip It Up. Tax avoidance was the main purpose because Di entered these arrangements in order to access the losses of Patch It Up. GB 3BAC applies to treat Patch It Up as having incurred the expenditure that gave rise to the deductions. Rip It Up is reassessed and has tax to pay once the deductions have been taken away, shortfall penalties are also imposed. Previously forfeited losses Proposed sections IB 3(3)(b) and (c) are incorporated to confirm a taxpayer cannot revive a tax loss component: • that has previously been subject to a change in ownership followed by a major change, or • that was subject to a change in ownership before the 2020–21 income year. 39 Consequential amendments Other proposals are consequential amendments to sections of the Income Tax Act 2007 which reference the loss continuity rules to ensure that, where appropriate, reference is made to the proposed business continuity test. These include amendments to rules relating to the carry forward of certain tax credits which are intended to mirror the rules for the carry forward of losses. These are research and development tax incentive credits, attributable controlled foreign company income tax credits, and tax credits for supplementary dividends.

of proposed amendment The proposed amendment sets the annual income tax rates that would apply for the 2021–22 income tax year. The annual rates that apply to the 2021–22 income tax year include a top personal income tax rate of 39% to annual income exceeding $180,000. Application date The proposed amendment would apply for the 2021–22 tax year. For most taxpayers, the 2021–22 income tax year commenced on 1 April 2021. Key features The proposed annual income tax rates for the 2021–22 tax year would be set at the rates specified in schedule 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The rates include a top personal income tax rate of 39% on annual income that exceeds $180,000. The top personal income tax rate of 39% was added by the Taxation (Income Tax Rate and Other Amendments) Act 2020. Detailed analysis Table 1 in part A of schedule 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 sets out the basic income tax rates that apply to personal income. Table 1: Income tax rates Row Taxable income Tax rate 1 $0–$14,000 10.5% 2 $14,001–$48,000 17.5% 3 $48,001–$70,000 30% 4 $70,001–$180,000 33% 5 $180,001 upwards 39% 11 GST policy items 13 TAX TREATMENT OF CRYPTOASSETS Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments would exclude cryptoassets (also known as cryptocurrencies) from GST and the financial arrangements rules. Background Cryptoassets are digital assets (commonly known as coins or tokens) that use cryptography to secure transactions and verify the transfer of the coins or tokens. Instead of relying on a financial institution to verify transactions, cryptoasset transactions are confirmed by computers operating on the currency’s network (distributed ledger technology). Tax rules in New Zealand and overseas do not contemplate cryptoassets and can be difficult to apply as cryptoassets will often not fit into existing definitions that were designed for other investment products such as currency, shares, debt or equity securities. Because of their innovative nature, they will often also have different features to these other investment products. Cryptoassets and GST The current position is that cryptoassets likely fall within the scope of existing GST rules (although this position is unclear). Under current law, the application of GST to cryptoassets would vary depending on the facts, the features of the cryptoasset and the residency of the parties to the transaction. The supply of a cryptoasset could be subject to GST at 15%, an exempt financial service, or a zero-rated supply to a non-resident. The issues that arise when applying GST to cryptoassets can be summarised as follows: • Tax settings disincentivising purchasing of cryptoassets by residents: Applying GST to cryptoassets could result in supplies to non-residents being zero-rated for GST purposes but subject to GST when supplied to residents. This creases a distortion and preference to sell to offshore investors. • Double taxation: This could occur when an asset is purchased with bitcoin and then that bitcoin is converted back into fiat currency. • Compliance costs: If cryptoassets were subject to GST then the GST treatment would vary depending on the classification of the asset (for example, if the cryptoasset was similar to money then it would not be subject to GST, but if it provided access to services then it would). As there are over 10,000 cryptoassets with various functions and constantly changing uses, it would add unnecessary compliance costs to taxpayers if they were required to determine the underlying status of the asset for the purposes of determining whether GST applied. 14 Cryptoassets and the financial arrangements rules Example 1: Lucy Lucy purchases NZ$11,500 worth of bitcoin from a domestic bitcoin exchange. The exchange is required to remit three twenty-thirds of this ($1,500) to Inland Revenue as GST on the taxable supply of bitcoin they made in exchange for NZD. Lucy purchases a car from Smith Motors Ltd using the $11,500 worth of bitcoin. GST applies on the sale of the car and Smith Motors must return 3/23rds ($1,500) of the value of the bitcoin to Inland Revenue as GST. As a result of these two transactions, GST of NZ$3,000 has been charged in relation to the purchase of a vehicle worth $10,000. If Lucy had paid for the vehicle with NZD instead of bitcoin, only $1,500 of GST would have been paid. From Smith Motors perspective, it receives $11,500 NZD worth of bitcoin and must return $1,500 of GST to Inland Revenue for the taxable supply of the car, but it will also need to return another $1,500 in GST when it converts that bitcoin back to NZD. The financial arrangements rules are a set of rules that require all returns on “financial arrangements” to be accounted for tax on an accrued basis over the term of the financial arrangement using a spreading method. A “financial arrangement” is broadly defined and includes virtually any arrangement where there is a delay in giving or receiving consideration. A common example of a financial arrangement is a loan. The financial arrangements rules do not apply to “excepted financial arrangements”, which often have their own rules or general rules apply. An example of an excepted financial arrangement are shares. A person who is subject to the financial arrangements rules must account for all income and expenditure under the rules using an applicable spreading method regardless of whether the financial arrangement is of a revenue or capital nature. As financial arrangements are broadly defined, this means that some types of cryptoassets are likely to be financial arrangements under the current rules. The application of the financial arrangements rules to cryptoassets could lead to accrual-based taxation on large unrealised gains and losses from cryptoasset values, which can be very volatile. This would require a taxpayer to convert their cryptoassets value into NZD, spread income and expenditure over the time of the arrangement and undertake a base price adjustment on maturity. In addition to these compliance costs, applying the financial arrangements rules to cryptoassets could bias a taxpayer’s investment decision towards cryptoassets not subject to these rules. 15 DEFINITION OF CRYPTOASSET (Clauses 5(2), and 127(2)) Summary of proposed amendment In order to exclude cryptoassets from GST and the financial arrangements rules, the term “cryptoassets” needs to be defined. The proposed amendment introduces a definition of “cryptoasset” into section 2 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 January 2009, the date that the first cryptoasset, bitcoin, was launched. Detailed analysis Meaning of cryptoasset The proposed amendment would define cryptoasset widely as a digital representation of value that exists in a distributed ledger (such as a blockchain) and is secured cryptographically to record the ownership and transactions involving cryptoassets. The proposed definition would also future proof it against any technological advancements in the blockchain and cryptography area by including another application of the same technology performing an equivalent function. To meet the definition of cryptoasset, the asset in question must also be fungible. The fungibility requirement has been included to exclude non-fungible asset classes, such as non- fungible tokens (NTFs). NFTs certify a digital asset to be unique and are not interchangeable. They are generally used to represent items such as photos or videos and can be owned or traded using a blockchain. 16 EXCLUDING CRYPTOASSETS FROM GST (Clauses 5(2) and (3)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would exclude cryptoassets from GST by amending the definitions of both “goods” and “services” in section 2(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) to expressly exclude cryptoassets. The proposed definition of cryptoassets is explained above – note that this definition excludes non-fungible tokens which will remain subject to GST if supplied by a registered person. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 January 2009, the date that the first cryptoasset, bitcoin, was launched. Detailed analysis Section 8(1) of the GST Act imposes goods and services tax at a rate of 15% on the supply of goods and services in New Zealand by a registered person. Proposed amendments to the definition of “goods” and “services” in section 2(1) of the GST Act would expressly exclude cryptoassets from these definitions. This means that the supply of cryptoassets would not be subject to GST. However, GST will continue to apply to supplies of goods and services which are bought using cryptoassets (the same as if those goods or services had been purchased using money or swapped for another good or service). Example 2: Paul Paul is a GST registered software developer who develops a new blockchain-based software project and issues a new cryptoasset token to help fund the project. The supply of the cryptoasset token to investors is not a taxable supply for GST as there are no goods or services supplied to the investors in return for their money (or the other cryptocurrency they use to buy the new token). Six months later the project is successfully launched, and Paul now supplies a blockchain-based software service whereby users of the software can redeem the new cryptoasset token for a monthly subscription to use the software. The supply of the software services is a taxable supply for GST, so Paul must charge 15% GST on the value in New Zealand dollars of sales of the software subscription service to New Zealand customers and zero-rate (charge 0% GST) his sales of software services to non-resident customers. Paul also continues to issue and sell new tokens, but on these are not taxable supplies. Instead, GST applies when the tokens are redeemed for the supply of the software services (similar to a voucher). Example 3: Bary Bary is a GST registered web developer who loves whales. He develops a series of collectible non-fungible tokens using a whale theme. Bary’s tokens become quite popular, and Bary sells them for a total of $1,150. From a GST perspective, Bary must return $150 of GST on the sale. This is because non-fungible tokens remain subject to GST. 17 Because the proposed definition of cryptoassets excludes non-fungible tokens, supplies of non-fungible tokens will remain subject to GST if supplied by a registered person. 18 INPUT CREDITS FOR CAPITAL RAISING (Clause 22) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would allow GST-registered businesses that raise funds through issuing cryptoassets with features similar to debt or equity securities to claim input tax credits on their capital-raising costs. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 April 2017, the date the capital-raising deduction rule took effect. Background The GST rules were amended in 2017 to allow GST-registered persons to claim input credits for inputs such as legal or advisory services used to raise capital using equity or debt securities (see section 20H of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act)). To ensure businesses that choose to raise capital through issuing cryptoassets are not disadvantaged, the amendment proposes that GST-registered businesses that raise funds through issuing security tokens that have features similar to debt or equity securities (such as a right to a share of the profits of a project) should also be able to claim input credits on their capital-raising costs. Detailed analysis Clause 22 would amend section 20H(1)(d) of the GST Act to include cryptoassets with similar features or functions to a debt security, participatory security or equity security (now known collectively as a “funding security”). This treatment would allow businesses that principally make taxable supplies of goods and services to deduct the GST cost of specific costs incurred to raise capital. Examples could include legal fees, exchange listing fees, and costs associated with preparing a product disclosure statement (or whitepaper in the cryptoasset context). Example 4: Nicole Nicole is the founder of a cryptoasset called ‘econo-coin’ which is a revolutionary blockchain based project that aims to create efficiencies in manufacturing production chains through the use of RFID chip technology. These supply chain efficiencies result in saved manufacturing costs for businesses. Nicole prepares a white paper setting out the purpose of econo-coin and the technology that will be implemented to achieve its goals in order to persuade investors to back the project. Investors who buy an econo-coin are entitled to a share of the profits made by the project, and the econo-coin has similar features or functions to a participatory security. In issuing the white paper, Nicole spends $23,000 on legal and consultant fees, including GST of $3,000. Nicole claims a deduction of $3,000, the GST component of the costs she incurred to raise capital (with the whitepaper being the promotional tool to achieve this capital raising aim). 19 EXCLUDING CRYPTOASSETS FROM THE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS RULES (Clause 79) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments would exclude cryptoassets from the financial arrangements rules by amending section EW 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) to include cryptoassets as an excepted financial arrangement. Officials consider that the issuing of non-fungible tokens are not financial arrangements as they do not meet the definition of a financial arrangement as set out in EW 3 of the ITA. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 January 2009, the date that the first cryptoasset, bitcoin, was launched. Detailed analysis Proposed new section EW 5(3BA) provides that a cryptoasset is an excepted financial arrangement if the cryptoasset does not meet the requirements of subsection (3BAB). Proposed new section EW 5(3BAB) provides that a cryptoasset is not an excepted financial arrangement if the owner receives amounts that are determined by reference to the purchase price of the cryptoassets and on a basis that is known by the owner in advance. The purpose of this exclusion is to ensure that cryptoassets that are economically equivalent to debt arrangements are still taxed under the financial arrangements rules. This would ensure that cryptoassets receive equivalent treatment to other types of investments. Example 5: Gordon Gordon has 2 bitcoin that he invests via a platform called blockgrowth.co.nz. Blockgrowth is a spread business that makes money by borrowing capital at a certain rate (the interest it pays to users) and lends it at a higher rate. When Gordon invests his bitcoin on the blockgrowth platform, his bitcoin is locked in for a set period and Gordon is paid a guaranteed fixed return in bitcoin for the period that his investment remains locked in to the blockgrowth platform. Gordon invests via blockgrowth for a year and is provided with a 5% return. During this time Gordon is unable to sell, trade, exchange or otherwise make any use of his bitcoin. After the expiration of the yearly period, Gordon withdraws 2.10 bitcoin from blockgrowth. Although Gordon’s underlying investment of 2 bitcoins is not subject to the financial arrangements rules, his additional 5% return, or 0.1 bitcoin is subject to these rules. As Gordon is a cash basis person, this means that Gordon must undertake a base price adjustment on the maturity of this arrangement and pay tax accordingly. Although in most cases cryptoassets would not be subject to the financial arrangements rules, it is noted that the amounts you get from selling, trading or exchanging cryptoassets can be taxable. You may have to pay tax because you are: 20 • acquiring cryptoassets for the purposes of disposal (for example to sell or exchange) • trading in cryptoassets, or • using cryptoassets for a profit-making scheme. 21 ABILITY TO AGREE AN APPORTIONMENT METHOD WITH INLAND REVENUE (Clauses 21(5), and 23(2)) Summary of proposed amendment Proposed amendments to sections 20(3EB) and 21(4B) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 would remove the $24 million turnover threshold for agreeing an apportionment method with the Commissioner. The proposed amendment would allow any registered person to apply to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to agree to an apportionment method, irrespective of their turnover. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the date of enactment. Detailed analysis The apportionment and adjustment rules apply when a GST-registered person uses or intends to use goods and services for both taxable and non-taxable purposes. Following the acquisition of an asset, the apportionment rules require the GST-registered person to annually compare the intended taxable use of an asset with the actual taxable use of an asset. If there is a difference the person must make an adjustment to either claim extra input tax credits or pay output tax to reflect the actual taxable use of the asset. Under current law, only registered persons that expect to make supplies of goods and services with a value of more than $24 million in a 12-month period can agree to an apportionment method with the Commissioner. GST registered persons below this threshold are currently unable to negotiate a specific apportionment method with the Commissioner, and must apply rules that can be seen as complex. Removing the threshold would reduce compliance costs by allowing all registered persons to apply to the Commissioner to agree to an apportionment method. 22 DISPOSAL OF ASSETS WITH A MIX OF TAXABLE AND NON-TAXABLE USE (Clause 25) Summary of proposed amendment Section 21F of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) applies when a GST registered person disposes of an asset which they have partly used to make taxable supplies and also partly used for a non-taxable use (such as a private or exempt use). It allows them to claim an additional input tax deduction in respect of their non-taxable use of an asset. However, this deduction is currently capped at the GST fraction of the purchase price paid by the registered person when they acquired the asset. The proposed amendment to section 21F would remove this cap on deductions to ensure that disposals of appreciating assets, such as land, are not overtaxed. It is proposed that the cap would remain in place for land disposed of by property developers as an increase in the value of the land in these cases is directly connected to their taxable activity of property development. Application date The proposed amendments would apply from 24 February 2020. Detailed analysis Section 21F applies when a registered person disposes of an asset which during their period of ownership they have partly used to make taxable supplies and also partly used for a non- taxable use (such as to make exempt supplies, private use or using the asset before registering for GST). It allows the person to claim an additional input tax deduction to reflect the non-taxable use of the asset. This input tax deduction is in addition to any input tax deduction already claimed in respect of the percentage use of the asset to make taxable supplies. The additional deduction offsets the output tax which the registered person is required to return on the disposal of any goods or services used in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity. The current section 21F of the GST Act caps the input tax deduction to the tax fraction (3/23rds) of the consideration paid when the asset was acquired (or 15% of the consideration in cases where the land was acquired as a zero-rated supply). This cap on deductions can lead to appreciating assets such as land being overtaxed on disposal, as it means that while any increase in the value of the asset is subject to output tax, there is no corresponding input tax deduction to reflect any non-taxable use of the asset. There are currently two separate formulae in sections 21F(2) and (4) that, while expressed differently, actually calculate exactly the same amounts. Currently, application of the formula in section 21F(4) is limited to land that was a zero-rated supply under 11(1)(mb) at the time it was acquired by the registered person who is now disposing of the land. 23 Because the formula in section 21F(4) is simpler and easier to understand than the formula in section 21F(2) of the GST Act, the proposed amendment would repeal section 21F(2) and expand the application of section 21F(4) so the simpler formula in section 21F(4) would apply to all assets. A cap on input tax deductions is retained for property developers The policy intention is that the existing cap on input tax deductions under section 21F should remain in place for land disposed of by a property developer. This is because their taxable activity is about improving the value of land so any appreciation in value of the land is directly connected to their taxable activity. To retain a cap on property developers, the proposed amendment would replace the current section 21F(6) with a new proposed section 21F(6) that would apply to GST-registered property developers whose taxable activity is supplying land (as a good). More specifically, the proposed section 21F(6) would apply to a disposal of land, which would be a taxable supply in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity of supplying land even in the absence of any other use of the land by the person in a taxable activity. If, instead, the registered person uses the land to conduct another type of taxable activity, such as short-term commercial accommodation or a home-based business, and the land would not have been a taxable supply in the absence of that other type of taxable activity, new section 21F(6) would not apply and the formula in section 21F(4) would allow an uncapped input tax deduction that reflects the percentage of non-taxable use of the land. This is illustrated in example 6. Example 6: Short-term commercial accommodation Sally purchases a home in Whangamatā for $690,000. The holiday home is used to supply short-term commercial accommodation and because the expected revenues from this activity will exceed $60,000 per annum, Sally registers for, and charges GST on the short-term accommodation. As Sally has also stayed in the holiday home for long periods over the winter months, her private (non- taxable) use of the house has been 20%. Because the taxable use of the holiday home is 80%, Sally has already claimed an input tax deduction of $72,000 during her period of ownership ($72,000 is 80% of the tax fraction (3/23rds) of the $690,000 purchase price of the house). After many years she sells the holiday home for $1,150,000 (including GST). As Sally is GST registered and disposing of an asset which was used in the course and furtherance of her taxable activity of supplying short-term commercial accommodation, she is required to return $150,000 of GST output tax. Sally does not have a taxable activity of selling land. This means that in the absence of the supplies of short- term commercial accommodation Sally made from the holiday home, the sale of the holiday home would not be considered as being made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. Under the proposed change in the Bill the cap on adjustments in section 21F would therefore not apply to the disposal of the holiday home so Sally can claim an input tax deduction of $30,000. Applying the formula in proposed section 21F(4) to Sally’s holiday home: Tax fraction × consideration × (1 − previous use) = 3/23 × $1,150,000 × (1 – 0.8) = $30,000 Sally returns $150,000 of GST output tax and claims an input tax deduction of $30,000 in her next GST return. The $120,000 of net GST she returns reflects 80% of the output tax charged on the sale of the holiday home which is consistent with the fact that 80% of the holiday home was used to make taxable supplies. 24 If the person who is disposing of the land is a property developer, so that the cap in proposed section 21F(6) applies to them, then how the cap is calculated depends on whether the land was acquired as a zero-rated supply of land. If the property developer acquired the land as a zero-rated supply, paragraph (a) would apply to limit the maximum input tax deduction under section 21F to 15% of the consideration paid on purchase (the amount calculated under 20(3J)(a)(iii) with a 15% GST rate). For other types of land, including land acquired as a secondhand good, paragraph (b) would apply to limit the maximum input tax deduction for a property developer under section 21F to the full input tax deduction (3/23rds) of the consideration the developer paid when they acquired the land. The limit on input tax deductions for property developers is illustrated in example 7. Example 7: Property developer House Co is a GST registered property developer that purchases a house on a large section of land for $2.3 million from an unregistered person that is currently rented out as residential accommodation. Six months later the residential tenancy ends and they begin renting out the house as short-term commercial accommodation while developing plans and obtaining consent for development work. After six months of using the home for providing short-term commercial accommodation House Co begins the process of demolishing the house, subdividing the land and constructing five new houses on the land. Two years after acquiring the land House Co sells the five new houses for a total price of $5.75 million (including GST) and returns output tax of $750,000. House Co has a taxable activity of property development and therefore, even in the absence of the supplies of short-term commercial accommodation they made with the land, the supply of the land would still be made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. As such, the cap on adjustments in the current section 21F and the proposed new section 21F(6) would apply to the disposal of the land. Proposed section 21F(6)(b) caps the maximum input tax deduction to the tax fraction of the purchase price that House Co paid when they acquired the land which is $300,000 (3/23 × $2.3 million = $300,000). Over the period House Co owned the land their taxable use was 75% so they had claimed an input tax deduction of $225,000. House Co’s additional input tax deduction under section 21F would therefore be capped at $750,000 as this is the remainder of the $300,000 tax fraction on the $2.3 million purchase price. 25 DOMESTIC TRANSPORT SERVICES SUPPLIED AS PART OF THE INTERNATIONAL TRANSPORT OF GOODS (Clause 11) Summary of proposed amendment The Goods and Services Act 1985 (GST Act) zero-rates services provided to transport goods to and from New Zealand. This is because exported goods are zero-rated, and the value of transport services for imported goods are already included in the cost of imported goods, which are subject to 15% GST. Under the current law, the transport of goods within New Zealand – where the service forms part of the international transport of goods – may also be zero-rated, but only when these services are supplied by the same supplier as the international transport (that is, they are not subcontracted to another supplier). The proposed amendment would expand zero-rating to accommodate sub-contracting arrangements. This would mean that domestic transport services supplied to a primary transport supplier (often a non-resident/international transporter) to transport goods to or from New Zealand would be zero-rated. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the date of enactment. Key features The proposed amendment to section 11A(1)(c) of the GST Act would remove the words “to the extent that the services are supplied by the same supplier”, which would enable domestic transport suppliers to subject their domestic transport services (where they relate to the international transport of goods) to 0% GST. Background The current rules for when domestic transport services that form part of the international transport of goods must be zero-rated do not align with current commercial practices. It is a common commercial practice for an international transport supplier, contracted to supply the international transport of goods to or from New Zealand, to subcontract the domestic transport component to a New Zealand-based transport supplier (for example, a courier company) – instead of the international transport supplier establishing themselves in New Zealand in order to complete the domestic component of the transport service themselves. However, currently the rules require the primary transport supplier to also be the same supplier of the domestic transport component (essentially the primary transport supplier provides the full transport service). The issue is the requirement of “same supplier” has been interpreted strictly – meaning subcontract and other common commercial arrangements, even where the domestic transport supplier is a wholly owned subsidiary of the international transport supplier, have been outside the scope of the zero-rating rule. This has meant that 26 domestic transport suppliers have been required to impose 15% on the domestic transport service. There are circumstances where 15% GST has been charged and the international transporter is unable to claim back the GST charged to them. The current rules have also led to non-compliance within the goods transportation industry. Officials understand that many goods transporters are incorrectly zero-rating their domestic transport services – either due to a lack of understanding of the requirements or intentionally due to significant commercial pressure in order to remain competitive in the marketplace. Voluntary compliance can result in tax cascades Where a domestic transporter has chosen to adhere to the current rules, it is possible that the primary transporter is not registered for GST in New Zealand, resulting in the undesirable outcome of tax cascades – where the GST is absorbed by the business as a cost and consequently becomes embedded in the price charged for the international transport of goods (instead of being separated out on the invoice and claimable), and ultimately embedded in the price of the goods being transported. While the effect of tax cascades could be avoided if the non- resident chose to register for GST in New Zealand, many chose not to do so, due to compliance costs and other commercial reasons. Consequently, the unregistered transporters are unable to claim a refund on the GST incurred. In many situations, the GST is either an unrecoverable GST cost for the unregistered transport business, or the domestic transporter erroneously does not charge GST for their service. Detailed analysis Removal of “to the extent that the services are supplied by the same supplier” The proposed amendment to section 11A(1)(c) would result in subcontracting arrangements and other common commercial arrangements being in-scope of the zero-rating rule. This means all domestic transport services supplied to a primary transport supplier contracted to transport goods to or from New Zealand would be zero-rated, regardless of whether the transporter is one and the same and regardless of the residency of the primary transport supplier. The proposed zero-rating rule applies regardless of the residency of the primary transport supplier. Goods transported into New Zealand Consistent with the existing policy intent of section 11A(1)(a), it is proposed that if the international transport supplier is contracted to deliver goods from point A outside New Zealand to point B in New Zealand, then the transporter can zero-rate the entire supply. Any domestic transport services contractually supplied to the international primary transport supplier to move goods within New Zealand, in order to fulfil the whole transport service to the customer, would also be zero-rated. 27 Example 8: Goods being transported from a place in New Zealand to a place outside New Zealand Scotty’s Shipping is contracted by a customer to transport goods from Thorndon, Wellington to New York City. Scotty’s Shipping subcontracts Lucy’s e-Lorries, a domestic all-electric trucking company based in Wellington, to transport the goods from Thorndon to Auckland. From Auckland, Scotty’s Shipping then transports the goods to New York City. Under the proposed rules, Lucy’s e-Lorries would zero-rate (charge 0% GST) on the supply to Scotty’s Shipping. While the supply of the domestic transport services by Lucy’s e-Lorries is between one point in New Zealand to another point in New Zealand, the service is actually being supplied to Scotty’s Shipping as part of the supply of transport services whose end destination is outside New Zealand. Goods transported out of New Zealand Likewise, if the international primary transport supplier is contracted to transport goods from point A in New Zealand to point B outside New Zealand, then they can zero-rate this entire supply. Any domestic transport services contractually supplied to the international transport supplier between point A and point B would also be zero-rated. Example 9: Goods being transported from a place outside New Zealand to a place in New Zealand WILL-Transport, an international transport supplier of luxury vehicles, is contracted by a customer to transport their German-made vehicle from Huddersfield England, to Oamaru New Zealand. WILL- Transport transports the vehicle from England to Auckland and subcontracts Auto Bens Couriers (ABC) to provide the domestic transport service between Auckland and Wellington. Under the current rules, ABC must charge 15% GST on its supply to WILL-Transport. This is because WILL-Transport and ABC are different entities. Under the proposed rules ABC would zero-rate (charge 0% GST) its supply of domestic transport services as the supply is part of the supply of transporting goods outside New Zealand and the supply is being provided to the primary transport supplier. Evidence to determine the origin or destination of the goods To support the GST treatment of a particular supply of transport services and whether a particular good is being exported/imported as part of an international transport service, taxpayers and transporters should rely on existing documentation that usually accompanies a particular shipment. This includes intermodal freight transport, such as Bill of lading (shipping lines) or Airway Bills (airlines), or other relevant transport documents including “track and trace” and other digital-based shipping documentation tools. Many of these documents are required for Customs purposes. Given the widespread use of “track and trace” and other digital-based shipping documentation tools, it should make it relatively straightforward to identify shipments that are intended for international transportation. 29 Other policy items 31 COVID-19 INFORMATION SHARING – REMOVAL OF TIME LIMIT (Clause 173(1)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed change would remove the current time limit on schedule 7, clause 23B of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which enables information sharing between government agencies for COVID-19 related initiatives. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the date of enactment. Background Schedule 7, clause 23B enables information sharing between government agencies for COVID-19 purposes and includes a sunset clause, meaning it ceases to be in effect once 24 months have passed from the date of the clause commencing. This time limit can be extended by an Order in Council, which must be made before the expiry of the 24-month period. The proposed change would remove the time limit from schedule 7, clause 23B, meaning it would remain in effect without the need for repeat extension using an Order in Council. This would future proof these powers, ensuring agencies can share needed information throughout the entire life cycle of the pandemic and the initiatives that support New Zealand’s recovery. Having an open-ended time limit on these provisions would not remove current limitations on information sharing. They would continue to be tied specifically to the delivery and administration of relevant COVID-19 related initiatives. The provision would therefore inherently self-limiting in the powers it provides. 32 OFFENCES RELATING TO ELECTRONIC SALES SUPPRESSION (Clauses 160–162, and 165) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments would introduce a penalty regime intended to prevent the spread of electronic sales suppression tools within the New Zealand tax base. They would establish a criminal penalty for the manufacture or distribution of suppression tools and criminal and civil penalties for the acquisition or possession of suppression tools. All section references in this section are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). Application date The proposed amendments would apply from the date of enactment. Key features The features of the proposed amendments are: • Proposed section 143BB would establish a criminal penalty for the manufacture or supply of a suppression tool. A person convicted of an offence under the proposed penalty would be liable to a fine of up to $250,000. • Proposed section 143BC would establish a criminal penalty for the acquisition or possession of a suppression tool. A person convicted of an offence under the proposed penalty would be liable to a fine of up to $50,000. • Proposed section 141EE would establish a civil penalty of $5,000 for the acquisition or possession of a suppression tool. • Proposed section 141FB(6) would remove the fifty percent prior behaviour reduction of shortfall penalties for evasion where the use of a suppression tool contributed to that evasion. • Proposed section 141GB would provide a voluntary disclosure reduction in the civil penalty similar to that which already exists for shortfall penalties under section 141G. Background Electronic sales suppression tools are software programs, devices, or other tools that systematically alter point-of-sale data collected by a business to understate or completely conceal revenues, which facilitates tax evasion. These tools can work in a variety of ways, targeting the integrity of transactions, software, internal memory, external filing, or reporting to delete, change, or simply not record select sales data and transactions. Unlike a number of other jurisdictions including Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada, electronic sales suppression is not currently specifically considered in New Zealand law. While using a suppression tool constitutes tax evasion and can be penalised under existing anti-evasion provisions, it is not currently illegal to manufacture, sell, buy, or possess such tools. The spread of electronic sales suppression poses risks to the integrity of the tax system, 33 as suppressing sales data allows businesses to more easily evade their income tax and GST obligations. Preventing the spread of suppression tools is therefore vital to maintaining the integrity of the tax base. The proposed new penalties would allow Inland Revenue to specifically target suppliers and taxpayers possessing suppression tools, which is likely to be a more efficient means of preventing the spread of the tools than solely prosecuting end-users under existing evasion penalties. The desired outcome is that taxpayers are deterred from adopting the tools, which helps maintain the integrity of the tax base. Detailed analysis Definitions Two amendments are proposed to section 3, which defines terms used elsewhere in the TAA. The first proposed amendment would introduce a definition of an electronic sales suppression tool. Electronic sales suppression tools would include a software program, device, or other thing, part of a thing, or combination of things or parts. The proposed definition is written broadly and intended to encompass both physical and digital tools. To be an electronic sales suppression tool, a tool would need to meet two criteria: • it must be able to modify, falsify, destroy, or prevent the creation of a record created by an electronic point of sale system that a person is required to keep under a tax law, and • the use of the tool would lead to a reasonable conclusion that one of its principal functions is to facilitate the modification, falsification, destruction, or prevention of such a record. The proposed criteria are intended to avoid the issues inherent to using a highly specific definition of a suppression tool (for example, accidentally capturing software that modifies sales data for legitimate reasons, such as correcting input errors or training staff). This would allow for the targeting of tools intended for the purposes of sales suppression while avoiding similar tools that are not used for malicious purposes. The proposed definition is closely modelled on a similar definition used in Australia. 1 The second proposed amendment would add the sales suppression penalty to the definition of a civil penalty. New penalties relating to suppression tools (proposed sections 143BB, 143BC, 141EE) The proposed amendments would add three new sections to the TAA, to provide penalties targeting the manufacture, provision, acquisition, or possession of suppression tools. Proposed new section 143BB provides for a criminal penalty targeting the manufacture or provision of suppression tools, while proposed new section 143BC provides for a criminal penalty targeting the acquisition or possession of such tools. Proposed new section 141EE also provides a civil penalty for acquisition or possession. 1 Refer to the definition of an electronic sales suppression tool in section 8WAB of the Taxation Administration Act 1953. 34 Criminal penalty for manufacture or provision of suppression tools (section 143BB) Proposed new section 143BB would establish a criminal penalty for either of these two acts: • Manufacturing, developing, or publishing a suppression tool. The penalty would apply where the tool is provided to a New Zealand resident who is liable for a sales suppression penalty or an intermediary who ultimately provides it to a New Zealand resident (subsection (1)). • Knowingly supplying, making available for use, or otherwise providing a suppression tool to a person resident in New Zealand, including a right to use a tool or a service including the use of a tool (subsection (2)). The proposed penalty for committing these offences would be a fine up to a maximum of $250,000 (subsection (3)). As this is a criminal penalty, the size of an individual fine would be determined by a court allowing for variation based on a taxpayer’s circumstances. Criminal penalty for acquisition or possession of suppression tools (section 143BC) Proposed new section 143BC would establish a criminal penalty for taxpayers required to keep records under a tax law who knowingly acquire or possess a suppression tool with the purpose of using it to evade the assessment or payment of tax (subsection (1)). The proposed penalty for committing this offence would be a fine of up to a maximum of $50,000 (subsection (3)). As with the proposed penalty for manufacture or provision in new section 143BB, and for similar reasons, the size of an individual fine would be determined by a court. Proposed subsection (4) provides that a taxpayer who possesses the tool for multiple periods commits a single offence and therefore would only be liable for a single penalty, for all tax types and periods, from when the tool was acquired until the penalty is imposed. This subsection would also allow for the proposed penalty to be imposed again if the taxpayer continues to possess the tool after the first penalty was applied. Proposed subsection (2) provides that the penalty would not apply to taxpayers who acquire a business whose operations include the use of a suppression tool, where the taxpayer could not reasonably have known of the tool’s existence and has not used the tool. This is intended to ensure, for the avoidance of doubt, that taxpayers who accidentally acquire a tool in this way are not penalised for this unintentional acquisition. As subsection (1) states an offence is only committed when the person has a purpose of evading the assessment or payment of tax, subsection (5) would strengthen this provision by treating the person as meeting the purpose test in subsection (1)(c) if they have used the tool to evade the assessment or payment of tax. A person who has acquired or possesses the tool but has not used it to evade the assessment or payment of tax could still have committed an offence if they had a purpose of doing so. Civil penalty for acquisition or possession of suppression tools (section 141EE) Proposed new section 141EE would establish a civil penalty for taxpayers who acquire or possess a suppression tool with the purpose of using it to evade the assessment or payment of tax (defined in subsection (1)), and includes an exception for taxpayers who acquire a tool unwittingly through acquiring a business that includes a tool (subsection (2)). The proposed 35 subsections are intended to operate identically to the corresponding parts of proposed section 143BC. Proposed subsection (3) would set the penalty amount at $5,000. This smaller civil penalty would allow Inland Revenue discretion to prosecute major offenders using criminal penalties, while applying the civil penalty against smaller offenders (potentially in addition to existing civil evasion shortfall penalties). The proposed approach is based on the operational experience of the Australian Taxation Office, which has noted that users of suppression tools can be very high in number and the cost-effective approach to these users is to levy civil penalties against them, rather than having to take them individually through the courts, to impose criminal penalties. Consistent with proposed section 143BB(4), proposed section 141EE(4) would also prescribe that the penalty can only be imposed once for all tax types and periods, after which a further penalty may be imposed for continued possession of the tool. Previous behaviour penalty reduction amendment (section 141FB) Section 141FB of the TAA provides for a fifty percent reduction for tax shortfall penalties imposed under various other sections of the TAA where the taxpayer has no prior history of incurring relevant shortfall penalties. This is intended to provide leniency in situations where a taxpayer has no prior history of non-compliance. However, evasion involving a suppression tool requires the taxpayer to acquire the tool (itself a premeditated act of non- compliance) and therefore establishes a history of intended non-compliance. An amendment is proposed to section 141FB, adding new subsection (6). This proposed subsection would disable the fifty percent shortfall penalty reduction when a taxpayer is liable for a shortfall penalty for evasion or a similar act where an electronic sales suppression penalty has been imposed on the taxpayer under section 141EE and the use of the suppression tool contributed to the evasion or similar act. Voluntary disclosures (proposed section 141GB) Section 141G of the TAA allows for reductions in the amount of certain shortfall penalties for which a taxpayer is liable if the Commissioner deems that the taxpayer has made a full voluntarily disclosure of the shortfall. However, section 141G cannot easily be applied to a penalty under section 141EE, as a voluntary disclosure must include full details of the tax shortfall and an electronic sales suppression penalty does not, in itself, arise from a tax shortfall. Instead, the proposed amendment mirrors many of the concepts from existing section 141G in proposed new section 141GB. This section refers to “disclosures” rather than “voluntary disclosures” to provide separation from the use of that term in section 141G and confirm that it is not necessary to provide details of a tax shortfall to satisfy proposed section 141GB; although any tax shortfall would still be required to be disclosed if the disclosure is to satisfy section 141G. As with section 141G, a disclosure of possession of an electronic sales suppression tool can be either pre-notification (where the disclosure was made before the taxpayer was notified of a pending audit or investigation) or post-notification (where it was made after the taxpayer was notified of the audit or investigation). The level of reduction for a pre-notification disclosure is one hundred percent compared to forty percent for a post-notification disclosure. 36 LOCAL AUTHORITY TAXATION – DIVIDENDS AND DEDUCTIONS (Clauses 54, 55, 58–60, 62, 63, 83, 91, 108, 109, and 116) Summary of proposed amendments These proposed amendments would improve the integrity of local government taxation: • Treat dividends derived by a local authority from a wholly-owned council-controlled organisation (CCO), port company and energy company as exempt income. • Local authorities would no longer be allowed a deduction for charitable or other public benefit gifts made to donee organisations. • Ensure that a local authority’s deductions for finance costs (including finance costs relating to financial derivatives such as interest rate hedges) would be limited to finance costs incurred: − on loans made to a council-controlled trading organisation 2 ( CCTO) − on borrowings to acquire shares in a group company that is a CCTO, and − on base price adjustments for financial arrangements involving CCTOs. • Local authorities would no longer be permitted to convert unused imputation credits to a tax loss. • Ensure that a credit would not arise to a consolidated group’s imputation credit account (ICA) for imputation credits attached to a dividend derived by a local authority. Application date The proposed amendments would apply for the 2022–23 and later income years, except for one maintenance change (clause 62) which would apply from the date of enactment. Key features Dividends Inter-corporate dividends paid between New Zealand resident companies are tax exempt where there is 100% common ownership. Dividends paid to the Crown from State enterprises, and to charities from their wholly-owned companies, are similarly tax-exempt. The proposed amendment would provide consistency with these exemptions by treating dividends derived by a local authority from a wholly-owned CCO as exempt income. Deductions Current law allows local authorities tax deductions for some expenditure not incurred in deriving assessable income (such as corporate gift deductions and certain finance costs). 2 A council-controlled trading organisation (CCTO) is a CCO that operates a trading undertaking for the purpose of making a profit. 37 These deductions result in local authorities having tax losses despite being largely exempt from tax. These losses can be used under the loss grouping rules to reduce the taxable income of group companies (companies in which a local authority has at least 66% ownership). Corporate deductions for a charitable or other public benefit gift The proposed amendment would prevent a local authority accessing the corporate deduction for a charitable or other public benefit gift. Data shows that local authorities have been consistently the largest group of companies that have used this deduction, despite their substantively tax-exempt status. Finance costs The proposed amendments would limit deductions for finance costs. Finance costs include interest expenses and deductions for financial arrangements that are not interest expenses. The proposed amendments would limit deductions of a local authority for finance costs to the following situations: • interest incurred on money borrowed that is on-lent to a CCTO • interest incurred on money borrowed to capitalise a group company that is a CCTO, and • a negative base price adjustment for financial arrangements involving CCTOs. Imputation credits attached to dividends received A person is entitled to an imputation credit only if the credit is included in their assessable income. A consequence of the proposed amendment to exempt dividends derived by a local authority from wholly-owned CCOs is that the local authority would no longer receive a tax credit for imputation credits attached to dividends from a wholly-owned CCO. The proposed amendments mean that a local authority would not be permitted to convert any unused imputation credits to a tax loss. Imputation credit accounts The proposed amendment means that a local authority that is a member of a consolidated group would not be able to make a credit entry to the group’s imputation credit account (ICA) for dividends received from a group member. This proposed change is consistent with the legislative settings for a local authority not being allowed to maintain an ICA on its own account. Background The current tax policy settings for local authorities stem from local government reforms of the late 1980s. Broadly speaking, since these reforms the tax settings for local authorities have been as follows: • A local authority is generally tax-exempt on its income (primarily rates) derived from its core services (for example, parking fees). • However, a local authority is taxable on all income (for example, rent, management fees and dividends) derived from a CCO, an energy company or a port company (trading subsidiaries of a local authority). A CCO itself is taxable. 38 The proposal to treat dividends derived by a local authority from a CCO as exempt income was supported by the local government sector in discussions with Inland Revenue officials in 2019. Officials also consulted with the local government sector in the first half of 2021 on the application of the loss grouping rules to local authorities. This consultation focused on improving the integrity of the tax system given the substantive exemption from income tax for income earned by local authorities. In this later consultation, feedback was sought on a broader proposal to deny loss grouping between a local authority and its CCOs. Submissions on this proposal considered that a local authority with tax losses should be entitled to offset any losses against the income of other taxable entities within their group. Some submissions indicated support for limiting deductions that gave rise to integrity concerns. Detailed analysis Dividends Under current law, the income of a local authority is exempt from income tax except for income earned from a CCO, a port company or an energy company. The purpose of taxing income derived by a local authority from these types of entities is to prevent profit shifting from these taxable entities to exempt local authorities. Without this provision, income from a CCO could be extracted tax-free by the local authority charging the CCO above-market rental or management fees, which would be deductible to the CCO but not taxable to the local authority due to its tax-exempt status. Taxing local authorities on dividends derived from their CCOs is inconsistent with similar entities, such as the Crown and State enterprises, or charities. Inter-corporate dividends paid between New Zealand resident companies are exempt where there is 100% common ownership. This exemption currently does not apply to dividends derived by local authorities from their CCOs. As a dividend is not a deductible expense of a CCO, there are no profit shifting concerns with treating the dividend as exempt income of the local authority. Under the proposed amendments, dividends paid by a wholly-owned subsidiary of a local authority that is a CCO, energy company, or a port company would be exempt income of the local authority. The proposed amendments would improve the coherence of the tax system by providing consistency with the rules exempting dividends paid within wholly owned groups, as a number of CCOs are wholly owned by one local authority. Deductions Broadly, under current law, a local authority is allowed deductions for any costs incurred to the extent they are incurred in deriving assessable income of the local authority (for example, management fees paid by CCOs to councils). This statutory test is often referred to as the nexus test. However, no deduction is allowed for costs incurred in providing core services, as these services are generally primarily funded from rates income and other exempt income streams. 39 However, current law allows local authorities certain deductions for expenditure without being required to meet the nexus test. Examples of deductions that are not required to meet the nexus test include the corporate gift deduction and certain deductions for finance costs. It has been identified that access to these deductions has allowed local authorities to have tax losses, despite being largely exempt from tax. These tax losses can be used under the grouping rules to reduce the taxable income of CCOs. Corporate gift deductions Changes to the application of the corporate gift deduction provision from the 2008–09 income year allowed companies a deduction for charitable donations to donee organisations, subject to the deduction not exceeding the company’s net income. It was not clear that specific consideration was given at the time to whether local authorities should have access to this provision. As current law treats a local authority as a company, the corporate gift deduction is available to a local authority. The corporate gift deduction is intended to encourage companies to redirect part of their otherwise taxable income to charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes. The corporate gift deduction is not intended to be available for primarily exempt entities like local authorities. In particular, it is not intended to provide a tax subsidy for donations made by local authorities whose legislated purpose is to promote the social, economic, environmental, and cultural well-being of communities. Currently, local authorities can offset corporate gift deductions against dividend income from their CCOs. This results in imputation credits attached to those dividends being unused, which are then converted to a tax loss and used to reduce the taxable income of the local authority’s CCOs under the loss grouping rules. This arrangement can result in local authorities transferring the benefit of their exempt status to their taxable CCOs, contrary to the policy intent. The proposed amendments would also change the crossheading above section DB 41 from “Marketing” to “Corporate gifting” to represent the purpose of this section more accurately. Finance costs Under current settings, a local authority is allowed a deduction: • for interest expenses incurred on money that has been borrowed to derive assessable income • for interest expenses incurred on money borrowed to capitalise a subsidiary company • for finance costs relating to annual valuation movements on financial arrangements (for example, interest rate hedges). These finance costs are treated as an interest expense for income tax purposes, a nd • for finance costs arising under a wash-up calculation when a financial arrangement ends. This wash-up calculation is known as the base price adjustment (BPA). A statutory deduction arises if the BPA results in a negative amount. This statutory deduction is not required to meet the nexus test. Given the mainly exempt status of a local authority, the proposed amendments would clarify: 40 • the extent to which a deduction for interest expenses would be allowed for a local authority, and • the extent to which the statutory deduction for the BPA would be an allowable deduction of a local authority. Examples 10–13 illustrate how the proposed amendments would apply. Example 10: Interest incurred on money borrowed and on-lent to a CCTO The Drury District Council borrows $50 million and on-lends $30 million (60% of the $50 million loan) to its CCTO (Drury Trading Company). The loan is for a fixed term and bears interest at 3% a year and there is no margin charged to the CCTO. The annual interest cost for Drury District Council is $1.5 million. The proposed amendment would limit the interest deduction for Drury District Council to $900,000 (that is, 60% of the total $1.5 million interest cost). The balance of the interest incurred by the Drury District Council would be non-deductible. Example 11: Interest incurred on money borrowed to acquire shares in a group company The Drury District Council borrows $10 million for a fixed term at 3.5% a year. This loan is made to acquire shares in a new wholly owned company, Drury Administration Limited. This new company is a CCO but is not a CCTO. The proposed amendment would deny a deduction for interest incurred by the Drury District Council on this loan because the group company (a CCO) is not a CCTO. Example 12: Annual finance costs for valuation change for financial arrangements The Drury District Council borrows $48 million for a fixed term at 3.5% a year (floating rate). The Drury District Council enters into an interest rate hedge. The movements in the value of this hedge can result in a finance cost, which is treated as interest. None of this loan is on-lent to the Drury District Council’s CCTOs. The proposed amendment would deny a deduction for interest incurred by the Drury District Council on this loan because the money is not on-lent to a CCTO and the interest rate hedge does not relate to a CCTO. Example 13: Finance costs arising from a BPA calculation The Drury District Council borrows $60 million for a fixed term at 3.3% a year (floating rate). Of this amount, $40 million (two-thirds of the $60 million loan) is on-lent to the Drury Trading Company (a CCTO). The Drury District Council enters into an interest rate hedge for the entire loan. At the expiry of the hedge, the BPA calculation results in a negative amount of $100,000. The proposed amendment would allow a deduction for two-thirds of $100,000 as this proportion of the hedge relates to on-lending to a CCTO. Imputation credits attached to dividends Currently, a local authority is taxed on dividends derived from a CCO, a port company or an energy company. These dividends are generally received with maximum imputation credits attached. Current tax rules allow some local authorities to satisfy their income tax liabilities on dividends without using the full amount of imputation credits attached to those dividends (for example, by using corporate gift deductions). This results in the local authority having excess imputation credits. The local authority can then convert the excess imputation credits 41 to a tax loss and offset the tax loss against the net income of its CCOs. This allows the local authority to shelter its CCOs from tax. Converting imputation credits to a tax loss was part of the original design of the imputation system, as unused imputation credits are not refundable to the shareholder. The policy for converting unused imputation credits to a tax loss was to provide a mechanism for taxpayers in tax loss to carry forward the benefit of unused imputation credits to satisfy future income tax liabilities. It was not intended that an exempt shareholder would be able to convert unused imputation credits to a tax loss. As the proposed amendments would include treating dividends from wholly-owned CCOs as exempt income, any imputation credits attached to such dividends would not give rise to a tax credit for the local authority. However, local authorities may continue to derive dividends from CCOs that are not wholly owned. Imputation credits attached to these dividends can still give rise to the integrity concerns set out above if they can be converted to a tax loss. To address this integrity concern, the proposed amendments provide that local authorities would no longer be able to convert any unused imputation credits to a tax loss. Imputation credit accounts A local authority is not allowed to maintain an imputation credit account (ICA). 3 However, local authorities in consolidated tax groups can credit to the group’s ICA imputation credits attached to dividends it derives from a CCO. These credits are then available for use by CCOs within the group. The proposed amendments would mean that a local authority that is part of a consolidated group would not be able to make such credit entries to the group’s ICA. This proposal would ensure that all local authorities are treated similarly for imputation credit purposes. 3 Section OB 1(2)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007. 42 FAIR DIVIDEND RATE FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGES (Clauses 71–78) Summary of proposed amendment Many investors who invest offshore enter into foreign currency hedges to protect themselves from fluctuations in the value of their offshore assets caused by exchange rate movements. Differences in the tax treatment of the underlying assets and these foreign currency hedges can create a tax mismatch. This mismatch in treatment means that a hedge that is effective in removing the impact of unexpected currency fluctuations before tax ceases to be effective after tax. The rules for hedging of foreign currency movement in Australian non-attributing shares and attributing FDR method interests (FDR FX hedges rules) were introduced from the beginning of the 2013–14 income year with the policy intent of eliminating this tax mismatch. The rules are optional and broadly allow a taxpayer to calculate tax on a foreign currency hedge on the same basis as the hedged offshore asset – thereby removing the tax mismatch. There has been limited application of the FDR FX hedges rules by taxpayers since their introduction. This is because certain requirements in the rules imposing burdensome compliance costs for taxpayers with large numbers of hedges. Therefore, effective after-tax foreign currency hedging remains an ongoing issue for some taxpayers. The proposed technical amendments to the FDR FX hedges rules would address this issue. The proposed amendments would improve their functionality from a practical perspective and reduce compliance costs for investors with large numbers of hedges. Application date The proposed amendments would apply from 1 April 2022. Key features The proposed amendments would: • Modify the second formula for determining the extent to which foreign currency hedges can be subject to FDR treatment (known as FDR hedge portions). • Introduce a de minimis threshold for non-eligible assets to ensure that immaterial foreign cash balances temporarily held do not reduce FDR hedge portions. • Introduce an optional new method (known as the portfolio method) for determining FDR hedge portions to allow taxpayers with significant hedging activity to apply the rules from a practical perspective. • Allow eligible hedges to have no NZD leg subject to certain requirements. • Introduce an optional look-through rule to allow taxpayers who hedge indirectly owned eligible assets to apply the rules. 43 • Allow eligible hedges to continue to be subject to FDR treatment when there is a transfer of ownership of the assets of a fund or investor class. Proposed remedial and technical amendments would also: • Specify how the methods for determining FDR hedge portions apply to a hedge of hedge. • Specify how the formula for calculating FDR income from eligible hedges is applied to hedges entered and settled within a valuation period. • Clarify that all other income or expenditure arising from eligible hedges, besides the FDR amount, is exempt to the extent that FDR treatment applies. • Amend the definition of non-eligible assets to exclude eligible hedges, and New Zealand securities listed on foreign exchanges and denominated in foreign currencies to the extent that no foreign currency hedges have been entered to hedge these assets. Background Foreign currency hedges When a person invests into an offshore asset, changes in the exchange rate can affect the value of the person’s investment when it is converted back to New Zealand dollars (NZD). Therefore, many people who invest offshore enter into arrangements to protect themselves from exchange rate changes. These arrangements are referred to as foreign currency hedges. The idea is that changes in the hedge’s value due to movements in the exchange rate offset changes in the value of the underlying foreign assets due to those same exchange rate movements. Tax mismatch A tax mismatch arises when a person hedges an investment taxed under the fair dividend rate (FDR) method. This is because, under the FDR method, changes in an asset’s value are not taxed. Instead, FDR assets are taxed on a deemed dividend return of five percent of the asset’s market value at the start of the period. Conversely, changes in a hedge’s value are fully taxed under the financial arrangements rules. This mismatch in tax treatment means that a hedge that is effective in removing the impact of unexpected currency fluctuations before tax ceases to be effective after tax. While taxpayers can attempt to hedge effectively on an after-tax basis, this is often not practical, especially when the taxpayer is taxed based on investors’ marginal rates (for example, portfolio investment entities (PIEs) which are prevalent in the managed fund industry). It also increases the hedging transaction costs for an investor. FDR FX hedges rules The FDR FX hedges rules were introduced in 2013 with the policy intent of eliminating this mismatch in the tax treatment of foreign currency hedges and hedged offshore assets. The rules are optional and allow a taxpayer to calculate tax on a foreign currency hedge on the same basis as the hedged offshore asset – by imputing taxable income of five percent of a hedge’s opening market value. 44 The FDR FX hedges rules were designed to ensure that FDR treatment was not available for speculative instruments or hedges of non-eligible assets, and also to prevent manipulation. These risks were addressed by including appropriate restrictions in the regime. However, these restrictions impose burdensome compliance costs on taxpayers with large numbers of hedges which have resulted in the rules being impractical to apply. Therefore, effective after- tax foreign currency hedging remains an ongoing issue for some taxpayers. Detailed analysis Proposed technical amendments to the FDR FX hedges rules would reduce compliance costs and improve the functionality of the rules from a practical perspective. The specific issues with the rules and the proposed amendments are detailed below. Modification to second hedge-by-hedge formula for calculating FDR hedge portions (clause 74(1), (8) and (10)) The FDR FX hedges rules currently include two alternative formulae to determine the maximum fair dividend rate hedge portion (FDR hedge portion) on a hedge-by-hedge basis that a taxpayer can choose from. These formulae ensure that the amount of a taxpayer’s eligible hedges that can be subject to FDR treatment does not exceed the value of their hedged eligible assets. However, the application of the second formula in current sections EM 5(6)–EM 5(10) always results in an FDR hedge portion of less than a 100% when a taxpayer holds non- eligible assets, even when those non-eligible assets are already fully hedged. Example 14: Fagan On 2 August 202x, Fagan Asset Management Fund (Fagan) has a portfolio of: • US$55,000 of shares in US-based companies (eligible assets, worth NZ$70,000) • US$20,000 of US bonds (non-eligible assets, worth NZ$30,000) • A hedge of USD to NZD with a foreign amount hedged of US$20,000 (equivalent to NZ$30,000). This hedge has an FDR hedge portion of zero. On 2 August 202x, Fagan enters into an eligible hedge for US dollars with a foreign amount hedged of US$55,000 (equivalent to NZ$70,000). Applying the current second hedge-by-hedge formula to this hedge results in a maximum FDR hedge portion of the lower of the following two formula: First formula 1 – NZ$30,000 NZ$100,000 = 70% Second formula ( 1.05 × NZ$70,000 − 0 ) NZ$70,000 = 105% This means that the maximum FDR hedge portion that can be applied to the hedge of US$55,000 is 70% even though Fagan’s non-eligible assets are already fully hedged by the hedge on hand of US$20,000. To address this issue, the proposed amendment would modify the second hedge-by-hedge formula for calculating FDR hedge portions to ensure its application does not always result in an FDR hedge portion of less than 100% when a taxpayer’s non-eligible assets are already fully hedged. The proposed new formula can be broken down into three steps. 45 The first step would be to calculate the apportioned current hedge amount. The purpose of this step would be to allocate a hedge to non-eligible assets first which is the policy intention of the second formula. The apportioned current hedge amount would be one of the following amounts: • If the calculation hedge is not a hedge of a hedge, 4 or is a hedge of a hedge and the second bullet point below does not apply, the amount is the lesser of the following amounts: − the amount of foreign currency hedged by the calculation hedge, and − the amount of foreign currency that is hedged by a person’s hedges including the calculation hedge less the amount of foreign currency that is hedged by a person’s FDR hedge portions excluding the calculation hedge less the total market value of a person’s non-eligible assets, treating a negative result as zero. • The negative of the amount of foreign currency that is hedged by a person’s FDR hedge portions excluding the calculation hedge, if: − the calculation hedge is a hedge of a hedge, and − the amount of foreign currency that is hedged by a person’s FDR hedge portions excluding the calculation hedge plus the calculation hedge equals less than zero. If the apportioned current hedge amount is zero, the FDR hedge portion would be zero and no further action would be required. The second step would be to calculate the FDR gross amount. This is the portion of the apportioned current hedge amount that hedges eligible assets and is therefore eligible for FDR treatment. The FDR gross amount would be the lesser of 1 and the amount resulting from the following formula: ( 1.05 × eligible currency assets−FDR hedges amount ) apportioned current hedge amount Where: • Eligible currency assets would be the total market value of a person’s eligible assets owned directly and, if the person chooses and is a qualifying hedge fund (described below), their interest in the eligible assets that are owned by a multi-rate PIE in which the person invests, converted to NZD. • FDR hedges amount would be the amount of foreign currency hedged by a person’s fair dividend rate hedge portions but excluding the portion for the calculation hedge. • Apportioned current hedge amount would be the amount calculated for the first step. If the denominator is zero, the formula result should be treated as zero. 4 A hedge of a hedge is a hedge that effectively cancels out another hedge of a foreign currency to NZD. 46 The third step would be to convert the FDR gross amount into a portion of the calculation hedge by applying the following formula: FDR gross amount × ( apportioned current hedge amount calculation hedge amount ) Where: • FDR gross amount would be the amount calculated for the second step. • Apportioned current hedge amount would be the amount calculated for the first step. • Calculation hedge amount would be the amount of foreign currency that is hedged by the current hedge. The result of this step, expressed as a percentage, would be the maximum fair dividend rate hedge portion for a person’s hedge. Example 15 In this example, the modified second formula is applied to the hedge entered on 2 August 202x by Fagan in example 14. First step The apportioned current hedge amount is $70,000 as it equals the lesser of: • the amount of foreign currency hedged by the calculation hedge (NZ$70,000), and • the amount of foreign currency that is hedged (including by the calculation hedge) less the amount of foreign currency that is hedged by a person’s FDR hedge portions excluding the calculation hedge less the total market value of a person’s non-eligible assets (NZ$100,000 – NZ$0 – NZ$30,000 = $70,000). Second step lesser of 1 and ( 1.05 × NZ$70,000 − 0 ) NZ$70,000 = 1.05 Third step 1 × NZ$70,000 NZ$70,000 = 100% This means that the maximum FDR hedge portion that can be applied to the hedge of US$55,000 is 100%. De minimis threshold for non-eligible assets (clause 78(1)) In some cases, a taxpayer’s non-eligible assets will only consist of small cash balances held for liquidity purposes, and cash in relation to outstanding settlements of eligible assets and dividends derived from eligible assets. These balances often equate to an immaterial amount and are only on hand for a short period of time before being distributed to investors or reinvested. From a policy perspective, it would not be unreasonable if these cash balances did not reduce the portion of an eligible hedge that can be subject to FDR treatment. To address this issue, the proposed amendment would introduce a de minimis threshold for non-eligible assets. The proposed de minimis threshold would be cash assets totalling less than five percent of the value of a taxpayer’s eligible assets. This de minimis threshold would have the effect of reducing the value of a taxpayer’s non-eligible assets by the relevant cash assets for the purposes of the rules. 47 Example 16 van der Clark Wealth Partners Fund (van der Clark) has a portfolio of: • US$100,000 of shares in US-based companies (eligible assets) • US$40,00 of US bonds (non-eligible assets) • US$5,000 of US cash (non-eligible assets) As a result of the 5% de minimis threshold for cash assets, the value of van der Clark’s non-eligible assets would be US$40,000 (being US$45,000 less US$5,000) for the purposes of the rules. Optional portfolio method for calculating FDR hedge portions (clauses 71(1), 73, 74(3), 75, and 77) The current formulae for determining FDR hedge portions must be applied at the time an eligible hedge is entered into, and the portion calculated is applied for the life of a hedge. Where taxpayers hold a significant number of hedges at any point in time and turnover hedges regularly, the requirement to apply the rules on a hedge-by-hedge basis can impose burdensome compliance costs which result in the rules being impractical to apply. To address this issue, the proposed amendment would introduce a new optional portfolio method for calculating FDR hedge portions for eligible hedges. This method would sit alongside the two existing formulae for calculating FDR hedge portions on a hedge-by- hedge basis, and taxpayers would have the option of selecting their preferred method (subject to eligibility criteria detailed below). The requirements under section EM 7 would not apply to taxpayers using the portfolio method. This is because FDR hedge portions for all eligible hedges would be reset at the start of every period. Eligibility criteria and elections Only taxpayers that are daily unit valuers for the purposes of section EX 53 would be able to elect to use the portfolio method. This election can be made at any time. However, once an election to use this method has been made, taxpayers would be required to apply the portfolio method to all existing eligible hedges on hand (regardless of whether they are subject to an existing hedge-by-hedge method) and any hedges entered into post-election for a minimum of four years. Period Taxpayers would be able to elect their own periodic basis for calculating FDR hedge portions, up to a maximum period of one month. However, taxpayers would not be allowed to alter the periodic basis for calculating FDR hedge portions for four years. Portfolio FDR hedge portion Under this method the FDR hedge portion would be calculated at the start of each period and applied to the entire portfolio of eligible hedges for that period. Where a taxpayer enters into a new eligible hedge within a period, the FDR hedge portion calculated for the portfolio at the start of the period would apply to that hedge until the end 48 of the period, at which point the FDR hedge portion calculated for the portfolio for the next period applies. Formulae The approach for calculating FDR hedge portions under this method would involve two formulae, with the portfolio FDR hedge potion being set at the lower of the two (unlike the existing hedge-by-hedge formulae which calculate the maximum). The first formula would be: 1− non-eligible assets portfolio hedges amount Where: • Non-eligible assets would be the total market value of a taxpayer’s foreign currency assets excluding eligible assets, de minimis cash assets, eligible hedges and certain New Zealand securities denominated in a foreign currency, converted to NZD. • Portfolio hedges amount would be the total amount of foreign currency that is hedged by a taxpayer’s hedges, converted to NZD. The second formula would be: 1. 05 × eligible currency assets portfolio hedges amount Where: • Eligible currency assets would be the market value of a taxpayer’s eligible assets owned directly and, if the taxpayer is a qualifying hedge fund (described below) and choses to, their interests in the eligible assets held by a multi rate PIE in which the taxpayer invests, converted to NZD. • Portfolio hedges amount would refer to the total amount of foreign currency that is hedged by a taxpayer’s hedges, converted to NZD. 49 Example 17 Gekko Investments Fund (Gekko) is a daily unit valuer who elects to use the portfolio method and chooses a periodic basis of one month. On 1 September 202x, Gekko holds: • £25,000 of shares in UK-based companies (eligible assets, worth NZ$50,000) • £10,000 of UK bonds (non-eligible assets, worth NZ$20,000) • Hedges of GBP to NZD with a foreign amount hedged of UK£30,000 (equivalent to NZ$60,000). Gekko’s FDR hedge portion for September 202x would be calculated as follows: First formula 1 − NZ$20,000 NZ$60,000 = 67% Second formula ( NZ$50,000 × 1.05 ) NZ$60,000 = 88% The FDR hedge portion for Gekko’s hedges for September 202x would be 67% (being the lower of the result of the two formulae). This FDR hedge portion would be applied to all hedges on hand at the start of the month as well as new hedges or hedges of hedges entered into within September 202x regardless of any changes in the holdings of eligible or non-eligible assets. On 1 October 202x, Gekko holds: • UK£15,000 of shares in UK-based companies (eligible assets, worth NZ$30,000) • UK£30,000 of UK bonds (non-eligible assets, worth NZ$60,000) • Hedges of GBP to NZD with a foreign amount hedged of £40,000 (equivalent to NZ$80,000). Gekko’s FDR hedge portion at the start of October 202x would be calculated as follows: First formula 1 – NZ$60,000 NZ$80,000 = 25% Second formula ( NZ$30,000 × 1.05 ) NZ$80,000 = 39% The portfolio hedge portion for Gekko for October 202x would be 25% (being the lower of the result of the two formulae). This portfolio FDR hedge portion would be applied to all hedges on hand at the start of the month as well as new hedges or hedges of hedges entered into within month two regardless of any changes in the holdings of eligible or non-eligible assets. Eligible hedge requirements – one leg in NZD (clause 72(1) and (2)) Eligible hedges are currently required to have one “leg” in NZD (that is, hedge one foreign currency back to NZD). Often taxpayers with large portfolios of hedges rebalance their hedging position of eligible assets denominated in two foreign currencies to NZD, by hedging one foreign currency to the other – that is, entering a hedge with no NZD leg. These hedges are entered into to eliminate foreign currency risk in relation to eligible assets but are currently not eligible for FDR treatment. The proposed amendments would allow eligible hedges to have no NZD leg provided these hedges are entered into to adjust the hedging position of existing hedges on hand that have one leg in NZD. 50 This proposed eligible hedge requirement would only be extended to taxpayers applying the second formula in the hedge-by-hedge method or the new portfolio method for calculating FDR hedge portions. This change would not apply when the first formula in the hedge-by- hedge method is used because amounts must be calculated in the calculation hedge’s foreign currency for the purposes of this formula, rather than converted to NZD, and this is not practical where a hedge has two legs in a foreign currency. Optional look-through rule (clauses 74(7), 74(10), 75 and 78) Taxpayers commonly invest into eligible assets indirectly through other funds and may hedge their foreign currency exposure in relation to these indirectly owned eligible assets. However, only directly owned eligible assets are treated as eligible assets for the purposes of the FDR FX hedges rules. The result is that hedges of indirectly held assets are not eligible for FDR treatment. To address this issue, the proposed amendments would introduce an optional look-through rule to allow certain funds to include their interest in eligible assets held by a multi-rate PIE in which they invest in their calculation of eligible assets. This look-through rule would only be available to a “qualifying hedge fund”, which is defined as a zero-rate investor in a multi-rate PIE if the multi-rate PIE attributes income from eligible assets to the zero-rate investor. In applying this new look-through rule, the qualifying hedge fund would need to determine the value of their interest in eligible assets held in the multi-rate PIE by reference to the proportion of the total units held in the PIE. The zero-rate investor would need to have access to sufficient information from the multi-rate PIE to choose to apply this optional rule and comply with the requirements. Transfer of eligible hedges (clauses 72(3), 73, 74(4), 74(6) and 74(10)) The application of the FDR FX hedges rules to eligible hedges that are transferred between funds or sub funds is currently unclear. This is because under section EM 3 an eligible hedge is required to have a fair value of zero when first entered into. Also, under section EM 4, an election to apply the rules must be made before a hedge is first entered into, and under section EM 5, FDR hedge portion calculations must be performed when a hedge is first entered into. The proposed amendments would address this issue by amending the definition of an eligible hedge to include a hedge that is entered into or acquired at its fair value. Elections for the rules to apply would also be allowed before a hedge is first entered into or acquired and FDR hedge portion calculations would be allowed to be performed when an eligible hedge is first entered into or acquired. Remedial amendments Hedge of a hedge (clauses 74(2), 74(4), 74(5), 74(9) and 74(10)) A hedge of a hedge is currently eligible for FDR treatment. 5 However, the methods for calculating FDR hedge portions do not work as intended when applied to a hedge of a hedge. 5 A hedge of a hedge is a hedge that effectively cancels out another hedge of a foreign currency to NZD. 51 The general policy principle is that the FDR method can be applied to eligible hedges that hedge a maximum of 105% of the currency risk for eligible assets. When the formulae in section EM 5 are applied to a hedge of a hedge however, the FDR hedge portion will be the amount that reduces the combined FDR hedge portions for all hedges, including the hedge of a hedge, to a minimum of 105%. From a policy perspective, the hedge of a hedge should be allowed to reduce the combined FDR hedge portions below 105%. Example 18: Dern On 2 August 202x, Dern Capital Solutions Fund (Dern) has a portfolio of: • £45,000 of shares in UK-based companies (eligible assets, worth NZ$90,000) • £5,000 of UK bonds (non-eligible assets, worth NZ$10,000) Dern currently has one foreign currency hedge for UK pounds with a foreign amount hedged of £50,000 (equivalent to NZ$100,000) and an FDR hedge portion of 90% (calculated under the first formula in the hedge-by-hedge method). Therefore, the total FDR hedge portions coverage of eligible assets is 100%. On 10 August 202x, the value of Dern’s UK shares drops to £40,000 (NZ$80,000). In order to adjust their foreign currency hedge exposure as result of this drop, Dern enters into a hedge of a hedge on 10 August 202x, for £5,000 (NZ$10,000). Applying the first formula in the hedge-by-hedge method, the maximum FDR hedge portion for this hedge of a hedge would be: 1.05 × ( £40,000 + £0 ) − ( £50,000 × 0.90 ) −£5,000 = 60% A maximum FDR hedge portion of 60% for the hedge of a hedge would result in the total FDR hedge portions coverage of eligible assets being a minimum of 105%. To address this issue, the proposed amendments would mean that the formulae in section EM 5 should identify the minimum FDR hedge portion rather than the maximum when applied to a hedge of a hedge, with a negative result treated as a minimum of 0%. Taxpayers could choose to apply an FDR hedge portion to the hedge of a hedge between the minimum identified in the formulae and 100%, provided their combined FDR hedge portions do not fall below zero. When applying the formulae for calculating FDR hedge portions to a hedge that is a hedge of a hedge, the hedge should be treated as a negative amount. Example 19 Assuming the same as for example 18, application of the first hedge-by-hedge method calculation would instead identify a minimum FDR hedge portion of 60% for the hedge of hedge for £5,000. This would result in the total FDR hedge portions coverage of eligible assets being a maximum of 105%. Hedges entered and settled within a valuation period (clause 76) Section EM 6 calculates the FDR income or expenditure from eligible hedges by reference to the hedges’ opening market value at the start of every valuation period. Eligible hedges entered into and settled within a valuation period do not have an opening market value and as a result are not subject to this calculation. The result being that any gain (or loss) on these hedges is not subject to either FDR treatment or the FA rules. The proposed changes to the formula in section EM 6 would address this by including the net gain or loss on eligible hedges entered and settled within the preceding valuation period. 52 The proposed new formula would be: ( FDR portions ′ value+푝푝푝푝푝푝푝푝푝푝푝푝 푔푔푔푔푝푝 푔푔−푝푝푝푝푝푝푝푝푝푝푝푝 푙푙푝푝푙푙푙푙 ) × 0. 05 × valuation period days in the year Where: • Period gain would be the net gain multiplied by the FDR hedge portion for relevant eligible hedges that are entered into and settled within the preceding valuation period. • Period loss would be the net loss multiplied by the FDR hedge portion for relevant eligible hedges that are entered into and settled within the preceding valuation period. Example 20 Sterling Cooper Fund has a one-month valuation period. Its hedging activity during March 202x is: • On 4 March 202x, it enters into an eligible hedge for US$100,000 (equivalent to NZ$140,000 at acquisition). This hedge has an FDR hedge portion of 50%. • On 15 March 202x, it enters into an eligible hedge for US$50,000 (equivalent to NZ$75,000 at acquisition). This hedge has an FDR hedge portion of 100%. • On 27 March 202x, the hedge for US$50,000 is settled. At settlement, US$50,000 is equivalent to NZ$70,000. • At the end of 31 March 202x, the hedge entered into on 4 March 202x is still on hand and US$100,000 is equivalent to NZ$125,000. There are no other hedges on hand. Applying the proposed amendment to the formula in section EM 6, Sterling Cooper’s FDR income from its eligible hedges on 1 April 202x would be: ( ( NZ$125,00 0 × 50%)) + 0 − NZ$5,000 ) × 0.05 × 31 365 = $244 Period gain is zero on 1 April 202x because there was no net gain on the hedge of US$50,000 that was entered and settled within the preceding valuation period. Period loss is NZ$5,000 on 1 April 202x because there was a net loss of $5,000 (being (NZ$70,000 − NZ$75,000) × the 100% FDR hedge portion) on the hedge of US$50,000 that was entered and settled within the preceding valuation period. Income or expenditure under other provisions (clauses 71(2) and 73) Under the FDR FX hedges rules no income or expenditure from eligible hedges arises under the FA rules to the extent to which the hedges are subject to FDR treatment. However, the rules do not explicitly state that no income or expenditure arises from eligible hedges under other provisions to the extent that FDR treatment applies. This opens the theoretical possibility of double tax or double deductions. The proposed amendments would explicitly clarify that no other income or expenditure arises from eligible hedges to the extent that FDR treatment applies. Definition of non-eligible assets (clauses 74(11) and 78(1)) The market value of foreign currency hedges is included within the current definition of non- eligible currency assets. The current definition of non-eligible assets also includes New Zealand securities listed on foreign exchanges that are denominated in foreign currencies. Although these assets are 53 denominated in a foreign currency, any hedges entered into in relation to them are not eligible for FDR treatment on the basis that these securities are naturally hedged back to NZD. In essence, they are more akin to NZD securities than foreign currency securities and therefore should not be within the definition of non-eligible assets – which is intended to identify foreign investments that are not subject to FDR treatment. Including these amounts in the definition of non-eligible assets has a distortionary effect on FDR hedge portion calculations, therefore proposed changes would exclude eligible foreign currency hedges from the definition of non-eligible assets, as well as New Zealand securities listed on foreign exchanges denominated in foreign currencies, to the extent that no foreign currency hedge has been entered into to hedge these assets, from the definition of non- eligible assets. 54 USE OF TAX POOLING TO SATISFY A BACKDATED TAX LIABILITY (Clause 125) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would enable taxpayers to use tax pooling to satisfy a liability arising from a voluntary disclosure where there is no existing assessment. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the date of enactment. Background Under current settings, tax pooling cannot be used where there is no existing assessment or quantified obligation. The only exception is certain voluntary disclosures for income tax and resident withholding tax (RWT) where no prior return was filed, and the return was provided as part of the voluntary disclosure. In these situations, use of tax pooling is subject to a Commissioner’s discretion measured against specific legislative criteria. In some circumstances, a taxpayer may have unintentionally not filed a tax return for a particular tax type and tax period. For example, a small business may be unaware that an employee benefit it provides is subject to fringe benefit tax and so does not provide a return. Tax pooling will be available where the new liability did not arise as a result of a choice by the person not to comply with the person’s obligations under the Inland Revenue Acts or as a result of a failure by the person to take reasonable care to comply with those obligations. Key features Under the proposed amendment, a taxpayer would be able to use tax pooling, and thereby mitigate their exposure to UOMI, for voluntary declarations related to tax types other than RWT and income tax. The tax types that would be covered are tax paid or payable under the PAYE rules, ESCT rules, RSCT rules, NRWT rules, GST, FBT, income tax, further income tax, and imputation penalty tax. This change would also include these proposed measures to ensure that the integrity of the tax system is not undermined through the wilful non-filing of returns: • The taxpayer must make a voluntary disclosure to file the original return and generate an original assessment or obligation before Inland Revenue has made any contact with the taxpayer or their agent. • This would be available where the new liability did not arise as a result of a choice by the person not to comply with the person’s obligations under the Inland Revenue Acts or as a result of a failure by the person to take reasonable care to comply with those obligations. • The voluntary disclosure must be made within a reasonable time frame of the taxpayer or their agent becoming aware of the error, with “reasonable time frame" to be defined by guidance issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or by an Order in Council. 55 OVERSEAS DONEE STATUS – SECTION YZ 5 AND SCHEDULE 32 (Clauses 131 and 133) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) would add 11 charities to the list of donee organisations in schedule 32 of the ITA and remove others that have ceased to operate in New Zealand. Proposed changes would also update the name of a current organisation on the list and extend the donee status of NZ Memorial Museum Trust – Le Quesnoy. Application date These application dates would apply for the proposed changes: • The proposed amendments adding the eleven new additions to the schedule would apply from 1 April 2021 for donations made in the 2021–22 or later income years. The amendment extending the NZ Memorial Museum – Le Quesnoy’s overseas donee status would also apply from 1 April 2021. • The proposed removals would apply from the date of enactment. • The proposed maintenance change would apply from 4 May 2020. Key features The proposed amendments would: • Add 11 charitable organisations to schedule 32 of the ITA. Donors to these charities would be eligible for tax benefits on their donations. • Extend overseas donee status for the NZ Memorial Museum Trust – Le Quesnoy to 31 March 2025. • Remove nine organisations from the schedule. Inland Revenue records show these organisations have ceased operations and fundraising in New Zealand. A proposed maintenance change would update the reference to UN Women Aotearoa New Zealand Incorporated. Background Donors to organisations listed in schedule 32 are entitled as individual taxpayers, to a tax credit of 33⅓% of the monetary amount donated, up to the amount of their taxable income. Companies and Māori authorities may claim a deduction for donations up to the level of their net income. Charities that apply funds towards purposes that are mostly outside New Zealand must be listed in schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007 before donors become eligible for these tax benefits. 56 Detailed analysis Additions to the list of donee organisations The proposed 11 charitable organisations that would be added to schedule 32 are engaged in the following activities: Community Transformation Trust Community Transformation works in partnership with communities in developing countries to improve economic outcomes and the relief of poverty. It is currently supporting projects that improve water quality and land use in South Sulawesi, Indonesia, in partnership with Global Hope Network International. Firefly Children’s Home Charitable Trust Firefly Children’s Home operates in partnership with PA Nepal (Prisoners Assistance Nepal, a registered Nepali charity) and supports orphaned or abandoned children including the children of prisoners. Firefly’s purposes are directed towards relieving poverty and ensuring those in care receive adequate education and medical attention. Hadassah Medical Relief Association of New Zealand The Hadassah New Zealand Association provides financial support to Hadassah International, which operates several hospitals in Jerusalem. Hadassah International provides treatment to all people irrespective of race or religious views. Hadassah International also has an international relief focus within socio-economically deprived areas of the Middle East and carries out medical relief missions in Africa. It also provides international assistance by providing additional medical capacity in response to natural disasters. Hands Across the Water New Zealand Trust Hands Across the Water New Zealand Trust works in partnership with Hands Across the Water Australia to provide education and training opportunities for orphaned, abandoned, or homeless children in Thailand. It supports six homes in Thailand and has around 350 children in care. In addition to the care provided by the homes, Hands Across the Water provides tuition in English and supports former residents seeking higher education. Institute for Indian Mother and Child Aotearoa Charitable Trust The Institute for Indian Mother and Child Aotearoa provides sponsorship support to children under the care of the Institute for Indian Mother and Child, based in Kolkata, India. The Kolkata organisation mainly provides medical support to the poor and destitute; it has also built schooling facilities in the poorest villages to provide education for primary and secondary school-aged children. Medic to Medic Medic to Medic is a New Zealand sister charity to similarly named charities in the United Kingdom and the United States. The purpose of Medic to Medic is to increase medical and healthcare professional capacity in developing countries by providing scholarships to students at risk of dropping out of their training due to poverty. 57 Missio Benevolent Society Missio Benevolent Society is the humanitarian aid arm of the New Zealand office providing for the Pontifical Missions Society. Missio’s activities are directed toward the relief of poverty and advancing education in Oceania, Africa, Asia and South America. Prabh Aasra Trust Prabh Aasra Trust raises funds to support its Indian counterpart Prabh Aasra, which provides care and medical treatment to the homeless and destitute in North India. Reemi Charitable Trust Reemi Charitable Trust is a social enterprise whose activities are directed at alleviating period poverty in developing countries. It is currently active in Bangladesh and seeks to improve physical and mental health outcomes for women through education and supplying culturally appropriate products such as self-sterilising underwear and laundry bags. Talalelei Life Futures Fund Talalelei Life Futures Fund provides yearly scholarships to support academic high performers to obtain tertiary qualifications in Samoa. YWAM Ships Aotearoa Limited Using a specifically equipped medical aid ship, YWAM Ships Aotearoa undertakes health and education work in remote and isolated communities throughout the Pacific Islands, Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands. YWAM Ships provides a range of medical services to these communities including eye care, dental care, and immunisation and paediatrics. It also carries out developmental projects for those communities, such as water sanitation, to improve and maintain overall health outcomes. Removals from the list of donee organisations on schedule 32 As part of Inland Revenue’s stewardship of overseas donee status Inland Revenue has examined what information it has on record about the charities that have overseas donee status. This work is ongoing and complements New Zealand’s regulatory framework to prevent overseas financing of terrorism and extremism. The proposed changes would remove the following organisations from schedule 32: • Books for Cambodia • Channel 2 Cyclone Aid for Samoa • Cyclone Ofa Relief Fund • Cyclone Val Relief Fund • Kyrgyzstan New Zealand Rural Trust • L Women of Africa Fund • The Band Aid Box • The Serious Road Trip Charitable Trust • The Sir Walter Nash Vietnam Appeal 58 NZ Memorial Museum Trust – Le Quesnoy The New Zealand Memorial Museum Trust – Le Quesnoy was given donee status for a time- limited period with effect from 1 April 2018. The Trust’s donee status was to end during March 2022. The Trust’s purposes are to create a museum in Le Quesnoy, France, as a memorial to New Zealand’s participation in and contribution to the First World War. The museum proposes to be a place to provide information and learning resources to visitors about the service of New Zealanders during that conflict. Fundraising for the project, and wider commissioning activities relating to the museum site in France has been negatively affected by COVID-19. Recognising the impact of COVID-19 on the Trust, the Government has agreed to extend the Trust’s overseas donee status to 31 March 2025. Maintenance change – UN Women Aotearoa New Zealand Incorporated The UN Women National Committee Aotearoa New Zealand Incorporated was given overseas donee status with effect from 1 April 2019. The proposed maintenance change would update the reference to UN Women Aotearoa New Zealand Incorporated with effect from 4 May 2020, the date the organisation changed its name. 59 GST remedials 61 MODERNISING INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS FOR GST (Clauses 5(1), 9, 12, 19, 21(1) –(3) and 21(9)–(10), 24, 26–34, 36, 38–40, and 42–44) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments seek to reform the way in which the GST system interfaces with 21 st century business record-keeping without changing the process of accounting for GST for each taxable period. The proposed changes mainly relate to: • setting out relationships between the different parts of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) • supply information (including GST charged on the supply), which is described in two new terms supply information and taxable supply information (currently, this information is contained in the defined terms invoice and tax invoice) • how supply information is used to support input tax deductions • adjustment information, which is described in a new term supply correction information (currently required to be set out in a credit note or a debit note) • buyer-created invoices and shared processes, which will rely on taxable supply information • payment receipts, which are treated as taxable supply information, for example, for low value supplies not exceeding $200 • consequentially updating terminology in a number of information and recordkeeping provisions, and • providing consistency with the provision of information rules in subpart 2 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). The proposed amendments rationalise supply information provisions in the GST Act. The rationalisation is to allow supply information to be created and retained in business record- keeping systems rather than requiring the creation and retention of a statutorily prescribed document (for example, tax invoice, credit note, debit note). The proposed changes permit the form and manner of creating, providing and retaining supply information to be determined by registered persons, including GST groups and companies electing to use the supplier group provisions. The proposals are also consistent with e-invoicing initiatives and electronic recordkeeping. In addition, the proposed amendments would not disturb the processes for calculating and paying GST for each taxable period. This seamless transition arises because the nature of supply information required to support these processes remain unchanged. Only the form of recording, retaining and providing supply information is proposed to change. 62 Application date The proposed amendments would apply for taxable periods beginning on or after the date of enactment. Key features Supply information Proposed requirements Under proposed amendments the current provisions for tax invoices would be replaced with a list of information that supports the integrity of the GST system. The proposed amendments also would repeal the simplified tax invoice for taxable supplies having a value not exceeding $1,000. Otherwise, the list of supply information that would be retained by the supplier and provided to a registered recipient remains unchanged. This proposed list of information would be set out in two new proposed terms (supply information and the taxable supply information) neither of which would require the information to be provided or retained in any particular format in the same way as a tax invoice format is prescribed in current law. Other relevant new terms proposed are GST trade name and recipient details. The provision of information rules in the TAA will continue to apply to this information. A minor change to the current law for information requirements relates to the supplier’s obligation to provide supply information for a taxable supply to a registered recipient at the time of supply, only on request. The proposed amendments would require the supplier to provide a registered recipient with the taxable supply information, which is consistent with commercial practice. A copy of a taxable supply information can be obtained by a registered recipient if the original taxable supply information has been lost or become corrupted. An un-registered recipient who later becomes registered for GST, can ask for relevant supply information from the supplier (if information remains available). This ensures that supply information can be available to the recipient to support input tax deductions for secondhand goods. Proposed changes to the rules relating to supply information for GST groups and supplier groups would ensure consistency with these general changes. These proposed amendments are discussed later in a separate commentary item “GST groups”. Correcting supply information Currently a registered person may correct taxable supply information for a cancellation of a taxable supply, or an increase or decrease in the GST amount previously recorded. The amendments propose that a registered person may also correct other incorrect supply information previously recorded. This proposed list of information would be termed supply correction information. It is also proposed that it would no longer be necessary to have separate processes for credit or debit adjustments. 63 The proposed amendments would also allow other errors in taxable supply information to be corrected under this process. It is anticipated that the Commissioner will publish guidelines for this changed process. Copies of supply information If a copy of a taxable supply information or a supply correction information is requested, it would no longer be mandatory to require this information to be marked “copy only”. Buyer-created taxable supply information Under current law, GST-registered buyers must obtain Inland Revenue’s prior approval to issue buyer-created tax invoices. The proposed amendments would remove the requirement to have Commissioner pre-approval and instead require an agreement between the supplier and recipient (both must be registered persons) that is recorded by both parties. This agreement must record: • that only the recipient will create the taxable supply information and that the recipient will provide that information to the supplier, and • the reasons for entering into the agreement. If the Commissioner considers the agreement is inconsistent with legislative parameters, the Commissioner may treat the agreement as invalid. Shared tax invoices and supplier groups The proposed amendments would clarify that a group of registered persons may use the shared invoice process, provided none of those entities are part of a GST registered group. The registered person that is currently termed the principal supplier for a shared tax invoice, is proposed to be an agent for each registered person that is a party to that agreement. Companies choosing to use the shared invoice process would be required to document in an agreement: • the reasons for adopting the shared invoice process • acceptance of joint and several liability for GST obligations for each taxable supply • which registered person will create taxable supply information (no change) • certain identifying GST information for each party to the agreement, and • this type of agreement will also be subject to normal assurance processes, and if the Commissioner considers the agreement is inconsistent with legislative parameters, the Commissioner may treat the agreement as invalid. Recipient obligation to have business records that supports input tax deductions The amendments propose that, rather than relying on a formal “tax invoice”, a wider set of ordinary business-to-business information, including electronic information, could be able to be used to support GST output tax and input tax. This proposal will be supported by a proposal to introduce a strict liability penalty for claiming input tax more than once for the same taxable supply. The proposed strict liability 64 penalty replaces a knowledge offence penalty that applies to a supplier who has issued more than one tax invoice for the same supply Background In broad terms, the GST system operates as follows: • Contract law determines whether a supply of goods or services occurs. • Supplies of goods or services by registered persons are levied with GST either at the standard rate (15%) or at a zero rate (exports, sale as a going concern, some land transactions). These supplies are known as taxable supplies. • Registered persons must file a self-assessed GST return for each taxable period (generally 1 month, 2-monthly, or 6-monthly). • The GST payable or refundable for a taxable period is calculated from: − the difference between total output tax charged on taxable supplies made to customers and total input tax borne on business costs (assets and expenses), and − adjustments for second-hand good (input tax), and for partial private use of business assets (output tax) or partial business use of private assets (input tax). The integrity of the GST system is supported by prescribed information about taxable supplies (supply information), which in most cases is contained in a tax invoice. For a low value supply ($50 or less), the necessary information is usually contained in a receipt for the transaction. Supply information may also include subsequent adjustments to the original supply information using credit notes and debit notes, and for low value taxable supplies, payment receipts. The form of the tax invoice is based on paper-based recordkeeping systems and this has not altered since GST was introduced. The information required to be included in the tax invoice relates to the identities of the supplier and recipient, the nature of the goods or services supplied, and the GST levied on that supply. In this commentary this is referred to as supply information. A tax invoice is required for all taxable supplies having a value greater than $50. A GST issues paper, published in February 2020, 6 sought feedback on proposals to address integrity risks mainly relating to compliance and administration costs because: • the standard requirements for tax invoices, which support the integrity of the GST system, have not changed very much since 1986 • vast changes in business practices relating to transactional information and the use of technology have occurred since the introduction of GST, and • the New Zealand and Australian governments are working together to facilitate electronic invoicing (e-invoicing) to allow data exchange to be used in place of traditional invoices. 6 Inland Revenue. (February 2020). GST policy issues – an officials’ issues paper. https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2020/2020-ip-gst-issues 65 Detailed analysis Supply information Current requirements Under current law, a registered person making a taxable supply is, when requested, required to provide a tax invoice to a registered person that contains prescribed disclosures for that supply. The manner in which a registered person provides this information to the recipient is governed by section 14B and related provisions in Subpart 2D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (provision of information rules). In broad terms, those provisions require that information relating to a supply transaction can be provided in a number of ways. For supply information provided electronically, that information must comply with certain legislative provisions of contract law. 7 Proposed requirements The proposed amendments replace current provisions relating a tax invoice with a list of information that supports the integrity of the GST system. The proposed amendments also would repeal the simplified tax invoice for taxable supplies having a value not exceeding $1,000. Submissions on the GST issues paper indicated that in the modern record-keeping environment, the simplified tax invoice would not be required. The only other change of note to current information requirements, is that a registered supplier must keep a record of the quantity or volume of goods or services supplied but this information would no longer be required to be provided to the recipient of a taxable supply for GST purposes. Otherwise, the list of supply information that would be retained by the supplier and provided to a registered recipient remains unchanged. This list of information is proposed to be set out in two new terms (supply information and the taxable supply information) neither of which require the information to be provided or retained in any particular format in the same way as a tax invoice format is prescribed in current law. Other relevant terms are GST trade name and recipient details. The provision of information rules in the Tax Administration Act 1994 will continue to apply to this information. The primary list of required supply information continues to be: • prescribed information identifying the supplier and the recipient • the amount of the consideration payable for the supply of goods or services • the date of the supply • a description of the goods or services supplied • the amount of GST charged for the supply (which can be on an inclusive basis). For the following types of taxable supplies, again there is no change in the information requirements for either the supplier or recipient for: 7 Part 4 of the Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017. 66 • a receipt provided by a supplier of distantly taxable goods • information provided to the Customs Service by a supplier of distantly taxable goods • supply information required for a buyer-created invoicing process (see below for proposed changes to this process) • supply information required for receipts for taxable supplies having low-value consideration (this threshold is proposed to increase from $50 to $200). The $200 value correlates to electronic “PayWave” transaction limits and was suggested by some submitters on the GST issues paper) • tax invoices issued for supplies made before the application date of the proposed changes. A minor change to current law for information requirements relates to the supplier’s obligation to provide supply information for a taxable supply to a registered recipient at the time of supply, only on request. The proposed amendments would require the supplier to provide a registered recipient with the taxable supply information, which is consistent with commercial practice. The current law provides that a tax invoice must be provided only at the request of the recipient. The on- request approach is proposed to continue for any recipient of a supply of goods or services, to ensure that: • a copy of the taxable supply information can be obtained by a registered recipient if the original taxable supply information has been lost or become corrupted, and • an un-registered recipient who later becomes registered for GST, is able to ask for relevant supply information from the supplier (assuming that information remains available). This ensures that supply information can be available to the recipient to support input tax deductions for secondhand goods. Consequential amendments are also proposed for a number of rules to update references to the terminology proposed for modernising record keeping requirements. Rules relating to supply information for GST and supplier groups are also proposed to be amended to ensure consistency with these general changes. These proposed amendments are discussed later in a separate commentary item titled “GST Groups”. Correcting supply information Under current law, supply information in the tax invoice can be corrected if a taxable supply is: • cancelled, or • the supply information set out in a tax invoice is fundamentally different from the nature of the goods or services supplied, and • in some other limited circumstances. This correction process uses either a debit note (to increase the GST charged on the supply) or a credit note (to cancel or reduce the GST charged on the supply). Both a debit note and a credit note are currently defined to be: • a document that is provided under the relevant provision of section 25; and includes 67 • a document deemed to be a credit note or a debit note under the relevant provision of section 25. The amendments propose that a registered person may create supply correction information for: • a cancellation of a taxable supply, or an increase or decrease in the GST amount previously recorded (no change), or • to correct other incorrect supply information previously recorded, provided the correction is within the scope of Inland Revenue guidelines for making such corrections. This list of information is proposed to be termed supply correction information. It is also proposed that it would no longer be necessary to have separate processes for credit or debit adjustments. The new process replaces the requirements relating to credit and debit notes. The amendments also propose that a registered person creating supply correction information must provide that information to the other registered person who is a party to the supply, and all parties to the supply must retain this information in their business records required and retained by both the supplier and recipient (correction information). This is necessary to ensure that the recipient of a taxable supply has the correct available information when making an input tax deduction in their GST return. It will continue to be possible to request a copy of supply correction information, but it would no longer be mandatory to include the words “copy only” on that copy (if that information remains available). This supports the obligation for the recipient of a supply to have supply information records that support all input tax claims. In addition, an issue raised in submissions on the GST issues paper is that the current rules for debit noter and credit notes are not sufficiently flexible to allow supply information to be corrected. For example, spelling errors in the recipient’s name, or the description of the nature or quantity of the goods or services supplied. The proposed amendments would also allow such errors to be corrected. It is anticipated that the Commissioner will issue guidelines relating to the correction of errors under this proposed process. Copies of supply information If a copy of taxable supply information or supply correction information is requested, it would no longer be mandatory to require this information to be marked “copy only”. This proposal was supported by submissions on the GST issues paper. An integrity risk may arise due to the copies not being marked “copy only”. This is addressed in the proposed amendments, which would: • require the recipient of a taxable supply to have business records to support input tax deductions included in their GST return for a taxable period, and • impose a strict liability penalty on the recipient if multiple input tax deductions are taken for the same taxable supply. This strict liability penalty would replace the current knowledge offence for issuing more than one tax invoice for a single taxable supply (see later in this commentary for more information). 68 Buyer-created taxable supply information Under current law, GST-registered buyers must obtain Inland Revenue’s prior approval to issue buyer-created tax invoices. These invoices must contain the same supply information that is required for a taxable supply having a value greater than $1,000. A buyer can be approved to issue invoices for: • particular goods or services, or • a particular supplier or group of suppliers. A buyer-created tax invoice can only be used if both the buyer and the seller: • are GST registered • agree in writing that only the buyer will issue the tax invoice, and • keep a copy of the tax invoice. Submissions on the GST issues paper identified that this pre-approval process creates relatively high levels of compliance and administration costs. The amendments propose to remove the requirement to have Commissioner pre-approval and instead require an agreement between the supplier and recipient (both must be registered persons) that is recorded by both parties. The agreement must record: • that only the recipient will create the taxable supply information and that the recipient will provide that information to the supplier, and • the reasons for entering into the agreement. If the Commissioner considers the agreement is inconsistent with legislative parameters, the Commissioner may treat the agreement as invalid. This would result in the person not being able to continue to use this process. Shared tax invoices and supplier groups Under current law, a registered person may issue a tax invoice on behalf of multiple registered suppliers in situations where either: • the suppliers are all part of a group of companies, or • the suppliers have statutory obligations which make it practical to use a single invoice. The proposed amendments would clarify that the shared invoice process will continue to apply to a group of registered persons provided they are also not part of a GST registered group. The amendments also propose that registered persons using the shared invoice process would be required to document in an agreement setting out: • the reasons for adopting the shared invoice process (these would be consistent with published guidelines for acceptable use of the shared invoice process) • the joint and several liability for GST obligations for each taxable supply • which registered person will create taxable supply information (no change), and • certain identifying GST information for each party to the agreement (no change). 69 Consistent with submissions received on the GST issues paper, the registered person that is currently termed the principal supplier, is proposed to be an agent for each registered person that is a party to that agreement. This agency would only apply in relation to supplies to which the agreement applies. If the Commissioner considers the agreement is inconsistent with the legislative parameters, the Commissioner may treat the agreement as invalid. This would result in the person not being able to continue to use this process. Recipient obligation to have business records that supports input tax deductions Current information requirements To support the integrity of the GST system, current law in broad terms requires: • a registered person making a taxable supply to issue a tax invoice and retain that document in their business records • a registered supplier to provide the tax invoice to a registered recipient of the supply, but only on request • a registered recipient making input tax deductions in a GST return, to have a tax invoice for input tax deductions claimed, if the consideration for the supply is more than $50 (low-value threshold) • in limited circumstances, if a tax invoice has not been provided to the recipient of the supply, the Commissioner may approve the use of business records to support an input tax deduction • for secondhand goods input tax deductions a minimum set of information requirements must be satisfied, and • for taxable supplies having a consideration under the low-value threshold, the registered recipient is expected to a business record to evidence the input tax deduction (usually a till receipt). Some of these rules bear a relatively high compliance and administration cost because they require interaction with the Commissioner to determine whether it impractical to issue the records that contain the necessary evidence to support the input tax deduction. Proposed supply information requirements The GST issues paper proposed that rather than relying on a formal “tax invoice”, a wider set of ordinary business-to-business information, including electronic information, could be able to be used to support GST output tax and input tax. The proposed amendments in this Bill reflect the policy proposal in the GST issues paper. The proposed amendments also clarify that the supplier must provide the relevant supply information at the time of supply unless the recipient is not a registered person. The form of provision of that information is to be determined by the supplier. An unregistered recipient of a taxable supply may request to receive the relevant supply information at the time of supply or at a later time. 70 Proposed changes for information required to support an input tax deduction The proposed amendments would clarify that an input tax deduction must be supported by the registered person’s business records which show that the person: • has borne GST on those supplies, or • meets the information requirements for secondhand goods. Typically, contractual arrangements and associated recordkeeping required under commercial law will result in transactional information being created and retained in business records that is consistent with the information requirements of the GST system. As an input tax deduction is proposed to be supported by the registered person’s business records, it would be no longer necessary to have the current provision that requires Commissioner involvement in relation to recordkeeping. Consequentially, the proposed amendments would require a registered supplier to provide supply information to the recipient of the supply at the time of supply, unless the recipient is not a registered person. This differs from the current law which requires this information to be provided only on request. In practice, we observe that many suppliers already follow this process. This proposal may result in some minor change in business processes at point of sale for some small and medium size business sectors, mainly relating to determining if the recipient requires the supply information. Under this process, it would be sufficient for the supplier to determine if the recipient requires the supply information. If a recipient is a registered person, the recipient should always require the supply information as this is essential information to support the input tax credit process. Submissions on the GST issues paper were supportive of business records being used to support input tax deductions rather than requiring a formal document, such as a tax invoice. This proposal will be supported by a proposal to impose a strict liability penalty for claiming input tax more than once for the same taxable supply (see below). Strict liability penalty Submissions to the GST issues paper considered that criminal offence potentially applied to the wrong registered person, as multiple tax invoices for a single taxable supply were either a mistake or could be the result of taking an abusive tax position, evasion or fraud (each of which would have their own consequences). Under current law, a supplier of goods and services issuing multiple tax invoices for the same supply commits a criminal offence (termed a knowledge offence). Conviction for a knowledge offence exposes the supplier to a sanction of imprisonment not exceeding five years, a fine not exceeding $50,000, or both imprisonment and a fine, for each offence. The amendments propose to repeal the knowledge offence penalty for issuing multiple tax invoices for a single taxable supply and replace it with strict liability offence which carries a lower level of sanctions. 71 The replacement strict liability offence (also a criminal offence) wo would apply to a registered person who claims an input tax credit more than once for the same taxable supply. This is consistent with submissions made on the GST issues paper. This new penalty would only apply if the registered person has not taken reasonable care in ensuring they have not made more than one input tax deduction for the same taxable supply, or that person has already self-corrected for a multiple input tax deduction claim in a subsequent GST return. The sanction for the proposed strict liability offence provides for a scale of fines (a maximum of $12,000), depending on how many times the person is convicted under this rule. Existing guidelines would apply for determining when reasonable care has been taken. 72 SECONDHAND GOODS INPUT TAX CREDIT – ASSOCIATED PERSONS SUPPLIES (Clause 6) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments would allow an input tax credit for a supply of secondhand goods from an associated person by reference to the last known supply from a non-associated person. The proposed amendment would not apply to a supply of goods that were acquired by the supplier before GST was introduced. Application date The proposed amendment would apply for taxable periods starting on or after the date of enactment. Key features The current rule prevents a registered person from having an input tax credit for secondhand goods acquired from an associated person who had not previously acquired those goods as a taxable supply. The proposed amendment would allow an input tax credit for secondhand goods acquired from an associated person as follows: • if the associated supplier has purchased the secondhand goods from a non-associated person, an input tax deduction allowed would be equal to the tax fraction of that earlier purchase price from the non-associated person, or • if the associated supplier has purchased the second-hand goods from an associated person, an input tax deduction would be allowed only if an earlier supply with a non- associated person can be identified after 1 October 1986. In this situation, the input tax deduction allowed would be equal to the tax fraction of that earlier purchase price from the non-associated person. Background The input tax deduction for a supply of secondhand goods to an associated person is intended to have the same outcome for input tax that would be allowed if the supplier had, instead of making an associated person transaction, started using the secondhand goods in their own taxable activity. In this situation, the owner of the secondhand goods would receive an input tax deduction that takes into account previous GST costs embedded in the purchase price of the owner of those goods. The GST issues paper proposed amending the law to allow an input tax credit if a registered person is denied a secondhand goods input tax credit, where previous GST costs have been embedded in the transactional cost of the asset. 73 Example 21 illustrates the policy problem and the outcome that would be achieved by the proposed amendments. Example 21: A developer sells a property to Sam for $1.15 million, including $150,000 of GST Sam is not registered for GST (or, if registered does not use the property to make taxable supplies). Two months later Sam sells the property for $1.2 million to John. As this sale is not subject to GST, there is no GST included in the sale price to John. John lives in the property for five years and then sells the property for $1.5 million to his sister, Jasmine who will re-develop the property to use it as the premises for her business of making taxable supplies. Current law would limit the secondhand goods input tax credit to the GST included in the original cost to John, which was zero – therefore Jasmine is unable to claim any secondhand goods input tax credit. This is despite GST of $150,000 being embedded in the chain of transaction costs. The intended result is that Jasmine should be able to claim a secondhand goods input credit based on the tax fraction (3/23rds) of the original cost to John which would be a $150,000 secondhand goods input credit. The policy objective is for the input tax deduction rule to give the same input tax deduction (in total) overall that John would have if, instead of selling the secondhand goods to Jasmine had applied the goods 100% in a taxable activity. Under the current adjustment rules, if the property was applied 100% to a taxable activity of John, the total amount of input tax deduction allowed to John would be equal to the tax fraction of the cost of the property purchased from Sam. The proposed amendments achieve this outcome and also ensure that a chain of associated person supply transactions is looked through to determine the first non- associated supply introduced to that chain In addition, the current rule for supplies of secondhand goods between associated persons prevented an input tax deduction for secondhand goods acquired before the commencement of GST. This was achieved in the current rule for acquisitions of secondhand goods from an associated person by the limitation on the input tax credit for the amount of tax included in the original cost of the goods to the supplier. The proposed amendment bases the amount of the input tax deduction on the tax fraction of the purchase price. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that an input tax deduction for secondhand goods cannot arise if the relevant supply of secondhand goods was from goods acquired by the supplier before GST commenced in 1986. This is proposed to be set out in the requirements that must be satisfied for a person to have an input tax credit for secondhand goods. This proposed amendment ensures that a secondhand goods input tax credit cannot arise if either: • the supplier acquired the goods before 1 October 1986, or • the supplier acquired the goods as part of a chain of transactions between associated persons dating back to before 1 October 1986. 74 GST INPUT TAX RECOVERY FOR NON-RESIDENT BUSINESS (Clause 21(8)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would allow a GST registered non-resident business to claim input tax deductions for all their GST costs purchased in New Zealand that are used to make supplies outside New Zealand. Some consequential amendments are also proposed which would prevent a GST registered non-resident business from claiming a GST input tax deduction for any GST paid to Customs on imported goods that are supplied to a final consumer in New Zealand. Application date The proposed amendments would apply from the date of enactment. Key features A proposed amendment would expand section 20(3L) so that it applies to all GST registered non-residents. These GST registered non-residents would then be able to deduct input tax for goods and services purchased by them that are used for, or available for use in, making taxable supplies, treating all supplies made by them as if they were made and received in New Zealand. Proposed new section 20(3LB) would allow a similar input tax deduction for when the GST registered non-resident has imported goods and paid GST to Customs on the imported goods unless new section 20(3LC) applies. Proposed new section 20(3LC) would exclude an input tax deduction for the Customs GST paid on imported goods if those goods are supplied to another person in New Zealand who is not a GST registered person, or, who is a GST registered person and the supply is not for use in their taxable activity. This means no input tax deduction can be claimed by the non- resident in respect of any imported goods that are supplied to a final New Zealand consumer. Background A GST registered non-resident business may send their goods to New Zealand for work to be done on them by a New Zealand resident business. Once work is complete, the non- resident will often export some of the goods outside of New Zealand. Unless they establish a fixed or permanent place in New Zealand, the non-resident is currently unable to claim input tax deductions for their New Zealand inputs that relate to the exported goods. This is because section 8(2) deems the supply of these goods to occur outside New Zealand. The proposed amendments would allow the GST registered non-resident business to claim input tax deductions for their New Zealand inputs that relate to the exported goods. This would reduce the compliance costs associated with establishing a fixed or permanent place in New Zealand and ensure that GST is not a cost borne by businesses. 75 The proposed amendments achieve this by expanding the scope of an existing input tax deduction rule in section 20(3L) which allows deductions for certain non-resident businesses, so it would apply to all GST registered non-residents. Existing rules in section 20(3LB) and 20(3LC) prevent an input tax deduction from being claimed by a non-resident if they pay Customs GST and deliver goods to a final consumer in New Zealand. The current rules achieve this by deeming the Customs GST to be paid by the New Zealand person who receives the goods, rather than the non-resident importer. However, the current deeming rule means that when the GST registered non-resident pays Customs GST on behalf of a GST registered New Zealand business, the New Zealand business needs to claim an input tax deduction for this Customs GST and reimburse the non- resident. This process can be confusing for the parties involved and lead to errors or higher compliance costs. Therefore, the proposed amendment would replace the deeming rule in sections 20(3LB) and 20(3LC) with a proposed new section 20(3LC). This would prevent an input tax deduction from being claimed by the non-resident in respect of Customs GST paid on any imported goods that are delivered to a person in New Zealand who is not a GST registered person, or, who is a GST registered person and the supply is not for use in their taxable activity. The input tax deduction for Customs GST is denied where the imported goods are outside New Zealand at the time of supply. 76 EXPORTS OF GOODS THAT ARE DELIVERED TO A RECIPIENT’S VESSEL IN NEW ZEALAND (Clause 10) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would allow a supplier to zero-rate a supply of goods to a recipient who then exports those unaltered goods from New Zealand. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the date of enactment. Key features Section 11(1)(eb) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 allows a supplier who delivers goods to a non-resident recipient who then exports those goods outside of New Zealand to zero-rate the supply. However, section 11(1)(eb) does not apply if the recipient is a resident. The proposed amendment would allow a supplier to zero-rate the supply of goods to a resident recipient for export. This would be achieved by expanding section 11(1)(eb)(i) so that it is not limited to cases where the recipient exporter is a non-resident. The other conditions of section 11(1)(eb)(ii)–(vi) would remain in place and must be met for the supply of goods to the recipient to be zero-rated. For example, a supplier who delivers logs to the ship of a recipient who then exports the logs outside of New Zealand would be able to zero- rate the supply of logs. The proposed amendment would reduce compliance costs for the supplier and the recipient. 77 GROUND LEASES PAID VIA A UNIT TITLE BODY CORPORATE (Clause 7(3)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would deem a GST registered unit title body corporate to not be making taxable supplies to its members for any portion of a levy charged by the body corporate for supplies which would be exempt supplies if they were provided directly to the member. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the date of enactment. Key features When a GST registered unit title body corporate charges a levy to its members, section 5(8A) deems there to be a taxable supply of services to the members. This means that a GST registered unit title body corporate must charge and remit output tax on the levy to Inland Revenue. Section 5(8A) deems there to be a taxable supply in relation to the whole of the levy or other amount paid, even though a portion of that levy may be used to purchase exempt supplies such as a lease on leasehold land to the extent that land is used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land. The proposed amendment would qualify section 5(8A) so that the portion of a unit title body corporate levy that relates to the purchase of exempt supplies is not treated as consideration for services supplied to the member. This means that GST would not be charged on the portion of the levy that represents payment for exempt supplies (as defined in section 14). For example, where a unit title body corporate charges to its members a levy of $500, and $300 of that levy is paid to the leasehold landowner for ground rent on land that is used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land, the body corporate would only be making a taxable supply in relation to the $200 that does not represent consideration for the exempt supply. 78 GST B2B COMPULSORY ZERO-RATING OF LAND RULES (Clauses 7(5), and 33(1), 33(3) and 33(4)) Summary of proposed amendments Three proposed remedial amendments would amend the GST business-to-business compulsory zero-rating of land rules. The proposed amendments would apply in cases where a registered person has incorrectly zero-rated a supply of land and is required to make subsequent adjustments. Two of the proposed remedials would clarify that the adjustment should be made in the period that the error became apparent, rather than the period when the original supply took place. The third proposed remedial would allow a non-taxable supply that has been incorrectly zero-rated to be correctly adjusted to be a non-taxable supply. Application date The proposed amendment to the timing of an adjustment under section 25AB of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) would apply for taxable periods starting on or after the date of enactment. The proposed amendments to the timing and nature of the adjustment under section 5(23) of the GST Act would apply from the date of enactment. Key features Timing of an adjustment under section 25AB A registered person may claim a secondhand goods input tax deduction when they purchase land from a non-associated person who has not made a taxable supply. If, subsequent to the supply of land, it is found that the supply should have been zero-rated under section 11(1)(mb), the recipient of the supply is required to make an output tax adjustment for the underpaid GST in the taxable period in which the “event” occurred under section 25AB. In this case, the “event” is the incorrect treatment of the supply of land as a non-taxable supply for which the recipient claimed a secondhand goods input tax deduction. The output tax is therefore owing in the taxable period in which the land was supplied. This means the recipient will be liable to pay penalties and use of money interest, and there is a risk that the necessary adjustment may have since become time barred. The proposed amendment would address these concerns by ensuring that the liability to pay output tax only arises on the date it is found that the amount of input tax deducted by the recipient was incorrect. This is achieved by amending section 25AB so that it refers to the time the error was discovered when determining the adjusted tax liability of the recipient of the supply. 79 Timing of an adjustment under section 5(23) A registered person must zero-rate a supply of land to another registered person when the requirements under section 11(1)(mb) are met. If, subsequent to the supply of land, it is found that the supply did not meet the requirements for zero-rating under section 11(1)(mb), the recipient of the supply is required to return output tax on the purchase price. This output tax liability is attributed to the taxable period in which the date of settlement occurred. This means the recipient will be liable to pay penalties and use of money interest, and there is a risk that the necessary adjustment may have since become time barred. The proposed amendment would address these concerns by ensuring that the liability to pay output tax only arises in the taxable period where the recipient becomes aware that the zero- rating rules did not apply to the original supply. This is achieved by amending section 5(23) so that the supply of land by the recipient is deemed to occur on the date on which the error in application of the zero-rating rules is discovered. This means that the recipient’s output tax liability would occur in the same taxable period that they would be entitled to claim an input tax deduction (to the extent to which they are using the land to make taxable supplies). Nature of the adjustment under section 5(23) A supplier must zero-rate a supply of land to a recipient when the requirements of section 11(1)(mb) are met. If, subsequent to the supply of land, it is found that the supply was incorrectly zero-rated and should have instead been treated as a non-taxable supply for which the recipient could claim a secondhand goods input tax deduction, the recipient is currently unable to claim this deduction. The proposed amendment would allow the recipient to claim a secondhand goods input tax deduction where they meet the requirements of section 3A(2). This would be achieved by limiting the application of section 5(23), so that it would only apply where there has been a taxable supply of goods. 80 GST – DEDUCTION NOTICES FOR MEMBERS OF UNINCORPORATED BODIES AND PERSONS WHO ARE NO LONGER REGISTERED (Clause 35) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments would ensure that deduction notices could be used to recover outstanding GST debt from members of unincorporated bodies, and from persons who are no longer registered for GST. Application date The proposed amendments would apply from the date of enactment. Key features The proposed amendments are designed to: • resolve a technical issue with the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) that prevents the Commissioner from being able to recover outstanding GST debts from members of unincorporated bodies, despite them being jointly and severally liable for the obligations of the unincorporated body, and • ensure that the Commissioner can still recover outstanding GST debts by way of a deduction notice, whether the person who incurred the debt is registered for GST or not. Background The Commissioner has the power under various Inland Revenue Acts to issue deduction notices as a means of collecting outstanding tax debts. The GST Act permits the Commissioner to issue deduction notices, which require a person (usually an employer or a bank) who owes an amount to a debtor to extract and pay to the Commissioner from that amount an amount in satisfaction of the debtor’s tax debt. In this regard, deduction notices are an effective and an efficient means of collecting outstanding tax debts. For GST, the Commissioner can issue deduction notices that have effect in respect of outstanding GST owed by a registered person. This means that deduction notices cannot be used to recover outstanding GST from members of unincorporated bodies (such as partners in partnerships, and trustees of trusts) because the members themselves are not regarded under the GST Act as registered persons, and instead the GST Act treats the unincorporated body itself as the registered person. This also means that deduction notices cannot be used to recover outstanding GST that relates to a person who is no longer a registered person under the GST Act. Neither of these outcomes are intended, and it is noted that the Commissioner is not prevented from recovering outstanding tax debts in these circumstances for other tax types such as income tax and PAYE. 81 Detailed analysis The proposed amendment inserts new subsection (2AA) to section 43 (Deduction of tax from payment due to defaulters) which would make it clear that the Commissioner can issue deduction notices to recover outstanding GST from both registered persons themselves (such as the case now), and persons liable to meet the obligations under the GST Act of a registered person (defined in the amendment as a “liable person”). A person is a liable person if they are liable to meet the obligations under the GST Act of a registered person. This would be the case where: • The person was a member of an unincorporated body that itself was registered for GST. This is because the members of unincorporated bodies are jointly and severally liable for the tax payable by the unincorporated body, whether still a member or not. • The person is no longer registered for GST (and is therefore not a registered person) but nevertheless continues to be liable for the obligations and liabilities incurred by the registered person while they were registered. This would also include members of unincorporated bodies, where that unincorporated body ceased being a registered person. Further consequential amendments are proposed to section 43 of the GST Act to allow the Commissioner to recover outstanding GST debts from members of unincorporated bodies, and from persons who are no longer registered persons under the Act. These proposed amendments involve adding references to “the registered person or the liable person” to provisions which currently only apply to the registered person. 82 GST GROUPS (Clauses 9, 36, and 37) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments to the GST group rules would mainly resolve an identified ambiguity in the current law relating to the relationship of the GST group provision with the other rules underpinning the GST system. This ambiguity was identified in an issues paper released in February 2019 by Inland Revenue’s Public Rulings Unit on the consequences of GST group registration (IRUIPP 13). The proposed amendments clarify that the GST group rules would: • apply as if the group were a single registered person for all activities carried on by any member within the group for supplies made to third parties • disregard most intra-group supplies in determining the group’s GST liability for each taxable period • clarify which intra-group supplies are included in the group’s GST return • apply joint and several liability on the same basis as for consolidated groups in the Income Tax Act 2007 • allow a group to nominate a member company to create and issue all supply information records for taxable supplies, and • be consistent with the proposed amendments to modernise information requirements for the GST system. Application date The proposed amendments would apply for taxable periods beginning on or after the date of enactment. Key features The proposed amendments for GST groups would: • address an ambiguity in the law about the relationship of the grouping rules to the other rules in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 • simplify compliance requirements by allowing the group to choose a group member company to comply with the modernised information requirements • clarify that the representative member is responsible for making elections and giving notices on behalf of the group, in particular for elections and notices relating the activities of the GST group • update some rules for groups to be consistent with the modernisation of invoicing proposals also included in this bill. These proposals have resulted in renumbering of existing rules, and 83 • provide a framework for identifying any intra-group supply transaction that must be included in the group GST return for the relevant taxable period. The ambiguity identified is proposed to be addressed by clarifying that supplies made by any member of the group to third parties that would be a supply by that member in the absence of the GST group rules are treated for GST purposes as made by the representative member of the group Clause 9 provides a signpost for readers to indicate the GST group rules are to be read in conjunction with the core rules in Part 2. Clause 36 proposes consequential terminology updates relating to the term GST group and the modernisation of invoicing. Detailed analysis Treatment as a single company The proposed amendments would result in a GST group being mostly treated, for GST purposes, as a single company that: • operates each business carried on by any member of the group (a clarification) • makes and receives each supply to a person that is not a member of the group, this includes exempt supplies (a clarification) • treats the representative member as the person acting on behalf of the group for elections, giving notices, keeping records, and accounting for GST for the group (no change) • permits a GST group to choose to issue taxable supply records for taxable supplies to third parties in the name of either the representative member or a member company (allows GST groups more flexibility in their GST systems) • the representative member and members of the group are to share the responsibilities and liabilities arising from the members’ business activity, and • is not required to account for GST in a GST return for taxable supplies made between members of the group, unless specifically required to account for those intragroup supplies. Clause 9 proposes a signpost to the special case rules in Part 9, which includes the GST group rules. This proposed amendment provides a signal for the reader that the rules in section 55 are intended to be applied first when determining how GST is accounted for by the representative member of a GST group. Representative member treated as carrying on all activities The proposed amendments clarify that the representative member carries on all taxable activities and exempt activities that are carried on by any member of the group where those supplies would otherwise be taxable to the member. Each of those activities would be treated in the same manner as if they were carried on by a branch within a single company that is registered for all of its taxable activities. This would 84 ensure that the multiple activities are not treated as being merged into a single taxable activity, and that the individual activities would retain their unique nature. The representative member is to continue to be responsible for: • filing GST returns for the group, and • satisfying GST payment obligations for the group. The proposed amendments would also ensure that apportionments and adjustments would be calculated by reference to the total activities carried on within the group, including exempt activities. These proposals would improve the integrity of the GST system for GST groups. The representative member would continue to be treated as: • making all taxable and non-taxable supplies made by any group member to a third party, and • receiving all taxable and non-taxable supplies made to any group member by a third party. Intra-group supplies would continue to be disregarded, unless specifically identified to be included in the GST group’s return for a taxable period. Intra-group supplies A new provision provides a framework for listing types of intra-group supplies that must be taken account of in a group GST return. For example, if a provision is not listed in this proposed section, taxable supplies made in New Zealand between members of the GST group are disregarded in the preparation of the group GST return for each taxable period. Information requirements Under current settings, each member of the GST group is required to issue tax invoices and keep records for all taxable supplies. As a simplification measure, it is proposed that a group may choose that supply information for these supplies to be issued and retained by either: • the representative member, or • a nominated company (for example, an administration company that maintains all record keeping functions for the group), or • the supplying member itself. The form of creating and retaining and issuing that information would be determined by the group. However, if the group chooses to have an administration company maintain all record-keeping functions for the group, the amendments propose that the identity of this company and its role are notified to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. However, irrespective of which company issues and retains information for taxable supplies and any related subsequent adjustments, this company would need to meet the minimum information requirements set out in the rules proposed for modernising GST recordkeeping processes. The representative member is to remain responsible for ensuring that the record- keeping processes are complied with. 85 Eligibility to be in a GST group The eligibility rules for being included in a GST group remain unchanged, although the drafting is updated for consistency with other amendments for GST groups. Joint and several liability The proposed amendments would align the joint and several liability provisions with the joint and several liability provisions for consolidated groups of companies in the Income Tax Act 2007. Joint and several liability generally will continue for GST obligations incurred while a member of the group. The Commissioner may choose to grant relief under the proposed amendments, if all of the following are satisfied: • the assessment is a reassessment made after the later of the date the exiting company leaves the GST group, and the date of the event that results in that member being treated as having left the group • the amount assessed is an increased assessment, and • the Commissioner considers the removal of joint and several liability will not significantly prejudice the recovery of the increased assessment and has notified the member and the GST group of this conclusion. Commencement of membership of a GST group The proposed amendments would clarify the start date for a member company that is newly incorporated. The representative member may choose that the start date of membership is either: • the date of the company’s incorporation, or • the start of the taxable period following the date of incorporation. 86 NON-STATUTORY BOARDS (Clause 8) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would remove the word “statutory” from this provision. This would ensure that all boards are treated the same for GST purposes. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the date of enactment. Key features The proposed amendment would ensure that when a natural person who is a registered person, provides services to local authorities, boards, committees, any other council, they are treated the same for GST purposes. This would also ensure that the bodies on which they serve are also treated in the same way for GST purposes for those services, irrespective of their statutory or non-statutory status. Background The proposed amendment stems from a proposal set out in the February 2020 GST issues paper. The issues paper identified that the wording of the law is inconsistent with the policy intent. In particular, the application of the law was resulting in a different GST treatment as between services supplied: • by members of statutory bodies, such as a local authority (the service is not subject to GST), and • by members of non-statutory bodies, such as community boards (the service is potentially subject to GST). 87 MORE FLEXIBILITY FOR CHANGING END DATE FOR TAXABLE PERIOD (Clauses 9, and 13–18) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments would allow the Commissioner to approve a registered person to use their accounting cycle as the basis for calculating GST payable for a taxable period. The Commissioner would need to be satisfied that the request to change their end date of a taxable periods is consistent with the purpose of aligning the person’s accounting system. Under the proposed amendments, the end date of the accounting cycle would be aligned with the last day of a month using late and early balance date principles similar to those used in the Income Tax Act 2007 for non-standard balance dates. Application date The proposed amendments would apply for taxable periods starting on or after the date of enactment. Key features A registered person may apply to Inland Revenue for approval to change the end date of a taxable period that is not within seven days of the end of a calendar month. The approved end date may be either a day of the week or a calendar date. The change in the end date may be approved if the change would significantly improve the alignment of the registered person’s taxable periods with their accounting systems. If the request is approved, the end date of the registered person’s accounting cycle would be treated for GST purposes as corresponding to: • the end of the preceding month, if the end of the end date of the accounting cycle is on or before the fifteenth of the month, or • the end of the current month, if the end date of the accounting cycle is after the 15th of the month. The proposed amendments would: • have an effect that is similar to the way in which late and early balance dates correspond to a tax year for income tax purposes, and • provide for consistency with provisional tax methods, and due dates for satisfying GST obligations. Clause 9 provides a signpost to the proposed amendments to the taxable period rules. 88 Background The proposed amendment stems from proposals in the February 2020 GST issues paper about the use of accounting systems of registered persons that do not coincide with the last day of the month. The issues paper noted that: • the last day of the month is the normal end date for a taxable period • an exception to this requirement exists, but is limited to an approved end date that is within seven days of the end of the month, and • this requirement can require a relatively high level of compliance and administration cost if GST accounting cycles are not consistent with accounting cycles. The issues paper also noted that for the concerns mainly relate to organisations using accounting cycles based on a “4 week – 4 week - 5 week” accounting system. Accounting for GST on the statutory cycle (to the last day of a month). Detailed analysis Approvals A request for approval for an end date for a taxable period on the basis of aligning GST taxable periods with the registered person’s accounting cycles is proposed to be made under existing section 15(2). Inland Revenue’s GST guide 8 sets out that an application for changes to filing requirements is made in writing. This can include an application made in the registered person’s MyIR account. The approved end date can be based on the end of an accounting cycle, which can be a specific day of the week (the dates will therefore vary) or can be based on a fixed calendar date. The proposed amendments would take effect from the end of the taxable period in which the person applies or at the end of a later taxable period nominated by the registered person. The proposals would also allow an application for approval to be for the accounting cycle that would be equivalent to either a 1-month or 2-month or 6-month taxable period Alignment of approved taxable period with end of the month If Inland Revenue approves the end date of a taxable period to be other than the end of the month, the end date of the registered person’s accounting cycle is treated for GST purposes as corresponding to: • the last day of the month, if the accounting cycle ends on or after the 16th of the month (for example, 16th March is treated as taxable period ending on following 31 March – late end date), or • the last day of the previous month if the accounting cycle ends on or before the 15th of the month (for example, 13 April is treated as taxable period ending on prior 31 March). 8 Inland Revenue.

GST guide – working with GST (IR375). https://www.ird.govt.nz/- /media/project/ir/home/documents/forms-and-guides/ir300---ir399/ir375/ir375-2021.pdf 89 As it is possible for the end date of successive accounting cycles to vary (where the accounting cycles end on a particular week day), this could result in those end dates of the accounting cycles corresponding to the same end date of a month. Consequently, the proposals would permit the GST information from those two accounting cycles to be aggregated and returned as one taxable period. Example 22 illustrates this outcome. Example 22 Under the 4–4-5 cycle ending on a Thursday (for a monthly GST cycle), allowing the cycle to be based on a fixed day of the week, can result in an early and late balance date falling into the same taxable period. If two approved end dates relate to the same end of month date, then the second of those two dates is ignored – and the two four weekly cycles are combined as one taxable period so that GST returns for all taxable periods include the information for all taxable supplies and input tax deductions.

This would correct an inadvertent change made on 1 April 2011 that resulted in a narrowing of allowable input tax deductions for goods acquired by a registered person but which remained in transit at the time of preparing the GST return. Application date The proposed amendment would apply to supplies of goods made on or after 1 April 2011. Key features The proposed amendments would allow an input tax deduction for goods acquired but not yet physically received if: • the goods are expected to be used in making taxable supplies, and • the goods have not been acquired from an associated person. The limitation on the proposed amendment for associated person transactions addresses an integrity risk for the GST system to prevent asymmetrical transactions to give beneficial GST outcomes for the associated persons. 91 CHALLENGE RIGHTS – ASSESSING TIME-BARRED GST RETURNS (Clause 155) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments would provide that a Commissioner assessment for a time-barred GST return is treated as a disputable decision. Application date The proposed amendment would apply for taxable periods starting on or after the date of enactment. Key features The proposed amendments would provide that a Commissioner’s decision to reopen an assessment for a time barred GST return is treated as a disputable decision. Under current law, such a Commissioner assessment could only be challenged under a judicial review process. The proposed amendment would align the treatment of Commissioner assessments for time barred periods as between income tax and GST. 92 REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS TO THE GST APPORTIONMENT RULES Background The apportionment and adjustment rules apply when a GST-registered person uses or intends to use goods and services for both taxable and non-taxable purposes. Following acquisition of an asset, the GST-registered person must annually compare the intended taxable use of an asset with the actual taxable use of that asset. If there is a difference the person must make an adjustment to either claim extra input tax credits or pay output tax to reflect the actual taxable use of the asset. Proposed remedial changes to the GST apportionment rules would increase the accuracy and fairness of the rules. These proposed changes are discussed separately: • zero-rated supplies of going concerns, and • switching off adjustment provisions after a wash-up is performed. 93 ZERO-RATED SUPPLIES OF GOING CONCERNS (Clauses 21(7) and 21(8)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment introduces a provision that would require a purchaser who acquires goods which were zero-rated as the sale of a going concern and then uses those goods for a partly non-taxable use, to determine the amount of GST that would have been payable if the transaction was not zero-rated and apportion the amount accordingly. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the date of enactment. Detailed analysis Under current section 11(1)(m) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, the sale of a going concern between registered persons may be zero-rated if the supplier and recipient agree. The problem under current law is that if the purchaser utilises this going concern for a partly private use, there is no provision that requires them to determine the amount of GST that would have been payable if the transaction was not zero-rated and apportion the amount accordingly. Clause 21(7) proposes an expansion to the scope of section 20(3J) so that this section would also apply to goods which were zero-rated as a going concern under section 11(1)(m) at the time they were acquired by the registered person. The proposed amendment would require the registered person to determine if they have any non-taxable use of the goods (such as private use or use of the goods to make exempt supplies) and return output tax in respect of 15% of the consideration they paid to acquire the goods multiplied by their percentage of non-taxable use. This would ensure consistency with the zero-rating of land rules, which do require the purchaser to determine the nominal amount of GST that would have applied if the supply was standard rated and return output tax on the apportioned amount. Example 23: Kelvin Kelvin has a business selling ice cream. He enters into an agreement to sell the entire business, which includes an ice cream truck, to Stewart for $100,000 (plus GST if any). This $100,000 is made up of $50,000 for the truck and $50,000 for other assets. Kelvin and Stewart agree to zero-rate the sale of the business as a going concern. Stewart estimates that the private use of the truck will be 20%. Under current law, as no GST has been paid, Stewart does not need to account for this private use. Under the proposed amendment Even though Stewart acquired the truck as a zero-rated supply, under the proposed amendment Stewart must first determine the amount of GST that would have been charged if the supply of the truck was not zero- rated. $7,500 would have been charged on the $50,000 truck had it not been zero-rated. Stewart must then determine his non-taxable use of the truck, which he estimates to be 20% and return output tax on 20% of $7,500, which equals $1,500, in his next GST return. 94 SWITCHING OFF ADJUSTMENT PROVISIONS AFTER A WASH-UP IS PERFORMED (Clause 23(1)) Summary of proposed amendment Proposed section 21(2)(ac) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) would provide a person with an exemption from making an adjustment for apportioned supplies if they have performed a “wash up” calculation under section 21FB of the GST Act. The wash up calculation under section 21FB applies when there has been a change to 100% taxable or 100% non-taxable use of an asset for two adjustment periods. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the date of enactment. Detailed analysis The proposed amendment would ensure that a registered person is not required to continue to perform annual adjustments for goods and services that have had a complete change of use and have been subject to a wash-up under section 21FB. This would reduce unnecessary compliance costs for a taxpayer. Example 24: Ben Ben works part time running a flooring business. On 1 April 2021 he purchased a van for $57,500. As the business is only part time, Ben’s uses the van for 50% taxable use, and fifty percent for private use. Ben claims an input tax credit of $3,750 to account for the taxable use of the van. On 1 April 2023 Ben switches the van to one hundred percent taxable use. This is because business has now picked up and Ben needs to work full time. He has also purchased another car for his private use. On 1 April 2025, there has been two adjustment periods with 100% taxable use, so Ben performs a wash- up calculation under section 21FB and is able to claim an additional input tax credit. Ben’s total input tax deductions for the van will now add to $7,500 or 100% of the GST component of the van. The proposed amendment clarifies that Ben will not need to continue to perform annual adjustments for his van, as it has had a complete change of use and is 100% taxable. This applies for as long as Ben’s use of the van remains 100% taxable. If, for example, Ben’s taxable use of the van changed on 1 April 2026 to 80% taxable and 20% private use he would need to make an adjustment to account for this. The proposed amendment would apply provided that the registered person has not changed the use of the goods or services since performing the wash-up. If in a subsequent adjustment period the use of the asset changes, the registered person would be required to recommence calculating annual adjustments under the apportionment rules, unless one of the other section 21(2) thresholds is applied. 95 REPEAL REDUNDANT PROVISION (Clause 45) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would repeal the transitional provision that applied to the vesting of railway assets in KiwiRail Holdings Limited in 2012 as this rule has served its purpose and is now redundant. Application date The proposed amendment would apply for taxable periods starting on or after the date of enactment. 97 Income tax remedials 99 BRIGHT-LINE TEST – CONSTRUCTION OF A MAIN HOME THAT TAKES LONGER THAN 12 MONTHS (Clause 49) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment to the main home exclusion from the bright-line test would ensure a main home that takes longer than 12 months to construct would not be subject to the bright- line test. Application date The proposed amendment would apply to residential land acquired on or after 27 March 2021. 9 Key features The proposed amendment to section CB 16A(6) would allow the period when a person is making reasonable efforts to construct a dwelling intended for use as their main home (or the main home of a beneficiary described in section CB 16A(2)) to be counted as “main home days” and not subject to the bright-line test. Upon completion of construction, the property would need to be used as the person’s main home for the construction period to count as “main home days”. Background The main home exclusion from the bright-line test in section CB 16A applies where a property is the owner’s main home for the entire period it is owned, ignoring periods of less than 12 months where the property is not used as a main home. This 12-month buffer is intended to provide leeway for moving in or out of a property, or, for example, where the taxpayer rents out their home while they are overseas for a short period. It was not intended that a taxpayer who purchases bare land and constructs their main home on the land would be subject to tax for the construction period if that is longer than 12 months. The proposed amendment to the main home exclusion would address this. 9 However, it would not apply to property acquired on or after 27 March 2021 as a result of an offer made by the purchaser on or before 23 March 2021, provided the offer could not be revoked before 27 March 2021. 100 BRIGHT-LINE TEST – NO REDUCTION IF THE MAIN HOME EXCLUSION DOES NOT APPLY (Clause 48) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would change the bright-line test so that the amount of income derived on the sale of a property used as a main home would not be reduced where the person has used the main home exclusion twice in a two-year period or has engaged in a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of residential land. Application date The proposed amendment would apply to residential land acquired on or after 27 March 2021. 10 Key features Proposed changes amend section CB 6A(6) to provide that the formula in section CB 6A(7) does not apply to reduce the amount of income derived on disposing of property if the main home exclusion in section CB 16A does not apply because the person has already used the exclusion twice in the last two years or has engaged in a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of residential land. Background The income calculation provision in the bright-line test disregards any period of main home use (including certain periods of 12 months or less where the property is not used as the person’s main home) where the main home exclusion does not apply (section CB 6A(7)). A person is only allowed to use the main home exclusion twice in a two-year period and if they are not engaged in a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of residential land (section CB 16A(3)). The income calculation provision in the bright-line test disregards any period of main home use (as well as periods of 12 months or less where the property is not used as the owner’s main home) where the main home exclusion does not apply (section CB 6A (7)). Where the main home exclusion does not apply because of section CB 16A(3), periods of main home use and non-main home use of 12 months or less should not be disregarded and should be included for the purposes of calculating income, otherwise the person could essentially access the main home exclusion more than twice in a two-year period. 10 However, it would not apply to property acquired on or after 27 March 2021 as a result of an offer made by the purchaser on or before 23 March 2021, provided the offer could not be revoked before 27 March 2021. 101 Example 25: Main home exclusion Bob purchases a house in January 2022, lives in it while he renovates it, and sells it in May 2022. He purchases another house in June 2022, lives in it while he renovates, and sells it in November 2022. He qualifies for the main home exclusion for both properties and pays no tax under the bright-line test (assume he is not subject to tax under any other taxing provision). He purchases his third property in January 2023, lives in it until May 2023 while he renovates it, then rents it until November 2023 before selling it. The main home exclusion would not apply to this third property as he has already used the exclusion twice in a two- year period. However, the current income calculation provision in the bright-line test would disregard the period where Bob lived in and renovated the property and the period where he rented the property, given it was under 12 months. This effectively allows him to claim the main home exclusion three times within a two-year period, which was not the policy intent. 102 BRIGHT-LINE TEST – CLARIFYING THE APPLICATION OF THE 12- MONTH BUFFER (Clause 49) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment to the main home exclusion from the bright-line test would clarify that: • a person may still qualify for the exclusion if they have multiple periods, each of less than 12 months, where the property is not used as a main home, and • a person may not use the reduction formula in the bright-line test or access the main home exclusion for a period of non-main home use exceeding 12 months by claiming that the period is multiple consecutive periods of less than 12 months Application date The proposed amendments would apply to residential land acquired on or after 27 March 2021. 11 Key features Multiple periods of less than 12 months The proposed amendment would change “a continuous period” to “one or more continuous periods” in section CB 16A(6)(b) to make it clear that a person could still qualify for the main home exclusion where they have multiple periods, each of less than 12 months, that do not meet the main home criteria. Non-main home use exceeding 12 months In addition, the proposed amendment to section CB 16A(6)(c) would require both the beginning and end of such a period that does not meet the main home criteria to adjoin either a period within the bright-line period that meets the criteria, or the first or last day of the bright-line period, for the main home exclusion to apply. This amendment would prevent back-to-back continuous periods that are each less than 365 days but together exceed 365 days from satisfying the criteria, as each of these periods would be adjoined to the other. The land would still need to meet the criteria at some point in the bright-line period (existing section CB 16A(6)(a)). As a result, the continuous period would need to adjoin at least one period where there was use of the property as the main home to qualify. 11 However, it would not apply to property acquired on or after 27 March 2021 as a result of an offer made by the purchaser on or before 23 March 2021, provided the offer could not be revoked before 27 March 2021. 103 Background Multiple periods of less than 12 months The main home exclusion from the bright-line test in section CB 16A applies where a property is the owner’s main home for the entire period it is owned, ignoring periods of less than 12 months where the property is not used as a main home. This 12-month buffer is intended to provide leeway for a taxpayer moving in or out of a property or, for example, renting out their home while they are overseas for a short period. It is not clear from the current wording of the legislation whether the 12-month buffer period can be used only once or multiple times. The policy intent is that a person can qualify for the main home exclusion regardless of how many periods they do not satisfy the main home criteria, provided no individual period exceeds 12 months. Non-main home use exceeding 12 months The current wording also provides that a period where a property is not used as a main home is treated as satisfying the main home criteria if, among other things, the period is a continuous period of 365 days or less and the beginning or end of that period adjoins a period within the bright-line period where the property is used as a main home. Because only one end of the non-main home use period needs to adjoin a period where the property is used as a main home, arguably back-to-back periods that together exceed 365 days could qualify for the main home exclusion. For example, if a taxpayer used the property as their main home, then went overseas and rented the property first to person A for 250 days and then to person B for 250 days, and then used the property as their main home again, arguably they could still qualify for the main home exclusion because each of these periods is less than 365 days. 104 HYBRID AND BRANCH MISMATCHES – IMPORTED MISMATCH RULE (Clauses 81, 82, and 127(10)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed remedial amendments address issues identified with the imported mismatch rule contained in the hybrid and branch mismatch rules (subpart FH of the Income Tax Act 2007). Application date The proposed amendments would apply from 1 July 2018 (when the hybrid and branch mismatch rules generally applied from), except for amendment four, which would apply for income years beginning on or after the date of enactment. Key features The proposed remedial amendments to the imported mismatch rule would: 1. Clarify that a deduction for a charge to a deducting branch in New Zealand is denied where the charge imports the benefit of an offshore mismatch into New Zealand. 2. Not deny a deduction (either wholly or partly) where a jurisdiction(s) in a chain of payments funding a mismatch has hybrid mismatch legislation. 3. Not deny a deduction where there is sufficient dual inclusion income for the payer of the funded payment. 4. Deny a deduction for payments that can be traced to a hybrid mismatch through loss grouping, group contributions of income, or consolidation. 5. Not deny a deduction for a payment that funds a mismatch where the mismatch is not due to hybridity. 6. Introduce two cross references into section YA 1 for terms defined in section FH 15(1) (“hybrid entity” and “hybrid mismatch”). Background The New Zealand hybrid and branch mismatch rules were enacted in 2018 in response to the OECD reports Neutralising the Effects of Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements – Action 2: 2015 Final Report” (the Hybrid Mismatch Report) 12 and Neutralising the Effects of Branch Mismatch Arrangements – Action 2: Inclusive Framework on BEPS (the Branch Mismatch Report). Issues have been identified in the imported hybrid and branch mismatch rules. In general, these issues arise where New Zealand’s rules do not align with the Hybrid Mismatch Report and the Branch Mismatch Report. 12 OECD. (2015). Neutralising the Effects of Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements, Action 2 – 2015 Final Report, OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, OECD Publishing, Paris at \[234\]. 105 New Zealand’s hybrid and branch mismatch rules seek to remove the tax benefit from various hybrid and branch mismatch arrangements. Hybrid and branch mismatch arrangements are cross-border arrangements that exploit differences in the tax treatment of an instrument, entity or branch under the laws of two or more countries to eliminate, defer or reduce income tax. All of the proposed remedial amendments in this section concern the imported mismatch rule. The imported mismatch rule generally denies deductions for payments made by New Zealand taxpayers where the payments fund a “hybrid mismatch” located offshore. The imported mismatch rule therefore prevents the benefit of the hybrid or branch mismatch being imported to New Zealand. It is the most complex of the hybrid rules, and for that reason, it only became fully effective for tax years beginning on or after 1 January 2020. Detailed analysis Denying deductions for charges that import the benefit of a hybrid mismatch into New Zealand The proposed rewrite of current sections FH 11(1) and FH 11(1B) would clarify that deductions generated by charges to branches 13 in New Zealand can be denied under the imported mismatch rule where the charge shifts the benefit of a hybrid mismatch into New Zealand. The introduction to the imported mismatches chapter of the Hybrid Mismatch Report provided that: The policy behind the imported mismatch rule is to prevent taxpayers from entering into structured arrangements or arrangements with group members that shift the effect of an offshore hybrid mismatch into the domestic jurisdiction through the use of a non-hybrid instrument such as an ordinary loan. The imported mismatch rule disallows deductions for a broad range of payments (including interest, royalties, rents and payments for services) if the income from such payments is set-off, directly or indirectly, against a deduction that arises under a hybrid mismatch arrangement in an offshore jurisdiction (including arrangements that give rise to DD outcomes). The key objective of \[the\] imported mismatch rule is to maintain the integrity of the other hybrid mismatch rules by removing any incentive for multinational groups to enter into hybrid mismatch arrangements. \[Emphasis added.\] While it is arguable that section FH 11 already denies a deduction for a charge, the proposed new language seeks to clarify the position. Proposed new section FH 11(1) would replace the opening text of the current section, which describes the payment or charge for which a deduction can be denied under the imported mismatch rule. The subsection excludes payments to, or charges made by, a person in a country that has hybrid mismatch legislation. Proposed paragraphs (a) and (d)–(g) of section FH 11(1B) would replace current paragraphs (a)–(e) of section FH 11(1) respectively. Table 2 provides details about each paragraph of the proposed section. 13 Typically, charges to branches are for cost of goods sold or interest on a notional loan. 106 Table 2: Commentary on proposed paragraphs (a)–(g) Paragraph(s) Comment Equivalent current paragraph (a) Proposed paragraph (a) requires that the original payment or charge provides funds for a payment (the funded payment). Whether a payment or charge “provides funds” for a funded payment is determined consistently with the approaches described in chapter 8 of the Hybrid Mismatch Report and chapter 5 of the Branch Mismatch Report (see proposed section FH 11(5)). 14 Paragraph (a) (b) and (c) These are new paragraphs and are described under “Chains of payments through jurisdictions with hybrid mismatch legislation”. None (d) and (e) Proposed paragraphs (d) and (e) implement minor amendments to current paragraphs (b) and (c) to ensure they apply correctly to charges. Paragraphs (b) and (c) (f) Proposed paragraph (f) relies on the new definition of “hybrid mismatch”. This new definition is described further under the heading “Limiting the rule to mismatches arising from hybridity” below. Paragraph (d) (g) Proposed paragraph (g) replicates current paragraph (e) but removes reference to the payer jurisdiction. With the new definition of “hybrid mismatch”, that reference is now unnecessary. (For more details see “Limiting the rule to mismatches arising from hybridity”.) Paragraph (e) Chains of payments through jurisdictions with hybrid mismatch legislation The imported mismatch rule can apply through a chain of any number of payments, any number of jurisdictions and in any direction (that is, up or down a corporate chain, or sideways). The imported mismatch rule currently does not apply to a payment where any of the following persons are in a jurisdiction that has hybrid mismatch legislation: • the recipient of the payment from the New Zealand funder • the person who makes the payment that constitutes the hybrid mismatch (located offshore), or • except in the case of a double deduction mismatch, the person who receives the payment that constitutes the hybrid mismatch (located offshore). Under the proposed amendments to clarify the application of the imported mismatch rule to charges, the rule would also not apply where a non-resident who makes a charge is located in a jurisdiction with hybrid mismatch legislation. In all these cases, any denial of a deduction in New Zealand would result in over-taxation. This is because the other jurisdiction with hybrid mismatch legislation would have first priority to either deny deductions or recognise income to counteract the benefit of the 14 However, section FH 11(5) would only apply for income years beginning on or after the date of enactment. 107 mismatch. However, another jurisdiction (other than those above) through which the chain of payments flows may have hybrid mismatch legislation with an imported mismatch rule that would deny deductions to address the mismatch. Further denial of deductions in New Zealand would result in the denial of two sets of deductions in respect of one mismatch and result in over-taxation. To prevent this over-taxation, the proposed amendment would ensure the imported mismatch rule only denied deductions in New Zealand for a payment that provides funds to the funded payment where: • First, the funds are provided to the payer either directly or indirectly through a series of further transactions (the intermediate transaction chain) that are each governed by the tax laws of countries or territories outside New Zealand (proposed section FH 11(1B)(b)). An intermediate transaction chain only comprises transactions further to (that is, other than) the original payment or charge and the funded payment. An intermediate transaction chain could comprise of simply one transaction. • Second, for each transaction in an intermediate transaction chain, each country or territory with tax laws that govern the transaction does not have hybrid mismatch legislation having an intended effect corresponding to section FH 11 (proposed section FH 11(1B)(c)). In effect, where there is only one intermediate transaction chain and a country governing a transaction along that chain is subject to hybrid mismatch legislation, then the imported mismatch rule would not apply to deny deductions. However, where an original payment or charge provides funds through multiple intermediate transaction chains to the funded payment, the deduction for the original payment or charge could be denied provided that at least one chain of transactions satisfies section FH 11(1)(b) and (c). New Zealand providing funds to funded payment through a single intermediate transaction chain Under the proposed section FH 11(1B), where the original payment or charge provide funds for the funded payment through a single intermediate transaction chain, and at least one of those transactions in the intermediate transaction chain is governed by a country or territory with an imported mismatch rule, then the deduction for the original payment or charge would not be denied in New Zealand. This is demonstrated in example 26. Example 26 Facts • A Co, B Co, C Co, D Co, and NZ Co are members of a control group. There is a D/NI outcome (hybrid mismatch) between A Co and B Co – there is a deduction created in Country B, without corresponding income in Country A. • NZ Co makes a payment to D Co, which provides funds indirectly through transactions (the intermediate transaction chain) from D Co to C Co and from C Co to B Co, to the funded payment (hybrid mismatch) between B Co and A Co. • C Co is located in Country C, which has hybrid mismatch legislation having an intended effect corresponding to New Zealand’s imported mismatch rule (hence it is shaded). Countries A, B and D do not have hybrid mismatch legislation. 108 Figure 1 D Co A Co C Co N Z Co interes t (D/NI) interest interest interest Country A Country B Country C Country D New Zealand B Co Analysis • Proposed section FH 11(1B)(a) would be satisfied as the payment from NZ Co provides funds for the funded payment (for the interest payment from B Co to A Co). • Proposed section FH 11(1B)(b) would be satisfied as the funds are provided to B Co indirectly through a series of further transactions (the intermediate transaction chain) that are each governed by the tax laws of countries or territories outside New Zealand. Those transactions are the interest payments from D Co to C Co and from C Co to B Co. • However, proposed section FH 11(1B)(c) would not be satisfied as at least one transaction in the intermediate transaction chain is governed by a country (Country C) that has an imported mismatch rule. • The deduction for the payment from NZ Co would therefore not be denied under the proposed amendments to section FH 11. New Zealand providing funds to funded payment through multiple intermediate transaction chains Where the original payment or charge can be said to provide funds indirectly to the funded payment through multiple intermediate transaction chains, and one of those chains contains a transaction that is governed by a country or territory with an imported mismatch rule, then the deduction for the original payment or charge could (to some extent) still be denied on the basis that the original payment or charge provides funds indirectly through other intermediate transaction chains to the payer for the funded payment. However, the extent to which such a deduction is denied would depend on sections FH 11(4) and (5). This includes first considering whether there is dual inclusion income in the payer 109 jurisdiction 15 and then second considering the tracing and priority rules provided in the Hybrid Mismatch Report and the Branch Mismatch Report (as is done under current legislation). The extent of the denial under New Zealand’s imported mismatch rule may depend on, for example, whether priority to deny a deduction is given to another country’s imported mismatch rule (for example, where another country is more proximate to the hybrid mismatch and triggers the direct imported mismatch rule) and therefore deductions in New Zealand should be partly or wholly allowed. This is demonstrated in example 27. Example 27 Facts • The facts are the same as in example 26 except that D Co also makes a direct interest payment to B Co. Figure 2 D Co A Co C Co N Z Co interes t (D/NI) interest interest interest Country A Country B Country C Country D New Zealand interest B Co Analysis • Proposed section FH 11(1B)(a) would be satisfied as the payment from NZ Co provides funds for the funded payment (from B Co to A Co). • Proposed section FH 11(1B)(b) would be satisfied as the funds are provided to B Co indirectly through a series of further transactions (the intermediate transaction chain) that are each governed by the tax laws of countries or territories outside New Zealand. Here, NZ Co provides funds indirectly through two intermediate transaction chains: – Chain 1: From D Co to C Co and from C Co to B Co (to the hybrid mismatch between B Co and A Co). 15 See the heading "Imported mismatches and dual inclusion income", describing an amendment to provide that deductions should not be denied under New Zealand’s imported mismatch rule to the extent a ‘hybrid payment’ (in New Zealand, a ‘funded payment’) is set off against dual inclusion income in the payer jurisdiction. 110 – Chain 2: From D Co to B Co (to the hybrid mismatch between B Co and A Co). • Proposed section FH 11(1B)(c) would be satisfied where for each transaction in at least one of the intermediate transaction chains described above, each country or territory with tax laws that govern the transaction does not have an imported mismatch rule. – Chain 1: Country C governs both of the transactions that comprise Chain 1. Country C has an imported mismatch rule, so paragraph (c) is not satisfied in respect of Chain 1. – Chain 2: Countries B and D govern the single transaction that comprises Chain 2. Neither of Countries B or D have an imported mismatch rule, so paragraph (c) is satisfied. • Provided all other requirements in section FH 11(1B) are met, then section FH 11(2) will deny a deduction in New Zealand for an amount (which could be zero). • The amount of those denied deductions (if any) is determined according to sections FH 11(3)-(5) as appropriate. This includes using the tracing and priority rules as provided in the Hybrid Mismatch Report and Branch Mismatch Report. – In this example, the direct imported mismatch rule provided in the Hybrid Mismatch Report would require that Country C first deny the deductions. – If the direct imported mismatch rule as applied by Country C does not fully neutralise the effect of the mismatch, then deductions for the original payment or charge would be denied in New Zealand sufficient to neutralise the effect of the mismatch. Tracing through loss grouping, group contributions of income, and consolidation Proposed section FH 11(5) is intended to allow tracing through tax grouping regimes. The proposed subsection provides that whether a payment or charge by a funder “provides funds” for a funded payment under section FH 11(1B)(a) is determined consistently with the approaches described in chapter 8 of the Hybrid Mismatch Report and chapter 5 of the Branch Mismatch Report. This would include determining whether there is a chain of payments (that is, an intermediate transaction chain) that establishes the original payment or charge provides funds indirectly to the funded payment. Those report chapters provide various methods for determining the payments that can be traced out from the hybrid mismatch and subsequently denied under an imported mismatch rule; such payments being called “hybrid deductions”. This essentially provides a method for tracing chains of payments from a hybrid mismatch out to, for example, New Zealand. A “hybrid deduction” is described in the Hybrid Mismatch Report (at \[243\]) as including hybrid deductions that are “surrendered to a group member under a tax grouping regime”. Further, examples 8.10 and 8.14 in the Hybrid Mismatch Report provide examples of the effect of such loss surrendering and the required tracing method. Proposed section FH 11(5) is intended to include any type of tax grouping regimes, including loss grouping, income grouping (under regimes providing for group contributions of income), and consolidation regimes. The amount by which the New Zealand original payment or charge funds the funded payment is to be determined consistently with the Hybrid Mismatch Report. An example of the application of proposed section FH 11(5) is demonstrated in example 28. 111 Example 28 Figure 3 A Co Interest ( D/NI ) Country A Country B New Zealand Interest N Z Co Tax los s grouping B Co 1 B Co 2 Tax loss grouping in Country B allows the benefit of the D/NI outcome to erode the New Zealand tax base: • There is a D/NI outcome between A Co and B Co 1 – a deduction created in Country B, without corresponding income in Country A. • The tax loss grouping available in Country B allows B Co 1’s loss (generated from the deduction from the D/NI outcome) to be offset against B Co 2’s income (generated from the payment from NZ Co). The payment from NZ Co to B Co 2 generates a deduction in New Zealand. • Overall, deductions are generated in New Zealand with no income elsewhere in the world. No income is generated in Country A, the income and deductions in Country B offset each other, and a deduction is generated in New Zealand. Similar analysis applies where B Co 1 and B Co 2 are subject to a consolidation regime or where a group contribution of income from B Co 2 to B Co 1 is allowed. Imported mismatches and dual inclusion income The Hybrid Mismatch Report indicates that deductions should not be denied under the imported mismatch rule to the extent a “hybrid payment” (in New Zealand, a “funded payment”) is set off against dual inclusion income (similar to surplus assessable income in section FH 12). New Zealand’s imported mismatch rule partially implements this through current section FH 11(3)(b) for structured arrangements. The amount of a denied deduction under section FH 11(3)(b) is equal to the amount of the funded payment that, if hybrid mismatch legislation were applied by the payer jurisdiction, would be disallowed as a deduction against income or equivalent tax relief. In other words, if the payer jurisdiction applied a dual inclusion income rule and some or all of the deductions in the payer jurisdiction would not be denied in such a situation, then some or all of the deductions in New Zealand under the imported mismatch rule would also not be denied. However, section FH 11(3)(b) only applies for structured arrangements (being arrangements priced assuming the existence of a hybrid or intended to rely on, or produce, a hybrid). No similar rule exists for unstructured arrangements. 112 Proposed section FH 11(4) would provide a test for unstructured arrangements similar to that provided in section FH 11(3)(b). Proposed section FH 11(5) would allow a carry forward of denied deductions to a later year when there is excess dual inclusion income. It provides that a deduction denied under the imported mismatch rule is allowed in a later income year to the extent that: • the payer jurisdiction would allow a deduction for the funded payment in the later income year if hybrid mismatch legislation were applied by the payer jurisdiction • the funded payment is funded by the denied deduction, and • the denied deduction meets the requirements of section FH 12(8) to be carried forward to the later income year as a mismatch amount. The amount allowed in New Zealand is proportional to the amount of deduction that is allowed in the payer jurisdiction. For example, assume the funded payment (hybrid mismatch) was $100, of which New Zealand funded $50 (that is, 50%). If $80 of dual inclusion income arose in a later year, the payer jurisdiction would allow a deduction in that year of $80. Given that the extent of New Zealand’s funding of the funded payment (hybrid mismatch) was 50%, then a $40 deduction would be allowed in New Zealand ($50 × $80/$100 = $40). Limiting the rule to mismatches arising from hybridity The current definition of “hybrid mismatch” could deny deductions for New Zealand payments that fund offshore payments that receive different tax treatments in different jurisdictions for reasons other than hybridity. For example, the jurisdiction receiving the hybrid payment may have no corporate income tax regime or have a territorial tax regime. Denying deductions in these situations is inconsistent with the intention of the Hybrid Mismatch Report, which was to only address mismatches that arise due to the different tax characterisations of instruments or entities. The proposed new definition of “hybrid mismatch” is intended to mitigate these concerns by using New Zealand’s hybrid and branch mismatch rules to determine whether a payment from a jurisdiction (the payer jurisdiction) is a hybrid mismatch. If an amount of a deduction for a payment would be denied by the payer jurisdiction if that jurisdiction had legislation having an effect corresponding to New Zealand’s hybrid and branch mismatch rules, then a hybrid mismatch arises. Practically, this would essentially require consideration of whether the deduction would be denied under New Zealand’s hybrid and branch mismatch rules if the payer was in New Zealand. Following, if the payer jurisdiction does, in fact, have hybrid mismatch legislation that counteracts the relevant mismatch in that jurisdiction, then no deduction exists in the payer jurisdiction, and therefore no “hybrid mismatch” will arise for the purposes of New Zealand’s imported mismatch rule. As a result of this proposed new approach, references to counteraction by the payer jurisdiction in current section FH 11(1)(e) would be removed in the proposed equivalent section FH 11(1B)(g). Cross-references to definitions Proposed cross-references from section YA 1 to the definitions of “hybrid entity” and “hybrid mismatch” in section FH 15(1) are to improve readability. No change of interpretation or meaning of those provisions is intended. 113 EARLY-PAYMENT DISCOUNT RATE CHANGES (Clause 111) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would alter the rate of the early-payment discount (EPD) from 6.7% to match the use of money interest (UOMI) credit rate plus 200 basis points. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the date of enactment. Background The EPD is intended to encourage early payment of provisional tax to relieve the financial strain associated with having to pay both terminal tax and provisional tax in the second year of business. The EPD rate was set at 6.7% when it was introduced in 2005 and has not been updated since. Consequently, it now represents a windfall for qualifying taxpayers. This change would align the EPD rate with the UOMI credit rate plus 200 basis points. The EPD would therefore retain its purpose of incentivising the early payment of provisional tax without representing a windfall for the taxpayers who use it. 114 RESTRICTED TRANSFER PRICING REMEDIALS (Clauses 51 and 86) Summary of proposed amendment Two proposed remedial amendments to the restricted transfer pricing rules would: • Ensure the deemed dividend arising when interest is disallowed under the restricted transfer pricing rules is calculated based on the amount disallowed under those rules rather than the arm’s length amount. • Ensure the third-party test for loans with terms of more than five years applies only when there is significant third-party borrowing with terms of more than five years. Application date The proposed deemed dividend amendment would apply for income years starting on or after 1 April 2022. The proposed five-year term amendment would apply from 1 July 2018. Key features Deemed dividend When interest is denied under the transfer pricing rules, the additional amount above the arm’s length amount is treated as a deemed dividend. However, in some circumstances, applying the restricted transfer pricing rules results in more interest than the arm’s length amount being denied. As the legislation does not contemplate this, the difference between the arm’s length interest and the allowable interest under the restricted transfer pricing rules retains its status as interest (albeit non-deductible to the borrower). The proposed changes would amend the rules so that the amount of a deemed dividend is calculated by comparing the actual amount of interest paid with the lower of the amount determined under ordinary transfer pricing rules and the amount determined under the restricted transfer pricing rules. Third-party test for loans of more than five years The third-party test to allow terms of more than five years when there is significant third- party borrowing with terms of more than five years currently compares the relevant individual cross-border related borrowing with borrowing from third parties. Proposed changes would amend this test so it compares the amount of all cross-border related borrowing with borrowing from third parties. 115 Detailed analysis Deemed dividend The general transfer pricing rules in sections GC 6 to GC 14 deny deductions for interest payments for cross-border related-party loans where the interest rate is above the rate for arm’s length conditions that would be agreed to by a third party in a comparable transaction. The restricted transfer pricing rules in sections GC 15 to GC 19 also apply to certain related- party loans between non-resident lenders and New Zealand resident borrowers. The rules alter the terms and conditions of a borrower and/or a loan before the general transfer pricing rules are applied to price the interest. When interest is denied under the transfer pricing rules, the additional amount above the arm’s length amount is treated as a deemed dividend by sections CD 39(5) and CD 39(8). In some circumstances, such as where there are uncommercial terms or conditions are being ignored, the restricted transfer pricing rules deny an additional amount of interest that would fall within the arm’s length amount. However, as section CD 39(8) does not contemplate this, the difference between the arm’s length interest and the allowable interest under the restricted transfer pricing rules retains its status as interest (albeit as non-deductible to the borrower). Therefore, the amount of denied interest and the deemed dividend do not match. The proposed amendment would change section CD 39(8) so that the amount of a deemed dividend would be determined by comparing the actual amount of interest paid with the lower of the amount determined under the ordinary transfer pricing rules and the amount determined under the restricted transfer pricing rules. Third-party test for loans of more than five years The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020–21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2021 amended section GC 18(4) to introduce a second method to allow a cross-border related borrowing to have a term of more than five years. This is provided the term of cross- border related borrowing is less than the weighted average term of third-party borrowing. As with other parts of the restricted transfer pricing rules, this is only available when there is significant third-party debt. The reason for this is to prevent a borrower having a small amount of expensive third-party debt and using that to justify a large amount of expensive related-party debt. As enacted, the amendments to section GC 18(4) allow terms of more than five years when the amount of the cross-border related borrowing is less than four times the amount of third- party borrowing. However, this test applies to each cross-border related borrowing at the time the interest rate is being determined. This makes it possible for a borrower to have multiple cross-border related borrowings that are each individually below the four-times threshold but, when viewed collectively, are above the threshold. This was not intended. The proposed amendment would change section GC 18(4)(b)(ii) so that the relevant test would be applied to the total value of all cross-border related borrowing rather than the specific cross-border related borrowing for which the terms and interest rate are being determined. 116 DEPRECIATION COST BASE INTEGRITY MEASURE (Clause 67) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment to the depreciation cost base integrity measure in section EE 40 would ensure it applies to non-residential buildings that were transferred to an associate when depreciation on non-residential buildings was 0%. Application date The proposed amendment would apply for the 2011–12 and later income years. Key features The proposed amendments to sections EE 40(2) and EE 40(3) would ensure that the depreciation cost base restriction in section EE 40(7) would apply where an associated vendor would have been allowed a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss for a non- residential building if the depreciation rate had not been 0%. Background The cost base that may be used for depreciation purposes where a purchaser has acquired depreciable property from an associated vendor is restricted to the cost of the property to the associate under section EE 40(7). This is an integrity measure to prevent the purchaser from claiming more depreciation than was available to the associated vendor. The restriction applies where the associated vendor was allowed a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss for the item either in the year it was transferred to the purchaser or in the previous income year (sections EE 40(2) and EE 40(3)). Non-residential buildings were depreciable at a rate of 0% from the 2011–12 income year until the start of the 2020–21 income year. Therefore, it is arguable that the cost base restriction does not apply to a non-residential building sold to an associate during the years where non-residential buildings were depreciable at 0%, as the associated vendor was not allowed a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss for the building. It was not intended that the cost base restriction would not apply because depreciation rates were set at 0%. 117 FOREIGN CURRENCY LOANS THAT FINANCE RESIDENTIAL RENTAL PROPERTY IN A FOREIGN JURISDICTION (Clause 70) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would amend the definition of “residential income” to include income that a person derives from a foreign currency loan to the extent the loan finances their residential portfolio. Application date The proposed amendment would apply for income years beginning on or after the date of enactment. Key features Under the proposed amendment, income that a person derives from a foreign currency loan under section CC 3 (Financial arrangements) would be residential income, for the purposes of section EL 3, to the extent the loan finances their residential portfolio. Background Deductions relating to a foreign currency loan that finances a residential rental property, including foreign exchange losses, are ring-fenced by section EL 4. However, foreign exchange gains on the same loan in a subsequent period cannot be offset against the ring- fenced deductions because this income is not included in the definition of “residential income” in section EL 3. The proposed amendment to the definition is intended to address this issue. 118 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX – UNCLASSIFIED BENEFITS PAID BY ASSOCIATES (Clause 114) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed changes would amend the unclassified benefits de minimis concession for fringe benefit tax (FBT). The amendment would exclude unclassified benefits paid by an employer’s associate to that associate’s employees from the calculation of the de minimis concession when the employer and their associate are not part of the same commonly owned group (as defined in section IC 3). Application date The proposed amendment would apply for the 2022–23 and later income years. This would be from 1 April 2022, except for employers calculating FBT on an income year basis. Key features The proposed amendment would exclude unclassified benefits paid by an employer’s associate to that associate’s employees from the calculation of the de minimis concession when the employer and their associate are not part of the same commonly owned group (as defined in section IC 3). Background Section RD 45 provides that if the amount of unclassified benefits provided by an employer falls below a de minimis, then FBT does not apply. An employer is only liable to pay FBT on unclassified benefits if they exceed $300 per individual employee per quarter or $22,500 of total benefits in four consecutive quarters. Existing section RD 45(6) expands the meaning of “employer” to include persons “associated” with the employer within the relevant period. This is intended to prevent benefits being provided by an associated employer or to employees of an associate, rather than directly, to effectively increase the amount of unclassified benefits being paid without being over the de minimis. However, benefits paid by an associate to that associate’s employees, even when the employer has no connection with or oversight of that associate, must also be taken into account when determining whether the de minimis in section RD 45 applies. These benefits are also less likely to be provided to avoid the de minimis. Detailed analysis Proposed new section RD 45 would clarify the categories of unclassified benefits that an employer must take into account when determining if they are liable to pay FBT. The existing categories that have been included in proposed new subsection (4) are: 119 • unclassified benefits provided by an employer to their employee • unclassified benefits provided by persons associated, at any time in the relevant period, with the employer to employees of the employer, and • unclassified benefits provided by the employer to employees of persons associated, at any time in the relevant period, with the employer. The proposed new category that would apply if the employer is a company: • Unclassified benefits provided by other companies that are part of the same group of companies as the employer, at any time in the relevant period, to employees of those other companies. This category would remove the need for an employer to consider unclassified benefits provided by an associate to the associate’s own employees. 120 ELECTION DAY WORKER TAX CODE (Clause 127(6)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would change the current definition of “election day worker” to extend access to the election day worker tax code to advance voting workers. Application date The proposed amendments would apply from 1 April 2022. Key features The proposed amendment would change paragraph (c) of the definition of “election day worker” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 so that it would apply to a person who works on any days on which voting is held in New Zealand for an election or poll. This would replace the current definition that only applies to a person who works on election day. The terms “Deputy Returning Officer” and “poll clerk” in paragraph (a) of the definition are no longer being used by the Electoral Commission, so the proposed amendment would replace these with “electoral official” in line with current practice. Background Election day workers are taxed through the PAYE system at a flat rate of 17.50 cents in the dollar (plus ACC earner’s levy). The rationale for this flat rate of PAYE was to simplify withholding for the Electoral Commission in dealing with a temporary work force. The current definition of election day worker applies to “work done or services rendered immediately before, on, or immediately after the day on which the election or poll is held”. However, this definition has been outpaced by both the growth in advance voting and the fact that many election workers work throughout the voting period. The proposed amendments to the definition would align with the current electoral process. Detailed analysis The issue with the current definition is that the work done or services rendered must be immediately before, on, or immediately after election or polling day. Advance voting can take place several weeks before the election or polling day and so most of the work associated with advance voting would not meet the current definition. The proposed amendment would decouple the definition from the election day or polling day and links it to days on which voting is held instead. This would capture those workers who work immediately before, on, or immediately after days where voting, including advance voting, takes place. 121 The proposed amendment would also specify that the work must be for voting held in New Zealand, as otherwise the definition may cover workers hired to facilitate overseas voting. These workers are not intended to be covered, so this addition is proposed to avoid confusion. 122 APPROVED ISSUER LEVY AND SECURITY TRUSTS (Clause 119) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would ensure that approved issuer levy (AIL) can still be paid where the approved issuer and the lender are only associated through a security trust. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 30 March 2017, the date section RF 12(1)(a)(iv) came into effect. Key features The proposed remedial amendment to section RF 12(1)(a)(iv) would ensure that AIL can still be paid where the approved issuer and the lender are only associated through a security trust. Background Under section RF 12, a borrower can pay AIL at the rate of 2% on interest payments to non- residents under registered securities. This is instead of withholding non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) at the rate of 15%. AIL is only available if (among other things) the borrower and the lender are not associated (as determined under the general associated person rules). However, section RF 12(1)(a)(ii) provides that AIL is still available if the parties are only associated because the lender is a beneficiary of a trust established for the main purpose of protecting and enforcing beneficiaries’ rights under the registered security (referred to as a security trust). This exception was included because security trusts are often used for bond issues and the limited rights they provide to the bond holders do not create the kind of commonality of interest that the associated person rules were intended to capture. Accordingly, it is appropriate for AIL to still be payable on bond issues that use a security trust to protect the rights of otherwise non-associated bond holders. However, the Income Tax Act 2007 was amended in 2017 by inserting section RF 12(1)(a)(iv). That section extended AIL unavailability for “related party debts” (as defined in section RF 12H), which includes loans between associated persons. Associated persons for this purpose would include those associated through a security trust. The consequence is that the requirement in section RF 12(1)(a)(iv) that a loan not be a “related party debt” effectively over-rides the exclusion from association for security trusts in section RF 12(1)(a)(ii), making that exclusion ineffective. This was not intended. Therefore, the proposed amendments to section RF 12(1)(a)(iv) would restore the effectiveness of the exclusion in section RF 12(1)(a)(ii). This would allow AIL to still be paid where the borrower and lender are only associated because the lender is the beneficiary 123 of a security trust. Section RF 12(1)(a)(iv) would still prevent AIL from being payable if the registered security is a related party debt for other reasons. 124 ELECTING INTO THE SECURITISATION REGIME (Clause 89) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would allow taxpayers to elect into the securitisation regime from the commencement of their securitisation arrangement. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the date of enactment. Key features The proposed amendment to section HR 9BA(1) would allow originators to elect into the securitisation regime from the commencement of their securitisation arrangements, rather than when their tax returns are filed. Background The Income Tax Act 2007 contains a specific regime for securitisations in sections HR 9–HR 10 and sections HZ 9–HZ 10. Under this regime, the originator of debt assets is treated as still owning them for tax purposes following their transfer to a special purpose vehicle (SPV). This allows the SPV to be tax neutral (that is, have no net tax obligations). The securitisation regime requires the originator, rather than the SPV, to satisfy all the tax obligations relating to the transferred debts. This means the originator must withhold and pay any non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) or approved issuer levy (AIL) on the interest payments by the SPV. Currently, an originator elects into the securitisation regime when it files its tax return for the relevant income year (section HR 9BA), and the election then has effect for that year. For NRWT and AIL (which are usually payable monthly), the election effectively applies retrospectively to the start of the income year. This was intended to avoid the need for a separate election process and reduce compliance costs. However, relying on the originator to elect into the securitisation regime in its tax return for the year exposes the SPV to the risk of unpaid tax (plus interest and penalties) if the election is not made. This risk has led to the securitisation regime being underused. To address this, the proposed amendment would allow the originator to elect into the securitisation regime from the commencement of the securitisation arrangement. 125 TAX POOLING AND EARLY-PAYMENT DISCOUNT SETTINGS (Clauses 112, 124, and 126) Summary of proposed amendment The four proposed remedial amendments to tax pooling and early-payment discount (EPD) settings would: • allow the use of tax pooling funds to mitigate use of money interest (UOMI) in the first year as a provisional taxpayer • allow purchased tax pooling funds to qualify for the EPD • restore the link between sections RP 19(2) and RP 19(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA), and • extend the definition of small-business person to include the shareholder of a look- through company (LTC). Application date The proposed amendments would apply from the date of enactment. Background Mitigating UOMI Under current settings, non-safe harbour taxpayers (those with residual income tax of more than $60,000) cannot use purchased tax pooling funds to mitigate UOMI in their first year as a provisional taxpayer. This is contrary to the policy intention. The availability of tax pooling is intended to reduce exposure to UOMI if there is uncertainty over the correct tax liability at the due date. As tax pooling is limited to satisfying taxpayer “obligations” (section RP 17) and initial provisional taxpayers are not “obliged” to pay provisional tax (section RC 3(3)), they cannot use purchased tax pooling funds to reduce their exposure to UOMI. Although section RP 17 now includes an obligation to pay terminal tax, the relevant credit date in section RP 19(3)(a), being the due date for terminal tax, is not early enough to affect the UOMI exposure from provisional tax installment due dates. Use of tax pooling to get the early payment discount In 2009, tax pooling was extended beyond provisional tax to include terminal tax. Consequently, a taxpayer who has no obligation to pay provisional tax (and therefore may qualify for an EPD) will still have an obligation to pay terminal tax, and tax pooling can be used to meet an obligation to pay that terminal tax (section RP 17). Such taxpayers qualify for the EPD if their income tax is paid before balance date and they can use their own deposited tax pooling funds to qualify for the discount. This is on the basis that tax pooling can be used to meet an obligation to pay terminal tax, and for own deposited funds, the credit date under section RP 19(3) is the date the funds were deposited. 126 However, the earliest credit date for purchased funds is the terminal tax date, so purchased funds would not qualify for the EPD. Previously, non-safe harbour taxpayers were generally able to use tax pooling and were credited with an EPD. However, following Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation, a transfer with a backdated effective date is no longer recognised for the purposes of the EPD if the date the transfer is processed is after the taxpayer’s balance date. The proposed amendment would bring the legislation in line with previous practice. This is considered the right policy outcome. Aligning disjointed provisions Previously, section RP 19(3) referred to section RP 19(2). However, in 2011, section RP 19(3) was amended to prevent an unintended ability to use tax pooling funds to eliminate imputation account debit closing balances. However, section RP 19(2) was not amended at that time, which has resulted in the sections not making sense when read together. The proposed amendment would restore the link by amending section RP19(3) to make it clear that purchased tax pooling funds can be transferred with an effective date that is on or after the first day of the relevant income year. Including look-through companies in the definition of “small-business person” Section RC 40 of the ITA contains some definitions for the EPD, including that it applies to a person who is self-employed or a partner in a partnership. This section was written before LTCs were introduced and was not updated following their creation. In an LTC, the revenue flows through to the owners as if it was their own income (much like a partnership). As a partnership is included within the definition of a small-business person, it follows that an LTC should also be included. The proposed amendment to section RC 40 to include LTCs for a small-business person is in line with the current treatment of partnership income in the hands of an individual. 127 CUSTODIAL INSTITUTIONS – DEFINITION OF END INVESTOR (Clauses 117 and 140) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment to the definition of an “end investor” would ensure that a custodial institution whose New Zealand operation is a fixed establishment of a non-resident entity could access the investment income withholding and reporting obligations as intended. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 April 2020 for the 2020–21 and later income years. Key features The proposed amendment would change the definition of “end investor” in section RE 10C(7) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section 25MB(8) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to include branches in New Zealand of non-resident custodial institutions. This would allow these branches to take advantage of the relaxed reporting and withholding obligations for custodial institutions. Background Custodial institutions act as a conduit between the payer of investment income and the ultimate owner of that income. New rules to clarify the investment income withholding and reporting obligations imposed on custodial institutions were introduced by the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act 2020 with effect from 1 April 2020. The rules provide for some relaxations of the strict requirements of the general withholding and reporting rules. The general rules place the obligation for withholding tax and reporting to Inland Revenue on the custodial institution that pays or transfers investment income to an end investor. An end investor can be resident or non-resident and may be a person or an entity. Where the income passes to a non-resident custodial institution, these reporting and withholding obligations are relaxed. Some custodial institutions operate their New Zealand business by way of a fixed establishment in New Zealand. It is intended that, in all cases, the New Zealand business should withhold tax and report to Inland Revenue when it pays or transfers investment income to an end investor. However, the New Zealand fixed establishment is not a separate legal person from the overseas parent. As fixed establishments are currently excluded from the definition of an end investor, those custodial institutions that use this business model are unable to access the relaxations of the rules available to others. This outcome is contrary to the policy intent. The proposed amendments are intended to address this. 128 CORPORATE SPIN-OUTS AND SHAREHOLDING CONTINUITY (Clause 129) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would prevent a spun-out company from breaching shareholder continuity requirements due to a corporate spin-out when there has been no change in ultimate ownership. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the date the Bill was introduced. Key features Proposed section YC 13(1B) would treat the notional single person that holds an interest in a spun-out company after a spin-out as holding the original parent’s interest in the spun-out company before the spin-out. Background For the purposes of section YC 13, a spin-out involves the shareholders in a parent company (the original parent) acquiring the shares in a subsidiary of the original parent (the spun-out company). Section YC 13 currently addresses shareholding continuity problems for subsidiaries of a spun-out company that are caused by a spin-out. However, under current law, tax losses and credits of a spun-out company itself can still be lost as a result of a spin-out even though, from an economic viewpoint, no change in ownership occurs because the company retains the same ultimate shareholders. The proposed amendment would address this specific shareholding continuity problem. However, it does not address all problems caused by spin-outs, as a broader set of rules regarding spin-outs would be complex and would have to undergo the usual tax policy processes. This is not possible within current timeframes. Detailed analysis Clarification of form of spin-out Section YC 13 applies to a form of spin-out described in section YC 13(1). Proposed section YC 13(1)(db) is intended to clarify that, in this form of spin-out, a notional single person would hold a voting interest or market value interest in the spun-out company after the spin-out. Rule for ownership of a spun-out company Proposed new section YC 13(1B) is intended to address shareholding continuity problems for a spun-out company. The proposed new provision would address these problems in a 129 similar way to how section YC 13(2) currently addresses the shareholding continuity problems for a subsidiary of a spun-out company. Under the proposed new provision, the notional single person that holds an interest in the spun-out company after a spin-out would be treated as holding the original parent’s interest in the spun-out company before the spin-out. However, this treatment would only apply to the extent a group of persons exists who hold common interests in the original parent and the spun-out company immediately after the spin-out, calculated on the assumption that the only interests in those companies are those held by a notional single person. 130 SHARE-FOR-SHARE EXCHANGES AND AVAILABLE CAPITAL DISTRIBUTION AMOUNT (Clause 53(1)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed changes would amend the calculation of the available capital distribution amount (ACDA) arising when a company (Acquirer) disposes of shares in another company (Target) acquired in a share-for-share exchange to a non-associated party. ACDA would be increased by the amount that was excluded from Acquirer’s available subscribed capital (ASC) by section CD 43(10) when those shares were acquired. This would allow a distribution of the same amount to not be treated as a taxable dividend upon the liquidation of Acquirer. Application date The proposed amendment would apply to distributions upon the liquidation of an Acquirer from the date of enactment. This may include distributions arising from the proceeds of the sale of shares in Target before this date. Key features A component of the ACDA calculation is capital gains. Capital gains arise under section CD 44(7) and include disposing of capital property for more than the cost of the property to the company (subsection (a)) and a capital gain distributed by a subsidiary upon its liquidation (subsection (c)). Proposed new section CD 44(7B) would provide for an additional capital gain amount equal to the amount that was excluded from Acquirer’s ASC under current section CD 43(10). This amount would arise when Acquirer sells some or all of its shares in Target to a third party. Background A share-for-share exchange is when the shareholders of a company (Target) transfer ownership of Target to another company (Acquirer) in exchange for shares in Acquirer. Two common applications of a share-for-share exchange are: internal restructuring to insert a holding company; and mergers/acquisitions where Acquirer purchases Target from a third party and issues shares in itself to Target’s former shareholders rather than paying cash. Generally, when property is contributed to Acquirer in exchange for shares, Acquirer’s ASC is increased by the value of the property at the time of the contribution. This amount can be distributed tax free on a share repurchase or liquidation of the company. However, if the property is shares in another company (Target), this is undesirable. For example, suppose Target is worth $500, and it has ASC of $100 and retained earnings of $400. If, by simply contributing Target to Acquirer, the contribution of Target’s shares to Acquirer increased Acquirer’s ASC by $500, the $400 of retained earnings would be able to 131 be distributed tax free (first as an exempt intercorporate dividend from Target to Acquirer, then as a liquidating distribution of ASC or share repurchase by Acquirer to its shareholders). To prevent this outcome, sections CD 43(9) and (10) limit the ASC of the shares issued by Acquirer to the ASC of the contributed shares in Target ($100 in the above example). This is known as the share-for-share ASC limitation. However, this response creates a flow-on problem if Acquirer sells Target and is later liquidated. The problem is easiest explained as a sequence of transactions: 1. The first transaction is a share-for-share exchange, where Acquirer acquires shares in Target from the Target shareholders in exchange for the issue of shares in Acquirer to the Target shareholders. The ASC of the issued shares is limited to the ASC of the Target shares under sections CD 43(9) and (10). The problem arises only if the ASC of the Target shares is less than their value (which it usually is). 2. The second transaction is the sale of Target by Acquirer. The gain or loss from this sale will be measured by comparing the sale price with the value of the Target shares when they were acquired by Acquirer in the share-for-share exchange. 3. The third transaction is the liquidation of Acquirer. This is the point at which the problem arises. Because of the ASC limitation referred to in step 1, the Acquirer shareholders are taxed on the liquidating distribution to the extent that it is funded out of the sale of Target and the sale proceeds recover the cost of the Target shares in excess of Target’s ASC. This means the Acquirer shareholders are taxed more heavily on the liquidating distribution than if the share-for-share exchange in step 1 had not occurred, in which case the Target shareholders would have either liquidated or sold Target directly. This is explained further in example 29. 132 Example 29: Problem under current law Acquirer has $500 retained earnings and $500 cash. Target has $300 ASC and $200 capital gain. If Acquirer was liquidated, Shareholder 1 would receive a $500 taxable dividend. If Target was liquidated, the $500 distributed to Shareholder 2 would be $300 ASC and $200 ACDA, so there would not be a taxable dividend. Instead, Target is acquired in a share-for-share exchange with Shareholder 2 on capital account. Target is subsequently sold to a third party for $500. Acquirer is liquidated immediately thereafter. Shareholder 1Shareholder 2 Acquirer $500 Cash $500 R/earnings Target $500 Asset $300 ASC $200 ACDA Acquirer shares Target shares Before After Shareholder 1 Disposal of shares Sale of shares $500 Cost $500 Capital gain/loss $ 0 Acquirer $500 Cash $500 Shares in Target $300 ASC $500 R/earnings Target $500 Asset $300 ASC $200 ACDA Distribution $1,000 Cash $ 300 ASC $ 700 Dividend Shareholder 2 Sale to third party Acquirer ACDA is $0. The $1,000 distributed would be $300 ASC and $700 taxable dividend. Taxable dividends are $200 higher than if the share-for-share exchange had not occurred. Detailed analysis When a shareholder is paid an amount in relation to a share on liquidation of a company, section CD 26 provides that the amount paid is a taxable dividend only to the extent to which it is more than the ASC per share calculated under the ordering rule and the ACDA per share. The ACDA per share is calculated by applying the formula in section CD 44(1): (receipt − ASC per share) × (capital gains + (capital property distributed − cost) − capital losses) ÷ (total receipts − total ASC) For the purposes of this formula, sections CD 44(7)(a) and CD 44(9) provide that “capital gains” and “capital losses” include a gain or loss on disposal of capital property. Although the ASC limitation in sections CD 43(9) and (10) reduces the additional ASC to Acquirer from the share-for-share exchange, it does not impact the cost of the Target shares, which will be equal to their market value. This means if Acquirer sells Target, its capital gain will only be equal to the increase in share value since the share-for-share exchange. This effectively means Acquirer’s shareholders will be taxed when the proceeds from the sale of Target shares are distributed, even though this would partially be a recovery of the cost. While removing the ASC limitation would allow these amounts to be distributed tax free to Acquirer’s shareholders, it would also allow these amounts to be distributed tax free without 133 selling Target or liquidating Acquirer. This would place Acquirer’s shareholders in a better position than if the share-for-share exchange had not occurred. Instead, the proposed amendment would create an additional capital gain that would flow through to the ACDA formula shown above. This would allow any gains that could have been derived by Target’s former shareholders by selling shares in Target to instead be distributed tax free as ACDA to Acquirer’s shareholders. 16 This capital gain would arise only when all of the following requirements are met: • target has been acquired by Acquirer in a share-for-share exchange that meets the requirements of section CD 43(9) • acquirer’s ASC uplift has been limited by section CD 43(10), and • acquirer has subsequently sold shares in Target to a third party. 16 This may include Target’s former shareholders unless they have sold their shares in Acquirer after the share- for-share exchange but before Acquirer is liquidated. 134 DEBT REMISSION WITHIN AN ECONOMIC GROUP (Clauses 50, 52, 53(2)–(3), 65, 80, 85, and 127(11), 127(14) and 127(15)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed remedial amendments would clarify the related party debt remission rule in section EW 46C and other associated provisions. Application date The first proposed amendment (relating to terminology) would apply for a person for the 2008–09 and later income years, except for an income year before the 2015–16 income year for which the person takes a tax position in a return of income that is inconsistent with the amendments. The other two amendments would apply from the date of enactment. Key features The proposed amendments would clarify the rules for debt remission within economic groups by: • clarifying that the related party debt remission rule applies to any type of remission, not only forgiveness • providing an available subscribed capital (ASC) increase to a resident company within a wholly-owned group of companies where a shareholder remits a debt owed by the company (without requiring the company to capitalise the debt), and • applying the related party debt remission rule to the remission of debt owed by a New Zealand branch of a non-resident company to a member of the same wholly-owned group. Background Generally, when debt is remitted the debtor derives taxable income to reflect that they are better off by the amount of debt they no longer have to pay. An exception to this is the related party debt remission rule. This rule provides that, in some circumstances, debt forgiven within an economic group is not income for the person who owes the debt (the debtor). This leads to the correct result, as bad debts are not deductible to an associated party creditor. There is therefore no income for the debtor and no deduction for the creditor, which reflects that net worth is unchanged from the remission when considered on a group basis. Three proposed remedial amendments would ensure that the related party debt remission rule operates as intended. 135 Detailed analysis Use of terminology The language in the debt remission rule is centred around the word “forgiveness”. However, the rule is commonly understood to apply to all types of debt remission (for example, when debt is not forgiven but is remitted by a court order or due to the passing of time). To align with current practice, proposed amendments to section EW 46C would replace references to “forgiveness” (and its derivatives) with “remission” (and its derivatives). Available subscribed capital Where a shareholder of a company remits a debt owed by the company, an increase in available subscribed capital (ASC) is permitted to recognise that the remission of a loan is in substance a capital contribution to the company. Currently, a resident company must capitalise the debt, but a non-resident is not required to do so in the same circumstances. A proposed amendment to section CD 43(6B) would allow the resident company to obtain an ASC increase where debt is remitted even when no shares are issued. Remission of debt owed by New Zealand branches of non-residents The related party debt remission rule only applies in limited circumstances to debt owed by branches of non-resident companies. Branches located in New Zealand are treated very similarly to New Zealand resident subsidiaries for debts owing. Where a New Zealand branch owes money to an associate that is a New Zealand resident or a non-resident with a New Zealand branch, an asymmetrical outcome arises because no deduction is provided to the creditor, but debt remission income is recognised for the New Zealand branch. Proposed amendments to section EW 46C(1)(a) would extend the debt remission rule to a New Zealand “fixed establishment”, provided it meets the other requirements in the debt remission rule that apply to New Zealand residents. However, this would be limited to apply only where the creditor does not receive a deduction on the remission of the debt (in New Zealand or offshore). 136 EMPLOYER SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTION TAX ON CONTRIBUTIONS FOR PAST EMPLOYEES (Clause 115) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would reduce the employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) rate on contributions for past employees from 39% to 33%. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 April 2022. Background In general, ESCT rates are designed to match an individual’s marginal income tax rate. However, a couple of exceptions exist where it is not practical to do so. While it is not common, some employers continue to make contributions after an individual leaves their employment. In these circumstances, a flat rate applies because an employer will not have up-to-date information for past employees to enable them to match an individual’s rate. At the time the 39% personal income tax rate was introduced, a decision was made to increase the rate of tax on employer superannuation contributions made for past employees from 33% to 39%. However, the 39% rate results in over-taxation in nearly all past employee cases. Reverting to a 33% rate would be more accurate and poses minimal integrity risk. Some employers who make contributions to defined benefit schemes elect to pay a flat rate of ESCT because they wish to avoid the administrative costs of allocating the contributions to specific employees. Employers would continue to be able to elect a flat rate of 39% when contributions are to a defined benefit scheme. This rate will remain 39% because use of the rate is not mandatory. Employers retain the ability to attribute contributions to defined benefit schemes to specific individuals using the usual ESCT rates. 137 DEFINITION OF “DECOMMISSIONING” IN THE PETROLEUM MINING REGIME (Clause 127(4)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments would modify the definition of “decommissioning” in the petroleum mining tax rules. The intention is to ensure that refundable credit claims for decommissioning expenditure only relate to expenditure on wells that have both contributed to further petroleum production and been permanently plugged and abandoned. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the date of enactment. Key features Proposed remedial amendments to the definition of “decommissioning”: • Exploratory wells that are geologically contiguous with a commercial well but that have not contributed to the commercial production of petroleum would be removed from the definition of “decommissioning”. • For clarification, the term “plugging and abandoning” used within the definition of “decommissioning” would be amended to “permanently plugging and abandoning”. Detailed analysis Since 2018, petroleum miners have been allowed a refundable credit for qualifying expenditure on decommissioning petroleum assets. Part of the definition of “decommissioning” in the Income Tax Act 2007 refers to plugging and abandoning certain types of wells, including production wells and other wells used in the commercial production of petroleum. Narrowing the scope of eligible wells Paragraph (b)(ii) in the definition of “decommissioning” in section YA 1 extends the scope to exploratory wells that are plugged and abandoned in a permit area together with a commercial well geologically contiguous with the exploratory well. This was intended to cover a situation where a petroleum miner delays plugging and abandoning an exploratory well in case it is used in future for water or gas injection (to extend the life of a geologically contiguous production well). The petroleum miner may be allowed a refundable credit if they decommission the exploratory well and the production well together as part of an arrangement. An unintended consequence of this paragraph in the decommissioning definition is that it is possible for expenditure on plugging and abandoning an exploratory well to be eligible for a refundable credit even if there was never an intention that the well might be used in the production process. This is exacerbated by the fact that the phrase “geologically contiguous” 138 is likely to be a broader term than what was contemplated at the time the definition was introduced. The proposed amendment would repeal this paragraph within the definition to narrow the scope of eligible wells to what was originally intended. Expenditure on decommissioning production wells and other wells used in the commercial production of petroleum would continue to be eligible for a refundable credit through the other existing parts of the definition. Clarifying that plugging and abandoning means doing so permanently A well can be suspended so that it does not create any environmental risks while a decision is made on what to do with it in future. However, the petroleum decommissioning definition only refers to the plugging and abandonment of wells and does not explicitly differentiate between a well that has been suspended, or plugged and abandoned temporarily, and a well that has been permanently plugged and abandoned. The proposed amendment would ensure that the definition refers to permanently plugging and abandoning wells. This would clarify that temporarily plugging and abandoning a well does not fall within the definition and would prevent petroleum miners from being allowed a refundable credit for expenditure on temporarily plugging and abandoning a well. 139 ABILITY TO REFUND ANCILLARY TAXES (Clauses 121 and 122) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments would deem the filing of an ancillary tax return to be an assessment for the purposes of sections RM 2 and RM 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007. This would ensure that amounts of overpaid ancillary tax can be refunded. Application date The proposed amendments would apply in relation to a return for an amount of an ancillary tax for a period regardless of whether the return was or is provided before, on or after the date of enactment. Detailed analysis Under current law, the filing of an ancillary tax return is not an assessment. The refund rules require an assessment before an amount of overpaid tax can be refunded. This means that, in most cases, no legislative ability to refund ancillary taxes currently exists. This is contrary to the policy intent of the refund rules. The proposed amendments would deem the filing of an ancillary tax return to be an assessment for sections RM 2 and RM 4 so that amounts of overpaid ancillary tax could be refunded. 140 AMENDING MEMORANDUM ACCOUNTS WHEN MAKING TRANSFER FROM PREVIOUS YEARS (Clauses 90, 98–107, 110, and 123) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments w ould permit imputation credit account (ICA) entries that result from a transfer of tax from a previous period to be made on the date that the taxpayer requests the transfer, rather than the effective date chosen by the taxpayer. This is as long as: • the ICA of the transferee is in credit on 31 March of the imputation year in which the effective date arises, and • the ICA of the transferor on 31 March of the imputation year in which the effective date arises was in credit by at least the amount of the transfer and any other transfers made during that imputation year. This change also extends to Māori Authority Credit Accounts (MACAs). Transfers made before the end of an income year would continue to be made in the current year. Application date The proposed amendments would apply from the date of enactment. Key features The proposed amendments would permit ICA entries resulting from a transfer of tax from a previous period to be made on the date that the taxpayer requests the transfer, rather than the effective date chosen by the taxpayer. This is provided that on 31 March of the imputation year in which the effective date arises: • the ICA of the transferee is in credit, and • the ICA of the transferor was in credit by at least the amount of the transfer and any other transfers made during that imputation year. This change would also extend to Māori Authority Credit Accounts (MACAs). Transfers made before the end of an income year would continue to be made in the current year. Background An issue has been raised that the current practice of taxpayers and Inland Revenue accounting for ICA/MACA entries may not be in line with a strict interpretation of the relevant legislation when making transfers between tax types or taxpayers. Under a strict 141 interpretation of the law, taxpayers who transfer tax between tax types or taxpayers must request the Commissioner make amendments to ICAs/MACAs that have already been included as part of a tax return filed with Inland Revenue, where those tax transfers occur at a date outside of the tax year in which the transfer is requested. However, in practice, entries to ICAs/MACAs from previous years are not amended to reflect a transfer of tax from a previous period to a future period. Rather, entries reflecting the transfer are included in the ICA of the year of transfer. The interpretation of current law can increase compliance and administration costs for both taxpayers and Inland Revenue for little to no gain where the respective accounts are in credit. It is preferable that the legislation be amended to allow transfers to be dealt with in the year of transfer, subject to certain requirements. Detailed analysis Section OB 4(4) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) sets out the credit dates for different types of debits and credits to a company’s ICA. An amendment proposes to insert paragraph (c) to this section for amounts transferred in a tax year from another period under sections 173L and 173M of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) and section RC 32(5)(b) of the ITA. Under proposed subparagraph (i), the credit date of these amounts would be the day on which the taxpayer requests the transfer, provided that the credit in the ICA equals or exceeds the amount of all transfers from that account requested in the tax year, and that the ICA to which the transfer is made is also in credit. If these requirements are not met, proposed subparagraph (ii) would clarify that the credit date would instead be the date of transfer, as defined in sections 173L and 173M of the TAA or section RC 32(5)(b) of the ITA. Proposed amendments to table O1 reflect the additions to section OB 4(4). More specifically, row 2 would be replaced with rows 2, 2B and 2C. Rows 2B and 2C would indicate the different credit dates as set out in sections OB 4(4)(c)(i) and OB 4(4)(c)(ii) respectively. Corresponding amendments are also proposed for section OB 32 and table O2, which pertain to the debit side of the ICA transfer. These proposed changes would also apply to debits and credits in MACAs (sections OK 2, OK 3, OK 11, OK 12 and tables O17 and O18). Transfers made under sections 173L and 173M of the TAA or section RC 32(5)(b) of the ITA during an income year would continue to use the dates prescribed by those sections. 143 Other remedials 145 EXTENDING USE OF MONEY INTEREST RELIEF DURING COVID-19 (Clause 169) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would modify the scheme that allows for an extension of use of money interest (UOMI) relief for taxpayers affected by COVID-19. The proposed changes would allow the scheme to be extended retrospectively and for a specific group of taxpayers described in an Order in Council. The proposed changes would also include a time limit of 36 months for extensions that could be set within an Order in Council. Application date The proposed amendments would apply from 25 March 2022. Key features The proposed amendments to the provisions for extending UOMI relief for taxpayers affected by COVID-19 would: • allow an Order in Council made under the scheme to describe a specific group of taxpayers the Order in Council applies to • change the time limit within which an Order in Council must be made to allow the scheme to be extended retrospectively, and • limit the time limit that can be set by an Order in Council to 36 months. Detailed analysis Section 183ABAB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 currently allows for the remission of UOMI for taxpayers affected by COVID-19, subject to meeting the criteria outlined in the section. Sections 183ABAB(4) and (5) allow the scheme to be extended by an Order in Council made on the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue. The proposed amendments would allow for an Order in Council made under either of these sections to specify a group of taxpayers the Order in Council applies to. This would enable UOMI relief to be extended for a specific group of taxpayers if that is preferred, rather than having a general extension for all taxpayers. This would mirror the equivalent provisions in section 183ABA, under which UOMI can be remitted for a specific group of taxpayers for emergency events. Given the timing difference between the current expiry date of the scheme of 24 March 2022 and the potential date of enactment of this Bill, it is also proposed that an Order in Council to extend the scheme could be made within six months of the scheme’s expiry date. This would allow the scheme to be extended retrospectively, which would ensure that an Order in Council made to extend the scheme could take account of these proposed amendments. 146 The proposed amendments would also include a 36-month limit on the length of the extension that could be set by an Order in Council. This would not limit the ability for such an Order in Council to be renewed. 147 INVESTMENT INCOME INFORMATION – ALIGNING FILING AND PAYMENT DATE FOR SIX-MONTHLY PAYERS OF INVESTMENT INCOME (Clause 141) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would align the investment income information filing dates for those payers of investment income who meet certain de minimis criteria with their six- monthly payment date. Application date The proposed amendment would apply for the 2022–23 and later income years. Key features The proposed amendment to the filing options under subpart 3E of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) would allow payers who meet the criteria set out in sections RE 21 or RF 13(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA), or section 89KA of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 (SCDA), to file their investment income information six-monthly. This would align with the payment date. Background Before 1 April 2020, the legislation contained a de minimis option that allowed payers of investment income who met certain criteria to file and pay resident withholding tax (RWT), non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) and the approved issuer levy (AIL) six-monthly. Under the post 1 April 2020 investment income reporting rules, such payers still have the six-monthly payment option but do not have a de minimis option of filing six-monthly. This places an undue compliance burden on payers who must now meet the requirements under the ITA, or the SCDA, to provide investment income information monthly. Reinstating a de minimis option by amending the investment income reporting rules in the TAA would allow payers that meet the criteria to file and pay six-monthly, as was the case before 1 April 2020. This would lower their compliance costs. A variation has been granted for the 2020–21 and 2021–22 income years to allow a six- monthly filing option consistent with the rules that applied before 1 April 2020. The proposed amendment would replace that variation on a permanent basis. 148 NON-ACTIVE ESTATES RETURN FILING (Clause 143) Summary of proposed amendment The Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) provides an exclusion for trustees of non-active trusts from their tax return filing obligations under section 43B. However, this section does not include non-active estates. This gives rise to a compliance cost that could be saved if the estate were able to apply for an exclusion under section 43B. The proposed amendment would amend section 43B to extend the non-filing provision to include non-active estates. Application date This amendment would apply from 1 April 2022. Background Executors and administrators of estates have an obligation to file income tax returns under section 43(1) of the TAA. This obligation means estates that do not derive income (non- active estates) are still required to file income tax returns. This can cause issues for executors and administrators of estates who may be obligated to file income tax returns for many years despite deriving little to no income. The TAA provides an exclusion for trustees of non-active trusts from their tax return filing obligations under section 43B. However, this section does not include non-active estates. This is because an estate is not a “trust” in the ordinary meaning of the word. While conflicting advice and interpretations of the section have been given over the years, causing confusion for executors and administrators, the current position is that estates cannot apply under section 43B (although testamentary trusts can generally utilise section 43B, as can executors and administrators that have reached the point of distribution where the property is to be held on trust for beneficiaries). The obligation to file gives rise to a compliance cost that could be saved if the estate were able to apply for an exclusion under section 43B of the TAA. Detailed analysis The proposed amendment would allow executors and administrators of non-active estates to apply for an exemption from filing where the non-active estate meets the requirements in section 43B(2). Executors and administrators of non-active estates that qualify would then be able to file an IR633 non-active declaration to exempt them from having to file income tax returns. 149 REPEAL OF INFORMATION SHARING CLAUSES FOR THE ACC AND THE REGISTRAR OF COMPANIES BY AN ORDER IN COUNCIL (Clauses 173(2) and 173(3)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would repeal clauses 36, 41 and 42 of schedule 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) on a date set by an Order in Council. Application date The proposed amendments would apply from a date set by an Order in Council. Background Inland Revenue is currently developing Approved Information Sharing Agreements (AISAs) with the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) and the Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment (MBIE). These two AISAs will replace existing information- sharing provisions in the TAA. The Privacy Act 2020 prevents two provisions for sharing the same information from being in place at the same time. This means that the relevant information-sharing provisions of the TAA would need to be repealed as the two AISAs come into force. As we cannot determine exactly when the new AISAs would take effect, the proposed amendment would repeal the relevant information-sharing provisions of the TAA on a date set by an Order in Council. 150 COMMISSIONER’S REMEDIAL POWERS – DISPUTABLE DECISIONS (Clause 155(1)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would clarify that the disputes and challenge processes in the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) do not apply to decisions of the Commissioner using the remedial powers in that Act. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the date of enactment. Key features The proposed amendment would clarify that the disputes and challenge procedures of the TAA do not apply for the purposes of resolving disagreements with the Commissioner about the application of the discretionary remedial powers. Background As a general rule, discretionary administrative matters left to the Commissioner under a provision of the Inland Revenue Acts should not be subject to the disputes and challenge procedures of the TAA. This reflects the fact that the purpose of the disputes process is to ensure that an assessment is as correct as practicable and to deal with any disputes over tax liability fairly, and efficiently. Sections 6C to 6G were inserted into the TAA in 2019. These sections contain remedial powers, including discretionary regulation-making powers that can be exercised in limited circumstances. These powers enable Orders in Council to be made on the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue to modify the application of tax laws. They also provide for exemptions to be granted by the Commissioner to exempt a person from provisions of tax laws where those laws contain minor errors or are otherwise unable to be interpreted as giving effect to intended policy outcomes. Generally, a six-week period of public consultation is required on any proposed Order in Council or exemption before it comes into force. This can be shortened or dispensed with if it is considered that a case of urgency exists. For the avoidance of doubt, the proposed amendment would clarify that a person cannot initiate the disputes and challenge procedures of the TAA for decisions made by the Commissioner to grant (or not grant) an exemption, or to shorten or dispense with the period of public consultation for proposed exemptions if the Commissioner considers a case of urgency exists. This would recognise that more appropriate mechanisms are in place for resolving issues about regulation-making powers, such as judicial review and the Regulations Review Committee. 151 Detailed analysis The proposed amendment to section 138E(1)(e)(iv) (Rights of challenge not conferred) of the TAA would include a reference to sections 6E (Exemptions granted by Commissioner) and 6F (Consultation on proposed modifications and exemptions). This would mean a person could not commence challenge proceedings against decisions made by the Commissioner under either section 6E or section 6F. It would also follow that the disputes process in the TAA would not apply to decisions made by the Commissioner under either of those provisions. This is because the disputes process cannot be initiated for issues for which a person has no right of challenge under the TAA. 152 CHALLENGE NOTICES – WHETHER REQUIRED AFTER AMENDED ASSESSMENT ISSUED (Clause 148) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would clarify that the Commissioner is not required to issue a challenge notice where, following completion of the disputes process in a taxpayer-initiated dispute, an assessment is issued that reflects some but not all of the adjustments proposed by the taxpayer. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the date of enactment. Key features The proposed amendment would clarify that the Commissioner is not required to issue a challenge notice following completion of a taxpayer-initiated dispute where the Commissioner issues an amended assessment, and the taxpayer has challenge rights pursuant to the amended assessment. Background In taxpayer-initiated disputes, the Commissioner is required to issue a challenge notice to mark the end of the disputes process under the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). The challenge notice then forms the basis for the taxpayer to commence proceedings with either the High Court or the Taxation Review Authority. The issue is that it is unclear whether the Commissioner needs to issue a challenge notice in circumstances where, at the end of the disputes process, the Commissioner issues an amended assessment that reflects some, but not all, of the taxpayer’s proposed adjustments. In such circumstances, if the Commissioner were to issue a challenge notice, there would seem to be two bases on which a taxpayer could commence challenge proceedings: • the first is where an amended assessment has been issued: section 138B(2) of the TAA, and • the second is where a challenge notice has been issued: section 138B(3) of the TAA. It is not intended that two separate bases exist for a taxpayer to commence challenge proceedings with a hearing authority. Further, the Commissioner should not be required to issue a challenge notice to mark the end of the disputes process where an amended assessment is issued. This is because the amended assessment should form the basis of any challenge proceedings. The proposed amendment would clarify that a challenge notice would not be required to be issued where, following completion of the disputes process, an amended assessment was 153 issued that reflected some, but not all, of the adjustments proposed by the taxpayer, and the taxpayer could initiate challenge proceedings on the basis of the amended assessment. Example 30 A taxpayer issues the Commissioner with a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) that raises two different issues. The Commissioner concedes the first issue but, following completion of the disputes process, does not concede the second issue. The Commissione r then issues an amended assessment that reflects an assessment the Commissioner considers to be correct, taking into account the effect of the first issue raised in the taxpayer’s NOPA but ignoring the second issue. In example 30, the taxpayer could commence challenge proceedings in accordance with the procedure outlined in section 138B(2) of the TAA – that is, by filing proceedings in accordance with the Taxation Review Authority Regulations 1994 or the High Court Rules 2016 within the response period following the issue of the amended notice of assessment. 154 REMOVING FAX AS A MODE OF COMMUNICATION (Clauses 41, 128, 136, 137, 138, 199, and 200) Summary of proposed amendment Given the increasingly digital way we work and the inability for our technology partners to continue to support faxes, Inland Revenue is no longer able to accept faxes. The proposed amendments would remove fax as an approved method of communication between a person and the Commissioner in the Inland Revenue Acts. Application date The proposed amendments would apply to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 for taxable periods starting on or after the date of enactment. The proposed amendments would apply for other Inland Revenue Acts from the date of enactment. Detailed analysis Currently, faxes are an approved method of communication (along with personal delivery, post, and electronic means) between a person and the Commissioner in the Inland Revenue Acts. However, as faxes will no longer be supported by 31 August 2021, the legislation should be amended to reflect this. The proposed amendment would also clarify the position for persons communicating with the Commissioner. The proposed amendment would remove all references to fax in the Inland Revenue Acts. The proposed amendment would amend sections 14, 14F and 14G of the Tax Administration Act 1994, section YA 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007, section 75B of the Goods and Services Act 1985, and sections 211 and 212 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011. 155 R&D TAX INCENTIVE – EXTENSION OF DUE DATES (Clauses 142 and 145) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments would extend certain due dates for years one and two (2019–20 and 2020–21) of the R&D Tax Incentive (RDTI) to 31 August 2021. Application date The proposed amendments would apply from 1 April 2019 for year one supplementary returns and from 1 April 2020 for year two approvals. Key features The proposed amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 would extend RDTI due dates to 31 August 2021 for: • year one (2019–20) income year supplementary returns (proposed new section 33F), and • year two (2020–21) income year general approvals and criteria and methodologies approvals (proposed new section 68CF). If a taxpayer has a late balance date that results in their due date being later than 31 August 2021, then this later due date would remain. Supplementary returns, general approvals and criteria methodologies approvals submitted after pre-amendment due dates, but before 1 September 2021, would be processed by Inland Revenue once the Bill has been enacted. 156 R&D TAX INCENTIVE – TAX YEAR CUT-OFF FOR CLAIMING SUPPORTING ACTIVITIES (Clauses 92 and 144) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would permit supporting activity expenditure that arises one year before or one year after a relevant core R&D activity to be eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive (RDTI). Application date The proposed amendments would apply for the 2020–21 and later income years, and would permit supporting activity expenditure incurred from the 2019–20 and later income years to be claimed. Key features The proposed amendments would: • include supporting activity that occurs up to one year before and one year after a relevant core activity in the definition of “eligible R&D expenditure” in section LY 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) so that it would be included in the calculation of a person’s tax credit under section LY 4, and • allow for the variation of a general approval under section 68CB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) to give businesses time to seek approval for supporting activities occurring the year before or after the core activity. Detailed analysis Supporting activities outside the year the core activity is performed Supporting activity expenditure is intended to only be eligible for the RDTI where a corresponding core activity has commenced (as this means there is R&D activity). Section LY 3 of the ITA gives effect to this policy by requiring a core activity to exist in the income year for any credit to be claimed. However, using the concept of an income year unintentionally resulted in some arbitrary exclusions from eligibility where the expenditure was incurred outside the income year in which the core activity occurred. For example, expenditure incurred on a pre- commencement supporting activity in March 2021 is currently ineligible if the core activity does not start until a month later in April 2021. If both happened in April 2021, then all expenditure would be claimable. A similar scenario occurs if expenditure for a supporting activity relating to the end of an R&D activity is incurred in the tax year after that core activity concludes. The proposed amendment would amend the definition of eligible R&D expenditure in section LY 5 by inserting section LY 5(1) (ab). This paragraph would include expenditure 157 incurred on a supporting activity occurring up to one year before or one year after the relevant core activity commences or ceases, respectively, in the calculation of a person’s tax credit in section LY 4. The effect would be that pre- and post-core supporting activity expenditure or loss would be claimable in the year of the core activity. For example, if pre- core supporting activity expenditure arose in the 2019–20 income year, it could be claimed in the 2020–21 supplementary return if there was a core activity in that year. For post-core supporting activity, the expenditure would be claimed in the supplementary return for the year prior, where the core activity occurred. For example, post-core supporting activity in 2022–23 could be claimed in the 2021–22 supplementary return. This might require re- opening the assessment for that year. As the supporting activity would be claimed in the income year the core activity occurs in, it would count towards the various caps for that year, for example, the $120 million total cap on expenditure in section LY 4(3)(i). Variation powers R&D activities (core and supporting) are only eligible for the tax credit if they are pre- approved as part of the “general approval” process (section 68CB of the TAA). A general approval must be submitted by the 7 th day of the second month after the end of the relevant income year. For example, a standard balance date payer must submit their general approval for the 2021-22 income year by 7 May 2022. This creates a timing issue for post- core supporting activities where a business does not anticipate in time that it will have claimable supporting activity in the following year under these rules. Proposed new section 68CB(7B) of the TAA would give the Commissioner the power to vary a general approval to include supporting activity that occurs in the year after the relevant core R&D activity and would therefore be able to be included in a business’ tax credit calculation under section LY 5. A variation must be applied for on or before the 7 th day of the 14 th month after the end of the relevant income year. Example 31 Whizzy Ltd (standard balance date) started their R&D eligible project in the 2020–21 income year. A general approval was sought for their 2020–21 core and supporting activities. However, towards the end of the 2020–21 income year, Whizzy Ltd’s health and safety team put an abrupt end to their R&D work. Whizzy Ltd has some unexpected supporting activity occurring in the 2021–22 year, but this was not included in the general approval. Section 68CB(7B) would give Whizzy Ltd until 7 May 2023 to vary its 2020–21 general approval to include the supporting activities that occur in the one year after the end of its core R&D activity. If this process occurs after Whizzy Ltd files its supplementary return for the 2020–21 income year (due 31 April 2022), it would also need to request an amendment under section 113 of the TAA to revise its eligible expenditure amount upwards. A transitional variation power is also proposed in new section 68CB(7C) for pre-core supporting activity arising in the 2019–20 income year. Businesses would have until 31 August 2022 to apply to include any supporting activities in their general approval for the 2020–21 income year. This short-term variation power is proposed as the due date for these general approvals would have passed before any legislation could be enacted permitting the activities to be claimed. This issue will not arise from the 2021–22 income year onwards as the business will be able to establish whether it had any eligible pre-core supporting activity in the one year prior when it submits its general approval for the particular year. 158 Example 32 Fizzy Ltd has supporting activity expenditure in the 2019–20 income year but the core activity only starts in the 2020–21 year. Fizzy Ltd should be able to claim the 2019–20 supporting activity expenditure in its 2020–21 supplementary return, but to do so the activity must have been approved in a general approval for the 2020–21 year. Fizzy Ltd has until 31 August 2021 to submit its general approval under section 68CF of the TAA (the extended due date). Up until 31 August 2021, Fizzy Ltd could request that the Commissioner vary the approvals in the general approval. However, proposed new section 68CB(7C) would give Fizzy Ltd until 31 August 2022 to vary its 2020–21 general approval to include the supporting activities that occur one year before its core R&D activity (2019–20). 159 R&D TAX INCENTIVE – TRANSITIONAL SUPPORT PAYMENT (Clauses 56, 64, and 132) Summary of proposed amendment Two proposed amendments to the proposed R&D Tax Incentive (RDTI) Transitional Support Payment (TSP) would: • set the tax treatment of the TSP payment (taxable with corresponding expenditure deductible), and • clarify that an existing exclusion from the RDTI for expenditure covered by a grant does not include the TSP. Application date The proposed amendments would apply for the 2019–20 and later income years. Key features Proposed new section CX 47(5) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) would ensure that section CX 47 does not treat the TSP (which may be a government grant) as excluded income. The result would be that the TSP is taxable and must be returned as income by the recipient business in the tax return for the income year the payment is received. A corresponding amendment proposed for section DF 1(1BA) would carve out the TSP from the general rules that make expenditure corresponding to a government grant non-deductible. The result would be that expenditure covered by the TSP would be subject to the normal deductibility rules in part D. Schedule 21B part B of the ITA excludes certain expenditure from being eligible for the RDTI. Clause 21 covers expenditure or loss that is a “precondition to, subject to the terms of, or required by, a grant” ineligible for the RDTI. The proposed amendment to this clause would ensure that receipt of the TSP does not make any expenditure or loss ineligible for the RDTI. Background The Government has agreed to implement the TSP to provide additional support for former Callaghan Innovation Growth Grant businesses transitioning to the RDTI. The Growth Grant, which ended in March 2021, was the main R&D support product for these businesses before the introduction of the RDTI. The TSP will take the form of an adjustment to a business’s RDTI entitlement so that it approximates what it would have received under the Growth Grant if that scheme had continued. It is available for the 2019–20 to 2021–22 income years. To claim the TSP, businesses must have been a former Growth Grant recipient and participate in the RDTI for 160 the relevant year. The details of the TSP were set by the Minister of Research, Science and Innovation in a Ministerial Direction notified in the New Zealand Gazette. 17 The tax treatment of the TSP proposed by the amendment would be consistent with an option to treat the Growth Grant as taxable income provided for in the ITA (section CX 47(4)). This optional treatment recognised that the business may receive the grant in a different income year to when the corresponding expenditure arose. The same situation would occur in most cases for the TSP. Treating the payment as taxable, as with the Growth Grant, would eliminate significant compliance costs and the need for a business to later amend a previously filed tax return to reverse deductions that were no longer allowed. Similarly, it is desirable to treat deductible expenditure in a matching way. That is, instead of expenditure being treated as non-deductible where the grant is non-taxable, the normal tax treatment would apply. This would eliminate difficult tracing and measurement or apportionment costs for the business and the need to seek an amended return. 17 Woods, M. (6 July 2021).

Following enactment, officials identified a group of minor and technical remedial changes to the Child Support Act 1991 (CSA) that are needed to give full effect to the policy intent of the recent amendments. Application date The proposed amendment to the write-off rules would apply from 1 April 2021. This is for consistency with the repeal of certain types of penalties under the CSAA. The other proposed amendments would apply from 1 April 2022. Key features Table 3 summarises the proposed minor and technical remedial amendments to the CSA. Table 3: Child support issues and proposed amendments Topic Issue Proposed amendment Estimations The CSAA allows newly liable parents to backdate their estimations (provided the estimation is made within 28 days of the notification of the assessment). It was intended that the backdating would cover estimations both over back years and within the current child support year. However, the amendment only allows estimations over back years. The proposed amendment would allow backdated estimations within the current child support year. Currently, a person could provide their initial estimate within 28 days and then submit a re- estimate within the same time period. Inland Revenue has no ability to refuse subsequent backdated estimations made by a newly liable parent. The proposed amendment would allow subsequent backdated estimations to be declined because the period has ended and would be squared up. 162 Topic Issue Proposed amendment End-of-year reconciliation The new definition of “reconciliation period” under the CSAA does not result in the correct outcome for new backdated estimations. Currently, the definition refers to the first day of the month in which notice is given. Because the estimation is backdated, it will be given after the start date of the assessment. This means that if the reconciliation period begins on the first day of the month in which the notice of election is given, the reconciliation period will start too late to cover the correct period. The proposed amendment would allow backdated estimations within the current child support year. Change of family circumstances The CSAA allows Inland Revenue to backdate an assessment to correct certain living circumstances that did not exist at the time of an initial assessment. Currently, Inland Revenue is not required to be satisfied that a relevant set of circumstances existed at the time of the assessment. Additionally, there is no requirement that the notification be accompanied by documentation. The proposed amendment would ensure that Inland Revenue could be satisfied that the relevant circumstances existed at the time of the assessment, and also that the notification be accompanied by relevant documentation. Currently, the relevant provision refers to circumstances that existed at the time the assessment was made, as opposed to when it began. It is possible that family circumstances change between a child support application beginning and when the child support notification is made. The proposed amendment would clarify that the relevant circumstances are those that existed when the assessment begins. Time bar The CSAA restricts reassessments of a child support year to four years from the end of a relevant child support year. Parents and carers are sent notification of their child support assessment in February each year and that assessment relates to the child support year starting on 1 April. As currently drafted, the time bar starts from the notification rather than the beginning of the relevant child support year. The proposed amendment would allow the time bar to begin from the beginning of the child support year, rather than when notification of the assessment is given. This would ensure that it covers the intended four- year period. The CSAA provides an exception to the four- year time bar in circumstances where a liable person has a dual liability with an overseas jurisdiction. Currently, the exception refers to the payment of child support, as opposed to having been assessed to pay financial support. This means that the liable person must have “paid” financial support before the exception can be applied. However, at times dual liability may exist but neither liability has been paid, and this means Inland Revenue cannot apply the exception. The proposed amendment would allow the exception to apply on assessment of a liability. 163 Topic Issue Proposed amendment Temporary exemption The CSAA introduces a new temporary exemption from paying child support for people who have a long-term illness or injury and who are subsequently unable to engage in paid work. Currently, an application only requires evidence that an individual has a long- term period of illness. The proposed amendment would require an individual to provide evidence that they are unable to engage in paid work when submitting an application. Offsetting The CSAA allows Inland Revenue to offset child support amounts between parents without the person having to apply for an administrative review. However, it does not currently allow offsetting to occur under a voluntary agreement. The proposed amendment would allow for the offsetting of a voluntary agreement. Write-off rules Inland Revenue can write off debt, including penalties, when a liable person or receiving carer dies. Currently, the relevant provision uses outdated terminology. The proposed amendment would update the terms used. Repeal of transitional provision The CSAA includes a transitional provision to establish that the amendments introduced do not affect the 2020–21 child support years and earlier. This is not required. The proposed amendment would repeal the transitional provision that is not required. Child expenditure table The CSAA removed the mixed aged bracket of the expenditure table for calculating a rate of child support. However, the heading still contains the words “or the oldest three”. The proposed amendment would correct the heading. Background In October 2021, the child support scheme will move to new systems and processes under Inland Revenue’s multi-year Business Transformation. This move will allow a greater degree of efficiency and simplicity, and it will also create opportunities for legislative changes to further improve the administration of the child support scheme. The policy changes in the CSAA take advantage of this opportunity. Following enactment, officials identified a group of minor and technical remedial changes to the CSA that would be needed to give full effect to the policy intent of the recent amendments. 164 REMOVAL OF THE POWER TO REPEAL THE SFO INFORMATION SHARING CLAUSE (Clause 201) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would remove the power to repeal clause 7 of schedule 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) by an Order in Council. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the date of enactment. Background The Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act 2020 provides for clause 7 of schedule 7 of the TAA to be repealed on a date to be appointed by an Order in Council. This Order has not been made. This empowering provision was enacted ahead of the implementation of the Serious Crime Approved Information Sharing Agreement (AISA), which was then progressing. The provision was intended to enable the AISA to be implemented correctly and to avoid two authorising provisions (the clause and the AISA) from being in place at the same time. It has since transpired that, due to the information being shared, it is not necessary to repeal the clause. The proposed amendment would remove the power to repeal the clause by an Order in Council. 165 DEFINITIONS OF “SENSITIVE REVENUE INFORMATION” AND “REVENUE INFORMATION” (Clause 139) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments would clarify the definitions of “revenue information” and “sensitive revenue information” in section 16C(2) and section 16C(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 for the avoidance of doubt in their interpretation. Application date The proposed amendments would apply from 18 March 2019. Background If a court took a broad interpretation of “revenue information” and “sensitive revenue information”, all information held by the Commissioner (including non-tax related information) would need to be treated as sensitive revenue information. As a result, information that could be released by any other government agency, such as the number of lightbulbs purchased in a year, would have its release restricted for Inland Revenue. Therefore, a broad interpretation would negatively affect the interpretation and application of the confidentiality rules, which were modernised in 2019 with the aim of enabling more information held by Inland Revenue to be made available than previously. These rules are not intended to impose restrictions on information held by Inland Revenue with no real connection to either the Commissioner or to Inland Revenue’s responsibility for tax law and the administration of the tax system. Therefore, amendments are proposed to clarify the relevant terms and prevent broad interpretations. Practically this would have no implications for taxpayers or their information. 166 REPEAL OF TRANSITIONAL CO-EXISTENCE PROVISIONS (Clauses 157–159(1)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments repeal provisions in sections 139A(10), 139AA(7) and 139B(1B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) that relate to the co-existence of two software platforms. From 1 April 2022, only one software platform will be operating. Application date The proposed amendments would apply for penalties imposed after 1 April 2022. Background Inland Revenue has been updating its software platform as part of its Business Transformation (BT) programme. During the duration of that programme, several transitional provisions were introduced to support co-existence of the old platform, FIRST, and the new START platform. In October 2021, the final stage of BT will see all tax products migrated to the new START platform, with FIRST being decommissioned, and the transitional provisions relating to the co-existence of two software platforms will no longer be required. The proposed amendments would remove those provisions from sections 139A, 139AA and 139B of the TAA. 167 AMENDING AND LATER REPEALING THE DEFINITION OF “START TAX TYPE” (Clauses 135(6 – 7), and 170) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments would add three new tax types to the definition of “START tax type” in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) from 1 March 2021 and then repeal the definition of “START tax type” from 1 April 2022 because all tax types will have been migrated into the START system by that date and the definition will be redundant. Application date The proposed amendment to add three new tax types to the definition of “START tax type” would apply from 1 March 2021. The proposed amendment to delete the “START tax type” definition would apply from 1 April 2022. Background Inland Revenue has been progressively adding tax types from its old technology platform, FIRST, to its new START system as part of its Business Transformation programme. From 1 March 2021, three new tax types (casino duty, lottery duty, and totalisator duty) were added to the START system. The proposed amendment would add those tax types to the definition of “START tax type”. This definition is used in section 183C of the TAA, which relates to the cancellation of interest. In October 2021, Inland Revenue will complete its shifting of all tax types to START. At that point, the definition of “START tax type” will be redundant, and it is proposed the definition be repealed from 1 April 2022. Consequential amendments are also proposed to section 183C of the TAA to replace references to “START tax type” once the definition is repealed. 168 PREVENTING CIRCULARITY OF KIWISAVER EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS (Clause 188(3)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment to the definition of “employer contribution” in section 4 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 (KSA) would provide that an employer need not pay an employer KiwiSaver contribution if the employer knows that the employee has opted out. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the date of enactment. Background Under section 93 of the KSA, an employer is required to pay all amounts of employer KiwiSaver contributions to the Commissioner. Where an employee opts out of KiwiSaver, Inland Revenue is required to refund that money to the employer under section 100 of the KSA. However, the interaction of section 93 and section 100 can produce a circularity of cash flow by requiring the employer to pay a KiwiSaver contribution to Inland Revenue that Inland Revenue must in turn refund to the employer. This specifically arises where the employer owes KiwiSaver employer contributions in connection with a period that precedes the employee having opted out of KiwiSaver, and the employer has not yet received a notice to cease payment of KiwiSaver employer contributions from Inland Revenue after the employee has opted out of KiwiSaver under section 19 of the KSA. The proposed amendment would exclude an amount from being an employer contribution if the employer knows that the employee has opted out. 169 ACC AND KIWISAVER BEING MADE SUBJECT TO A TIME BAR (Clauses 146, 147, 149–151, 154, 156, 189–191, and 193–197) Summary of proposed amendment This proposed amendment would introduce a four-year time bar on increased and decreased assessments of KiwiSaver employer and employee deductions and increased assessments of ACC earners’ levy deductions. This treats KiwiSaver employer and employee deductions and ACC earners’ levy deductions the same as other PAYE deductions for time bar purposes. Application date The proposed amendments would apply from the date of enactment. Key features Proposed new section 108AB would be inserted into the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). The provision would apply to both employer and employee deductions and provide a four-year time bar on amended assessments of KiwiSaver deductions (both employer and employee) that increase an amount assessed. However, where the employer information provided by the employer is fraudulent or wilfully misleading, the Commissioner would be able to amend an assessment at any time to increase the amount assessed. A proposed new paragraph inserted into section 108(1C) of the TAA would provide that the Commissioner may not amend an assessment of ACC earners’ levy deductions to increase the amount of an assessment after a period of four years from the date the employer provided the return. Proposed new section 91B would be inserted into the KiwiSaver Act 2006 (KSA). This section would provide that the Commissioner and KiwiSaver providers must not refund employee and employer contributions after the four-year period under section 108AB has ended. There are also several consequential amendments proposed to the TAA and the KSA to give effect to these changes. More time is required to work through how a time bar on refunds for overpayments of ACC earners’ levy deductions would apply and any changes will be included in a future Bill. Background The TAA imposes a four-year time bar on the amendment of tax assessments. The time bar means that, once four years have passed, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue may not amend an assessment so as to increase the amount assessed or decrease the amount of a net loss. There are a limited number of exceptions to this period, most notably that it does not apply in instances of fraud. Similarly, the Income Tax Act 2007 imposes a four-year time 170 bar on taxpayers’ ability to claim a refund for overpayments of tax. Both time bars are present to provide certainty within the tax system and to taxpayers. The KSA legislates that employer and employee deductions are subject to the PAYE rules. 18 However, this requirement does not capture increased assessments or refunds of KiwiSaver employer and employee deductions for the purposes of the time bar. The consequence of this is that, for time bar purposes, KiwiSaver employee and employer deductions and ACC earners’ levy deductions are not treated consistently with other PAYE deductions that are subject to the time bar. This increases uncertainty and exposure to ongoing liabilities for taxpayers, KiwiSaver providers and Inland Revenue. 18 In section 67 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006. 171 PENALTY FOR FAILURE TO KEEP TAXPAYER INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL (Clause 166) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would reinstate the penalty for failure by employees of another agency to keep taxpayer information confidential. These employees were unintentionally omitted when changes were made to the penalty provision in the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) in 2019. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 18 March 2019, the date that the employees of other agencies were omitted from the penalty provision. Key features Section 143D of the TAA describes the instances where a person, having access to taxpayer information, commits an offence for failing to keep taxpayer information confidential. The proposed amendment would insert a new subparagraph into section 143D(1) to refer to situations where the Commissioner shares taxpayer information with other agencies and their employees. Background Inland Revenue currently shares taxpayer information with 22 other agencies to assist those agencies in providing public services. Employees of these other agencies are required to keep this information confidential under the TAA. Before March 2019, failure by an employee of another agency to keep taxpayer information confidential was included in the offence provision under the TAA and punishable by a maximum penalty of $15,000 and/or a term of imprisonment of up to six months. Inland Revenue employees are also subject to the same confidential obligation and penalty. With the enactment of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 in March 2019, changes were made to the offence provisions in the TAA. However, an unintended outcome of these changes was that the references to situations where employees of other agencies receive taxpayer information was omitted. 173 Maintenance items 175 MAINTENANCE AMENDMENTS Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments in table 4 are minor technical maintenance items arising from both the rewrite of income tax legislation and subsequent changes.
