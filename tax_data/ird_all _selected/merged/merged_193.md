EMPLOYMENT COURT AWARDS FOR LOST WAGES OR OTHER REMUNERATION – EMPLOYERS’ LIABILITY TO MAKE TAX DEDUCTIONS PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 06/06 Note (not part of ruling): This ruling replaces Public Ruling BR Pub 01/06 published in TIB Vol 13, No 6 (June 2001). The preceding rulings were Public Rulings BR Pub 97/7 and 97/7A published in TIB Vol 9, No 6 (June 1997). This new ruling is essentially the same as the previous ruling. However, the new ruling has been updated and applies the Income Tax Act 2004, which came into force on 1 April 2005, rather than the Income Tax Act 1994 provisions. The changes between the provisions of the 1994 and 2004 Acts affecting this ruling do not affect the conclusions previously reached. The ruling applies for an indefinite period. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2004 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CE 1, BD 3, EI 8, NC 2, NC 16 , OB 1 (definitions of “employee”, “extra pay”, and “shareholder-employee”), and OB 2 (definition of “source deduction payment”). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is an order by the Employment Court or the Employment Relations Authority requiring an employer to make a payment for lost wages or other remuneration to an employee under the Employment Relations Act 2000. The Court or Authority will make such an award when an employee has lost wages or other remuneration as a result of an action by the employer which has been the subject of a personal grievance by the employee against the employer (e.g. unjustifiable dismissal or other unjustifiable action by the employer). An award for lost wages or other remuneration will usually be made under sections 123(1)(b) or 128 of the Employment Relations Act, but may be made under another provision. This Ruling does not apply to an award of compensation for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings made under section 123(1)(c)(i) of the Employment Relations Act. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: A. Employment income The payment of an award for lost wages or other remuneration under the Employment Relations Act 2000 is “employment income” of the employee under section CE 1. B. Employer’s liability to make tax deductions from the award The payment of an award for lost wages or other remuneration, under the Employment Relations Act 2000 is an extra emolument pay and is a “source deduction payment” under section OB 2 (1). The employer must make tax deductions from the payment under section NC 2 and account for those deductions to Inland Revenue in the normal way. If an employer fails to make the required tax deductions from a payment, the employee is liable, under section NC 16, to pay an amount equal to those tax deductions to the Commissioner (and is also required to furnish to the Commissioner an employer monthly schedule showing details of the payment). C. When the payment is derived by the employee Under section BD 3(4), an employee derives a payment of an award for lost wages or other remuneration under the Employment Relations Act 2000 when the employee receives the payment, or when the payment is credited to an account or otherwise dealt with on the employee’s behalf. A person who is a shareholder-employee for the purposes of section EI 8 (as defined in sections OB 1 and OB 2 (2)) derives a payment of an award for lost wages or other remuneration under the Employment Relations Act 2000, in the income year that the expenditure on that award is deductible to the employer. If the expenditure on the award is not deductible to the employer, the shareholder-employee derives the award in the year of receipt. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply to payments received on and following 1 October 2005 for an indefinite period. This Ruling is signed by me on the 30th day of June 2006. Susan Price Senior Tax Counsel 2 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 06/06 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 06/06 (“the Ruling”). The subject matter covered in the Ruling was previously dealt with in Public Rulings BR Pub 01/06 published in TIB Vol 13, No 6 (June 2001) which replaced Public Rulings BR Pub 97/7 and 97/7A published in TIB Vol 9, No 6 (June 1997). This Ruling applies for an indefinite period. The commentary refers to the Income Tax Act 2004, particularly section CE 1 and the concept of “employment income”. Background The Employment Relations Act 2000 provides for a number of remedies when an employee has a personal grievance against a current or former employer. This includes compensation for wages lost by the employee as a result of actions by the employer which are the subject of a personal grievance. Such compensation will usually be awarded under sections 123(1)(b) or 128 of the Act but may be made under another provision. For example, in Cleland v CIR (2001) 20 NZTC 17,086, Hammond J was concerned with the assessability of part of an award made by the Employment Court in 1992. The Employment Court awarded compensation for lost wages up to the date of hearing under the equivalent of section 128 of the Employment Relations Act. An award for lost wages from that date on was made under the equivalent of section 123(1)(c)(ii) which provides for compensation for the loss of a benefit. The law in this area seems to be evolving and while awards for lost wages or other remuneration are now generally made under section 123(1)(b), the Ruling will apply under whatever provision such an award is made. This Ruling confirms the Commissioner’s existing practice in respect of the assessability and deduction of tax from awards for lost wages or other remuneration made under the Employment Relations Act 2000. Legislation Relevant provisions of the Employment Relations Act 2000 Section 103(1) of the Employment Relations Act 2000 (“the ERA”) defines “personal grievance” as: For the purposes of this Act, “personal grievance” means any grievance that an employee may have against the employee’s employer or former employer because of a claim⎯ (a) that the employee has been unjustifiably dismissed; or 3 (b) that the employee’s employment, or 1 or more conditions of the employee’s employment (including any condition that survives termination of the employment), is or are or was (during employment that has since been terminated) affected to the employee’s disadvantage by some unjustifiable action by the employer; or (c) that the employee has been discriminated against in the employee’s employment; or (d) that the employee has been sexually harassed in the employee’s employment; or (e) that the employee has been racially harassed in the employee’s employment; or (f) that the employee has been subject to duress in the employee’s employment in relation to membership or non-membership of a union or employees organisation. Section 103(3) provides: In subsection (1)(b), unjustifiable action by the employer does not include an action deriving solely from the interpretation, application, or operation, or disputed interpretation, application, or operation, of any provision of any employment agreement. Section 123(1)(b) of the ERA states: Where the Authority or the Court determines that an employee has a personal grievance, it may, in settling the grievance, provide for any 1 or more of the following remedies: ... (b) the reimbursement to the employee of a sum equal to the whole or any part of the wages or other money lost by the employee as a result of the grievance ... Section 128 of the ERA states: (1) This section applies where the Authority or Court determines, in respect of any employee, - (a) that the employee has a personal grievance; and (b) that the employee has lost remuneration as a result of the personal grievance. (2) If this section applies then, subject to subsection (3) and section 124, the Authority must, whether or not it provides for any of the other remedies provided for in section 123, order the employer to pay to the employee the lesser of a sum equal to that lost remuneration or to 3 months’ ordinary time remuneration. (3) Despite subsection (2), the Authority may, in its discretion, order an employer to pay to an employee by way of compensation for remuneration lost by that employee as a result of the personal grievance, a sum greater than that to which an order under that subsection may relate. Section 124 of the ERA states: Where the Authority or the Court determines that an employee has a personal grievance, the Authority or Court must, in deciding both the nature and the extent of the remedies to be provided in respect of that personal grievance,⎯ (a) consider the extent to which the actions of the employee contributed towards the situation that gave rise to the personal grievance; and 4 (b) if those actions so require, reduce the remedies that would otherwise have been awarded accordingly. Relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act 2004 Section CA 1(1) provides: CA 1 Amounts that are income Amounts specifically identified (1) An amount is income of a person if it is their income under a provision in this part. Section CE 1 provides CE 1 Amounts derived in connection with employment The following amounts derived by a person in connection with their employment or service are income of the person: (a) salary or wages or an allowance, bonus, extra pay, or gratuity: (b) expenditure on account of an employee that is expenditure on account of the person: (c) the market value of board that the person receives in connection with their employment or service: (d) a benefit received under a share purchase agreement: (e) directors’ fees: (f) compensation for loss of employment or service: (g) any other benefit in money. Section BD 3(4) provides: Income credited into account Despite subsection (3), income that has not previously been derived by a person is treated as being derived when it is credited in their account or, in some other way, dealt with in their interest or on their behalf. Section EI 8 provides: EI 8 Matching rule for employment income of shareholder employee Matching if company allowed deduction (1) If a company is allowed a deduction for expenditure on employment income that is paid or is payable to a shareholder employee under section CE 1 (Amounts derived in connection with employment), the income is allocated in the way set out in subsections (2) and (3). Allocation to deduction year unless unexpired 5 (2) The income is allocated to the income year to which the deduction allowed to the company is allocated, except for an amount equal to any unexpired portion for the income year of the company's expenditure under section EA 4 (Deferred payment of employment income). Allocation otherwise when ceases being unexpired (3) The remaining income is allocated to the income year or years in which the corresponding amount of the company's expenditure on the income is no longer treated as an unexpired portion. Section NC 2(1) provides: NC 2 Tax Deductions to be made by employers or PAYE intermediaries (1) For the purpose of enabling the collection of income tax from employees by instalments, where an employee receives a source deduction payment from an employer, the employer, PAYE intermediary, or other person by whom the payment is made must, at the time of making the payment, make a tax deduction from the payment in accordance with the PAYE rules: provided that no tax deduction need be made from any source deduction payment made to any employee in respect of the employee’s employment as a private domestic worker: provided also that if a tax deduction is not made by the employer or the PAYE intermediary in any such case section NC 16 applies to the employee. Section NC 16 provides NC 16 Employee to pay deductions to commissioner Where for any reason a tax deduction or a combined tax and earner premium deduction or combined tax and earner levy deduction is not made or is not made in full at the time of the making of any source deduction payment or payments, the employee must— (a) Not later than the 20th day of the month that next follows the month in which payment of the source deduction payment was made, furnish to the Commissioner an employer monthly schedule containing those particulars that apply to the employee; and (b) Unless the employee is exempted from liability to pay the same or is not liable to pay the same, pay to the Commissioner an amount equal to the total of the tax deductions or combined tax and earner premium deductions or combined tax and earner levy deductions that should have been made and were not made, and that amount shall be due and payable to the Commissioner on the 20th of the month following the month in which payment of the source deduction payment or payments was made. Section NC 19 provides: NC 19 Amount of tax deductions deemed to be received by employee Where any amount has been deducted from a source deduction payment by way of tax deduction, or combined tax and earner premium deduction, or combined tax and earner levy deduction under the PAYE rules and, where applicable, section 115 of the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992 or section 285 of the Accident Insurance Act 1998 or section 221 of the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation, and Compensation Act 2001, the amount so deducted— (a) is deemed to have been received by the employee at the time of the source deduction payment: 6 (b) for the purposes of this Act, is deemed to have been derived by the employee at the same time and in the same way as the residue of the source deduction payment. Section OB 1 defines: “employee”— ... (f) for an employer, means an employee of the employer “employee share loan” is defined in section CX 29 (Meaning of employee share loan) “employment income” – means an amount that is income under section CE 1 (Amounts derived in connection with employment) “extra pay”— (a) means a payment that— (i) is made to a person in connection with their employment; and (ii) is not one regularly included in the salary or wages payable to the person for a pay period; and (iii) is not overtime pay; and (iv) is made in a lump sum; and (v) is made in 1 lump sum or in 2 or more instalments; and (vi) is made for a period of time or otherwise than for a period of time; and (b) includes a payment of the kind described in paragraph (a) made— (i) as a bonus, gratuity, or share of profits; or (ii) as a redundancy payment; or (iii) when the person retires from employment; or (iv) by a retrospective increase in salary or wages, but the payment is included only to the extent to which the payment accrues from the start of the increase until the start of the first pay period in which the increase is included in salary or wages, and to the extent to which, when a week ends with a Saturday, the total of the increase for the week, and of the salary or wages for the week excluding the increase, and of any other salary or wages that the person earns for the week, is more than $4; and (c) includes income that a person derives under section CE 9 (Restrictive covenants) or CE 10 (Exit inducements) if the income was derived in connection with an employment relationship between the person and the person who paid the income; and (d) does not include a payment of exempt income “shareholder-employee”,— (a) in sections EA 4 (Deferred payment of employment income) and EI 8 (Matching rule for employment income of shareholder-employee), means a 7 person who receives or is entitled to receive salary, wages, or other income to which section OB 2(2) (Meaning of source deduction payment: shareholder-employees of close companies) applies: (b) in the FBT rules and in section 177A of the Tax Administration Act 1994, means a person who is, in relation to a close company,— (i) a shareholder in and an employee of the company; and (ii) a person to whom section OB 2(2) (Meaning of source deduction payment: shareholder-employees of close companies) applies Section OB 2 provides: OB 2 Meaning of source deduction payment: shareholder-employees of close companies (1) In this Act, except as provided in subsection (2), source deduction payment means a payment by way of salary or wages, an extra pay, or a withholding payment, but does not include an amount attributed in accordance with section GC 14D.

Section YA 3(3) provides: Intention of new law 8 (3) Except when subsection (5) applies, the provisions of this Act are the provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994 in rewritten form, and are intended to have the same effect as the corresponding provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994. Section YA 3(5) provides: Limits to subsections (3) and (4) (5) Subsections (3) and (4) do not apply in the case of— (a) a new law specified in schedule 22A (Identified policy changes); or (b) a new law that is amended after the commencement of this Act, with effect from the date on which the amendment comes into force. Application of the Legislation An award for lost wages or other remuneration is made to compensate the employee for wages or other remuneration he or she may have lost as a result of an action by the employer which has been the subject of a personal grievance by the employee against the employer. The wages or other remuneration that would have been received if it were not for the personal grievance are “employment income”. Employment income is defined as an amount that is income under section CE 1 and section CE 1 provides that certain amounts derived by a person in connection with the employment are included in the person’s income. Those amounts include: (a) salary or wages or an allowance, bonus, extra pay, or gratuity: The term “extra pay” covers an award for lost wages or other remuneration. The payment of the award for lost wages or other remuneration must be made “in connection with the employment or service of the person” , even though the payment is made to resolve a personal grievance rather than for services actually performed. Relationship with Income Tax Act 1994 The Income Tax Act 2004 introduces the concept of an amount received by a person “in connection with their employment or service” being income of a person. Previously, the 1994 Act referred to an amount being monetary remuneration, and thus gross income, if it was an amount derived by a person “in respect of or in relation to” their employment or service. The wording of the 2004 Act provision is different to that in the 1994 Act. However, while the 2004 Act has replaced the 1994 Act, section YA 3(3) of the 2004 Act nevertheless provides that provisions of the 2004 Act are the provisions of the 1994 Act in rewritten form. The provisions of the 2004 Act are intended to have the same effect as the corresponding provision of the 1994 Act. The exception is, pursuant to section YA 3(5), where an “identified policy change”, as specified in schedule 22A, exists. 9 In this instance no identified policy change has been specified in schedule 22A. Therefore, the presumption is that the adoption of the term “in connection with” was not intended to give rise to an interpretation that differs from that which would apply if the term “in respect of or in relation to”, as used in the definition of “monetary remuneration” under the 1994 Act, still applied. It is therefore relevant to consider the meaning of the phrase “in respect of or in relation to” in the interpretation of the phrase “in connection with” in this situation. The meaning of “in connection with” The phrase “in connection with” is not defined in the Act. However, it has been considered in other contexts. In Strachan v Marriott \[1995\] 3 NZLR 272, Hardie Boys J stated, at page 279: “In connection with” may signify no more than a relationship between one thing and another. The expression does not necessarily require that it be a causal relationship: Our Town FM Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (1987) 16 FCR 465, 479 per Wilcox J. But, as Davies J warned in Hatfield v Health Insurance Commission (1987) 15 FCR 487, at p 491: “Expressions such as ‘relating to’, ‘in connection with’ and ‘in respect of’ are commonly found in legislation but invariably raise problems of statutory interpretation. They are terms which fluctuate in operation from statute to statute.... The terms may have a very wide operation but they do not usually carry the widest possible ambit, for they are subject to the context in which they are used, to the words with which they are associated, and to the object or purpose of the statutory provision in which they appear.” In Case E84 (1982) 5 NZTC 59,441 Bathgate DJ noted at page 59,445: It is a matter of degree whether, on the interpretation of a particular statute, there is a sufficient relationship between subject and object to come within the words “in connection with” or not. It is clear that no hard and fast rule can be or should be applied to the interpretation of the words “in connection with”. Each case depends on its own facts and the particular statute under consideration. In Hatrick (A) & Co v R \[1923\] AC 213, the Privy Council considered the meaning of “in connection with” in the context of section 10 of the Government Railway Act 1908, which empowered the Minister of Railways to fix charges to be paid for goods stored in any shed or store “in connection with a railway”. Their Lordships stated, at page 225: In the view of their Lordships these words cannot apply to something done on a space or in a building merely contiguous to or abutting upon a railway, even though it be the property of a railway; if the thing done forms no part of or has no connection with the property business or a railway, as a carrier of passengers and goods by rail, or in other words that the expression “in connection with a railway” means connect with, subserving and being ancillary to, the business of a railway as such carriers ... These words ... must be direct to something different from propinquity or contiguity, and in their Lordships’ view, having regard to all the provisions of the statute, mean in s 10 in connection with the business and operations of a railway as a carrier of goods by rail. In Hammington v Ross (1992) 2 NZ ConvC 191,150, the High Court considered whether a lawyer’s omission to disclose his investment in the client’s product to the 10 client was a “civil liability incurred in connection with the provision of professional services”. McGechan J stated, at page 191,162: One next goes to the operative clause. It provides cover for claims arising from civil liability incurred “in connection with” provision of “professional services”. The clause is a broad one. It extends to “civil liability”, not mere classical “neglect, error or omission”. It extends to claims incurred “in connection with” the provision of professional services, as contrasted with “in the” provision of professional services. It is not limited to strict integral components of those very services themselves. With that wider wording it was conceded, and rightly, that activity covered would include omission to provide, and “ancillary conduct not strictly professional work - eg, the business advice here”. Clearly however there must be a nexus between such wider activity giving rise to liability and the professional services. The wider activity must be related, and not merely co-existent. In Pan Pacific Forest Industries (NZ) Ltd v Norwich General (1997) 7 TCLR 560, the High Court considered whether an insurance policy applied where the product supplied was faulty. The relevant policy applied to “accidental loss of...property...resulting from accidents in connection with the business”. Paterson J stated at page 569: The operative provisions of the policy apply if the accident was “in connection with the business”. Giving those words their natural and ordinary meaning the accident did arise in connection with the business if it arose because the business supplied faulty materials and parts and gave faulty advice. The phrase “in connection with”, has also been considered in the context of section DJ 5 of the Income Tax Act 1994, a provision that allows a tax deduction for costs incurred “in connection with” the determination of a liability to tax. In that context, Bathgate DJ found in Case E84 that the term required a narrow interpretation. He said, at page 59,445: It may be that only an empirical and common sense approach to the interpretation of the words can be applied in each particular case to determine where, if at all, the line should be drawn to allow or not allow expenditure “in connection with” an assessment. However I believe that a narrow interpretation of the words "... any expenditure ... in connection with ... the assessment ..." is the correct interpretation: only expenditure closely and immediately connected to the assessment itself is intended to be allowed as a deduction, and expenditure more remote, as for instance in this case, the expenditure of O in making his trip to visit A, is not expenditure allowed as a deduction under the section. This case suggests that, in the context of section DJ 5, the phrase “in connection with” requires a close linkage between the expenditure and the “determination” or “calculation” of a liability to tax. The above cases suggest that for something to be “in connection with” something else, a necessary degree of nexus is required, and that the two things must be related to each other in some way. Overall, the Commissioner considers that they suggest that a broad interpretation should be given to the term. The meaning of “in respect of or in relation to” It is also necessary to consider the relevant words that were used in the Income Tax Act 1994. As noted, in that Act the relevant test was whether an amount was “in respect of or in relation to” employment, and thus “monetary remuneration”. 11 A wide interpretation of the words “in respect of or in relation to the employment or service” was endorsed by the Court of Appeal in Shell New Zealand Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,303, in response to Shell’s argument that a payment was not made in respect of or in relation to employment because it was not made under a contract of employment. The Court stated that the words “in respect of or in relation to” are words of the widest import. The Court also found that the words “emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money” were not to be read ejusdem generis with the preceding words, the genus being reward for services. Thus, for the purposes of the definition of “monetary remuneration”, the words “emolument ... or other benefit in money” were not confined to rewards for services. In Shell the Court found it important that the employees were only in a position to receive compensation payments (for changing the employees’ place of employment) because of their employment relationship with the employer. So, although the employees received compensation for the costs of moving rather than payments for services, this was still monetary remuneration. Similarly, the lost wages or other remuneration awarded on the personal grievance claim arise directly out of and as a result of an employee’s employment relationship with the employer. Again, although this is not a payment for services, it was within the definition of “monetary remuneration”. Other cases have also stressed the width of the words “in respect of or in relation to”. In the Queens Bench case of Paterson v Chadwick \[1974\] 2 All ER 772, Boreham J considered the meaning of the phrase “in respect of” in relation to discovery, and adopted the comments of Mann CJ in the Australian case Trustees, Executors & Agency Co Ltd v Reilly \[1941\] VLR 110, where the learned Chief Justice said: The words “in respect of” are difficult of definition but they have the widest possible meaning of any expression intended to convey some connection or relation in between the two subject- matters to which the words refer. Similarly, in Nowegijick v The Queen \[1983\] CTC 20 at page 25, the Supreme Court of Canada described the phrase “in respect of” as “probably the widest of any expression intended to convey some connection between two related subject-matters”. The earlier TRA decisions on the previous legislation also illustrate the wide meaning that may be attributed to the words “in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer”. In Case L92 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,530, Barber DJ considered the term “monetary remuneration” in relation to a payment of compensation for unjustified dismissal under the Industrial Relations Act 1973. The compensation was calculated on the basis of the personal hurt and procedural unfairness suffered by the objector. Barber DJ found that, even though the compensation was damages in nature, it was money received in respect of the objector’s employment. He stated that the words “compensation for loss of office or employment”, “emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money” and “in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer” have a wide embrace and go beyond the narrower concept of “salary, wage, allowance, bonus gratuity, extra salary” which precede them. On the particular facts of this case he said that “monetary remuneration”, interpreted widely, covered the payment in issue. 12 Barber DJ reached the same conclusion in relation to a similar compensation payment in Case L78 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,451. This case examined the nature of an ex gratia payment made to an employee as a result of a personal grievance claim brought against the employer under section 117 of the Industrial Relations Act 1973 which covered reimbursement for lost wages. The ex gratia payment was made up of six weeks’ holiday pay and pay for untaken sick leave. This holiday and sick leave was not owing to the taxpayer. The payment, which the taxpayer said he regarded as “extra wages”, was held to fall within the definition of “monetary remuneration” in section 2 of that Act. In Case P19 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,127, Barber DJ examined whether a severance payment of $77,598 paid to an objector by his overseas employer was assessable income. The objector was a jockey who entered into a three-year oral contract to ride his employer’s horses. The employer became dissatisfied with the objector’s performance and unilaterally terminated the contract after about 4 months. After negotiation, the matter was settled on the basis that the employer made the severance payment. Barber DJ held that “the severance payment was made as compensation for the objector’s loss of income due to the millionaire having terminated the contractual relationship”. He inferred that “the payment was a top-up of the first year’s minimum income” made to “assist the objector re-build his income earning process” and said that that type of payment “must be revenue in nature”. He stated that: In terms of the definition of “monetary remuneration”, the payment made to the objector must be “compensation for loss of office or employment, emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money, in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer;” Although not concerning a Court award, Case P19 supports the proposition that payments made as compensation for loss of income fall within the definition of monetary remuneration. In Case S96 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,603 and Case U38 (2000) 19 NZTC 9,361 the taxpayers in each case did not dispute that the portion of their compensation payment that was for lost wages was taxable, and this was accepted by the TRA. Doogue J in the High Court decision in Sayer v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,249 also accepted the assessability of the part of a settlement agreement attributed to lost remuneration. In Case U39 (2000) 19 NZTC 9,369 an IRD officer was awarded compensation of $126,000 being $46,000 (loss of wages), $30,000 (humiliation), and $50,000 (loss of benefits) by the Employment Court in 1992. The Commissioner accepted that the humiliation payment was not assessable and assessed the balance of $96,000. Barber DJ readily found that the compensation for lost wages was monetary remuneration, and so was the compensation for loss of benefits. He said (at paragraph 26, p 9,374): Awards made by the Employment Court pursuant to ss 227(c)(ii) above and 229 (for lost income) of the Labour Relations Act 1987 are generally deemed to be “monetary remuneration” and assessable income pursuant to s 65(2)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Indeed, because awards under s 229 are a reimbursement of, or compensation for, “lost remuneration” for the worker, any such award (in this case $50,000 \[sic\] of the $96,000 in issue) must, obviously, be revenue in character and within the above s 2 (of the Act) definition of “monetary remuneration”, and assessable. 13 (Section 128 of the Employment Relations Act 2000 is the equivalent of section 229 of the Labour Relations Act). In his decision on appeal dated 30 April 2001, Hammond J upheld the TRA’s decision: Cleland v CIR AP44/00 High Court, Hamilton. He found that the reimbursement of lost wages was “monetary remuneration”, saying, at paragraph 41: I cannot see how the loss of wages due up to the date of hearing under s229 ($46,000) is not “monetary remuneration” under s2 of the Income Tax Act 1976. He went on to find that the $50,000 awarded by the Employment Court under section 227(c)(ii) for loss of benefits, which included an element of future wages, was also assessable as “monetary remuneration”. Other New Zealand cases (Case U38 (2000) 19 NZTC 9,361 and C of IR v Kerslake (2001) 20 NZTC 17,158) have also considered the phrase “in respect of or in relation to”. Both cases are consistent with the authorities cited above in this commentary. As noted earlier in this commentary, the law in this area seems to have moved on from requiring a division of awards of lost wages between those up to the date of the hearing (under the reimbursement remedy), and those from that date on (under the loss of benefits remedy). Compensation for lost wages, including those that the employee would have been likely to receive over some future period but for the grievance, are generally awarded under section 123(1)(b) of the Employment Relations Act. See for example Trotter v Telecom Corporation of NZ Ltd \[1993\] 2 NZER 659. These cases clearly indicate that an award for lost wages or other remuneration is considered assessable as gross income to the employee. The Commissioner considers that these payments are made “in connection with the employment or service” and therefore are included in employment income of the taxpayer. When the employment relationship has ended In some cases the employment relationship of the employer and employee will have ended by the time the employer pays the court award to the employee. The fact that the employment relationship may have ended by the time the employer pays the award does not change the fact that the award is made “in connection with the employment or service” of the former employee. In Freeman & Ors. v FC of T (1982) 82 ATC 4629 the Supreme Court of Victoria found that a payment is made “in relation to the employment” of a former employee when the entitlement to that payment arises out of the employment or from services performed by the employee before the termination of employment. In Freeman the taxpayers were directors, shareholders, and employees of the appellant company which ceased to carry on business. The next day the business was sold to another company controlled by the taxpayers and carried on business as before. Six months later it was decided that the appellant company should pay to each of the taxpayers certain lump sum payments. The evidence suggested that the source 14 of the greater part of the payments consisted of fees (or “salaries”) received by the appellant company after it ceased carrying on business. The Court found that the payments received by the appellants were assessable income under section 26(e) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936-1978. Section 26(e) provided that assessable income included the value to the taxpayer of all allowances, gratuities, compensations, benefits, bonuses and premiums given to him or her in relation directly or indirectly to their employment or services rendered by him or her. Kaye J found that payments out of the income of the appellant company to employees by way of allowances for past services, which had been rendered by them, were within section 26(e). The decision on this aspect of the case was unchanged when the appeal was heard by the Federal Court. Awards for lost wages or other remuneration arise out of the employee’s previous service with the employer. A court award that compensates for lost wages or other remuneration is made as a result of the employee’s service with the employer, and so is made in connection with the employment of the employee. Employer’s liability to make tax deductions from the award for lost wages or other remuneration The Ruling states that the payment of an award for lost wages or other remuneration is a source deduction payment. Under section NC 2 (1), an employer must make the appropriate tax deduction from every source deduction payment made to an employee. Award is a source deduction payment The definition in section OB 2(1) of “source deduction payment” includes a payment by way of salary or wages, an extra pay, or a withholding payment. Section OB 1 defines “extra pay” as a payment that: ... (i) is made to a person in connection with their employment; and (ii) is not one regularly included in the salary or wages payable to the person for a pay period; and (iii) is not overtime pay; and (iv) is made in a lump sum; and (v) is made in 1 lump sum or in 2 or more instalments; and (vi) is made for a period of time or otherwise than for a period of time; and An award for lost wages or other remuneration is generally paid in a lump sum but according to section 123(2) of the Employment Relations Act 2000 it can also be paid in instalments if the financial position of the employer requires it. Such a payment would however not regularly be included in the salary or wages payable to the person. As discussed above, the payment of an award for lost wages or other remuneration is made to a person in respect of or in relation to the employment of that person. As the payment of an award for lost wages or other remuneration is generally made in a lump sum, or if made in instalments it is not regularly included in the salary or wages payable to the person, such a payment is considered as being made in connection with the employment of a person, and is not a payment of salary or wages but an extra pay. 15 As the payment of the award is an extra pay, it is included in the definition of “source deduction payment”. A former employee is an “employee” Section NC 2 requires an employer to make tax deductions from source deduction payments to employees. Section OB 1 defines “employee” as a person who receives or is entitled to receive a source deduction payment. As discussed above, the payment of an award for lost wages or other remuneration constitutes a source deduction payment. A payment can still be “monetary remuneration” and a source deduction payment when it is paid to a former employee. A former employee who is entitled to receive this source deduction payment is also an “employee” for the purposes of section NC 2 (even though he or she may no longer be in an employment relationship with the employer). The appropriate tax deduction Section NC 2 requires the employer to make the appropriate tax deduction from source deduction payments to employees. As the payment of an award for lost wages or other remuneration constitutes an “extra emolument”, the employer must deduct tax at the extra emolument rate as provided for in section NC 2(5) and clause 8 of Schedule 19. (This currently provides a minimum rate of 21 cents in the dollar, or 33 cents or 39 cents in the dollar depending on the recipient’s income level, or on whether the recipient makes an election for a particular rate under section NC 8(1A)). The employer must also: • deduct ACC earner premium and earners’ account levy from the payment; and • account for the deductions to Inland Revenue in the normal way and pay the remaining amount to the employee; and • pay employer premium and residual claims levy in respect of the gross award for lost wages or other remuneration. By deducting tax from the gross award and paying the net sum to the employee, the employer will satisfy the requirements under both the court award and the Income Tax Act. When an employer has deducted tax from a source deduction payment, section NC 19(a) deems the employer to have paid the amount deducted to the employee. Thus, the employer is deemed to have paid the total amount of the award to the employee for the purposes of satisfying the obligation imposed by the Court or Authority. When the Court or Authority awards a net sum In some cases a Court or Authority may make an award for lost wages or other remuneration net of tax, i.e. the sum that the employee would have received as remuneration after the deduction of tax. Because it is a “source deduction payment”, in such cases the employer would normally “gross up” the award to take account of the PAYE, the ACC earner premium, and the earners’ account levy. The employer is then required to pay the tax on the gross of the net award to Inland Revenue and pay 16 the net award to the employee. In this way the employer would fulfil his or her obligations to both the employee and the Commissioner. If the employer breaches the Court’s or the Authority’s direction to pay the net sum to the employee, the onus will be on the employee to enforce the terms of the award by requiring the employer to pay the employee the full net amount of the award. The required tax deduction must be made from whatever amount is paid to the employee. When an employer fails to make tax deductions Under section 168 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, if the employer fails to make the correct tax deductions from the payment of the award, the unpaid tax deductions become a debt owed by the employer to the Commissioner. The debt is due and payable on the date that the tax deductions were due to be paid to the Commissioner. Where an employer fails to make a deduction, the employee is liable, under section NC 16, to: • furnish the Commissioner with an employer monthly schedule containing particulars of the source deduction payment (i.e. the award) by the 20th of the month following the payment of the award; and • pay the Commissioner a sum equal to the tax deductions that the employer should have made on that source deduction payment (unless the employee is exempted from this requirement) by the 20th of the month following the payment of the award. When the payment is derived by the shareholder-employee Under section EB 1, a person is a shareholder-employee if he or she is a shareholder- employee in a close company and has met the criteria set out in section OB 2(2). Example 1 An employee is dismissed from her job. She issues proceedings against her former employer alleging unjustifiable dismissal. She seeks reinstatement and damages for wages lost as a result of the unjustifiable dismissal. The Employment Relations Authority orders the employer to reinstate the employee and awards her $27,000, a sum equivalent to the employee’s wages from the time of dismissal to the time of reinstatement, to compensate for the wages lost as a result of the unjustified dismissal. The Authority makes the award for lost wages on 20 March 2006. The employer pays this award to the employee on 10 April 2006. 1. The award for lost wages is derived by the employee in the 2006-07 income year, as this is the year of receipt. 17 2. The employer must deduct tax and ACC earner premium and earners’ account levy from the court award, and pay the following amounts to the employee and Inland Revenue respectively (in the 2007 income year): Award for lost wages $27,000 Less tax at the extra emolument rate, in this case 21% $5,670 Less ACC earner premium ($27,000 x 0.011) $ 297 Total payable to Inland Revenue $ 5,967 Total payable to the employee $21,033 Example 2 The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the Authority awards damages of $27,000 and states that this sum is net of tax. In order to ensure that it pays the employee a net sum of $27,000, the employer “grosses up” the payment by the extra emolument tax rate plus ACC earner premium and levy. The employer should make the following calculations and payments: Award for net lost wages $27,000.00 Divided by 0.779 (1 - 0.21 - 0.011) to give the gross wage $34,659.82 Less tax at the extra emolument rate of 21% $ 7,278.56 Less ACC earner premium ($34,659.82 x 0.011) $ 381.26 Total payable to Inland Revenue $ 7,659.82 Total payable to the employee $27,000.00 In both examples: • The employer must also pay the employer premium and residual claims levy on the gross award. • Any other source deduction payments received by the employee from that employer in the 4 weeks prior to payment of the award must also be taken into account in calculating her annualised salary or wages and determining the appropriate tax deduction rate. • If the employee is required to file an income tax return, she will include the amount of the award for lost wages in her return for the 2006-07 income year and claim the tax paid as a credit. 18

Susan Price Senior Tax Counsel 2 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 07/01 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusion reached in public ruling BR Pub 07/01 (the Ruling). The subject matter covered in the Ruling was previously dealt with in public ruling BR Pub 01/08 (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 13, No 9 (September 2001)) under the heading “Forestry rights—secondhand goods GST input tax deduction: Public Ruling—BR Pub 01/08”. BR Pub 01/08 was a reissue of BR Pub 98/5 (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 10, No 12 (December 1998)), which was a reissue of BR Pub 95/3 (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 3 (September 1995)). BR Pub 01/08 applied until 30 September 2006. This Ruling extends that coverage and applies for an indefinite period beginning on 1 October 2006. Background We have been asked to clarify whether a GST-registered person who buys a forestry right by way of a non-taxable supply may make a secondhand goods input tax deduction. It has been unclear whether a forestry right can be a secondhand good. All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. Legislation Section 2 of the Forestry Rights Registration Act 1983 (FRRA) defines “forestry right” (for the purposes of that Act): Forestry right means a right created in accordance with this Act: Section 2A of the FRRA deals with the creation of forestry rights. It states: 2A Creation of forestry rights (1) A forestry right may be created by the proprietor of land⎯ (a) By creating in accordance with subsection (3); or (b) By granting to any other person; or (c) By reserving to the proprietor on the sale of the land,⎯ the right to⎯ (d) Establish, maintain, and harvest; or (e) Maintain and harvest,⎯ a crop of trees on that land. (2) The forestry right may also⎯ (a) Grant or reserve rights of access and rights of construction and use of tracks, culverts, bridges, buildings, and other works and facilities if those rights are ancillary to and necessary for the purposes of subsection (1): (b) Provide for charges, payments, royalties, or division of the crop or the proceeds of the crop,⎯ whether or not such rights or provisions are coupled with an obligation. (3) Despite any enactment or rule of law, the proprietor may, in accordance with this section, create a forestry right for the proprietor. 3 (4) No right created under this section is capable of conferring a right of exclusive possession of the land. Section 3(1) of the FRRA states: Notwithstanding any rule of law or equity to the contrary, every forestry right shall be deemed to be a profit à prendre. Section 2(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 defines “goods”: Goods means all kinds of personal or real property; but does not include choses in action, money or a product that is transmitted by a non-resident to a resident by means of a wire, cable, radio, optical or other electromagnetic system or by means of a similar technical system: Section 3A(1)(c) defines “input tax” in relation to secondhand goods: (1) Input tax, in relation to a registered person, means⎯ ... (c) an amount determined under subsection (3) after applying subsection (2). Section 20(3) allows deductions from output tax, and states: (3) Subject to this section, in calculating the amount of tax payable in respect of each taxable period, there shall be deducted from the amount of output tax of a registered person attributable to the taxable period⎯ (a) In the case of a registered person who is required to account for tax payable on an invoice basis pursuant to section 19 of this Act, the amount of the following⎯ ... (ia) Input tax in relation to the supply of secondhand goods to which section 3A(1)(c) of the input tax definition applies, to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during that taxable period: ... (b) In the case of a registered person who is required to account for tax payable on a payments basis or a hybrid basis pursuant to section 19 of this Act, the amount of the following⎯ (i) Input tax in relation to the supply of goods and services made to that registered person, being a supply of goods and services which is deemed to take place pursuant to section 9(1) or section 9(3)(a) or section 9(3)(aa) or section 9(6) of this Act, to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during the taxable period: Application of the Legislation Under sections 2(1), 3A, and 20(3), seven conditions must be met before the purchase of a forestry right by a GST-registered person will permit a secondhand goods input tax deduction. • Forestry rights must be “goods” as defined in section 2(1). • The supply of a forestry right must be by way of sale. • The supply of the forestry right must be a non-taxable supply. 4 • The sale must involve payment in the taxable period for which an input tax deduction is sought. • The forestry right must be secondhand. • The forestry right must be acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. • The forestry right must be situated in New Zealand at the time of sale. The following paragraphs consider some of these requirements. “Goods” The Commissioner considers that a forestry right (as defined in section 2 of the FRRA) is a “good” for GST purposes. “Goods” means all real and personal property but does not include choses in action. Section 3(1) of the FRRA deems forestry rights to be profits à prendre. A profit à prendre is a right to take something off another person’s land. A profit à prendre is an interest in land. It is not a chose in action because the rights under a profit à prendre are of a possessory nature, whereas a chose in action can be enforced only by action. An example of a “chose in action” is the granting of a licence at a boat marina. The benefits arising from the licence cannot be obtained by taking possession of the licence, but by action against a licensor who refuses to honour the licence. On the other hand, a forestry right, which can be enforced by taking possession, is real property and a “good” for GST purposes. “Sale” A secondhand goods input tax deduction is available only if there is a supply by way of sale. Forestry rights are a form of transferable property right, like other profits à prendre, and may be sold. It will be a question of fact whether there has been a sale rather than a lease or sub-grant of a forestry right. Because of the definition of “input tax” in section 3A, a secondhand goods input tax deduction is available only where there is a sale (section 3A(2)). The sale must be by way of a non-taxable supply for an input tax deduction to be available. “Payment” An input tax deduction is available only to the extent that there has been payment for the goods in the relevant taxable period. Therefore, if there is a sale by instalments, input tax deductions are available only in the taxable period in which each instalment is paid. “Secondhand” The forestry right must be “secondhand” before an input tax deduction is available. The Commissioner considers that land is a secondhand good. This is supported by 5 case law (e.g. Case N13 (1991) 13 NZTC 3105). The Court of Appeal decision in Coveney v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,193 appears to have confirmed this view, notwithstanding earlier obiter dicta that land may not be a secondhand good in L R McLean v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,211 (CA) and King v Bennetts (1994) 16 NZTC 11,370. However, when a specific interest in land, like a forestry right, is newly created, it is a unique mix of rights distinct from the original land over which it was created. Accordingly, the original creation of a forestry right cannot be a sale of secondhand goods. The forestry right is a new item of property. Before a forestry right can be a secondhand good, at least one prior owner must have made use of the right for its intrinsic purpose (e.g. L R McLean v CIR) being some exercise of the rights conferred by the forestry right. A forestry right is a bundle of rights giving its owner the right to: • establish, maintain, and harvest; or • maintain and harvest, a crop of trees on that land. The forestry right will be considered a secondhand good so long as the prior owner has used the forestry right for its intrinsic purpose, namely has exercised some of the rights provided under that forestry right (e.g. the prior owner has established, maintained, and/or harvested a crop of trees). Examples Example 1 Purchaser is a GST-registered person who intends to enter the forestry industry in a small way. On 1 October 2006 she buys a forestry right from Supplier, who is not registered for GST. Supplier had bought the right 18 months earlier from a farmer who had decided not to diversify into forestry. Supplier had used the right on a small scale to remove a small amount of timber. The purchase price is $20,000 payable in four quarterly instalments. The first payment is made on 1 November 2006. Purchaser is entitled to a secondhand goods input tax deduction because the forestry right was disposed of by sale, the seller was unregistered (non-taxable supply), the forestry right was secondhand, and Purchaser acquired the right for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. In Purchaser’s next GST return (for the 2 months ending 30 November 2006) she should deduct as input tax the tax fraction of the amount of the first instalment ($5000). Accordingly, she may deduct $555.55. Example 2 The same facts as example 1, but neither the Supplier nor any other previous owner has harvested any trees, but the Supplier has used the existing forestry right to plant a crop of trees on the land. Once again a secondhand goods credit would be available as the Supplier has used the forestry right for one of its intrinsic purposes, being the right to establish a crop of trees. 6
FEDERAL INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS ACT (FICA) – FRINGE BENEFIT TAX (FBT) LIABILITY PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 07/02 Note (not part of ruling): This ruling replaces Public Ruling BR Pub 01/05 published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001)). This new ruling is essentially the same as the previous ruling. However, the new ruling has been updated and applies the Income Tax Act 2004 instead of the equivalent provisions in the Income Tax Act 1994. The changes between the provisions of the 1994 and 2004 Acts affecting this ruling do not affect the conclusions previously reached. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2004 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CX 12, CX 13 and CX 31. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the deduction of contributions from wages payable to employees and the payment of these contributions, together with employer contributions, to the United States Federal Government in accordance with the Federal Insurance Contribution Act (“FICA”), by an “American employer” (as defined in FICA) who is required to do so because the employer employs a citizen or citizens of the United States of America. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • Employer contributions paid under FICA do not give rise to a “fringe benefit” under section CX 12 as the contributions are not made for the benefit of employees. • Employer contributions paid under FICA do not give rise to a “fringe benefit” under section CX 13. As trust funds established for the purpose of paying disability benefits or Medicare and funded by contributions under FICA were not established for the benefit of employees and have not been approved by the Commissioner, they are not “sick, accident or death benefit funds” as defined in section OB 1. • Employer contributions paid under FICA do not give rise to an “unclassified benefit” in terms of section CX 31 as a benefit is not provided by employers in connection with the employment of employees through the payment of employer contributions under FICA. • Employee contributions required to be deducted from wages and paid under FICA do not give rise to an “unclassified benefit” as such contributions represent part of the assessable income of employees and are expressly excluded from the definition of “fringe benefit” by section CX 4. Therefore, payments required under FICA are not subject to fringe benefit tax (“FBT”). The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 July 2004 and ending on 30 June 2009. This Ruling is signed by me on the 12 th day of March 2007. Martin Smith Chief Tax Counsel 2 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 07/02 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 07/02 (“the Ruling”). Background The Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) is the part of the US Internal Revenue Code under which employers and employees are required to make payments for the funding of social security benefits. In some circumstances an employer who employs an employee to provide services in New Zealand is required to comply with obligations under the FICA legislation. FICA applies when an “American employer” pays wages for services performed as an employee by a US citizen outside the US: sections 3101 and 3111 and the definition of “employment” in section 3121 Internal Revenue Code. “American employer” means the US Government or its instruments, residents of the US or companies that are organised under the laws of the US. If FICA applies, employers must make deductions from wages payable to an employee in respect of Old-Age Survivors and Disability Insurance (“OASDI”) and Hospital Insurance (known as “Medicare”), and must pay the deductions to the Internal Revenue Service. In addition, employers are required to make payments for OASDI and Medicare (employer contributions) at the same rate. The current rate in respect of OASDI is 6.2 percent and in respect of Medicare the rate is 1.45 percent. An employer who fails to make the required payments or fails to make the payments on time is liable for a penalty. Under FICA amounts deducted from wages payable to employees are deemed to have been paid to employees at the time of deduction (Internal Revenue Code 26 US Chapter 21 section 3123). FICA does not provide for recovery of OASDI or Medicare payments imposed on employees from an employee where the employer has failed to make deductions. Payments collected under FICA are paid into the US Treasury’s General Fund and are appropriated to three separate funds: the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund; the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund; and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund. Amounts held in these funds are not held for any particular individual. A person must be a US citizen or legally resident in the US to be entitled to social security benefits (Public Law 104-193; Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act 1996). Under the US social security legislation (Public Health and Welfare Code, 42 USC Chapter 7) a person must hold not less than 40 credits to be entitled to a retirement benefit. The amount needed to gain a credit changes from year to year. Currently a credit is gained for every quarter in which an employee earns more than $970 from employment. No more than four credits can be gained in respect of a year. The minimum age to qualify for a retirement benefit depends on when a person was born. However, a person could qualify for a disability benefit with fewer credits, depending on their age. To be entitled to a disability benefit: 3 • A person must have a medical condition that meets the definition of “disability” in the social security legislation; and • Twenty of the 40 credits required to qualify for a disability benefit must have been earned in the 10 years ending in the year in which the person became disabled. If a person who is covered by social security dies, their surviving spouse or dependent children can receive a survivors benefit. The right to retirement, survivors and disability benefits cannot be assigned or transferred. The amount of the monthly benefit paid depends on the person’s earnings during the person’s working life and the age at which the person retires. The amount of the benefit is calculated according to a formula in the legislation. People aged 65 or older are entitled to receive Medicare benefits if they: • Receive a social security benefit; • Have worked long enough to be eligible for a social security benefit; • Would be entitled to a social security benefit based on their spouse’s work record and their spouse is aged at least 62; or • Have worked long enough in a federal, state or local government job to be insured for Medicare. People aged under 65 who receive disability benefits or who have permanent kidney failure may qualify for Medicare. Legislation “Fringe benefit” is defined in section CX 2(1) as follows: A fringe benefit is a benefit that— (a) is provided by an employer to an employee in connection with their employment; and (b) either— (i) arises in a way described in any of sections CX 6, CX 8, CX 9, or CX 11 to CX 15; or (ii) is an unclassified benefit; and (c) is not a benefit excluded from being a fringe benefit by any provision of this subpart. Section CX 12 provides: (1) A fringe benefit arises when an employer contributes to a superannuation scheme for the benefit of an employee. (2) This section does not apply if the contribution is a specified superannuation contribution. Section CX 13 provides: 4 A fringe benefit arises when an employer makes a contribution for the benefit of an employee to a sickness, accident, or death benefit fund. “Unclassified benefit” is defined in section CX 31 as follows: Unclassified benefit means a fringe benefit that arises if an employer provides an employee with a benefit in connection with their employment that is— (a) not a benefit referred to in any of sections CX 6 to CX 15; and (b) not a benefit excluded under this subpart. Section CX 4 provides: To the extent to which a benefit that an employer provides to an employee in connection with their employment is assessable income, the benefit is not a fringe benefit. “Superannuation scheme” is defined in section OB 1 as follows: superannuation scheme— (a) means— (i) a trust or unit trust established by its trust deed mainly for the purposes of providing retirement benefits to beneficiaries who are natural persons or paying benefits to superannuation funds; or (ii) a company that is not a unit trust, is not resident in New Zealand, and is established mainly for the purpose of providing retirement benefits to members or relatives of members who are natural persons; or (iii) an arrangement constituted under an Act of the Parliament of New Zealand, other than the Social Security Act 1964, mainly for the purpose of providing retirement benefits to natural persons; or (iv) an arrangement constituted under the legislation of a country, territory, state, or local authority outside New Zealand mainly for the purpose of providing retirement benefits to natural persons; and when referring to a superannuation scheme that is a trust, means the trustees of the scheme. The definition of “arrangement” in section OB 1 reads as follows: Arrangement means a agreement, contract, plan or understanding (whether enforceable or unenforceable), including all steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect. The definition of “sickness, accident or death benefit fund” in section OB 1 reads as follows: sickness, accident, or death benefit fund means a sickness, accident, or death benefit fund that is— (a) established for the benefit of— (i) employees; or (ii) the members of an incorporated society; or (iii) the surviving spouses and dependants of those employees or members; and (b) approved by the Commissioner 5 Application of the legislation Liability for FBT Whether an employer is required to pay fringe benefit tax (FBT) in respect of either employer or employee contributions made under FICA depends on whether the employer has provided or granted a “fringe benefit” (section ND 1(1)). There will be a “fringe benefit” where: • A benefit arises in a way described in any of section CX 6, section CX 8, section CX 9 or sections CX 11 to CX 15 or a benefit of any other type is provided by an employer to an employee in connection with their employment (an “unclassified benefit”); and • The benefit is not excluded from being a fringe benefit by any provision of subpart CX. In Australian cases, in the FBT context, the courts have considered that a fringe benefit will not be provided unless there is a link between the benefit and a particular employee: see Essenbourne Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (2002) ATC 5201; Walstern v Commissioner of Taxation 2003 ATC 5076; Cameron Brae Pty Ltd v FCT 2006 ATC 4433. The Commissioner considers that this principle also applies in the New Zealand context. As with the Australian legislation, the wording of the legislation suggests that it contemplates a benefit provided to a particular employee. The definition of “fringe benefit” in section CX 2(1) refers to “a benefit that is provided by an employer to an employee in connection with their employment”. Sections CX 12 and CX 13 also refer to “a contribution for the benefit of an employee”. As with the Australian legislation, under the valuation provisions any payment made by the employee is to be taken into account in determining the taxable value of the fringe benefit. The need for a link between the benefit and an employee is consistent with the purpose of the FBT provisions. FBT was intended to apply to non-cash remuneration provided to an employee and although liability for FBT is imposed on the employer, the theoretical basis for the imposition of FBT is that it is payable in respect of amounts that are essentially (or would be) income of an employee. Contributions to superannuation scheme: section CX 12 Under section CX 12 a fringe benefit arises when an employer makes a contribution to a superannuation scheme (other than a specified superannuation contribution) for the benefit of an employee. The definition of “superannuation scheme” in section OB 1 includes an arrangement constituted under the legislation of a country, territory, state or local authority outside New Zealand mainly for the purpose of providing retirement benefits to natural persons (paragraph (a)(iv) of the definition). Superannuation scheme The definition of “superannuation scheme” specifically includes an arrangement constituted under legislation. FICA requires employer and employee contributions to fund social security benefits, including retirement benefits. The US social security legislation contains the provisions relating to eligibility for retirement benefits and the payment of retirement benefits. These 6 two pieces of legislation together establish a system for the funding and payment of social security benefits, including retirement benefits. Therefore, there is an arrangement that is constituted under US legislation (the US social security legislation and FICA). The Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund was established under FICA (Internal Revenue Code Chapter 7 section 401). Under the US social security legislation an amount equal to 100 percent of the amount collected from employees and employers in respect of OASDI is appropriated to that trust fund (42 USC section 401). Monthly retirement benefits and survivors benefits are paid out of that trust fund. (A separate trust fund to be known as “the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund” is also established under the social security legislation.) The social security legislation sets out the conditions for entitlement to retirement benefits and provides for the payment of retirement benefits (42 US section 402). For paragraph (a)(iv) of the definition of “superannuation scheme” to apply, the arrangement must be mainly for the purpose of providing retirement benefits. Payments under FICA are appropriated to the Federal Old-Age Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and are to be used for the purpose of funding retirement benefits. Survivors’ benefits are also paid out of the fund to the widows, widowers and children of people who would have been entitled to receive a retirement benefit (that is, benefits could be paid out of the trust fund to people who have not reached retirement age). However, such people would be entitled to receive a benefit only if a person who qualifies for a retirement benefit has died. The principal object of creating the trust fund is to provide for the payment of retirement benefits. FICA is part of a legislative scheme for the provision of social security benefits by the US Federal Government, which is the equivalent of provision of benefits under the New Zealand Social Security Act 1964. In Roe v Social Security Commission (10 April 1987) unreported, High Court, Wellington, M 270/86, Davison CJ) the plaintiff was the recipient of a social security retirement benefit paid by the US Government. The issue was whether the benefit formed part of a programme providing benefits, pensions or periodical allowances for any of the contingencies for which benefits, pensions or allowances could be paid under the New Zealand Social Security Act. Davison CJ commented: The US retirement benefit is clearly on the evidence a benefit paid by the US Government of the same type as a NZ national superannuation benefit. Both are paid by the respective Governments and both are part and parcel of programmes for assistance to age-related beneficiaries. (p. 8) The Commissioner considers that payments made under FICA and appropriated to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund are paid under an arrangement constituted under US legislation mainly for the purpose of providing retirement benefits to natural persons. Therefore, there is a superannuation scheme that is constituted under the social security legislation and FICA in terms of paragraph (a)(iv) of the definition of “superannuation scheme”. This differs from the view expressed in the Commissioner’s previous ruling on this issue (BR Pub 01/05). However, for section CX 12 to apply, payments made by employers under FICA must be contributions for the benefit of an employee. 7 Whether contributions are for the benefit of employees Payments employers are required to make under section 3111(a) of FICA are tax. Section 3111(a) imposes on every employer “an excise tax, with respect to having individuals in his employ”. An excise tax is “a tax upon an activity” (CCH Federal Tax Guide Reports paragraph 21,001), in this case a tax imposed in respect of employment (Helvering v Davis 57 SC 904). However, a payment by an employer could be a contribution although the employer has a statutory obligation to make the payment. In Case M9 (1990) 12 NZTC 2069 it was held that the predecessor of section CX 12 applied to contributions made by a local authority to the National Provident Fund, although the employer did not have a choice about making the contributions. Judge Bathgate considered that the focus of the FBT legislation was whether the contributions could be regarded as a benefit from the employees’ point of view. Judge Bathgate said: The objector’s claim that the superannuation payments by the objector on behalf of its employees compulsorily paid by it under the National Provident Fund Act, are not benefits because it had no choice as to whether to make the payments is to an extent understandable, from the employer’s point of view. A benefit is often regarded as being given voluntarily, rather than compulsorily. A benefit may however be given under compulsion in some circumstances — Yates v Starkey \[1951\] 1 All ER 732. From the employees’ point of view, and after all Pt XB of the Income Tax Act is only concerned with benefits received by employees, albeit from employers, the contributions to the superannuation fund can be considered as a benefit. (p. 2073) In Yates v Starkey, referred to by Judge Bathgate, the Court of Appeal held that a person who had been ordered by the court to pay his wife an annual amount in trust for his children had provided funds for the purpose of the settlement of a trust. Jenkins LJ commented: I do not agree that the words “has provided” necessarily connote an exercise of free will. It seems to me that the taxpayer here if asked “Who is providing for the maintenance for your children?” could with perfect accuracy have replied “I am doing so under an order of the court”. (p. 479) However, for section CX 12 to apply the contribution must be for the benefit of an employee. In Case M9, although the employer was required by the National Provident Fund Act to make contributions, the objective of the contributions was to provide a benefit to employees under the National Provident Fund. In NZI Bank Ltd v Euro-National Corporation Ltd \[1992\] NZLR 528 Richardson J made the following comments in respect of the interpretation of the phrase “for the benefit of employees”: It is not sufficient to satisfy para (b) that the shares are to be held on trust for employees. The shares must be held “for the benefit” of employees. “For” in that context means with the object and purpose of benefiting employees and the “benefit” to employees must be discernible and real. As in the case of the exercise of trustees’ powers to make advances for a person’s benefit, it must confer an advantage which can be enjoyed by employees. It must be of value to employees. An arrangement does not qualify as being “for the benefit of employees” unless employees actually stand to benefit. (p. 544) Hence, for a contribution to be “for the benefit of an employee” in terms of section CX 12, the contribution must be made for the purpose of benefiting the employee and the contribution must provide something of real value to the employee. Employer contributions required under FICA are not hold in trust for any employee. The US Social Security system for the payment of retirement benefits is a pay-as-you-go scheme 8 under which current employer and employee contributions are used to fund the payment of retirement benefits to current recipients of retirement benefits. Neither employer nor employee contributions are allocated to, or held for, individual employees. Payments that an employer must make under FICA are not attributable to any particular employee. Excise tax is calculated on the total wages paid by the employer. Employees are not entitled to receive a refund of payments made either by employers or employees under FICA. The entitlement of employees to a retirement benefit does not depend on whether the employer has paid the excise tax imposed on the employer under FICA. To qualify for a retirement benefit, a person must be a “fully insured individual” (42 USC 402(a)(1)). To be a “fully insured individual” a person must hold sufficient credits (that is, a minimum of 40 credits). The number of credits earned is based on the amount of the employees’ earnings over their working life and not on the payment of employer contributions. Payments made by employers under FICA also do not affect the amount of the benefit payable. The amount of the retirement benefit is based on average earnings over a person’s working life, indexed to account for changes in average wages. Employees cannot transfer or assign their right to any future benefit (42 USC 407). Flemming v Nestor 363 US 603 establishes that a person who makes payments under FICA does not as a consequence acquire a right to a benefit analogous to a property right. The Commissioner considers that payments of excise tax under FICA are not made by employers for the benefit of any particular employee as: • Employee contributions are not held in trust for any individual employee; • Employees are not entitled to receive any part of the contributions made by employers; • Employees do not obtain the right to a retirement benefit as a consequence of the payments made by employers; and • The payment of employer contributions by employers does not affect the amount of the benefit payable to employees. Therefore, such payments do not give rise to a fringe benefit in terms of section CX 12. Contributions to sickness, accident or death benefit fund: section CX 13 Under section CX 13 a fringe benefit arises when an employer makes a contribution for the benefit of an employee to a sickness, an accident or a death benefit fund. The definition of “sickness, accident, or death benefit fund” refers to a sickness, an accident, or a death fund that is: • Established for the benefit of employees, the members of an incorporated society, or the surviving spouses and dependants of those employees; and • Approved by the Commissioner. 9 Under the US social security legislation separate funds are established for the payment of disability benefits and Medicare (the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund and the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund). Self-employed people can also earn credits so that they are entitled to receive disability benefits or Medicare. The funds are not limited to the employees of a particular employer or to employees in general. They were established to fund the payment of government-provided disability benefits and hospital and medical benefits that are available to all people who earn sufficient credits to qualify for benefits and satisfy the other conditions set out in the US legislation. Payments by employers do not directly affect employees’ entitlement to disability benefits or Medicare. Whether the employer pays employer contributions does not affect the employees’ entitlement to disability benefits or Medicare or the amount of the benefit. The Commissioner considers that neither the Disability Insurance Fund nor the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund was established for the benefit of employees. The funds were not established for the benefit of a particular employer’s employees and were not established for the benefit of employees alone. Employees do not obtain a right to receive Medicare or disability benefits as a consequence of the payments made by their employer. To be a sickness, an accident or a death fund within the statutory definition, a fund must also be approved by the Commissioner. As the Commissioner has not approved either the Federal Disability Insurance Fund or the Hospital Insurance Fund, the funds cannot be sickness, accident or death benefit funds for the purpose of section CX 13. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that a benefit does not arise in terms of section CX 13 as a consequence of payments required to be made by employers in respect of the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund or the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund under FICA as these funds are not sickness, accident or death funds as defined in section OB 1. Unclassified benefit: section CX 31 The definition of “unclassified benefit” in section CX 31 refers to a benefit an employer provides to an employee “in connection with their employment” other than the benefits referred to in any of sections CX 6 to CX 15. “Benefit” is not defined for FBT purposes. Therefore, the ordinary meaning of “benefit” applies. In CIR v Dick (2001) 20 NZTC 17,396 Glazebrook J commented as follows on the meaning of “benefit”: \[48\] The New Shorter Oxford Dictionary (1993 ed) defines benefit (in relevant part) as: a favour, gift, a benefaction, an advantage, a good, pecuniary profit. Likewise the definition of advantage is: a favouring circumstance, something which gives one a better position, benefit. Looking at the dictionary meaning of those words it would appear that something may not be a benefit or advantage if it has been acquired through the provision of services or goods at market value. This, therefore, is in contrast to the definition of income. The Commissioner considers that in the FBT context a “benefit” is an advantage, a material acquisition that confers an economic benefit on an employee. As outlined in “QB0043 The meaning of ‘benefit’ for FBT purposes” (published in Taxation Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 2 (March 2006)), in considering whether a benefit has been provided to an employee it is not relevant that the employee made a payment for what is provided. 10 For there to be a “fringe benefit”, the benefit must be provided by an employer to an employee in connection with their employment. The meaning of the phrase “in connection with” was considered in Claremont Petroleum NL v Cummings (1992) 110 ALR 239. Wilcox J said: The phrase “in connection” is one of wide import, as I had occasion to observe in a different context in Our Town FM Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (1987) 16 FCR 465 at 479-80; 77 ALR 577 at 591-592: The words “in connection with”.... do not necessarily require a causal relationship between two things: see Commissioner for Superannuation v Miller (1985) FCR 153 at 154, 160, 163; 63 ALR 237 at 238, 244, 247. They may be used to describe a relationship with a contemplated future event, see Koppen v Commissioner for Community Relations (1986) 11 FCR 360 at 364; 67 ALR 215; Johnson v Johnson \[1952\] P47 at 50-1. In the latter case the United Kingdom Court of Appeal applied a decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal, Re Nanaimo Community Hotel Ltd \[1945\] 3 DLR 225, in which the question was whether a particular court, which was given “jurisdiction to hear and determine all questions that may arise in connection with any assessment made under this Act”, had jurisdiction to deal with a matter which preceded the issue of an assessment. The trial judge held that it did, that the phrase “in connection with” covered matters leading up to, or which might lead up to an assessment. He said: “One of the very generally accepted meanings of ‘connection’ is ‘relation between things one of which is bound up with or involved in another’, or again ‘having to do with’. The words include matters occurring prior to as well as subsequent to or consequent upon so long as they are related to the principal thing. The phrase ‘having to do with’ perhaps gives as good a suggestion of the meaning as could be had.” This statement was upheld on appeal. (p 280) Hardie Boys J made the following comments on the meaning of “in connection with” in Strachan v Marriott \[1995\] 3 NZLR 272: “In connection with” may signify no more than a relationship between one thing and another. The expression does not necessarily require that it be a causal relationship: Our Town FM Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (1987) 16 FCR 465, 479 per Wilcox J. But, as Davies J warned in Hatfield v Health Insurance Commission (1987) 15 FCR 487, at p 491: Expressions such as ‘relating to’, ‘in relation to’, ‘in connection with’ and ‘in respect of’ are commonly found in legislation but invariably raise problems of statutory interpretation. They are terms which fluctuate in operation from statute to statute . ... The terms may have a very wide operation but they do not usually carry the widest possible ambit, for they are subject to the context in which they are used, to the words with which they are associated, and to the object or purpose of the statutory provision in which they appear. (pp. 279-281) In The Queen v Savage \[1983\] CTC 393 Dickson J in the Supreme Court of Canada commented: 23 ....Our Act contains the stipulation, not found in the English statutes referred to, “benefits of any kind whatever ... in respect of, in the course of, or by virtue of an office or employment”. ... Further, our Act speaks of a benefit “in respect of” an office or employment. In Nowegijick v The Queen, \[1983\] C.T.C. 20, 83 D.T.C. 5041 this Court said, at 25 \[5045\], that: The words “in respect of” are, in my opinion, words of the widest possible scope. They import such meanings as “in relation to”, “with reference to” or “in connection with”. The phrase “in respect of” probably the widest of any expression intended to convey some connection between two related subject matters. See also Paterson v. Chadwick, \[1974\] 2 All ER 772 (QBD) at 775. \[Emphasis added\] 11 Therefore, the phrase “in connection with” is used to describe a relationship between two things, but not necessarily a causal relationship. The phrases “in connection with”, “in relation to” and “in respect of” have similar meanings. These expressions are capable of having a very wide meaning. The degree of the relationship required depends on the context in which the expression is used. In the Australian FBT context, the courts have considered that it cannot be said that any causal relationship between the benefit and the employment is a sufficient relationship for FBT purposes and that a sufficient or material rather than a causal connection or relationship between the benefit and the employment must be established: see J & G Knowles & Associates Pty Ltd v FCT 2000 ATC 4151. In that case, the court considered that it was helpful to consider whether the benefit is a product or incident of the employment. The Commissioner considers that this approach would also be appropriate in the New Zealand context, given that FBT was intended to apply to non-cash remuneration provided to employees. The Commissioner considers that where the employment is a substantial reason for the provision of the benefit, there would be a sufficient relationship between the benefit and the employment (see “QB0043 The meaning of ‘benefit’ for FBT purposes” (published in Taxation Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 2 (March 2006))). Employer contributions The Commissioner considers that employer contributions do not give rise to a benefit that is provided by the employer in connection with the employment of any employee. It is not possible to establish a link between a benefit arising from the payment of employer contributions and any particular employee. The reasons are as follows: • Employees do not obtain a benefit in the form of an entitlement to receive payments made by employers under FICA. Employees have no beneficial entitlement to amounts paid by them or by their employer under FICA. • An employee’s right to receive a social security benefit is conditional on the employee satisfying the eligibility requirements in the social security legislation. When the right to receive payment from a fund is conditional, a benefit would not be provided when payment is made to the fund (Constable v Commissioner of Taxation 5 ATD 83). In Constable the taxpayer was the member of a provident fund established for the employees of the Shell group of companies. Both employer and employee contributions were paid to the fund. The fund’s regulations permitted members to withdraw the amount held on their behalf if an amendment was made to the regulations that curtailed their rights. Such an amendment was made with effect from 30 September 1947. The taxpayer withdrew amounts held to his credit (including the employer’s contributions and interest earned on the amount contributed). The High Court of Australia held that these amounts did not constitute an allowance, a gratuity, compensation, a benefit, a bonus or a premium in respect of or for or in relation to the taxpayer’s employment or services rendered by him. Dixon CJ and McTiernan, Williams and Fullager JJ in their joint judgment commented: It appears to us that the taxpayer becomes entitled to a payment out of the fund by reason of a contingency (viz an alteration of the regulations curtailing the rights of members) which occurred in the year enabling him to call for the amounts shown by his account. It was a contingent right which became absolute. The happening of the event which made it absolute did not, and could not amount to an allowing, giving or granting to him of any allowance, gratuity, compensation, benefit, bonus or premium. The fund existed as 12 one to a share in which he had a contractual, if not a proprietary title. All that occurred in the year of income with respect to the sums in question was that the future and contingent or conditional right became \[a\] right to present payment and payment was made accordingly. .... It is not of course, a matter which arises for decision in the present case, but to avoid misunderstanding it is we think desirable to say that on the frame of the regulations we find it by no means easy to see how the sums so contributed can be regarded as allowed, granted or given to the employee when they are paid to the Administrators of the Fund. It is only after the Administrators have exercised their discretion that the moneys paid to the special account are reflected in the member’s (employee’s) account and even then that does not mean that the member becomes presently entitled to the moneys credited to that account. (pp. 95- 96) • A benefit (either in the form of a social security benefit or the right to receive a social security benefit) would not be provided when payments are made by the employer under FICA. Employees must satisfy the statutory criteria (including citizenship or residence requirements, reaching retirement age, disability, earning the minimum number of credits) before a benefit would be paid to the employees. Fleming v Nestor 363 US 603 confirms that a right to receive future benefits does not accrue as a consequence of payments made by the employer under FICA. • The substantial reason for payment or the provision of retirement, disability or Medicare benefits to an employee is that the employee satisfies the statutory criteria for eligibility to receive the benefit. The amount of any benefit paid is not related to the payments made under FICA. The amount depends on a person’s earnings history (whether as an employee or a self-employed person). Therefore, there is an insufficient relationship between the payment of a social security benefit and payments made by the employer under FICA. Employee contributions The Commissioner considers that the deduction of employee contributions from wages and the payment of such contributions under FICA also do not give rise to a benefit in connection with the employee’s employment. As employee contributions form part of the salary or wages paid to employees, employee contributions are assessable income of employees in terms of section CE 1(1)(a). That being the case, such contributions are specifically excluded from the definition of “fringe benefit” by section CX 4. In Case 207 CTBR(NS) 91 it was accepted that deductions made under FICA from the salary paid to an Australian resident who was a visiting professor at a university in the US\_ was assessable income of the taxpayer. The issue was whether the amount deducted under FICA was exempt income (on the basis that a liability for income tax in the US had been paid). Summary For there to be an FBT liability, the employer must have provided a “fringe benefit” to an employee. • Employer contributions paid under FICA do not give rise to a “fringe benefit” under section CX 12 as the contributions are not made for the benefit of employees. 13 • Employer contributions paid under FICA do not give rise to a “fringe benefit” under section CX 13. As trust funds established for the purpose of paying disability benefits or Medicare and funded by payments under FICA were not established for the benefit of employees and have not been approved by the Commissioner, the funds are not “sick, accident or death benefit funds” as defined in section OB 1. • Employer contributions under FICA do not give rise to an “unclassified benefit” in terms of section CX 31 as a benefit is not provided by employers in connection with the employment of employees through the payment of employer contributions under FICA. • Employee contributions do not give rise to an “unclassified benefit”. Employee contributions required to be deducted from wages and paid under FICA represent part of employees’ assessable income and are expressly excluded from the definition of “fringe benefit” by section CX 4. Therefore, payments required under FICA are not subject to FBT. 14
LEGAL SERVICES PROVIDED TO NON-RESIDENTS RELATING TO TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING LAND IN NEW ZEALAND PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 07/03 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section 11A(1)(k). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the supply by a registered person of legal services to a non-resident (who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed) relating to: • transactions involving the sale or purchase of land in New Zealand or the lease, licence, or mortgage of land in New Zealand, or • easements, management agreements, construction agreements, trust deeds, guarantees and other agreements concerning land in New Zealand, or • disputes arising in relation to land in New Zealand. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: Under section 11A(1)(k) the supply of the following types of legal services to a non-resident who is not in New Zealand at the time the legal services are performed is zero-rated: • legal services relating to transactions involving the sale and purchase of land in New Zealand (including the drafting of agreements for the sale and purchase of land, the provision of legal advice in relation to the sale and purchase transaction and ancillary and related services leading up to the completion of the sale and purchase transaction); • legal services relating to transactions involving the lease, licence, or mortgage of land in New Zealand; • legal services relating to easements, management agreements, construction agreements, trust deeds, guarantees and other agreements relating to land in New Zealand; and • legal services relating to disputes arising in relation to land in New Zealand (including drafting court documents, court appearances, representation in negotiations and settlements and general advice in relation to such disputes). The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 22 May 2007 and ending on 22 May 2010. This Ruling is signed by me on the 22 nd day of May 2007. Susan Price Senior Tax Counsel 2 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR PUB 07/03 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 07/03 (“the Ruling”). Background Under section 11A(1)(k), GST is chargeable at the rate of 0% on services supplied to a non- resident who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. However, section 11A(1)(k) does not apply to services that are supplied “directly in connection with” land situated in New Zealand: section 11A(1)(k)(i)(A). New Zealand legal firms may provide legal services to clients who are non-residents and who are outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. Such legal services could include: • legal services relating to transactions involving the sale and purchase of land in New Zealand (including the drafting of agreements for sale and purchase of land, the provision of general legal advice in relation to the sale and purchase transaction and ancillary or related services leading up to the completion of the sale and purchase transaction); • legal services relating to transactions involving the lease, licence, or mortgage of land in New Zealand; • legal services relating to easements, management agreements, construction agreements, trust deeds, guarantees and other agreements in relation to land in New Zealand (including the drafting of documents and the provision of legal advice in relation to such transactions); • legal services relating to disputes arising in relation to land in New Zealand (including drafting court documents, court appearances, representation in negotiations and settlements and the provision of general legal advice in relation to such disputes). This ruling concerns the meaning of the phrase “directly in connection with” in section 11A(1)(k)(i) and the degree of connection between legal services and land in New Zealand necessary before such services would be regarded as services that are supplied “directly in connection with” land in New Zealand. Legislation Section 11A(1)(k)(i) provides: A supply of services that is chargeable with tax under section 8 must be charged at the rate of 0% in the following situations: .... (k) Subject to subsection (2), the services are supplied to a person who is a non-resident and who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed, not being services which are— 3 (i) Supplied directly in connection with— (A) Land situated in New Zealand or any improvement to the land; or (B) Moveable personal property, other than choses in action or goods to which paragraph (h) or (i) applies, situated in New Zealand at the time the services are performed;... Application of the legislation Meaning of “directly in connection with” In Case E84 (1982) 5 NZTC 59,441, Judge Bathgate discussed the meaning of the phrase “in connection with” in the context of the Income Tax Act 1976 in the following terms: It is a matter of degree whether, on the interpretation of a particular statute, there is a sufficient relationship between subject and object to come within the words “in connection with” or not. It is clear that no hard and fast rule can be or should be applied to the interpretation of the words “in connection with”. Each case depends on its own facts and the particular statute under consideration. .... Its proper interpretation depends on the context in which the phrase is used. It may mean “substantial relation in a practical business sense”, or it may have \[a\] far more restricted meaning, depending on its context, ... (p 59,446) \[emphasis added\] Judge Bathgate considered that it is a question of fact and degree and impression whether there is a sufficient relationship between two things so as to be “in connection with” each other and that the evaluation of whether two things are “in connection with” each other requires a common sense assessment of the factual situation. However, in section 11A(1)(k)(i) the phrase “in connection with” is qualified by the word “directly”. The interpretation of the phrase “directly in connection with” in the GST context was considered in Auckland Regional Authority v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,080; Wilson & Horton Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,221 (HC); (1995) 17 NZTC 12,325 (CA); Case S88 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,551 (appealed as CIR v Suzuki New Zealand Ltd (2000) 19 NZTC 15,819 (HC); (2001) 20 NZTC 17,096 (CA)); Malololailai Interval Holidays New Zealand Ltd v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,137 and Case T54 (1998) 18 NZTC 8,410. These cases illustrate how the phrase is to be interpreted in the context of section 11A(1)(k)(i)(A). The issue considered in the Auckland Regional Authority case was whether landing dues, terminal services charges and international garbage disposal charges levied by the ARA (the operator of Auckland International Airport) were paid for services that were supplied “directly in connection with” the service of international transportation. Barker J held that landing dues (which were paid for the use of runways, turnoffs, taxiways and holding bays) were supplied “directly in connection with” international transportation, since the service of international transportation could not be supplied without the provision of runways etc. However, he considered that the terminal services charge (which related to the use of terminals and equipment used for embarkation or disembarkation from international aircraft, maintenance and cleaning of luggage carousels, gate lounges, baggage makeup, distribution and storage areas) were “ancillary” (in the sense of being secondary or subservient) to the 4 supply of international transportation. Barker J also considered that the garbage disposal service was a separate service from the supply of international transportation and that, although an essential service, it was ancillary to the service of transportation. The Auckland Regional Authority case is not directly on point as it addresses the issue of whether two services are supplied “directly in connection with” each other, rather than whether a service is supplied “directly in connection with” land or other goods in New Zealand. However, by analogy, the case suggests that a service would not necessarily be “in connection with” an item even if the service could not have been performed without the existence of the item. In Wilson & Horton, the issue was whether the supply of advertising space in a newspaper was “directly in connection with” the goods advertised. In the High Court, Hillyer J considered that the goods that were the subject of the advertising were “at least one step removed from the services supplied by the newspaper proprietor” and that, therefore, the advertising services were not supplied “directly in connection with” land or any moveable personal property situated in New Zealand (p. 11,224). Hillyer J saw a distinction between the painting of a vessel (which would be directly connected with the vessel) and services supplied to the passengers or crew of the vessel (which would not be directly connected with the vessel). On appeal, it was accepted by both parties that the High Court’s conclusion was correct. Therefore, this aspect of the High Court’s judgment was not addressed by the Court of Appeal. The legislation was amended to overturn the result in Wilson & Horton (based on the Court of Appeal’s interpretation of the phrase “for and to” which was previously contained in section 11(2)(e) (now section 11A(1)(k))). However, the phrase “directly in connection with” was retained in the provision. This suggests that the “one step removed” test applied by the High Court in Wilson & Horton reflects the intention of the legislation. In Case S88, Judge Barber considered the phrase “directly in connection with” in relation to an arrangement involving warranties in respect of imported vehicles. The non-resident manufacturer (MC), from whom the importer (SNZ) purchased vehicles, provided a service warranty to SNZ under which it agreed to reimburse SNZ for certain repairs. SNZ on-sold the vehicles to a dealer, who in turn sold the vehicles to the public. The warranty given by SNZ was wider than the warranty which SNZ received from MC. If SNZ was required to reimburse the dealer for the cost of repairs covered by SNZ’s warranty and if the particular repairs were also within MC’s warranty, SNZ would claim reimbursement from MC. The issue was whether the payment received from MC was for services supplied “directly in connection with ...moveable personal property” (the vehicles) in New Zealand. Judge Barber considered that the service provided by SNZ was the repair of the vehicles (which was carried out by the dealer on behalf of SNZ) and that there was a direct relationship between the repair service and the vehicle. He noted that the repair service could not be performed but for the existence of the vehicle: In my view, the repair services effected by the dealer are directly in connection with the vehicles originally manufactured by MC but which, at the time of repair, are owned by the customer as purchaser from the dealer. The latter has, shortly before, purchased the vehicle from the objector. The moveable personal property in question is the repaired vehicle. There is a direct relationship or connection between the service of the 5 repairs and the vehicle. Accordingly, the said “proviso” to s 11(2)(e) must apply to the facts of this case and prevent the objectors from relying on the zero-rating provisions of the s 11(2)(e). The repair service could not be performed but for the existence of the vehicle. The repairs were carried out for the objector (and others) which was carrying them out for MC (and others). The objector was not merely arranging for the repairs to be carried out, but was responsible under warranty to make the repairs—as was MC. That activity, or supply, meets the statutory nexus between goods and the service. The service is the actual repair of vehicles even though that work was performed by a contractor—usually the dealer. I agree ... that s 11(2)(e) requires the existence of a linkage between the non-resident for whom the services are supplied and the moveable personal property, situated in New Zealand, in relation to which the services are performed. However, there is no requirement in s 11(2)(e) or anywhere else, that at the time the services are performed, the moveable property must be owned by the non-resident person, or that the non-resident person must be entitled to use or possession of the property. (p 7,558) \[emphasis added\] The High Court upheld Judge Barber’s decision (Suzuki New Zealand v CIR). McGechan J considered that the repair services provided by the importer were analogous to the “painting the ship” example given in Wilson & Horton: I have no doubt that repair services were carried out directly in connection with moveable personal property situated in New Zealand at the time the services were performed. Quite simply, they were repairs carried out on cars within New Zealand. The situation equates \[to\] "painting the ship". The nexus could not be closer. ... The duality involved is not prohibitive. ... while there was one repair, it arose under and met two quite separate contracts with two different persons. So far as SMC is concerned, the repair was a service to SMC, quite irrespective of the other contract with an SNZ customer likewise discharged. I see no reason why a provision of services to SMC under one contract should be viewed differently because of provision of services to a customer under another. They are concurrent but different supplies. The facts that SMC is non-resident, and a non-owner, are of no present consequence given the way s 11(1)(e)(ii) is worded. (p 15,830)\[emphasis added\] The Court of Appeal agreed that the repair services were supplied “directly in connection with” moveable personal property in New Zealand. Blanchard J, giving the judgment of the Court, said: There is a nexus in both cases between the performance and the consideration given by the other party. In the present case there is a more than sufficient financial and legal connection, as demonstrated by the evidence, between SMC’s payments and the carrying out of the repairs on behalf of SNZ by its dealers. The repairs may have been done for the customers, in practical terms, under SNZ’s standard warranty, but they were also done for SMC under its warranty. ... It follows from what we have said that we also reject the argument, made in relation to s 11(2)(e), that the services were not supplied directly in connection with movable personal property situated in New Zealand. The repair services were obviously supplied in relation to goods, namely motor vehicles, which were situated in New Zealand. The supply of repairs could hardly be more directly connected with the motor vehicles. The fact that they may have no longer been owned by SMC or SNZ is irrelevant. Section 11(2)(e) therefore has no application. (pp 17,102, 17,103) \[emphasis added\] In Malololailai Interval Holidays, a New Zealand company had supplied services relating to the marketing of timeshare interval holidays at a resort in Fiji to another New Zealand company. The issue was whether the marketing services were “supplied directly in connection with land, or any improvements thereto, situated outside New Zealand”. If so, the services would be zero-rated under section 11(2)(b) (now section 11A(1)(e)). (As the phrase “directly in connection with” has the same meaning throughout section 11A (Wilson & Horton Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,221, 11,224), the Malololailai case is relevant to the interpretation of the phrase in the context of section 11A(1)(k)(i).) In Malololailai Neazor J referred to Case E84 and said: 6 A good deal of the debate in that case about whether a narrow or wide interpretation of the statutory phrase was appropriate might have been seen as unnecessary if the word “directly” had been used, as it is in s 11 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. (p. 13,144) These comments highlight the importance of the addition of the word “directly”. The use of the word “directly” narrows the scope of what might be considered to be “in connection with” the land and confirms that there must be a direct relationship between the relevant services and land. The Malololailai case also confirms that the recipient of a service need not acquire a legal interest in land before the service would be regarded as one that is “directly in connection with” the land. At page 13,143 Neazor J commented: It is not in my view necessary to consider the first point of Mr McLay’s argument further than that, because the issue is not whether the purchaser acquires land or an interest in land, but whether the services provided by the marketer on behalf of the objector are “directly in connection with land” , which may involve much less than acquiring an interest in the land. By way of example, the provision of gardening services would surely come within the statutory words. Neazor J considered that a transaction between the New Zealand vendor and the purchaser of an interval holiday would be “directly in connection with” land outside New Zealand, but that the marketing services supplied by the marketing company (although essential to bring together the vendor and purchaser and although closely related to the sale and purchase transaction) were not “directly in connection with” the land. The marketing services merely facilitated a transaction that was directly connected to the land (the transaction between vendor and purchaser). Neazor J considered that (as with the advertising services in Wilson & Horton) the marketing services were one step removed from a transaction that directly related to the land: I would regard the contractual transaction between \[the New Zealand selling company\] and the purchaser of an interval holiday as within the descriptive words “directly in connection with land or any improvement thereto”, although that determination is not essential to this decision, but when attention is paid to the services supplied by \[the marketing company\] to \[the NZ selling company\] consider that those services are not within the statutory description. What \[the marketing company\] does is to advertise and promote interval holidays for \[the NZ selling company\] and negotiate the contract for individual holidays (including the consideration for that contract between the purchaser and \[the NZ selling company\]) up to the point where the contract is effected between those two parties. The services provided by \[the marketing company\] are not directly in connection with the land or the improvements. The transaction of those considered which would be in that category is the transaction between \[the NZ selling company\] and the purchaser. The transaction between \[the marketing company\] and \[the NZ selling company\] is one which brings about the transaction which has direct effect, but in my view is of a kind to which Hillyer J’s words may properly be applied—it is one step removed from the direct transaction. If one of the analogies referred to needs to be chosen I would take that of the publication of advertisements in the Wilson & Horton case. The newspaper proprietor’s services facilitated or opened the way to the transactions between vendor and purchaser, and that in my view is what \[the marketing company\] did, although it was more closely involved in the transaction to which the statutory words apply than the publisher of an advertisement would be. Nevertheless the transaction having direct effect was not that of the publisher, or in this case of the sales agent. (p 13,146) \[emphasis added\] The Malololailai case was decided before the High Court and the Court of Appeal judgments in Suzuki. Although Malololailai was referred to in submissions to the High Court in the Suzuki case, it was not discussed in detail by the High Court and the case was not referred to by the Court of Appeal. The Commissioner considers that the approach in Malololailai is 7 consistent with the approach taken in the Wilson & Horton case and is not inconsistent with the Suzuki decisions. These cases support a narrow interpretation of the phrase “directly in connection with”. Case T54 concerned the service of producing a video of Japanese honeymoon couples holidaying in New Zealand supplied by a Japanese company. Judge Barber considered that the services were not supplied “directly in connection with” the video camera or the blank tape used to create images (which were later edited to create the final video). Judge Barber considered that the video camera and blank tape were merely tools used to carry out the services and were not the object or objective of the services. He considered that the service provided was the creation of the final video. The judge concluded that the taxpayer had not provided services “directly in connection with” moveable personal property situated in New Zealand at the time services were performed. This was because the video did not come into existence until after the taxpayer’s services had been performed and at that time the video was outside New Zealand: The resultant video cassette did not come into existence until after the relevant services had been performed. It was not “situated inside New Zealand at the time the services are performed”. Until then it was only a blank tape. There is no other relevant moveable personal property to which the objector’s service could be regarded as supplied “directly in connection with”. Insofar as there is a connection between the said videoing services and the said blank tape (which fills up during the day) and camera and equipment, that connection is not a “direct” connection. That particular tape is only part of the equipment involved in the process of creating another tape - the resultant videotape cassette. Tools and equipment are aids to the supply of such videoing services, and are not the objects of such services. Those services could be regarded as supplied directly in connection with the Japanese tourists who, of course, are not moveable personal property. (pp 8,414-8,415) Case T54 is distinguishable on its facts from the types of situations addressed in this item, because it is not possible to argue that land did not exist before legal services are provided (an argument that was accepted in Case T54). Test of whether services are “directly in connection with” land in New Zealand The following principles on the interpretation of the phrase “directly in connection with” can be drawn from the above cases: • Whether there is sufficient relationship between two things, so as to be “in connection with” each other, is a matter of fact and degree and impression and the evaluation of whether there is a sufficient relationship between two things requires a common sense assessment of the factual situation (Case E84). • The inclusion of the word “directly” in section 11A(1)(k)(i) indicates that a close connection would be required between a service and land for the service to be regarded as a service that is supplied “directly in connection with” the land (Malololailai). • Although there must be a direct relationship between the service and the property, for the service to be directly in connection with that property, the non-resident to whom the service is provided need not own or be entitled to the use or possession of the particular property (Suzuki). • The recipient of the service need not acquire a legal interest in land before the service would be regarded as a service that is “directly in connection with” the land. Services that are “directly in connection with” land include services that have a physical effect on the land, such as gardening or repairs to improvements to land (Malololailai). 8 • Services that merely bring about or facilitate a transaction that has direct effect on land and which are one step removed from a transaction that has a direct effect on the land are not supplied “directly in connection with” the land (Wilson & Horton, Malololailai). • If the service could not have been performed but for the existence of the land, this may suggest that the service is supplied “directly in connection with” the land, but this factor is not conclusive (ARA; Suzuki). As a close relationship is required between the relevant services and land in New Zealand, the services must be supplied directly in connection with specific land in order to fall within section 11A(1)(k)(i)(A). Legal services Legal services that may be supplied to non-residents include: • Legal services relating to transactions involving the sale and purchase of land in New Zealand An analogy can be drawn between the marketing services considered in the Malololailai case and legal services in respect of the sale and purchase of land in New Zealand. In Malololailai, it was held that the marketing services did not have a direct effect on the land and that they merely facilitated a transaction that had a direct effect on the land (that is, the sale and purchase between the vendor and purchaser). Legal services relating to the sale and purchase of land facilitate or give effect to a transaction between the vendor and purchaser which has a direct effect on the land but are one step removed from that transaction. Accordingly, legal services relating to the sale and purchase of land in New Zealand (including the drafting of an agreement for the sale and purchase of land in New Zealand, legal advice in relation to a sale and purchase transaction and ancillary or related services leading up to the completion of a sale and purchase transaction) are not services that are supplied “directly in connection with” the land that is the subject of the transaction. Therefore, such services are zero-rated under section 11A(1)(k). • Legal services relating to transactions involving the lease, licence or mortgage of land in New Zealand or legal services relating to easements, management agreements, construction agreements, trust deeds, guarantees and other agreements concerning land in New Zealand The same reasoning applies to legal services relating to transactions involving the lease, licence, or mortgage of land in New Zealand or legal services relating to easements, management agreements, construction agreements, trust deeds, guarantees and other agreements concerning land in New Zealand. These services are provided to a person who enters into a transaction that would have direct effect on the land. However, such legal services are at least one step removed from the land that is the subject matter of the transactions. These services merely assist in bringing about or facilitating a transaction that has direct effect on the land. Accordingly, legal services relating to transactions involving the lease, licence or mortgage of land in New Zealand or legal services relating to easements, management 9 agreements, construction agreements, trust deeds, guarantees and other agreements concerning land in New Zealand (including the drafting of agreements relating to these transactions and the provision of legal advice in respect of such transactions) are not supplied “directly in connection with” the land that is the subject of these transactions. Such services are zero-rated under section 11A(1)(k). • Legal representation in disputes in relation to land in New Zealand Legal services involving representation in disputes relating to land in New Zealand (including drafting court documents, court appearances, representation in negotiations and settlements, and general advice) are also one step removed from the land to which the dispute relates. These services may be supplied as a consequence of a transaction that has direct effect on the land. However, consistent with the approach taken in Malololailai, the services are not supplied “directly in connection with” the land to which the dispute relates. Therefore, these services are also zero-rated under section 11A(1)(k). Example Steve, who is a US resident, comes to New Zealand with a view to purchasing land for investment purposes. He returns to the US and continues to carry on negotiations for the purchase of land from a distance. Tracey, a New Zealand solicitor, arranges for searches of the land in Land Information New Zealand’s records to be carried out and obtains a LIM report from the local authority. She provides advice in relation to tax issues relating to the purchase, advice on whether Overseas Investment Commission consent to the purchase is required and general legal advice in relation to the transaction. Tracey then drafts an agreement for sale and purchase which is signed by both parties. She also advises Steve regarding a mortgage to be secured over the land, drafts a transfer to be signed by the vendor and attends to settlement of the transaction. After settlement, Steve telephones a real estate agent and arranges for the property to be leased. Tracey drafts the lease and negotiates with the lessee’s solicitor regarding the form of the lease. The lease is signed and the lessee takes occupation of the property. During a brief visit to New Zealand, Steve discovers that the lessee is using the property for a purpose that is not authorised by the lease. Tracey drafts a notice to the lessee terminating the lease and arranges for the notice to be served. The lessee then applies to the court for an injunction preventing Steve from terminating the lease. Steve instructs Tracey to draft documents opposing the injunction. Tracey provides advice in relation to the management of the dispute and represents Steve in settlement negotiations with the lessee. Ultimately, the dispute is settled out of court. The legal services provided by Tracey either facilitate transactions between Steve and the vendor, the mortgagee or the lessee which have a direct effect on the land (by creating or changing legal interests in respect of the land) or arise as a consequence of these transactions. However, Tracey’s legal services are one step removed from transactions which directly affect the land. The legal services are not supplied directly in connection with land in New Zealand. Therefore, provided Steve is outside New Zealand at all times when these services are performed, the services will be zero-rated under section 11A(1)(k). 10

Susan Price Senior Tax Counsel 11 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULINGS BR PUB 07/04–07/09 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Rulings BR Pub 07/04–07/09 (“the Rulings”). The Rulings and commentary express the Commissioner’s view of the principles relating to interest deductibility in the Australian Full Federal Court decision in FC of T v Roberts; FC of T v Smith 92 ATC 4 (“Roberts and Smith”). All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2004 unless otherwise stated. SUMMARY 1. The interest deductibility test is satisfied if there is a sufficient connection between interest incurred and assessable income. The sufficient connection is established if the borrowed funds on which interest is incurred are used in deriving assessable income or in a business carried on for the purpose of deriving assessable income. 2. In Roberts and Smith the borrowed funds were not used directly in deriving income, but the Court held that the interest is deductible. 3. Roberts and Smith is authority that there is a sufficient connection between interest and income when the interest is incurred on borrowed funds used to replace an amount previously invested in an income earning activity or business and to return the amount to the person who invested it. The link with income is through the new borrowings taking the place of funds that have a sufficient connection with assessable income or in respect of which interest was deductible through the operation of section DB 7 or DB 8 of the Income Tax Act 2004. Capital contributions, past years’ profits and debt are all capable of being replaced. 4. The case only applies where the amount replaced and repaid is owed to a person separate to the income earning activity or business. It does not apply to sole traders. 12 BACKGROUND Legislation Income Tax Act 2004 PART D — DEDUCTIONS Subpart DA — General rules DA 1 GENERAL PERMISSION DA 1(1) Nexus with income A person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss (including an amount of depreciation loss) to the extent to which the expenditure or loss is— (a) incurred by them in deriving— (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income; or (b) incurred by them in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving— (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income.

DB 6 INTEREST: NOT CAPITAL EXPENDITURE DB 6(1) Deduction A person is allowed a deduction for interest incurred. DB 6(2) Exclusion Subsection (1) does not apply to interest for which a person is denied a deduction under section DB 1. DB 6(3) Link with subpart DA This section overrides the capital limitation. The general permission must still be satisfied and the other general limitations still apply.

DB 7(5) Exclusion: interest related to tax Subsection (1) does not apply to interest for which a person is denied a deduction under section DB 1. DB 7(6) Link with subpart DA This section supplements the general permission and overrides the capital limitation, the exempt income limitation, and the withholding tax limitation. The other general limitations still apply. Defined in this Act: business, capital limitation, company, deduction, dividend, exempt income, exempt income limitation, fixed establishment, general limitation, general permission, income, interest, New Zealand, non-resident company, qualifying company, supplement, wholly-owned group of companies, withholding tax limitation DB 8 INTEREST: MONEY BORROWED TO ACQUIRE SHARES IN GROUP COMPANIES DB 8(1) Deduction: borrowing to acquire group company shares A company is allowed a deduction for interest incurred on money borrowed to acquire shares in another company in the same group of companies. DB 8(2) Exclusion: group not in existence at tax year end Subsection (1) does not apply if the 2 companies are not in the same group of companies at the end of the tax year for which the deduction is claimed. DB 8(3) Deduction: interest after qualifying amalgamation A company is allowed a deduction for interest incurred on money borrowed to acquire shares in another company that has ceased to exist on a qualifying amalgamation. DB 8(4) Exclusion: group not in existence immediately before qualifying amalgamation Subsection (3) does not apply if the 2 companies were not in the same group of companies immediately before the qualifying amalgamation. DB 8(5) Application from tax year of qualifying amalgamation Subsection (3) applies in the tax year in which the qualifying amalgamation occurs and in later tax years. DB 8(6) Link with subpart DA This section supplements the general permission and overrides the capital limitation, the exempt income limitation, and the withholding tax limitation. The other general limitations still apply. Defined in this Act: company, deduction, exempt income limitation, general limitation, general permission, group of companies, interest, qualifying amalgamation, share, supplement, tax year, withholding tax limitation Roberts and Smith principle not relevant to section DB 7 deductions 5. The interest deductibility legislation distinguishes between companies and other taxpayers. Interest incurred by companies is automatically deductible— that is, there is no requirement to satisfy a nexus test—except for certain exceptions. The effect of this is that most companies seeking interest deductions will obtain them under section DB 7, rather than by applying Roberts and Smith. Roberts and Smith may apply to companies who do not come within section DB 7. 15 6. Under section DB 7, interest incurred by a company is automatically deductible, provided the statutory exceptions in subsections DB 7(2) – (5) do not apply. The exceptions are: • qualifying companies; • companies deriving exempt income except if that exempt income is dividends, exempt income arising from a disposal of a company’s own shares or exempt income related to stake money and a breeding business; • non-resident companies to the extent to which interest is not incurred in the course of carrying on a business through a fixed establishment in New Zealand; and • interest on unpaid taxes payable to another country and substantially the same as civil or criminal penalties as defined under certain laws in New Zealand. 7. The effect of section DB 7 is discussed in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 13, No 11 (November 2001). How the sections of the Act, other than section DB 7, apply in relation to interest deductibility 8. Section DB 6(1) provides that: A person is allowed a deduction for interest incurred. 9. Section DB 6(3) states that This section overrides the capital limitation. The general permission must still be satisfied and the other general limitations still apply. 10. Therefore, a person seeking to deduct interest is subject to the general permission, which states: DA 1 GENERAL PERMISSION DA 1(1) Nexus with income A person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss (including an amount of depreciation loss) to the extent to which the expenditure or loss is— (a) incurred by them in deriving— (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income; or (b) incurred by them in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving— (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income. DA 1(2) General permission Subsection (1) is called the general permission. 16 11. So in considering the application of the Act to interest expense, a person must satisfy the test under the general permission that the expenditure (interest in this case) is incurred in deriving assessable income (or excluded income) or incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable (or excluded income). This test is the same in all relevant respects to the test under the 1994 Act. 12. The concept of “excluded income” requires some comment in relation to how it will be dealt with in this commentary. “Excluded income” is defined and specified to include, for example, GST, fringe benefits, certain life insurance premiums or claims derived by persons carrying on the business of life insurance, and other specific classes of income (see sections OB 1, BD 1(3) and subparts CX and CZ). The addition of the reference to “excluded income” in the general permission does not alter the principles applying to the deductibility of interest. The same principles apply to excluded income. However, because the concept of “excluded income” is a statutory mechanism used to deal with certain types of income, and does not affect the principles of interest deductibility, for ease of reference, “excluded income” is not referred to further in this commentary. 13. The general permission is subject to the general limitations, pursuant to section DA 2(7). The general limitations include the private limitation and the capital limitation: DA 2 GENERAL LIMITATIONS DA 2(1) Capital limitation A person is denied a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a capital nature. This rule is called the capital limitation. DA 2(2) Private limitation A person is denied a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a private or domestic nature. This rule is called the private limitation. ... DA 2(7) Relationship of general limitations to general permission Each of the general limitations in this section overrides the general permission. 14. The private limitation applies to interest expense, pursuant to section DA 2(2). The capital limitation, on the other hand, does not apply to interest. This result is achieved in the Act by the capital limitation being expressly overridden. Sections DA 3(4) and DA 3(5) state the general rule that a limitation (such as that applying to capital expenditure) does not apply if it is expressly overridden: DA 3(4) Relationship between other specific provisions and general permission or general limitations A provision in any of subparts DB to DZ may override any 1 or more of the general permission and the general limitations. DA 3(5) Express reference needed to override A provision in any of subparts DB to DZ takes effect to override the general permission or a general limitation only if it expressly states— (a) that it overrides the general permission or the relevant limitation; or (b) that the general permission or the relevant limitation does not apply. ... 17 15. The capital limitation is expressly overridden in relation to interest by section DB 6(3) (subsection DB 6(1) is reproduced to give context): DB 6 INTEREST: NOT CAPITAL EXPENDITURE DB 6(1) Deduction A person is allowed a deduction for interest incurred. ... DB 6(3) Link with subpart DA This section overrides the capital limitation. The general permission must still be satisfied and the other general limitations still apply. Defined in this Act: capital limitation, deduction, general limitation, general permission, interest Summary of the legislation relating to interest deductions 16. In summary, the legislation provides the following general rules relating to interest deductibility: • Interest incurred by companies is usually automatically deductible; • For other taxpayers, interest is deductible if it is incurred in deriving assessable income or incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income; • Interest is not deductible if it is private or domestic in nature; • Being capital in nature will not, on its own, mean that interest is non- deductible. Analysis of the Commissioner’s Opinion The Roberts and Smith case Introduction 17. Courts have established that the general test for interest deductibility requires a sufficient connection between the interest on borrowed funds and the derivation of income. This sufficient connection depends on the use to which the assets provided with the borrowed funds are put (see Richardson J in Eggers v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1988) 10 NZTC 5,153, and Pacific Rendezvous Ltd v C of IR (1986) 8 NZTC 5,146; Cooke P at p 573, Richardson J at pp 577-578 and Somers J at p 581). In most cases, the test is satisfied when the borrowed funds are used directly in an income earning activity or business in that they are used to acquire income earning assets. 18. In a limited number of cases, notably Roberts and Smith and Public Trustee v CIR, Courts have held that the borrowed funds were used in relation to the income earning assets, and that the connection was sufficient for deductibility, even though the funds were deployed outside the income earning activity or business. The application of Roberts and Smith is discussed in this commentary, and the application of Public Trustee is discussed in 18 Interpretation Statement IS0082—Interest Deductibility—Public Trustee v CIR. The facts of Roberts and Smith 19. The Australian decision in Roberts and Smith concerned the deductibility of interest incurred by a partnership which borrowed in order to repay partners part of their capital contributions. Judgment was given on two appeals heard together. 20. The facts were that new partners were to join the partnership, but the cost of contributing an amount equal to the capital of the existing partners was too high. To make it easier for the new partners to join the partnership, the partners decided to decrease the amount of the existing partners’ capital by borrowing to repay partners their capital contributions. The Australian Full Federal Court held that the interest on this borrowing was deductible. 21. Hill J, who delivered the leading judgment, considered that the deduction was limited to the extent that the borrowed funds replaced the amount of partnership capital contributed by partners. His Honour explained (p 4,390): The provision of funds to the partners in circumstances where that provision is not a replacement of funds invested in the business, lacks the essential connection with the income producing activities of the partnership business. \[emphasis added\] 22. Hill J explained his reasoning in the following passage (p 4,390): Let it be assumed that the original partnership capital in the Lord Lindley sense \[i.e. contributed capital\] was $10 and that the balance in the account designated as “the capital account” of the partnership was $125,000, which included goodwill. That would mean that the equity of each partner in the partnership, assuming five partners, was $25,000. But it could not be said that each partner had invested funds totalling $25,000 as capital in the partnership. A cheque for $25,000 drawn on the partnership bank account would not operate to repay the partner any funds invested. The partnership capital would remain as $10, and all that would happen is that there would be a borrowing which was used to pay the partner $25,000. That borrowing would reduce the partner’s equity in the partnership, but it could not represent a replacement of capital invested. The partnership assets would remain constant. The goodwill would still be worth $125,000; it would not have been distributed to the partners, nor could it be. On these facts, there could be no question of there being a refund of a pre-existing capital contribution. Rather, looking at the facts objectively, the only purpose of the borrowing would be the provision of funds to the partners to which they were not entitled during the currency of the partnership (save of course by agreement among themselves). The provision of funds to the partners in circumstances where that provision is not a replacement of funds invested in the business, lacks the essential connection with the income producing activities of the partnership, or, in other words, the partnership business. ... If at least $125,000 of the amount in that account represents partnership capital in the Lord Lindley sense, undrawn profit distributions, advances by partners or other funds which have actually been invested in the partnership and which the partners were entitled to withdraw in June 1984, then in my view the taxpayer is entitled to succeed. \[emphasis added\] 19 23. His Honour considered that interest is only deductible in this type of situation if the borrowed funds replace amounts that have actually been invested in the partnership. The reason for this is that the borrowed funds will only take on the character of the funds they are replacing if in fact they have the effect of replacing funds used in the business. Capital contributions can be replaced by borrowings that are used to pay out these contributions to partners. Hill J explains that goodwill is not an amount invested in an income earning activity, and so it cannot be repaid to anyone, and therefore borrowed funds cannot take the place of that goodwill. Similarly, with asset revaluations, the revalued portion of the asset is not an amount that has been invested so it cannot be repaid to anyone. 24. Therefore, Roberts and Smith applies if an amount is able to be replaced by borrowed funds and if the amount replaced is then returned to the person who invested it. The link with income comes through the new borrowings taking the place of funds that have a sufficient connection with assessable income. Capital contributions, undrawn profits and advances are all capable of being replaced. 25. This principle from Roberts and Smith is referred to in this commentary as the “replacement and repayment principle”. Are the borrowed funds used in an income earning activity? 26. In Hill J’s view, in the circumstances of Roberts and Smith the borrowings replaced the capital that had been paid in by the partners. A question might be raised as to how borrowings can be said to replace funds invested in an income earning activity or business, when the borrowings were actually paid direct to the partners and were never paid into the partnership. The “replacement” occurs in the books of the partnership in that equity is reduced and debt increased. There might seem to be some difficulty in understanding how one debt, with its own parties, conditions, and direct use can inherit the deductibility status of a completely different debt. A basic principle of deductibility would seem to be that deductibility of any item should depend on the circumstances in which it is incurred. A further issue is that if the direct use of the borrowed funds is a private use, for example the private use of partners in a partnership, then it might be argued that the prohibition against deductions of a private nature in section DA 2(2) might apply. 27. Hill J supports his reasoning by saying that interest on a debt that replaces a debt is deductible. But that statement is not an explanation, and it is not clear that a debt replacing a debt inherits its deductibility status. A contrary approach was taken in the Canadian decision in Interior Breweries Ltd v Minister of National Revenue \[1955\] C.T.C. 143, 55 D.T.C. 1090 (Exch.). In that case Cameron J of the Exchequer Court held that interest was not deductible where the borrowed funds were used to pay a bank loan. Cameron J considered that the borrowed money was not used to earn income, but was “used entirely to pay off the bank loan...” (p.148). 28. However, Interior Breweries does not appear to have been applied in any later cases. In Canada, the reason is that legislation was introduced to reverse its 20 effect. It seems likely that the decision may not be accepted in New Zealand or Australia if it were argued, because although New Zealand and Australian courts have been cautious about allowing deductions relating to indirect uses of borrowed funds (particularly in the lower courts in regard to cases where there has been private use of funds), they have not taken such a strict approach as the Canadian courts. Roberts and Smith is an Australian example of acceptance by a Court that interest may, in some situations, be deductible when the borrowed funds are not used directly to derive income. The approach to identifying the use of borrowed funds in New Zealand 29. In New Zealand, as in Australia and Canada, the interest deductibility test involves considering the use of the borrowed funds and the connection between the funds and the derivation of income. However, New Zealand Courts have held that the use of funds encompasses not only the direct use of the funds, but also the outcome of that use. In Public Trustee the borrowed funds were applied in payment of the death duties. It was argued that the funds were used to retain assets. The dissenting judge in Public Trustee, Northcroft J, had the following view about how the borrowed funds were used (p 459): ... if money be borrowed to discharge a debt of the owner of the business which debt is otherwise unconnected with the business and if the alternative be a sale of business assets with a consequent diminution of profits, then, in my opinion, this would be capital employed in the payment of the debt and not in the production of income. 30. Northcroft J’s view was not shared by the majority. The majority held that the capital was used in the payment of the debt and to retain assets. Callan J held that borrowed capital used in retaining assets is employed in the production of assessable income, just as capital used in acquiring assets is employed in the production of assessable income. Therefore, the case is authority that in identifying how borrowed funds are used as required by the statutory test, the use of funds will not only encompass the actual application of the funds, but will include the outcome of the application. This interpretation is consistent with the meaning of “use” in the Concise Oxford Dictionary (11 th ed, Oxford University Press, 2004): use take, hold, or deploy as a means of achieving something. 31. This definition involves two aspects: deployment (i.e. application) and outcome. A similar conclusion was reached in Pacific Rendezvous. The use of the funds was held to be in acquiring assets for the motel business and in augmenting the company’s capital. Pacific Rendezvous therefore established that if borrowed funds are used in deriving assessable income, and the sufficient connection is established, it does not matter that the funds are also used to achieve a non-taxable outcome. In the Commissioner’s opinion, this same reasoning applies to the Roberts and Smith situation. If the sufficient connection is established through the use of the borrowed funds, that connection is not lost if there is a second, non-income-related outcome. In Roberts and Smith, the two outcomes were the replacement of funds that had a sufficient connection with the derivation of assessable income, and the use of the funds by partners for non-partnership and possibly private uses. 21 32. The Commissioner’s opinion is, following Hill J’s judgment, and applying the understanding of “use” that New Zealand Courts have taken, that borrowings used to replace and repay amounts invested in an income earning activity or business will have a sufficient connection with income. In those circumstances, the new borrowings take on the character of the money they replace, and the interest will be deductible if the original funds were used directly in the income earning process. Deductibility will not be affected by a concurrent non-income earning use of the borrowed funds. A requirement of the replacement and repayment principle—the funds must return to their owners 33. An element of the Roberts and Smith replacement and repayment principle is that the repaid funds are returned to the person who originally paid them. The principle stated by Hill J in Roberts and Smith is as follows (p 4,390): The provision of funds to the partners in circumstances where that provision is not a replacement of funds invested in the business, lacks the essential connection with the income producing activities of the partnership, or in other words, the partnership business. 34. Roberts and Smith does not apply when the borrowed funds are paid to someone else other than the person who originally paid them into the income earning activity. In that situation, even though the borrowed funds would be recorded as a liability against the assets, there is no particular connection between the new borrowing and those assets. That situation contrasts with the one where the borrowings are used to repay funds in the partnership that had a sufficient nexus for deductibility. When the new borrowing has the effect of repaying those other funds to the person who contributed them, the replacing funds have a special connection with the funds replaced that can be traced from one use of funds to the other, such that the replacing funds can take the place of the replaced funds and so take on the deductibility nexus of the replaced funds. Funds used to replace but not repay funds do not have that same connection with those amounts and do not inherit any deductibility status. 35. This distinction can be understood from a statutory interpretive point of view. If the Roberts and Smith principle extended to borrowings used to replace any amounts in an income earning activity or business, then interest on those funds would in most cases be deductible. That result would be inconsistent with the presence of a statutory test for deductibility that requires a sufficient connection between interest and income. For example, a business might borrow and use the funds for a non-income use, such as to make a nil interest loan to a sister company, to invest in a company which was barred from making distributions, or to pay criminal fines. The argument might be made that as the borrowing would be reflected in the business’ liabilities, it was used in the income earning activity. However, borrowed funds used in that way are not connected with the income earning activity or business. No amount is repaid, and therefore the borrowings cannot inherit any connection with income. 22 36. Professor Parsons discussed this issue in his paper Roberts and Smith: Principles of Interest Deductibility. 1 He argued that the Roberts and Smith principle should not be simply that a borrowing inherits the deductibility status of the original borrowing. If that were the rule, then there “would be opened a means of obtaining deductions for interest in respect of money borrowed that is used for private non-income producing purposes”. In the Commissioner’s opinion, an interpretation of the deductibility provision that would lead to all interest being deductible, in the context of a provision that the Courts have said requires a sufficient connection and apportionment where that connection is not established, cannot be correct. 37. Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, the Roberts and Smith principle requires that funds repaid are returned to the person who invested or advanced them. New Zealand cases relevant to Roberts and Smith Case P56 38. The approach of the TRA in Case P56 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,386 is similar to the Commissioner’s interpretation of Roberts and Smith. Partners borrowed to draw out more than they had invested in the partnership. The interest was held to be non-deductible. Willy DJ said that if the partners had replaced capital investments, they would have been entitled to interest deductions (p.4,396). Case M127 39. Roberts and Smith appears to be inconsistent with Case M127 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,817. Case M127 concerned a husband and wife operating a coffee lounge business. They had $76,000 of their own equity invested in the business. There was little available cash. They wished to buy a new dwelling house, and had some cash outside of the business, but were $70,000 short. The partnership paid $70,000 to the husband and wife as individuals. This put the partnership account into overdraft. The partnership then borrowed to repay the overdraft, leaving it with a credit balance of $2,304. In summary, the borrowed funds were used by the partnership to pay back a loan to the bank, which had been taken out to repay partners their capital so that they could buy a house. The effect on the partnership’s balance sheet was that the capital contributed by the partners was replaced by the loan. 40. The objectors argued that the borrowed money was used in the production of income. It does not appear from the judgment that they specifically argued that the loans replaced their equity. The case was heard before Roberts and Smith was decided, so the taxpayers did not have that case available as a precedent. 41. It is helpful to consider the case in the context of the general principles of interest deductibility. The direct test for interest deductibility, followed in Pacific Rendezvous v CIR and C of IR v Brierley (1990) 12 NZTC 7,184, 1 Professor Ross Parsons, Taxation in Australia Red Edition. Vol.1 No.5 June 1993 p.261 at p.266 23 requires borrowed funds to be traced to a use that derives income. Roberts and Smith is authority that a strict tracing is not required, if the borrowing replaces funds, and the replacement involves a replacement of money actually invested. The direct use of the borrowed funds in Roberts and Smith was to pay capital out to partners, who may have used the funds for private use. Hill J said at p 4,388: A tracing approach, if carried beyond the payment to the partner, encourages the argument raised by the Commissioner in the present case that the funds were used for the private purpose of the partner who received them. But that fact will not preclude the deductibility of the outgoing. The funds to be withdrawn in such a case were employed in the partnership business; the borrowing replaces those funds and the interest incurred on the borrowing will meet the statutory description of interest incurred in the gaining or production of the partnership of assessable income. 42. In Case M127, if a strict tracing approach is applied, the loan was used to pay off a business overdraft. That overdraft loan can be traced to private use by the partners. If Roberts and Smith is applied to the facts, the second loan can be seen as replacing the overdraft, which in turn replaced the equity. The equity was used directly to fund the partnership’s business, and therefore, there is a sufficient connection with income such that the interest is deductible. This reasoning was not argued, or applied by Bathgate DJ. Bathgate DJ held that the interest was not deductible. The case is, therefore, incompatible with Roberts and Smith. The objectors may have still failed on the facts, had they argued Roberts and Smith, because a large proportion of the $76,000 appears to have been made up of goodwill. 43. In the absence of Roberts and Smith, Bathgate DJ held in Case M127 that the borrowed funds were used for private purposes. His Honour considered that the first loan by way of overdraft was used to buy the house, the second loan paid back the overdraft, and that neither loan was used in producing partnership income. Instead, the loans were used to purchase the house for the objectors. The interest incurred by the partners was private in nature. 44. The decision in Case M127 is therefore inconsistent with the decision in Roberts and Smith. Although the TRA case is from the New Zealand jurisdiction, a decision of the Full Federal Court of Australia has precedential value, and in the circumstances of this issue the Commissioner considers that a higher New Zealand court would follow the decision in Roberts and Smith rather than the TRA decision. The arrangements to which the replacement and repayment principle applies Returns of capital to partners 45. The Roberts and Smith replacement and repayment principle applies to borrowed funds used to repay partners their capital contributions to the partnership. Interest is deductible on borrowings used to repay capital to partners, to the extent that the capital that was repaid was used in earning assessable income. 24 46. This view is based on the conclusion that a partnership can transfer property to a partner. However, a partnership is not a legal entity. A partnership consists of a collection of rights and obligations between the partners, and ownership of partnership assets is vested in the partners, not the partnership. It could be argued, therefore, that a partnership cannot repay partnership property to a partner, because the partner already owned that property. 47. A key concept of partnership law is that partners do not have individual rights to partnership property. In Hadlee & Sydney Bridge Nominees Ltd v C of IR (1993) 15 NZTC (PC), the Privy Council considered the rights of partners. Lord Jauncey, delivering the judgment, said at paragraph 5 that as a matter of general law a partner does not have title to specific partnership property but has a beneficial interest in the entirety of the partnership assets and in each and every particular asset of the partnership (his Lordship quoting Richardson J in the Court of Appeal Hadlee and Sydney Bridge Nominees Ltd v CIR (1991)13 NZTC 8,116, 8,126 and referring to Lindley on Partnership 15 th edition, page 516). 2 This beneficial interest, expressed in terms of its realisability, is in the nature of a future interest taking effect in possession on (and not before) the determination of the partnership. 48. Molloy says in Principles of the Law of Partnership 3 that a receipt received by a partnership remains a receipt of the partnership alone, which is to say by the partners jointly. He says that if an amount is partnership property, it is not an individual entitlement of any particular partner. The individual partner does not derive several income (i.e. each partner’s individual allocation of income) until it has been ascertained whether the overall result for the relevant fiscal period has been that the firm has derived any net assessable income. 49. The point was made in Crowe v Commissioner of Taxation (1958) 100 CLR 532 that there is a distinction between partnership property and partner’s individual property. The case was concerned with an expense, rather than income, but is relevant because it makes the point that partnership property is not the same as individual entitlements of the partners. In Crowe a partnership took out a policy on each of the lives of its four partners. Each policy was for the benefit of all four partners. The premiums were paid by the firm and the policy was in the name of the firm. A provision of the Australian Commonwealth income tax legislation permitted the deduction of “amounts paid by the taxpayer as premiums or sums for insurance on the life of the taxpayer.” Fullagar J said that if any of the partners were to have: ... effected an insurance on her own life, and the partnership had paid a premium on the policy at her request and debited the amount to an advance account in its books, I should have said that she ought to be held to have “paid” the premium, although no money or money’s worth passed from her hand to the hand of the insurer. 2 Lindley & Banks on Partnership, 17 th edition, para. 19-08. 3 Principles of the Law of Partnership sixth edition Webb and Molloy Butterworths Wellington 1996 para. 11.235 25 50. The issue in the case was whether payment by the firm, of the premium on a policy which the firm itself had taken out, had been payment by the taxpayer. Fullagar J answered the question in the negative: \[T\]hat a partnership has, in English law, no legal personality distinct from those of the individual partners ... does not mean that there is not a very real difference between a right or obligation of a partnership (or partners as such) and a right or obligation of an individual member of a partnership. 51. The insurance contracts were taken out in the name of the firm, and the firm (and not each individual partner) paid the premiums. The premiums were paid by the partners jointly. It was therefore not a payment made by any one of the individual partners. Similarly, in the Commissioner’s view, income of a firm is derived by the partners jointly, and not individually by each partner. 52. This conclusion is consistent with section HD, which provides that: HD 1 ASSESSMENT OF PARTNERS, CO-TRUSTEES, AND JOINT VENTURERS HD 1(1) Where amounts are derived or incurred by 2 or more persons jointly, whether as partners, co-trustees, or otherwise,— (a) in the case of co-trustees, they include such amounts that would be income or deductions if the co-trustees were a single taxpayer resident in New Zealand in a joint calculation of taxable income and are jointly and severally liable for the resulting income tax liability: (b) in the case of partners there is no joint assessment, but each partner must, in calculating their taxable income, take into account their share of the income that they jointly derive from the firm: (c) in any case other than that of co-trustees or partners, each person jointly deriving or incurring such amounts must, in calculating their taxable income, take into account their share of the income that they jointly derive. 53. As partners own an undivided interest in partnership property, and do not have individual title to any particular items of partnership property, there can be a valid legal transfer of property from a partnership to a partner, because the nature of the legal ownership changes from joint ownership to ownership by a single person. Therefore, the Roberts and Smith principle can apply to partnerships. The Roberts and Smith case of course involved a partnership, and so is authority for this point. 54. Proposals released in an Inland Revenue discussion document in June 2006, General and limited partnerships - proposed tax changes 4 to change the law relating to the taxation of partnerships will not, in their current form, affect this conclusion. 55. It should be noted that a return of capital, whether by a partnership or a company, is not connected with income simply because it is an ordinary part of running a business. A return of capital is not part of the income earning activity, it is a transaction relating to the structure of the business. However, 4 A Government discussion document. June 2006 26 there is a sufficient connection with income in this arrangement because, following Roberts and Smith, borrowing to return capital has the effect of replacing and repaying the funding of the income earning activity. In these circumstances, the borrowed funds continue the connection the repaid funds had with income. Share repurchases 56. A repurchase of shares by a company involves a payment by a company to its shareholders of amounts previously contributed by shareholders. The effect of the payment by the company is a diminishment of the shareholder’s capital holding in the company. This arrangement is analogous to a return of capital to partners in a partnership. 57. Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, the replacement and repayment principle may apply to share repurchases. Interest is deductible on borrowings used to repay share capital to shareholders, to the extent that the capital was used in deriving the company’s assessable income. 58. As discussed above, interest incurred by companies will usually be deductible under section DB 7, without the necessity to apply Roberts and Smith. Payments of past years’ profits to partners 59. Past years’ profits in a partnership, which Hill J refers to as undrawn profit distributions, can be viewed as amounts contributed by partners. If a partner does not withdraw profits, they are allocated to partners equally, or in accordance with the divisions in the partnership agreement (Principles of the Law of Partnership). 5 The accounting treatment might be to carry profits to the credit of the partner’s respective current accounts by book entry calculated at the end of the accounting period. Although there may not be any active reinvestment by the partners themselves, this process can reasonably be seen as an investment of capital. 60. Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, past years’ profits can be seen as reinvestments by partners in the partnership and the replacement and repayment principle may apply. Interest is deductible on borrowings used to repay past years’ profits to partners, to the extent that those profits were used in earning assessable income or in the partnership business. Payments of current year income to partners 61. The Commissioner’s opinion is that the principle from Roberts and Smith does not extend to borrowings purporting to return the current year income that has not yet been identified as profits. The reason is that current year income is not an amount that has been invested in the partnership by the partners, and so cannot be repaid to partners. 5 ibid para.s 2.48 and 4.109 27 62. The principle from Roberts and Smith is that interest may be deductible if borrowed funds repay funds invested in an income-earning activity or business carried on to derive income. The issue with current year income is whether it is an amount that can be repaid. To be repayable, it must have been paid into the partnership by someone. The amount can only have been paid in if someone other than the partnership has had an entitlement to it at some time. Therefore, the issue is to decide whether partners can be said to have become individually entitled to current year income at some time before any purported replacement. 63. To consider this question, the legal nature of current year income will be examined. If current year partnership income is owned by individual partners at any point during the year, it could in theory be invested by partners in the partnership business. Is current year income partnership property or property of individual partners? 64. The conclusion has already been reached that there is a distinction between partnership property and property belonging to individual partners. In considering the application of Roberts and Smith to current year income, the next step is to ascertain whether it is partnership property, or property of individual partners. 65. The Partnership Act 1908 is silent on the treatment of current year income. It provides for the division of profits in section 27: 27. Rules as to interests and duties of partners— The interests of partners in the partnership property, and their rights and duties in relation to the partnership, shall be determined, subject to any agreement (express or implied) between the partners, by the following rules: (a) All the partners are entitled to share equally in the capital and profits of the business, and must contribute equally towards the losses, whether of capital or otherwise, sustained by the firm: ... (d) A partner is not entitled, before the ascertainment of profits, to interest on the capital subscribed by him: 66. Under section 27, partners are entitled to share in any profits, subject to any agreement to the contrary. The concept of “profits” is not defined. There is no particular guidance in the Partnership Act as to when the division and allocation of profits occurs. 67. It has been held in Australia that, for tax purposes, the amount that forms part of each partner’s individual income is only ascertainable once partnership accounts have been prepared, and that this would normally be at year end. In FC of T v Galland 86 ATC 4885 the High Court held that in the absence of an agreement stating a different balance date, accounts of the partnership would be required to be taken each year as at 30 June and a partner’s share of the partnership income would be distributed to the partner as at that date. The Court said that: 28 ...although a partner is not usually entitled to call for a distribution of profits or net income until accounts have been prepared, he has an individual interest in the net income of the partnership, notwithstanding that the precise amount of his interest cannot be determined until the accounts are prepared for the relevant period. 68. The Court’s view is that partners are not \[usually\] entitled to current year income. The partners have an individual interest in the net income of the partnership, but not an immediate entitlement to the current year income. Galland was quoted by Hill J in Roberts and Smith as authority for the proposition that a partner’s share of the partnership income is derived by the partner only once annual accounts of the partnership have been prepared. Hill J said: In the absence of agreement, accounts for the partnership would be required to be taken each year as at 30 June and a partner’s share of the partnership income would be derived by him as at that date: FC of T v Galland. 69. Further, it is in the nature of profits that they have to be identified before anyone can become entitled to them. Fletcher Moulton LJ provided a definition of “profits” in Re Spanish Prospecting Co. Ltd \[1911\] 1 Ch 92 at 98-99 6 (cited in Galland): The word “profits” has, in my opinion, a well-defined legal meaning, and this meaning coincides with the fundamental conception of profits in general practice, although in mercantile phraseology the word may at times bear meanings indicated by the special context which deviate in some respect from this fundamental signification. “Profits” implies a comparison between the state of a business at two specific dates usually separated by an interval of a year. The fundamental meaning is the amount of gain made by the business during the year. This can only be ascertained by a comparison of the assets of the business at two dates ... We start therefore with this fundamental definition of profits, namely, if the total assets of the business at the two dates be compared, the increase which they show at the later date as compared with the earlier date (due allowance of course being made for any capital introduced into or taken out of the business in the meanwhile) represents in strictness the profits of the business during the period in question. 70. As Fletcher Moulton LJ points out, as a matter of logic, profits can only be known once they are calculated. They can only be calculated when the amounts of income and expenses for the relevant fiscal period are known. Although amounts will come in that will in due course form profits, until the fiscal period has ended, the amount of profits cannot be known. It follows, in the Commissioner’s opinion, that an entitlement cannot arise until the amount can be known, and it can only be known at the end of the fiscal period. This period, as Fletcher Moulton LJ says, is generally annual. 71. Therefore, the Commissioner’s opinion is that a partner does not have an individual entitlement to current year income. Current year income is owned by all of the partners jointly. Individual partners have an ownership interest in it in common with the other partners, but not an entitlement to their potential individual share until profits have been calculated and allocated for a fiscal period. 6 This definition was adopted by Williams J in Dalgety v Commissioner of Taxes \[1912\] NZLR 260 at 261-262, and discussed in The Law of Partnership in Australia and New Zealand Higgins & Fletcher LBC Information Services 2001 eighth edition 29 Discussion of current year income in Roberts and Smith 72. In applying the law to the case he was considering, Hill J explained that it was necessary to identify whether the partners received a refund of capital, or whether they received amounts in excess of their capital. Hill J considered capital to be the aggregate amounts contributed by the partners for the purpose of commencing or carrying on the partnership business (p 4,389). The partnership accounts he was considering did not separate out the contributed capital from other items. He thought that it was possible that the amount of capital represented in the partnership accounts included (p 4,390): • contributed capital; • internally generated goodwill; • undrawn distributions; • profits of the year not yet distributed; and • asset revaluations. In Hill J’s view, the items that could be replaced with a deductible result were (p 4,390): • contributed capital; • undrawn profit distributions; • advances made by partners; and • other funds which have actually been invested in the partnership and which the partners were entitled to withdraw. 73. Hill J did not include “profits of the year not yet distributed” (i.e. current year income) as amounts able to be replaced. Hill J’s view was that the types of amounts that could be replaced with a deductible result were funds which had actually been invested in the partnership and which the partners were entitled to withdraw at the time of the borrowing. 74. In contrast, Hill J considered that undrawn distributions that have been allocated to partners, but not paid out (i.e. past years’ profits), can be replaced with borrowings and the interest would be deductible. Application of the Roberts and Smith principle and the law on partnerships to current year income 75. Partners do not have rights to current year income as it arises during the year, because it is partnership property. Profits are generally determined at year- end. Until the profits are determined at year-end, the partners are not entitled to current year income. Any drawings taken from the partnership’s current year income can only be a partner’s anticipated share of the profits. Current 30 year income cannot, therefore, be an amount invested in the partnership by the partners. As it is, in the Commissioner’s opinion, essential for the Roberts and Smith replacement and repayment principle that the funds must be repaid to someone, there must be someone who has had an entitlement to them. Therefore, to be repayable, someone must have invested the funds in the income earning activity or business. Current year income has not been invested so the Roberts and Smith principle does not apply to it. The difference between current year income and past year’s profits 76. Past years’ profits can be distinguished from current year profits because partners have become entitled to them, either at a time specified under the partnership agreement or, in the absence of a partnership agreement, when the partnership accounts are required to be taken (FC of T v Galland) and they have been notionally allocated to partners. Their status is then as advances to the partnership or new investments of capital. Hill J considered that past years’ profits could be viewed as amounts invested, and that they could be repaid with a deductible result. Payments of dividends 77. The Roberts and Smith replacement and repayment principle applies to borrowings used to pay dividends sourced from past year profits, usually described as retained earnings, to shareholders. There is, however, some conceptual difficulty in bringing a company’s retained earnings within this principle. The difficulty is in analysing retained earnings as amounts contributed by shareholders. Company profits are not allocated to shareholders at the end of each year. Retained earnings are added to the existing retained earnings. Directors may decide to distribute some of these as dividends, or they may decide not to. Shareholders are not immediately entitled to retained earnings in the way that partners are entitled to partnership profits. 78. There are, however, similarities between a partnership’s past years’ profits and a company’s retained earnings. They share the characteristic that the amount has been finally settled for the year, and the theoretical amount each shareholder (or partner) is entitled to can be established. They can, in a sense, be seen as the amount a shareholder or partner has invested into the business. The features of partnership profits that do not suggest they have been invested by partners, are also shared by retained earnings. Both retained earnings and partnership profits are at the disposal of the business until the decision is made to pay them out. Just as partners may not necessarily make any active decision to reinvest past profits, shareholders would not usually make any decision to reinvest profits in the business. For these reasons, the Commissioner’s opinion is that payment of dividends from retained earnings can be viewed as sufficiently analogous to payments to partners of partnership past years’ profits, such that both should be treated the same in determining interest deductibility. 79. Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, retained earnings can be treated as notional reinvestments by shareholders in the company and the replacement 31 and repayment principle should apply. Interest is deductible on borrowings used to pay dividends to shareholders, to the extent that those profits were used in income earning. 80. If company profits are distributed as bonus issues, then similarly the amount represented by the shares can be seen as capital able to be replaced under the replacement and repayment principle. 81. It should be noted that interest incurred by companies will generally be deductible under section DB 7, the provision that gives companies in most situations an automatic deduction for interest, and that Roberts and Smith would be an alternative basis for deductibility for interest incurred on borrowed funds used to pay dividends. Replacement of debt 82. Borrowings used to repay borrowings used in an income earning activity or business are within the Roberts and Smith principle. Hill J in Roberts and Smith said that where a loan is taken out and used to repay a debt that was used directly in an income earning process or business, the character of the refinancing takes on the same character as the original borrowing and gives to the interest incurred the character of a working expense. In Hill J’s mind, there is no difference in terms of interest deductibility between repaying one debt with another and borrowing to return capital, and both situations should be similarly treated. 83. If the first refinancing takes on the character of the debt it replaces, then logically, subsequent refinancings should also inherit that character. Therefore, the Commissioner’s opinion is that interest is deductible on borrowings used to repay other borrowings, to the extent those other borrowings can be traced to a use that gave rise to deductible interest. Continuation of a statutory nexus 84. The general rule from Roberts and Smith is that borrowings may inherit the deductibility status of funds they repay. In some situations, the repaid funds may be deductible by the operation of a specified statutory nexus, rather than the general rule which requires as a question of fact a sufficient connection with income. One relevant nexus is in section DB 7, which provides for automatic deductions for most companies, and the other is in section DB 8, which provides for deductions for companies investing in shares in a group company. 85. Although the nexus in each of these two sections is different in nature from the nexus in Roberts and Smith, where the replaced funds achieved the nexus by being used to derive income, nevertheless, the Commissioner considers that the deductibility status should also be inheritable when deductibility is established through a statutory nexus. If it were not, and refinancing meant interest that had been deductible as a matter of law rather than fact was no longer deductible, Parliament’s intention for sections DB 7 and DB 8 would be defeated. Therefore, the Commissioner’s opinion is that Roberts and Smith 32 applies to replacement and repayment of borrowed funds in respect of which deductibility is established under sections DB 7 and DB 8. What is the treatment if the lender’s right is assigned? 86. The Commissioner’s view is that the principle from Roberts and Smith is that funds may be replaced with borrowed funds and the interest will be deductible, if the repaid funds are returned to their owners. The exception is the replacement and repayment of a debt, where the right to receive the amount advanced has been assigned to someone else. Interest would still be deductible under the principle, because in those circumstances there is still a repayment of funds invested, as the amount can be traced back to the original investor through the assignee. Is direct tracing required? 87. The replacement and repayment principle requires identifying how the original funds were used, and identifying the use of the new debt to repay those original funds. Therefore, under the principle, the use of funds needs to be identified or “traced”. 88. Given the compliance costs that may arise in some circumstances, consideration has been given to whether tracing is essential to the replacement and repayment principle. It is recognised that for some taxpayers, who have daily changes to their borrowings, the requirement may be difficult to fulfill. 89. One approach would be to allow a deduction if the refinancing loan is taken out and the first loan paid back about the same time. However, it seems likely that this “around the same time” requirement would not in practice operate to limit deductibility to arrangements within the principle, and would result in interest on any borrowing qualifying for deductibility. 90. An alternative is that the Commissioner would accept that a loan is a replacement unless it is used solely for a private or exempt use. However, that approach would, in the Commissioner’s view, be too wide to be consistent with the statutory requirements, as any use of borrowings would satisfy the test (apart from sole private and exempt uses). The test would not be limited to replacement of funds that are returned to their owners. Without the element of replacement, there would not be a sufficient nexus with income. Uses of funds that would qualify would be those uses that would not seem to be within the intent of the interest deductibility provision such as nil interest loans to sister companies, investments in companies prohibited from making distributions, and so on. 91. Therefore, the Commissioner takes the view that the replacement and repayment principle requires that borrowings should be traced to replacement of funds that satisfy the statutory nexus for deductibility. Taxpayers with few borrowings should usually be able to trace money. Taxpayers with more complicated borrowing practices will, in most case, be companies, for which interest will be deductible under section DB 7, without the need to satisfy the Roberts and Smith principle. 33 92. It should be remembered that all debt is subject to a tracing test. In a number of cases that considered the direct test of interest deductibility, the courts have held that the use of funds must be traced: for example, Pacific Rendezvous Ltd and Brierley. When interest is not deductible Subvention payments 93. Interest incurred by companies is generally deductible under section DB 7. Therefore, interest incurred by a company on borrowed funds used to make a subvention payment would generally be deductible under that section. 94. If section DB 7 does not apply, then the application or not of Roberts and Smith becomes relevant. The replacement and repayment principle is that interest is deductible on borrowings repaying funds paid into the business or income earning process. A subvention payment is a payment between companies in a group to reduce the overall tax burden of the group. It is not a replacement of an amount previously advanced by the recipient company, or an amount repaid to shareholders for amounts they invested in the paying company. 95. Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, the use of borrowed funds to pay a subvention payment does not satisfy the replacement and repayment principle from Roberts and Smith, and interest incurred on borrowed funds used to pay a subvention payment is not deductible under that principle. Sole traders 96. The principle in Roberts and Smith is that interest is deductible on borrowed funds used to repay funds to investors in an income earning activity or business. This principle applies where an entity—whether a partnership or a company—borrows money and uses it to return amounts invested in the partnership or company. Individuals with an income earning activity or business but who do not operate through a company or any other structure (referred to as a “sole trader”), do not have a separate entity in which to invest their money. If an individual invests money used for private purposes into a business or activity they carry on as a sole trader, there has been no change in ownership of that money. It is artificial to describe a transaction with oneself as a replacement and repayment of funds. Therefore, in the Commissioner’s opinion, the replacement and repayment principle cannot apply to sole traders arguing that borrowing funds have the effect of returning their capital or past years’ profits. 97. Although a partnership is not a separate legal entity from its partners, as discussed above, there is a distinction between property owned by a partnership and property owned by individual partners. Therefore, in contrast to sole traders, there can be a valid legal transfer of property from a partnership to a partner, and the Roberts and Smith principle can apply to partnerships. 34 98. Professor Parsons raised some arguments that support applying the Roberts and Smith principle to individuals in Roberts and Smith: Principles of Interest Deductibility. 7 He said that separate accounting records may personify a separate entity. Secondly, he argued that the legislation recognises a sole trader in business as separate from the sole trader in a private capacity, because the deductibility provisions distinguish between individuals in business and individuals not in business. However, he considered that these arguments may be tenuous, and that it will be difficult for a sole trader to establish that interest on borrowings used to withdraw capital is not prohibited as private. Also, Professor Parsons considered these arguments in the context of an interpretation of Roberts and Smith that is much broader than the interpretation taken by the Commissioner. 99. Although an individual cannot replace capital, an individual can, however, deduct interest incurred in using borrowed funds to replace a debt owed to a third party, where the amount first borrowed was used directly in the individual’s income earning activity or business. As the borrowed funds replaced are repaid to a separate entity, the third party lender, the funds are able to be repaid, and so the Roberts and Smith principle can apply. Goodwill and asset revaluations 100. Hill J singled out internally generated goodwill as an amount in the partnership capital account that could not be replaced because it is not an amount that has been invested by someone in the business. At p 4,390, Hill J explained that a payment of goodwill is not a “refund of a pre-existing capital contribution.” 101. Glazebrook and James 8 have explained that goodwill cannot be distributed because after a purported distribution, it would still remain. Therefore, internally generated goodwill is not an amount that can be replaced with borrowed funds with a deductible result. 102. However, the situation will be different if goodwill is purchased. In that situation, funds, either equity or debt, are used to purchase the goodwill. These funds can be replaced with borrowed funds and the interest would be deductible. 103. If purchased goodwill is revalued internally, the extent of the internal revaluation is not represented by an amount invested in the business that can be replaced. Therefore, interest on an amount borrowed purporting to replace goodwill to the extent that it is internally generated will not be deductible. 104. Similarly, amounts that are attributable to asset revaluations cannot be repaid and replaced and are not within the Roberts and Smith principle. 7 See n 1 8 “Taxation Implications of Company Law Reform” by Susan Glazebrook and Jan James, New Zealand Journal of Taxation Law and Policy, Volume 1 132 at p 157. 35 Private use 105. The Commissioner’s view is that when borrowings are used to return partners’ capital, the interest may be deductible despite the fact that the direct use of the borrowed funds may be for the private use of the taxpayer. The reason is that the borrowed funds are also used for a concurrent income-related use—the replacement of funds used in deriving income. 106. That situation compares with the one where the borrowed funds replace borrowed funds that are being used solely for private use. In that situation, the interest on the replacing funds will not be deductible. Australian Tax Office’s view on Roberts and Smith 107. The ATO has issued a ruling on its interpretation of Roberts and Smith. The ATO’s view is similar to the Commissioner’s view; see TR 95/25 Income Tax: Deductions for Interest Under Subsection 51(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 Following FC of T v Roberts; FC of T v Smith, issued 29 June 1995. Two addenda have been added to TR 95/25, primarily to update the references in the ruling to the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. A consistent interpretation of Roberts and Smith was applied in TR 2005/12, which relates to borrowings used to repay amounts to beneficiaries. The Commissioner’s view of the deductibility of interest on funds invested in QCs, CFCs and FIFs 108. The second issues paper on interest deductibility, IRRUIP 5, which considered the application of Roberts and Smith, discussed the issues of compliance costs. In the context of that discussion, the paper considered the deductibility of interest in investments such as qualifying companies, controlled foreign companies and foreign investment funds that give rise to both assessable and exempt income to the investor. Because these investments give rise to both assessable and exempt income, the issue arises as to whether the interest should be deductible in full. It was concluded in the issues paper that interest incurred on funds invested in these types of companies is deductible in full. If the funds were repaid with new borrowings, applying Roberts and Smith, the interest on the replacing funds would take on the deductibility status of the repaid funds. 109. Roberts and Smith is concerned with refinancing of investments, and when it applies, the deductibility status of the initial investment is taken on by the replacing funds. It is not necessary to understand the reasons for the deductibility or otherwise of the initial investment to understand the Roberts and Smith principle. Because the deductibility of interest incurred in relation to qualifying companies, controlled foreign companies and foreign investment funds is not relevant to an understanding of how the Roberts and Smith case applies, the issue is not dealt with further in this commentary or in the rulings. 36

This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law This Ruling applies in respect of section 14(1)(ca) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies This Ruling applies to the supply of leasehold land, in exchange for rent, by a registered person. This Ruling applies to what are generally referred to as ground leases, where the lease or rental payable under the terms of the lease relate solely to the use of land. The ruling does not apply to any leases of land together with improvements associated with that land. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement in the following manner. In respect of the supply of leasehold land by way of rental: • Where the leasehold land that is the subject of the supply is only used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land, the supply is exempt from GST; • Where the leasehold land that is the subject of the supply is not used, to any degree, for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land, the supply is not exempt from GST; • Where the leasehold land that is the subject of the supply is used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land and for another use, the supply is exempt from GST to the extent that the leasehold land is used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land, irrespective of whether the predominant use of the land is for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land; • Where the leasehold land that is the subject of the supply is used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land and for another use, the apportionment of the value of the supply between the exempt and non-exempt uses must be made on the basis of allocating that proportion of the supply that is properly attributable to 2 the exempt supply. • Where a lease is entered into for leasehold land, and that land is to be used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land, the supply of that leasehold land pursuant to the lease (or the relevant portion of the lease) is not exempt until the dwelling has been erected. The words “not being a grant or sale of the lease of that land” in section 14(1)(ca) refer to any payment made for: • The creation of a leasehold interest in that land, other than a payment of rent; or • The sale of the leasehold interest in the land. The period for which this ruling applies This ruling will apply to a supply of leasehold land by way of rental for an indefinite period beginning on 1 February 2006. This ruling is signed by me on the 23 rd day of June 2008. Susan Price Director Public Rulings 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub / 08/01 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 08/01 (“the ruling”). The subject matter covered in the Ruling was previously dealt with in Public Ruling BR Pub 96/7 (Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 7, No. 12 (April 1996)) and BR Pub 01/01 (Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 13, No. 4 (April 2001)). The Commissioner’s view in this ruling is not intended to differ from the previous rulings. Any changes between this ruling and the previous rulings are only intended to assist the reader’s understanding. A note as to legislative history This ruling and commentary refers to section 14(1)(ca) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. That section was originally enacted (pursuant to section 12(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act 1986 and with effect from 3 December 1985, the date of enactment of the principal Act) as section 14(ca). The Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000 amended section 14 and made it section 14(1) (with the subsidiary changes that section 14(ca) became section 14(1)(ca), section 14(c) became section 14(1)(c), etc). This was necessary due to the enactment of the new sections 14(2) and 14(3). In this commentary, sections 14(ca) and sections 14(1)(ca) will consistently be referred to as section 14(1)(ca). Therefore, where necessary references to section 14(1)(ca) should be read as a reference to section 14(ca). Similarly, section 14(1)(c) of the Act should be read as, where appropriate, section 14(c). Background Section 14(1)(ca) exempts from GST the supply of leasehold land by way of rental, to the extent that that land is used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land. The section expressly excludes from the exemption any grant or sale of the lease of the land. In the Commissioner’s view, section 14(1)(ca) applies to the supply of leasehold land by way of rental when it is supplied separately from any buildings or other improvements to that land. This form of lease is commonly known as a “ground lease”. Under a ground lease the rental is generally based on the unimproved value of the land. In such cases the head lessor owns the land, and the head lessee usually owns the buildings and any other improvements to the land. Section 14(1)(ca) was inserted into the Act \[originally as section 14(ca)\] by section 12(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act 1986. That amendment was effective from 3 December 1985, being the date of enactment of the principal Act and prior to the commencement of GST. The amendment was enacted to correct a deficiency in the principal Act. In the absence of the amendment, residential lessees of leasehold land would have had to pay GST on their ground 4 lease rental payments. This was seen as inequitable when compared with the position of residential owners of freehold properties, who generally do not pay GST on the acquisition of a private home, and lessees of residential accommodation. The supply of residential rental accommodation is GST exempt under section 14(1)(c). Section 14(1)(ca) was therefore intended to provide an extension to the section 14(1)(c) exemption. There had been some uncertainty regarding the scope and effect of the section 14(1)(ca) exemption. In particular, when there is a supply of leasehold land that is used for both commercial and residential purposes. Further, uncertainty also occurred regarding the meaning of the words “not being a grant or sale of the lease of that land” in section 14(1)(ca). Hence, public binding rulings BR Pub 96/7 and BR Pub 01/01 were issued by the Commissioner to clarify the position. This public binding ruling is not intended to change the Commissioner’s view of section 14(1)(ca) as expressed in those rulings. Rather, any changes are intended to clarify the Commissioner’s view. Legislation Section 14(1) exempts certain supplies from GST. Section 14(1)(ca) exempts: The supply of leasehold land by way of rental (not being a grant or sale of the lease of that land) to the extent that that land is used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land: Section 14(1)(c) also exempts: The supply of accommodation in any dwelling by way of - (i) Hire; or (ii) A service occupancy agreement; or (iii) A licence to occupy: Section 2 defines “dwelling” as meaning: ... any building, premises, structure, or other place, or any part thereof, used predominantly as a place of residence or abode of any individual, together with any appurtenances belonging thereto and enjoyed with it; but does not include a commercial dwelling: Section 10(18) states: Where a taxable supply is not the only matter to which a consideration relates, the supply shall be deemed to be for such part of the consideration as is properly attributable to it. Application of the legislation Section 14(1)(ca) exempts “the supply of leasehold land by way of rental ... to the extent that that land is “used” for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land”. The Commissioner’s view is that this means that to the extent that leasehold land is “used”, by the lessee, “for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land” the supply of that land is exempt. The word “used” in section 14(1)(ca) refers to the actual physical use of the land. The reason for this interpretation is briefly set out below. 5 The Shorter Oxford Dictionary, 5 th edition, Volume 2, (2002), gives the first meanings of “use” as the “Act of using, fact of being used. The action of using something, the fact or state of being used...”. The meaning of “used” in paragraph (ca) was also considered inter alia in Case N22 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,187 by Judge Bathgate who said: For instance in sec 14(ca) reference is made to the purpose for which land may be held; in that paragraph reference is to “... land which is used for the principal purpose of accommodation ...” , which is to be distinguished from goods, “applied” for a particular purpose. The “use” of goods, as opposed to the “application” of goods would seem to connote their direct, physical involvement, or use. This is consistent with the scheme and purpose of section 14(1)(ca) which was to provide an extension to the section 14(1)(c) exemption, by exempting the supply of leasehold land when it is “used” for residential accommodation purposes. The term “principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling” refers to the use to which the dwelling, erected on the leasehold land, or a portion of the leasehold land, is being put. It does not refer to the use to which the leasehold land is being put as a whole. Therefore, it is not necessary for the principal purpose to which the leasehold land is being put to be accommodation in a dwelling. It is sufficient if part of the leasehold land is being used for “the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land”. Therefore, in applying section 14(1)(ca) to any ground lease, the use or uses to which the leasehold land is being put must be considered. Such consideration will allow the extent to which the supply of the leasehold land is exempt to be determined. When all the land and any buildings erected on that land are used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling, the full rental in respect of the ground lease is exempt from GST. When all the land and any buildings erected on that land are used for commercial or other non-dwelling purposes, the ground lease is subject to GST. When leasehold land and any building erected on that land are used in part for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling and in part for commercial or other non-exempt purposes, the ground lease is only exempt to the extent that the use to which the leasehold land is being put relates to the provision of accommodation in a dwelling. This requires apportioning the ground lease rental and imposing GST only on that part of the rental that relates to the non-exempt purpose(s). Alternative interpretation It is also arguable that section 14(1)(ca) only exempts the supply of leasehold land when all the land is used for the principal purpose, i.e., more than 50%, of accommodation in a dwelling. The exemption then only applies to the extent that the land is so used. For example, the ground lease rental of land on which a building is situated that is used as to 75% for accommodation and 25% for offices, is exempt from GST as to 75%. However, the ground lease rental of land on which a building is situated that is used as to 25% for accommodation and 75% for offices, is not exempt from GST. While this is an arguable interpretation, the Commissioner considers that it is unduly narrow and restrictive, and that the interpretation that has been adopted (and expressed in the Ruling) 6 better effects the purpose of the section. The Commissioner’s view is that the primary focus of the provision is on that portion of the land that is used for accommodation purposes, rather than, as the alternative interpretation proposes, the predominant use of the land as a whole. To limit the exemption to only those instances where accommodation in a dwelling is the primary, or predominant, use to which the land being put would be to effectively ignore the apportionment requirement. It is considered that the better view is that the purpose of the section is to exempt from GST that element of total use that relates to the principal purpose of accommodation and that this purpose is best effected by a broad interpretation. Apportionment Section 14(1)(ca) is silent as to the correct way to apportion the lease payments in respect of the supply of the leasehold land between the exempt and non-exempt uses. The section only states that the supply is exempt “to the extent” that the use to which the land is being put is the exempt use. Section 10(18) of the Act also deals with the apportionment of consideration between exempt and taxable supplies. However, that section similarly does not specify the basis for determining the apportionment – rather it simply deems the taxable supply to be for that part of the consideration as is properly attributable to it. It is the Commissioner’s view that it is not possible to specify a method of apportionment that must be applied in all instances. The appropriate method must be determined on a case by case basis, taking into account the provisions of the lease and bearing in mind that section 14(1)(ca) requires the apportionment to be undertaken taking into account the uses to which the land is being put. The following examples are intended to be indicative only of the approach that may be taken to apportionment: • a six-storey building is erected on leasehold land. Calculated on the basis of the floor area used, 60% was used for offices, 20% for a restaurant and the remaining 20% for residential apartments. The residential apartments are used for the principal purpose of private accommodation in a dwelling. Pursuant to section 14(1)(ca), 20% of the ground lease rental is exempt from GST. • an area of rural leasehold land is used, on an area basis, as to 90% for grazing and 10% for a house and its curtilage. That house is used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling. Pursuant to section 14(1)(ca), 10% of the ground lease rental is exempt from GST. ), In some cases, the ground lease rental may be expressly calculated with reference to the different uses to which the land is to be put. For example: • a person leases ten hectares of rural land. A term of the lease is that one hectare can be used to erect a dwelling, but the remaining nine hectares must be left as pasture. The lease further provides that the pasture is to be leased at the rate of $10 per hectare per week, while the remaining land is leased at $50 per week. While the total rent payable under the lease is $140 per week, $50 will be GST exempt. A grant or sale of the lease of that land The words “not being a grant or sale of the lease of that land” create an exception to the exemption under the main body of section 14(1)(ca). The words in section 14(1)(ca) “not being a grant or sale of the lease of that land” refer to any payment made for: • The creation of a leasehold interest in that land, other than a payment of rent; or • The sale of the leasehold interest in the land. Any grant or sale by the head lessor (owner of the land) of a ground lease of that land, where the ground lease is exempt from GST to the extent that it is used for the principal purpose of supplying accommodation in a dwelling, is not exempt from GST. Whether GST is payable on the sale or grant depends on whether the sale or grant is made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by the head lessor. Examples The following examples do not form part of the Ruling. Example 1 A, a GST registered person, owns a vacant piece of land. She leases that land to S who constructs a building that is used to carry on her business as a drycleaner. The building occupies the entire piece of land, leaving only a narrow alley providing access to the rear entrance. No part of the land is used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling and therefore no part of the supply from A to S is exempt. Example 2 S constructs an apartment above her drycleaning business and rents it to E. The floor area of the apartment is exactly the same as that of the drycleaners, so 50% of the ground rent charged by A to S is GST exempt. Example 3 S sold her drycleaning business and the building, including the apartment, to E. E negotiated a new ground lease with A. 50% of the ground rent was exempt as it related to the apartment. In addition to the ground lease rental payments, in order to facilitate the negotiation of the new lease E agreed to make a one off payment to A of $5,000. None of that payment is exempt from GST as it relates to the grant of the lease and is excluded from the exemption.

Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CW 41 and CW 42. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The arrangement is the derivation of income by a trust established by a Maori Trust Board pursuant to the execution of a declaration of trust, under section 24B(1) of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955, declaring that it stands possessed of any of its property upon trust for charitable purposes. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement When a Maori Trust Board executes a declaration of trust that it shall stand possessed of property for charitable purposes, under section 24B(1) of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955, the income of such a trust is exempt from income tax under section CW 41 or section CW 42 if: • all the purposes specified in the declaration of trust are purposes that are specified in section 24 or section 24A of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955; and • the Commissioner is satisfied that, with the exception of the charitable purpose requirement and the public benefit test, all other requirements of charitable status are met; and • the declaration of trust has been submitted to and approved by the Commissioner, as required by section 24B(3) of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955; and 2 • the trust is registered as a charitable entity under the Charities Act 2005, or has started the registration process before 1 July 2008 provided the trust is not notified by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue that the entity is not a tax charity as defined in the Act. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for an indefinite period beginning on the first day of the 2008/09 income year. This Ruling is signed by me on the 31st day of July 2008. Susan Price Director, Public Rulings 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 08/02 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 08/02 (“the Ruling”). Overview Sections CW 41 and CW 42 provide the following exemptions from income tax for income derived by a charitable trust. • Under section CW 41, income derived by trustees in trust for charitable purposes or by any institution or society established and maintained exclusively for charitable purposes. • Under section CW 42, income derived from a business carried on by trustees in trust for charitable purposes or by any institution or society established exclusively for charitable purposes. Neither exemption is available if any person is able to influence the amount of any private pecuniary benefit from the trust. The exemption under section CW 42 applies only to the extent that the charitable purposes are carried out in New Zealand. Under section 24B of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955, a Maori Trust Board may declare that it holds property in trust for charitable purposes. The income of the trust can be applied only for those purposes set out in sections 24 and 24A of that Act and which are specified in the declaration of trust. Section 24B deems the income of such a trust to be income derived by trustees in trust for charitable purposes for the purposes of the Income Tax Act. As of 1 July 2008, the Charities Act 2005 amends sections CW 41 and CW 42 limiting the application of these sections to trusts, societies or institutions that register as charitable entities. An entity, including a trust established by a Maori Trust Board pursuant to section 24B of the Maori Trust Boards Act, must be registered with the Charities Commission to be eligible to receive tax exemptions under section CW 41 or CW 42. Also included are trusts that have started the registration process before 1 July 2008, that intend to complete the process of preparing an application and have not been notified by the Commissioner that they are not a tax charity. Legislation Income Tax Act 2007 Sections CW 41 and CW 42 are as follows.

CW 42 Charities: business income Exempt income (1) Income derived directly or indirectly from a business carried on by, or for, or for the benefit of a trust, society, or institution of a kind referred to in section CW 41(1) is exempt income if— 5 (a) the trust, society, or institution carries out its charitable purposes in New Zealand; and (b) the trustee or trustees of the trust, the society, or the institution is or are, at the time that the income is derived, a tax charity; and (c) no person with some control over the business is able to direct or divert, to their own benefit or advantage, an amount derived from the business. Subsections (3) to (8) expand on this subsection. Exclusion (2) This section does not apply to an amount of income derived by— (a) a council-controlled organisation, other than a council-controlled organisation operating a hospital as a charitable activity; (b) a local authority from a council-controlled organisation, other than from a council-controlled organisation operating a hospital as a charitable activity on behalf of the local authority. Carrying on a business: trustee (3) For the purposes of subsection (1), a trustee is treated as carrying on a business if— (a) the trustee derives rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues from an asset of the trust; and (b) the asset was disposed of to the trust by a person of a kind described in subsection (5)(b); and (c) either— (i) the person retains or reserves an interest in the asset; or (ii) the asset will revert to the person.

Control over business (5) For the purposes of subsection (1)(b) for an income year, a person is treated as having some control over the business, and as being able to direct or divert amounts from the business to their own benefit or advantage if, in the tax year,— (a) they are, in any way, whether directly or indirectly, able to determine, or materially influence the determination of,— (i) the nature or extent of a relevant benefit or advantage; or (ii) the circumstances in which a relevant benefit or advantage is, or is to be, given or received; and (b) their ability to determine or influence the benefit or advantage arises because they are— 6 (i) a settlor or trustee of the trust by which the business is carried on; or (ii) a shareholder or director of the company by which the business is carried on; or (iii) a settlor or trustee of a trust that is a shareholder of the company by which the business is carried on; or (iv) a person associated with a settlor, trustee, shareholder, or director referred to in any of subparagraphs (i) to (iii). Control: settlor asset disposed of to trust (6) For the purposes of subsection (5), a person is treated as a settlor of a trust, and as gaining a benefit or advantage in the carrying on of a business of the trust, if— (a) they have disposed of an asset to the trust, and the asset is used by the trust in the carrying on of the business; and (b) they retain or reserve an interest in the asset, or the asset will revert to them. No control (7) For the purposes of subsection (1)(b), a person is not treated as having some control over the business merely because— (a) they provide professional services to the trust or company by which the business is carried on; and (b) their ability to determine, or materially influence the determination of, the nature or extent of a relevant benefit or advantage arises because they— (i) provide the services in the course of and as part of carrying on, as a business, a professional public practice; or (ii) are a statutory trustee company; or (iii) are Public Trust; or (iv) are the Maori Trustee. Benefit or advantage (8) For the purposes of subsection (1)(b), a benefit or advantage to a person— (a) may or may not be something that is convertible into money: (b) unless excluded under paragraph (d), includes deriving an amount that would be income of the person under 1 or more of the following provisions: (i) section CA 1(2) (Amounts that are income): (ii) sections CB 1 to CB 23 (which relate to income from business or trade-like activities): (iii) section CB 32 (Property obtained by theft): (iv) sections CC 1 (Land), CC 3 to CC 8 (which relate to income from financial instruments), and CC 9 (Royalties): (v) section CD 1 (Dividend): 7 (vi) sections CE 1 (Amounts derived in connection with employment) and CE 8 (Attributed income from personal services): (vii) section CF 1 (Benefits, pensions, compensation, and government grants): (viii) section CG 3 (Bad debt repayment): (ix) sections CQ 1 (Attributed controlled foreign company income) and CQ 4 (Foreign investment fund income): (c) includes retaining or reserving an interest in an asset in the case described in subsection (3), if the person has disposed of the asset to the trust or the asset will revert to them: (d) does not include earning interest on money lent, if the interest is payable at no more than the current commercial rate, given the nature and term of the loan. Non-exempt business income (9) If an amount derived from the carrying on of a business by or for a trust is not exempt income because of a failure to comply with subsection (1)(b), the amount is trustee income. Maori Trust Boards Act 1955 Section 24B of the Maori Trust Boards Act states: 24B. Trusts for charitable purposes (1) Any Board may from time to time, in its discretion, execute under its seal a declaration of trust declaring that it shall stand possessed of any of its property, whether real or personal, upon trust for charitable purposes. (2) Any income derived by the Board from any property to which the declaration relates shall be applied for such purposes referred to in section 24 or section 24A of this Act as may be specified in the declaration of trust; and, for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 2007, any such income shall be deemed to be income derived by trustees in trust for charitable purposes. (3) No declaration of trust under this section shall have any force or effect unless it has been approved by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Sections 24 and 24A specify the purposes for which a Maori Trust Board may apply money. 24. Functions of Board (1) The functions of each Board shall be to administer its assets in accordance with the provisions of this Act for the general benefit of its beneficiaries, and, for that purpose, a Board may, in its discretion, provide money for the benefit or advancement in life of any specific beneficiary, or of any class or classes of beneficiaries. (2) Without limiting the general provisions hereinbefore contained, it is hereby declared that each Board may, from time to time, subject to the provisions of this Act, apply money towards all or any of the following purposes: (a) The promotion of health: 8 (i) By installing or making grants or loans towards the cost of installing water supplies, sanitation works, and drainage in Maori settlements; (ii) By promoting, carrying out, or subsidising housing schemes, or by making grants or loans for any such schemes; or (iii) By providing, subsidising, or making grants for medical, nursing, or dental services: (b) The promotion of social and economic welfare: (i) By making grants or loans for the relief of indigence or distress; (ii) By developing, subsidising, or making grants or loans for farming or other industries; (iii) By making grants or loans towards the cost of the construction, establishment, management, maintenance, repair, or improvement of Maori meeting houses, halls, churches, and church halls, villages, maraes, or cemeteries; (iv) By establishing, maintaining, and equipping hostels for the purpose of providing either permanent or temporary accommodation; (v) By making grants or loans towards the establishment of recreational centres for the common use of any Maori community and for such other uses as the Board thinks fit; (vi) By promoting, carrying out, or subsidising roading schemes, power schemes, or such other schemes as the Board thinks fit, or by making grants or loans for any such schemes; or (vii) By purchasing, acquiring, holding, selling, disposing of, or otherwise turning to account shares in any body corporate that has as one of its principal objects the economic or social advancement of Maoris, or the development of land: (c) The promotion of education and vocational training: (i) By assisting in the establishment of schools, and in the equipping, managing, and conducting of schools; by making grants of money, equipment, or material to schools or other educational or training institutions; or by making grants to funds established or bodies formed for the promotion of the education of Maoris or for assisting Maoris to obtain training or practical experience necessary or desirable for any trade or occupation; (ii) By providing scholarships, exhibitions, bursaries, or other methods of enabling individuals to secure the benefits of education or training, or by making grants to Education Boards or other educational bodies for scholarships, exhibitions, or bursaries; (iii) By providing books, clothing, or other equipment for the holders of scholarships or other individuals, or by making grants for any such purpose; or by making grants generally for the purpose of assisting the parents or guardians of children to provide for their education or training for any employment or occupation; (iv) By providing, maintaining, or contributing towards the cost of residential accommodation for children in relation to their education or training; or 9 (v) By the promotion of schemes to encourage the practice of Maori arts and crafts, the study of Maori lore and history, and the speaking of the Maori language: (d) Such other or additional purposes as the Board from time to time determines. (3) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to preclude any Board from applying money for the general benefit of a group or class of persons, notwithstanding that the group or class of persons includes persons other than beneficiaries; but no grant or loan shall be made to any individual for his exclusive benefit unless he is a beneficiary. 24A. Additional grants and payments by Boards Any Board may from time to time, in its discretion— (a) Make grants to the Maori Education Foundation established by the Maori Education Foundation Act 1961: (b) Make payments, not exceeding in the aggregate the sum of $400 in any financial year, for any purposes not otherwise specifically authorised by this Act,— whether or not any such grants or payments are of a direct or indirect benefit to the beneficiaries of the Board, or any of them. Charities Act 2005 Section 13 of the Charities Act provides: 13. Essential requirements (1) An entity qualifies for registration as a charitable entity if,— (a) in the case of the trustees of a trust, the trust is of a kind in relation to which an amount of income is derived by the trustees in trust for charitable purposes; and (b) in the case of a society or an institution, the society or institution— (i) is established and maintained exclusively for charitable purposes; and (ii) is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual; and (c) the entity has a name that complies with section 15; and (d) all of the officers of the entity are qualified to be officers of a charitable entity under section 16. (2) The trustees of a trust must be treated as complying with subsection (1)(a) if,— (a) in accordance with a ruling made under Part 5A of the Tax Administration Act 1994,— (i) an amount of income derived by the trustees in trust is treated as having been derived by the trustees in trust for charitable purposes for the purposes of section CW 41 of the Income Tax Act 2007; or (ii) income is treated as having been derived directly or indirectly from a business carried on by, or for, or for the benefit of the trustees in trust for 10 charitable purposes for the purposes of section CW 42 of the Income Tax Act 2007; or (b) the income derived by the trustees is deemed to be income derived by trustees in trust for charitable purposes under section 24B of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955. (3) A society or an institution must be treated as complying with subsection (1)(b) if, in accordance with a ruling made under Part 5A of the Tax Administration Act 1994, that society or institution is treated as being a society or institution that is established and maintained exclusively for charitable purposes and not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual for the purposes of section CW 41 or section CW 42 of the Income Tax Act 2007. (4) Subsections (2) and (3) cease to apply in relation to an entity if— (a) the period for which the ruling applies has expired; or (b) the ruling has ceased to apply because of section 91G of the Tax Administration Act 1994; or (c) the ruling has otherwise ceased to apply to the entity. (5) Despite subsections (1) to (3), an entity does not qualify for registration as a charitable entity if— (a) the entity is a designated terrorist entity as defined in section 4(1) of the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002; or (b) the entity has been convicted of any offence under sections 6A to 13E of the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002. Application of the legislation Charitable purpose and public benefit tests For a trust to be considered charitable for the purposes of the Income Tax Act, it must generally meet the common law requirements of charity. That is, a trust must be established for a “charitable purpose”, and must meet what is known as the “public benefit test”. The term “charitable purpose” was defined in earlier Income Tax Acts as including: every charitable purpose, whether it relates to the relief of poverty, the advancement of education or religion, or any other matter beneficial to the community. In 2003 the “charitable purpose” definition was extended by section OB 3B, which was inserted by section 76 of the Taxation (Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003 into the Income Tax Act 1994. Section OB 3B became section OB 3A in the Income Tax Act 2004. The Income Tax Act 2007 combined the “charitable purpose” definition with section OB 3A. Section YA 1 defines “charitable purpose” as including: every charitable purpose, whether it relates to the relief of poverty, the advancement of education or religion, or any other matter beneficial to the community, and— (a) the purpose of a trust, society, or institution is charitable under this Act if the purpose would meet the public benefit requirement apart from the fact that the beneficiaries of the trust, or the members of the society or institution, are related by blood: (b) a marae has a charitable purpose if— 11 (i) the physical structure of the marae is situated on land that is a Maori reservation referred to in Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993 (Maori Land Act 1993); and (ii) the funds of the marae are not used for a purpose other than the administration and maintenance of the land and of the physical structure of the marae, or not used for a purpose that is a charitable purpose other than under this paragraph. The Court of Appeal noted in Molloy v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,070; \[1981\] 1 NZLR 688 that the definition of charitable purpose in the Income Tax Act does not have the effect of enlarging or altering the ordinary, legal connotation of charity. This means that it is necessary to refer to general law to determine whether any specific taxpayer, or activity, is charitable. In Commissioners of IT v Pemsel \[1891\] AC 531, 583, Lord Macnaghten determined that all charitable purposes fall within four classes of charity (known as the “Pemsel Heads”), namely: • the advancement of religion; • the relief of poverty; • the advancement of education; and • any other matter beneficial to the community. In addition to falling within one of the Pemsel Heads, with the exception of a trust for the relief of poverty, to be charitable in law a trust must be established for the benefit of the community or a sufficiently important class of the community, rather than for the benefit of private individuals. This requirement, which is in addition to the objects of the charity falling within one of the four heads listed above, is known as the public benefit test. The public benefit test has been endorsed and further developed by a large body of case law, including Verge v Somerville \[1924\] All ER 121, Oppenheim v Tobacco Securities Trust Co Ltd \[1951\] 1 All ER 31, Davies v Perpetual Trustee Co (Ltd) \[1959\] 2 All ER 128 and New Zealand Society of Accountants v CIR \[1986\] 1 NZLR 148. It is noted that the amended definition of “charitable purpose” now allows the purpose of a trust to be charitable if the purpose would meet the public benefit requirement apart from the fact that the beneficiaries of the trust are related by blood. The trust, however, must still satisfy other requirements of a charitable trust. Section 24B of the Maori Trust Boards Act Section 24B of the Maori Trust Boards Act was inserted into that Act by section 3 of the Maori Trust Boards Amendment Act 1962. Section 24B permits the establishment of charitable trusts by Maori Trust Boards, and provides a concessionary tax treatment of the income of such trusts. There are two possible interpretations of the meaning of section 24B of the Maori Trust Boards Act: • The first interpretation is that a declaration can be made under section 24B(1) only if the purposes of the trust are exclusively “charitable” within the 12 common law meaning of the term. Although section 24B(2) requires that the income of the trust must be applied only for the purposes referred to in section 24 or section 24A, it follows from this approach that, as the trust must be also charitable, the income can be applied only for section 24 or section 24A purposes that are themselves charitable. Such income would, therefore, be exempt under the Income Tax Act. • The second interpretation is that the income of a section 24B trust can be applied for any of the purposes referred to in section 24 or section 24A – whether those purposes are charitable under general law or not. This approach proceeds upon the basis that any income derived by the trust is deemed by section 24B(2), to the extent that it is applied for purposes specified in section 24 or section 24A, to be income derived in trust for charitable purposes for the purposes of the Income Tax Act, and therefore, exempt from income tax. This is irrespective of whether the purpose is a purpose that would generally be considered charitable in law. The background papers relating to the introduction of section 24B, including Hansard, indicate that the new section was intended to remedy the concern, at the time, that trusts established by Maori Trust Boards were not considered charitable in terms of both the common law and the income tax legislation. This view of the law was confirmed in Arawa Maori Trust Board v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1961) 10 MCD 391. In that case Donne SM ruled that a trust established by the Arawa Maori Trust Board was not charitable for two reasons. • Many of the purposes specified in section 24 of the Maori Trust Boards Act were not charitable purposes under the general law. • The trust failed the public benefit test because it was for the benefit of a group of people determined by their bloodline or whakapapa. The Court determined that such a group of people did not satisfy the public benefit test. Analysis The Commissioner considers that the second interpretation, as set out above, and not the first interpretation, was what Parliament intended. As has been noted, when section 24B was enacted, it was strongly argued, taking into account the decision in Arawa, that a trust that benefits a specific tribe or iwi, or the members of such a tribe or iwi, cannot be charitable at common law because it will not meet the requirements of the public benefit test. Therefore, it would be arguable that any trust established under section 24B could not be charitable, irrespective of the purposes for which it was established, because Maori Trust Boards are acknowledged by the Maori Trust Boards Act to be for the benefit of iwi and hapu determined on the basis of whakapapa. This would give rise to a situation where, despite the enactment of section 24B, trusts established by Maori Trust Boards would possibly continue to be denied charitable status and the amendment would have no effective operation. Clearly, this cannot have been Parliament’s intention. 13 Taking this into account, and after considering the available background documents, the Minister’s statement (as recorded in Hansard) and the Commissioner’s practice immediately following the enactment of section 24B, the Commissioner considers that the second interpretation is the correct view of the law. Under the second interpretation, section 24B(1) allows a Maori Trust Board to declare that it holds property in trust for charitable purposes and authorises the Trust Board to settle some of the Trust Board’s assets to a charitable trust. Section 24B(2) has two limbs. The first limb states: Any income derived by the Board from any property to which the declaration relates shall be applied for such purposes referred to in section 24 or section 24A of this Act as may be specified in the declaration of trust; The Commissioner considers that this limb limits the purposes for which the income of a charitable trust can be applied to those purposes that are referred to in sections 24 and 24A. The purposes for which the income is to be applied must be specified in the declaration of trust. As previously noted, many of the purposes referred to in sections 24 and 24A may not be charitable purposes under common law. In addition, any trust established by a Maori Trust Board is allowed to apply its income only for the benefit of the Trust Board’s beneficiaries, which are restricted, by the Maori Trust Boards Act, to the members of specified iwi. Such a requirement could mean that a trust would fail the public benefit test applied under the common law (although it is noted that due to the amended definition of “charitable purpose” as discussed above, since 2003 this would no longer be the case for the purposes of the tax Acts). However, the second limb of section 24B(2) deems the income of the trust to be “income derived by trustees in trust for charitable purposes”. The second limb states: and, for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 2007, any such income shall be deemed to be income derived by trustees in trust for charitable purposes. Therefore, the effect of this section is to deem the income of the trust, even though it is established for purposes that may not be charitable in general law, to be “income derived by trustees in trust for charitable purposes” for the purposes of the Income Tax Act. This means that the requirements of sections CW 41 and CW 42, to the extent that those sections apply only to “income derived by trustees in trust for charitable purposes”, have been satisfied. It is, therefore, not necessary for such a trust to satisfy the common law requirements of “charitable purpose” and the “public benefit test”. It should be noted that section 24B(2) of the Maori Trust Boards Act only modifies the requirements of the Income Tax Act. It does not apply for any other purposes. Therefore, whatever may be the position of such a trust under common law and irrespective of whether the public benefit test would be met in other contexts, the Commissioner is satisfied that under this provision Parliament intended for a trust established under section 24B to be treated as a charitable trust for income tax purposes. The income of such a trust is, therefore, treated as having been derived for charitable purposes and as such is exempt from income tax under section CW 41 or CW 42. 14 Nevertheless, before that exemption can be applied, the requirements of section 24B(3) must be satisfied. That section requires a declaration of trust under section 24B(1) to be approved by the Commissioner before it will take effect. The Commissioner must still be satisfied that the constituting documents of the trust meet the legal requirements of a charitable trust. (In addition, from 1 July 2008 the trust must be registered with the Charities Commission, or the trust must have started the registration process before 1 July 2008 intending to complete it and have not been notified by the Commissioner that the trust is not a tax charity.) Approval of charitable trust As outlined above, section 24B(2) of the Maori Trust Boards Act modifies the general law requirements of a trust established under section 24B(1) to the extent that the trust is not required to satisfy the meaning of “charitable purpose” in section YA 1. However, before such a trust will be approved by the Commissioner under section 24B(3), the trust must still meet the other criteria of a charitable trust. For example, the Commissioner must also be satisfied that the declaration of trust provides that: • the charitable activities are restricted to New Zealand (if the trust is claiming exemption under section CW 42); • the rules of the trust cannot be changed in order to allow the income of the trust to be applied to purposes that are not specified in section 24 or section 24A of the Maori Trust Boards Act, or to otherwise affect the charitable nature of the trust; • no person is able to derive a personal pecuniary profit from the trust; • trustees are unable to materially influence their remuneration; • professional services provided by trustees to the trust are provided at commercial rates and that conflicts of interest are avoided; and • upon winding up, any remaining trust assets must be applied for charitable purposes. This is not an exhaustive list of all matters that the Commissioner will consider when deciding whether a trust is charitable. (In addition, some of these requirements may be satisfied by compliance with the terms of the Maori Trust Boards Act.) When a section 24B trust has previously obtained the Commissioner’s approval, as required by section 24B(3) of the Maori Trust Boards Act, that approval will continue to apply and the trust is not required to apply annually for assessment of the liability to income tax. The approval given by the Commissioner under section 24B(3) will not be revoked, however, the trust must continue to apply its income for the purposes specified in the declaration in order to rely on the exemption. 15 Charities Act 2005 The Charities Act established the Charities Commission to set up and manage the Charities Register. The Charities Commission began receiving registrations from 1 February 2007. While registration is voluntary and non-registration does not mean that the entity is not charitable, there will be benefits to registration. One of the benefits of the registration process is that the charity will be entitled to exemptions from income tax under section CW 41 or CW 42. However, once registered, charities will still need to assess for themselves whether they continue to meet the requirements of the tax legislation to obtain a tax exemption. For further information see Operational Statement OS 06/02 Interaction of tax and charities rules, covering tax exemption and donee status. The Charities Act amended sections CW 41 and CW 42 on 1 July 2008 so that only those charities that are registered or have begun the registration process with the Charities Commission are eligible for tax exempt status. For any entity wanting to continue receiving its current tax exemption or to begin to receive the tax benefits after 1 July 2008, that entity must have registered or have started the registration process with the Charities Commission by that date intending to complete it and have not been notified by the Commissioner that it is not a tax charity. This includes a trust established by a Maori Trust Board under section 24B of the Maori Trust Boards Act. An entity will qualify for registration as a charitable entity if the essential requirements of section 13(1) of the Charities Act are met. • The entity is established and maintained exclusively for charitable purposes. • The entity is not for the private profit of any individual or group. • The entity has a name that complies with the Charities Act. • All the officers of the entity are qualified to be officers. As discussed above, no declaration of trust shall have any force or effect unless it has been approved by the Commissioner under section 24B(3) of the Maori Trust Boards Act. Section 13(2)(b) of the Charities Act will treat such trusts as complying with the section 13(1)(a) requirement. Provided the trust can satisfy the other registration criteria, it will be registered with the Charities Commission. The trust will then be eligible for tax exemption under section CW 41 or section CW 42. However, continued tax exemption in respect of the income of the trust is dependent on the trust continuing to satisfy the other requirements of the Charities Act, including filing annual returns. Where a Maori Trust Board has been dissolved Some Maori Trust Boards have been dissolved (for example in the previous ruling it was mentioned that the Ngai Tahu Trust Board was dissolved by the Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu Act 1996). It was noted in the previous ruling that: notwithstanding the fact that the Trust Board has been dissolved and no longer exists, section 30(1)(c) provides that any income derived from property that was subject to the original declaration, to the extent that it is applied for the purposes specified in the declaration, shall be treated for tax purposes as being derived in trust for charitable purposes. This means that the income of the trust created under section 24B of the Maori Trust Boards Act will continue to be exempt for tax purposes. 16 Since the public ruling was last issued other runanga have been created. As indicated, this ruling relates only to trusts established under section 24B of the Maori Trust Boards Act. However, where a section 24B trust ceases to exist, the treatment of the income needs to be considered in the context of the Charities Act. Therefore, like any charitable entity, a runanga will need to register with the Charities Commission (or have started the registration process before 1 July 2008 intending to complete it and have not been notified it is not a tax charity) to continue to receive tax exemption status. Period of Ruling This ruling commences on the first day of the 2008/09 income year. The previous ruling expired on 31 March 2006. Given the terms of section 91C of the Tax Administration Act 1994, it is not possible to issue a ruling in respect of the Income Tax Act 2004 for the period beginning 1 April 2006 to the end of the 2007/08 income year. However, the Commissioner is of the view that the same principles and conclusions as set out in this ruling apply in respect of any income derived during this period from any property the subject of a declaration of trust under section 24B of the Maori Trust Boards Act. Examples Example 1 A Maori Trust Board executes a declaration of trust under section 24B of the Maori Trust Boards Act. The declaration provides that the trust will hold certain assets upon trust for charitable purposes. The declaration specifies that the income of the trust will be applied by making grants to reimburse any dental costs incurred by any of the beneficiaries, being members of the iwi. The declaration is submitted to the Commissioner who is satisfied that the purpose for which the trust’s income will be applied is a purpose specified in section 24 of the Maori Trust Boards Act (section 24(2)(a)(iii): “The promotion of health ... by providing, subsidising, or making grants for medical, nursing, or dental services”) and that there are adequate provisions in the trust deed to prevent the trust’s income and assets from being used for other purposes. The Commissioner will, therefore, approve the declaration under section 24B(3). The income of the trust will be eligible for exemption from income tax under section CW 41 or CW 42 if the trust is also registered with the Charities Commission. Provided the Maori Trust Board continues to apply its income for the purposes specified in its declaration of trust, being in compliance with the requirements in section 24 and section 24A of the Maori Trust Boards Act, the Income Tax Act and the Charities Act, the trust will be eligible to obtain a tax exemption under section CW 41 or CW 42. Example 2 A Maori Trust Board makes a declaration under section 24B for the same purpose as described in Example 1. The Commissioner is satisfied that the purpose for which the trust’s income is to be applied is a purpose that is specified in either section 24 or section 24A of the Maori Trust Boards Act. 17 However, it is found that the declaration does not prohibit the trustees from materially influencing the amount of remuneration that they receive. The declaration also does not provide for the disbursement of assets, upon winding up, to other charitable entities or purposes. The Commissioner will, therefore, decline approval until such time as the declaration is amended in such a manner to satisfy the Commissioner’s requirements.
PROJECTS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS PROGRAMME—GST TREATMENT The Projects to Reduce Emissions programme was established by the New Zealand Government in 2003 in order to assist New Zealand to meet its obligations under the Kyoto Protocol. A total of 41 agreements in the form described in this ruling were entered into under the programme before the Government’s climate change policies were reviewed and changed in 2005. This ruling applies only to agreements in the form described in this ruling and entered into under the Projects to Reduce Emissions programme. PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 08/04 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections 4, 8(1), and 9(3)(a) and the definitions of “goods”, “services”, and “consideration”. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is a project agreement between the Crown and a participant under the Crown’s Projects to Reduce Emissions programme. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows. • For the purposes of section 8, the participant will supply emission reduction services as defined in section 2 (the implementation and operation of a project so as to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases) to the Crown. • For the purposes of section 8, the consideration for the supply of emission reduction services will be in the form of emission units transferred by the Crown to the participant. • The value of the supply of emission reduction services determined under section 4 will be: - an amount equal to the price emission units transferred under the project agreement would fetch at the time of supply, if they were supplied between arm’s length parties; or 2 - if it is not possible to establish that price, an amount equal to the price similar emission units would fetch at the time of supply if they were supplied between arm’s length parties; or - if it is not possible to establish the price at which the emission units or similar emission units could be sold on the emissions market in New Zealand at the time of supply, the price (at the time of supply) of emission units calculated by The Treasury for the purpose of estimating the Crown’s contingent liability under the Kyoto Protocol. • Under section 9(3)(a) the time of supply of each annual supply under the project agreement will be the earlier of the relevant transfer date (as defined in the project agreement) and the date on which emission units are actually transferred to the participant. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2013. This Ruling is signed by me on the 7 th day of November 2008. Martin Smith Chief Tax Counsel 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR PUB 08/04 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 08/04 (“the Ruling”). All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. Background 1. The Kyoto Protocol is an international agreement that was signed in 1997 and came into force on 16 February 2005. The Kyoto Protocol was entered into in pursuit of the ultimate object of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (“the Convention”): the stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. The aim of the Kyoto Protocol is to reduce total greenhouse gas emissions to 5 percent below their level in 1990 during the first Commitment Period (2008–12). 2. Only countries that have ratified the Kyoto Protocol are bound by it. New Zealand ratified the Kyoto Protocol on 19 December 2002. 3. The Kyoto Protocol recognises that countries have different economic circumstances and that their abilities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions differ. Therefore, different countries have different emission reduction targets under the Kyoto Protocol. New Zealand’s commitment under the Kyoto Protocol for the first Commitment Period is to reduce New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions to their 1990 level, or to accept responsibility for the excess emissions. New Zealand has an initial quantity of emission units based on its emission reduction target under the Kyoto Protocol. Additional emission units can be derived: • from New Zealand’s forest sink credits, which are given in respect of forests planted since 1990 on land that did not previously contain forests (known as “Kyoto forests”) in recognition of the ability of growing forests to absorb carbon dioxide; • by purchasing emission units on the international market; or • by participating in projects recognised under the Kyoto Protocol. What are emission units? 4. The term “emission units” in relation to the Projects to Reduce Emissions programme is defined by the Ministry for the Environment in the key terms section of its website (http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/climate/policies-initiatives/projects/key-terms.html as follows: 4 Emission units Means all of the unit types specified in the Kyoto Protocol, namely, assigned amount units (AAUs), certified emission reduction units (CERs), emission reduction units (ERUs), and removal units (RMUs). For the purposes of the Projects to Reduce Emissions programme and the Model Project Agreement, the Emission Units being offered by the Crown are AAUs (or ERUs if these are requested by the project participant). 5. Assigned amount units (AAUs) are issued out of a country’s assigned amount under the Kyoto Protocol (which in New Zealand’s case is an amount equal to its 1990 greenhouse gas emissions multiplied by five). Certified emission reduction units (CERs) are issued in relation to Clean Development Mechanism projects (between an Annex I party to the Convention and non-Annex I countries and which are implemented in a non-Annex I country). The purpose of Clean Development Mechanism projects is to assist non-Annex I countries to achieve sustainable development, to contribute to the ultimate objective of the Convention, and to assist Annex I parties to achieve compliance with their commitments to limit and reduce emissions: Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol. Emission reduction units (ERUs) are derived from a Joint Implementation project under Article 6 of the Kyoto Protocol (which allows the acquisition and transfer of ERUs resulting from projects to reduce emissions undertaken between two Annex I countries). Removal units (RMUs) result from a country’s sink activities that result in a net removal of greenhouse gases. The term “sink” is defined by the Ministry for the Environment in the key terms section of its website: Any natural or man-made system that absorbs and stores greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. To be considered a sink, a system must be absorbing more carbon dioxide than it is releasing, so that the permanent store of carbon is expanding. 6. There is an agreed international standard for the measurement of greenhouse gas emissions, so that the position of each country is calculated in the same manner. One emission unit is equivalent to one tonne of carbon dioxide (or its equivalent in other greenhouse gases) that would otherwise have been emitted into the atmosphere. 7. Emission units are tradable allowances for greenhouse gas emissions. The ultimate users of emission units are national governments that will be required to retire (that is, set aside) emission units in order to meet their obligations under the Kyoto Protocol. If a country’s initial assigned amount, plus any additional sink and project credits earned over the Commitment Period, is less than its total emissions for that period, it must be a net purchaser of units over the Commitment Period, or it will be required to make up any shortfall by purchases at the end of the Commitment Period. Emission units can be used only once to offset emissions equal to the equivalent greenhouse gas value. Emissions trading 8. Emission units are tradable between nations and, where nations provide for private ownership of emission units, they can also be traded by private entities. The cost of emission units on the international market is expected to reflect the cost of achieving emission reductions throughout the market. The aim of emissions trading is to lower 5 the overall cost of achieving emission reductions. Because it is likely to be more difficult and expensive for some parties to the Kyoto Protocol to achieve emission reductions than for other parties, some parties may purchase emission units on the international market in order to comply with their obligations under the Kyoto Protocol. 9. The Kyoto Protocol allows governments to devolve responsibility for emissions to private entities. This means private entities would be required to report their emissions and hold a matching number of emission units. To the extent that some states have devolved, or are expected to devolve, national obligations to reduce emissions to individual emitters, private entities may be required to purchase emission units. 10. The New Zealand Government has announced a “cap and trade” emissions trading scheme under which participants in the system are allocated, or purchase, New Zealand units (NZUs) that they can trade with others. NZUs are a type of emission unit and will be the primary domestic unit of trade. It is intended that during the first Commitment Period the New Zealand emissions trading scheme will be linked to the international market for emission units issued under the Kyoto Protocol (Kyoto units) and that, subject to certain restrictions, NZUs will be interchangeable with Kyoto units, so that participants in the New Zealand emissions trading scheme will be able to surrender both NZUs and Kyoto units for New Zealand emissions trading scheme compliance purposes. See The Framework for a New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme (Ministry for the Environment and The Treasury, September 2007). 11. At present, there is no formal or organised market for emissions trading, and trading is being conducted through brokers. 12. Annex I parties to the Convention are required to establish and maintain a national registry system in order to keep track of transfers and acquisitions of emission units, the setting aside of units for the purpose of compliance with Kyoto Protocol commitments (retirement) and the cancellation of units. New Zealand is an Annex I party under the Convention. A New Zealand registry system for emission units will be established under the Climate Change Response Act 2002. 13. Unique serial numbers must be allocated to each AAU when the initial assigned amount is recorded and to each ERU when it is issued: section 15 of the Climate Change Response Act 2002. 14. An international transaction registry will verify the issue of units, transfers and acquisitions between registries, the retirement and cancellation of units, and the carry- over to any subsequent commitment period, and a clean development registry will issue Clean Development Mechanism units: United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change website (http://unfccc.int/2860.php). Projects to Reduce Emissions programme 15. One of the measures the New Zealand Government has adopted to enable New Zealand to meet its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol is the Projects to Reduce Emissions programme. Under this programme individuals, companies, or organisations were 6 invited to submit proposals for projects that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions in New Zealand, and to tender for emission units. The Crown awarded emission units in respect of projects undertaken under the programme. The use of a competitive tender process was intended to create pressure on participants to bid down to the minimum number of units they required to allow them to proceed with the project. 16. Initially, it was proposed that subject to Budget allocations being made and a decision of the Government to implement the round in each year, the opportunity to make tenders under the programme would be made available annually. Fifteen projects received emission units in the first tender round in 2003, and a further 26 projects received emission units in the second tender round in 2004. No more Projects to Reduce Emission agreements will be entered into as the New Zealand Government has reviewed and changed its climate change policies. Projects entered into include projects for wind farms, hydro-electricity generation, geothermal-electricity generation, and bio-energy and landfill gas projects. (The first tender round took place before the Kyoto Protocol came into force and successful bidders took the risk that it might not come into force.) 17. A tender under the Project to Reduce Emissions programme had to be for a single definable project. To be eligible to receive emission units under the programme, a project had to: • take place in New Zealand; • result in measurable emission reductions additional to reductions that would otherwise occur; • achieve a minimum annual reduction in emissions of 10,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in the first Commitment Period of the Kyoto Protocol; and • be a project that would not have proceeded if emission units had not been awarded in respect of the project. 18. The selection criteria for projects are explained on the Ministry for the Environment’s website (http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/climate/policies-initiatives/projects/eligibility- selection.html) as follows: In the second tender round, eligible projects were ranked and selected on the following basis: • The ratio of the number of emission units requested by the tenderer divided by the tonnes of CO 2 - equivalent emissions expected to be reduced by the project during the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (2008-2012). • Risk assessment of the project. Subject to the assessed risk of a project, projects offering the most reduction in emissions in exchange for the least number of emission units requested were ranked highest. Projects were selected in order of their ranking until the 6 million emission units available in the second tender round had been allocated. 7 19. If a project delivers emission reductions, the Crown’s requirement to retire emission units to meet its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol will reduce and these units will become available to the Crown to deliver to the participant instead. To the extent that the project results in greater emission reductions than the emission units to be provided by the Crown, the Crown will have improved its compliance position. 20. Project agreements have been entered into between the Crown acting through the Minister of Finance and the Minister Responsible for Climate Change Issues and a successful bidder under the programme (the participant). Project agreements apply for a term beginning on the date of the agreement and ending on 31 December 2013 (unless they are terminated earlier): clause 3 of the project agreement. (All references to clauses are to clauses in the project agreement.) 21. Both the Crown and the participant under a project agreement will be registered persons for GST purposes, and any supplies made by the Crown or a participant under a project agreement will be made in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity. 22. Project agreements in relation to projects under the programme contain standard terms and conditions and information specific to the project (such as implementation milestones and verification processes). Examples of milestones include the lodging of applications for resource consents, the granting of resource consents, entry into a contract for the supply of major equipment, starting construction, and milestones in the construction process from site preparation to equipment delivery to completion of the commissioning of equipment and commencement of operation. 23. Under a project agreement the participant agrees to two things. • The participant agrees to implement the project in accordance with agreed specifications and milestone dates specified in the project agreement and to complete the project by the final milestone date. The participant will achieve completion of the final milestone when: (a) the Participant has carried out all work necessary to complete the final Milestone; and (b) the Crown has accepted, in accordance with clause 7, the Milestone Report in respect of such Milestone or it has been resolved, in accordance with clause 7, that the Participant has carried out all work necessary to complete the final Milestone. • The participant agrees to operate the project so as to ensure that the project results in the specified emission reductions before and during the Commitment Period (1 January 2008 to 31 December 2012). The definition of “emission reductions” in clause 4.4 reads as follows: In this Agreement, “emission reductions” means greenhouse gas emission reductions where: (a) the Participant has achieved completion of the final Milestone in accordance with clause 4.1; (b) the Greenhouse Gas emission reductions have been determined in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 2, including the measurement methodology set out in that Schedule; and 8 (c) either the Crown has accepted, in accordance with clause 7, the Annual Report in which such Greenhouse Gas emission reductions are reported or, in the case of non-acceptance by the Crown, the Dispute has been resolved in accordance with clause 16 (including resolution of the Greenhouse Gas emission reductions achieved). 24. The project agreement provides for a monitoring process to enable the Crown to establish that the participant has complied with its obligation to implement the project and to establish the emission reductions achieved by the project. The participant must deliver to the Crown two things. • The participant must deliver to the Crown a milestone report containing the information specified in Schedule 3 of the project agreement within 20 business days of completion of each milestone: clause 7.2(a). If a milestone is not completed by the relevant milestone date, the participant, within 20 business days of that date, must deliver an interim milestone report outlining progress towards completion of the milestone, the reasons for the delay in completion, and the date by which the participant expects to complete the milestone: clause 7.2(c). • The participant must deliver to the Crown an annual report containing the information specified in Schedule 4 of the project agreement for each year from the first year in which the participant has promised in its tender that it will deliver emission reductions to 2012 (inclusive) by 31 January of the following year: clause 7.2(b). 25. The Crown may request any further information necessary to enable it to verify the information in any report, inspect the project, interview the participant’s staff, and arrange for any annual report to be audited by an independent person: clauses 7.3, 7.4, and 7.5. The Crown must notify the participant that it accepts a report or, if it does not accept a report, the Crown must notify the participant specifying the reasons for such non-acceptance: clause 7.3(b). If the Crown fails to notify the participant within the time-frame specified in clause 7.3(b), it is not deemed to have accepted the report: clause 7.3. If the participant disagrees with the Crown’s position, the dispute is to be resolved in accordance with the disputes resolution procedure in clause 16: clause 7.3(c). 26. The maximum number of emission units that the Crown is required to transfer will be specified in the project agreement: clause 5.2. Emission units are to be transferred to the participant annually during the Commitment Period. The number of emission units transferred in respect of each year is to be determined by reference to the reduction of emissions achieved by the project during the relevant year and calculated in accordance with the following formula: A = B × C Where: A is the number of Emission Units to be transferred B is the Emission Reductions, stated in (tCO2-e), resulting from the Project during the relevant year of the Commitment Period; and 9 C is a number not more than one that reflects the ratio of emission units to emission reductions requested by the participant in its tender. (The term “tCO 2 -e” means tonnes of carbon dioxide, or for greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide specified in Schedule 2 (if any), their equivalent in tonnes of carbon dioxide calculated in accordance with their respective global warming potential conversion rates specified in Schedule 2.) 27. The Ministry for the Environment administers the Projects to Reduce Emissions programme, and the Ministry of Economic Development manages the emissions unit registry. If the Ministry for the Environment is satisfied a project has achieved emission reductions (so that the participant is entitled to emission units under a project agreement), the ministry will recommend to the Ministers that a specific number of emission units be transferred to the participant. This transfer will be made through the registry. 28. Under clause 5.1 the emission units are to be transferred to the participant on or before the transfer date. “Transfer date” is defined in the project agreement as follows: “Transfer Date” means 5 Business Days after: (a) acceptance by the Crown of a Commitment Period Annual Report in accordance with clause 7.3; or (b) in the case of non-acceptance by the Crown, resolution of the Dispute (including resolution of the Emission Reductions achieved) in accordance with clause 16. 29. Under clause 5.3 if the participant gives notice by 31 January in any year that the participant wishes the Crown to transfer the emission units resulting from the project during the previous year to a nominated person or persons, the Crown must transfer the emission units to the nominated person or persons unless: • the Crown is unable to do so for any reason; or • in the Crown’s reasonable opinion it is impracticable to do so. 30. Either AAUs or ERUs may be transferred under project agreements. The participant may elect to receive ERUs if the project meets the eligibility requirements for a project under Article 6 of the Kyoto Protocol, provided the participant bears any costs the Crown incurs as a result of the participant requiring the transfer of ERUs. (Usually AAUs (being units issued out of New Zealand’s assigned amount under the Kyoto Protocol) will be transferred. There may be price differences between different types of units. Therefore, the value of the emission units transferred under a project agreement could differ depending on whether ERUs or AAUs are transferred.) 31. If it is established that the amount of emission units that have been transferred to the participant is incorrect, the participant must refund the excess amount of emission units to the Crown. This could occur when it is ascertained after the transfer of emission units that the level of emission reductions resulting from the project differs from that previously accepted in respect of a particular year. If either the Crown or the participant determines that the amount of emission reductions resulting from the project 10 in any year varies from the amount accepted in respect of that year, they may give written notice to the other party setting out the amount of and the reason for the variation and the revised amount of emission units that should have been transferred to the participant: clause 9.1. If the party receiving the notice does not trigger the disputes resolution provision in the project agreement (clause 16), the notice is deemed to have been accepted and, if the number of emission units transferred to the participant is: • more than the number specified in the notice, the participant must transfer the number of emission units equal to the difference(clause 9.3(a)); • less than the number specified in the notice, the Crown must transfer to the participant the number of emission units equal to the difference (clause 9.3(b)) (but the total number of emission units that would be transferred over the term of the project agreement will not exceed the maximum specified in the project agreement). 32. The participant may (with the Crown’s consent) assign all (but not less than all) its rights under the project agreement: clause 21.1. Such consent must not be unreasonably withheld. A direct or an indirect change in the effective control of the participant is deemed to be an assignment, unless the participant is a listed company or the change in the effective control of the participant is due to a change in the control of any other listed company: clause 21.3. 33. The Crown may terminate the agreement if the: • participant fails to meet a significant milestone in the project’s implementation; • project fails to result in more than 10 percent of the emissions reductions required under the agreement in any year (except where such failure is the direct result of the participant failing to achieve a milestone within 12 months after the relevant milestone date); • participant fails to provide any report within 30 business days of the due date; • participant provides inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading information; or • participant becomes insolvent(clause 18.2). The agreement may also be terminated by either party if the other party committed a material breach that is incapable of being remedied or the other party has failed to remedy a material breach that is capable of being remedied within 20 business days of notice of the breach: clause 18.3. 34. Clauses 6.1 and 6.2 provide: 6.1 Lowest price clause: The parties acknowledge that: (a) they are independent parties dealing at arm’s length with each other in relation to the matters contemplated by this agreement; and 11 (b) for the purposes of Division 2 of Part EH of the Income Tax Act 1994, neither the consideration provided by the Participant under clause 4 nor the consideration provided by the Crown under clause 5 includes any interest component, and in each case such consideration is the lowest price the parties would have agreed, on the Effective Date, if the obligations imposed on the parties under those respective clauses were required to be paid or discharged in full on the Effective Date. 6.2 GST: (a) On the date on which the Crown transfers Emission Units to the Participant or a Nominated Person or Persons in accordance with clause 5, the Crown shall issue a Tax Invoice to the Participant for that supply of Emission Units. At that time, the Crown shall also issue to the Participant a Buyer-Created Invoice in respect of the supply of services by the Participant under clause 4 that corresponds to the Emission Units being transferred under that Tax Invoice. The amount to be recorded on both the Tax Invoice, and the Buyer-Created Invoice which corresponds to that Tax Invoice, as: (i) the value of the supply, shall equate with the value of the Emission Units being transferred under that Tax Invoice; (ii) the tax charged in relation to the supply, shall be the value mentioned in (i) multiplied by the applicable rate of GST as determined under Part II of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. For the avoidance of doubt: (iii) each such invoice shall also record the GST-inclusive amount in relation to the supply, which amount shall equate with the sum of (i) and (ii); (iv) the date on which the Tax Invoice is issued is the time of supply of both supplies\[the supply of Emission Units by the Crown and the supply by the participant\] for\] for GST purposes. (b) For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that the GST chargeable in respect of a supply of Emission Units to the Participant, as recorded in a Tax Invoice, and the equivalent amount of GST chargeable in respect of the supply of services by the Participant under clause 4 that corresponds to the Emission Units being transferred under that Tax Invoice (which amount will be recorded in the Buyer-Created Invoice that corresponds to that Tax Invoice) can, be set off against each other. 35. If a formal, organised market for emission units does not develop, it is intended that the value of emission units would be determined on the basis of the information and methodology used by The Treasury for the purpose of calculating the Crown’s contingent liability under the Kyoto Protocol (that is, the price that the Crown would be required to pay to purchase emission units if New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions over the first Commitment Period exceed the target under the Kyoto Protocol). New Zealand’s contingent liability under the Kyoto Protocol was recognised for the first time in the Government’s accounts for the period ended 31 May 2005. The Treasury re-estimates the liability annually using World Bank published reports and having regard to European Union allowance prices and information from Point Carbon (a provider of news, analysis, and consulting services for European and global power, gas, and carbon markets). The methodology used and price calculated by The Treasury is peer reviewed. 12 Legislation 36. Section 8(1) provides: Subject to this Act, a tax, to be known as goods and services tax, shall be charged in accordance with the provisions of this Act at the rate of 12.5 percent on the supply (but not including an exempt supply) in New Zealand of goods and services, on or after the 1st day of October 1986, by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person, by reference to the value of that supply. 37. Section 5(1) provides: For the purposes of this Act, the term supply includes all forms of supply. 38. The definition of “goods”, “services”, and “consideration” in section 2 read: Goods means all kinds of personal or real property; but does not include choses in action, money or a product that is transmitted by a non-resident to a resident by means of a wire, cable, radio, optical or other electromagnetic system or by means of a similar technical system: Services means anything which is not goods or money: Consideration in relation to the supply of goods and services to any person, includes any payment made or any act or forbearance, whether or not voluntary, in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of, the supply of any goods and services, whether by that person or by any other person; but does not include any payment made by any person as an unconditional gift to any non-profit body: 39. Section 10(2) states: Subject to this section, the value of a supply of goods and services shall be such amount as, with the addition of the tax charged, is equal to the aggregate of,— (a) To the extent that the consideration for the supply is consideration in money, the amount of the money: (b) To the extent that the consideration for the supply is not consideration in money, the open market value of that consideration. 40. Section 4 provides: 4 Meaning of term open market value Similar supply defined (1) For the purposes of this section— (a) The term similar supply, in relation to a supply of goods and services, means any other supply of goods and services that, in respect of the characteristics, quality, quantity, functional components, materials, and reputation of the goods and services first mentioned, is the same as, or closely or substantially resembles, that supply of goods and services: (b) The open market value of a supply shall include any goods and services tax charged pursuant to section 8(1) of this Act on that supply. 13 Consideration in money (2) For the purposes of this Act, the open market value of any supply of goods and services at any date shall be the consideration in money which the supply of those goods and services would generally fetch if supplied in similar circumstances at that date in New Zealand, being a supply freely offered and made between persons who are not associated persons. Similar supply (3) Where the open market value of any supply of goods and services cannot be determined under subsection (2) of this section, the open market value shall be the consideration in money which a similar supply would generally fetch if supplied in similar circumstances at that date in New Zealand, being a supply freely offered and made between persons who are not associated persons. Method approved by Commissioner (4) Where the open market value of any supply of goods and services cannot be determined pursuant to subsection (2) or subsection (3) of this section, the open market value shall be determined in accordance with a method approved by the Commissioner which provides a sufficiently objective approximation of the consideration in money which could be obtained for that supply of those goods and services. Non-monetary consideration (5) For the purposes of this Act the open market value of any consideration, not being consideration in money, for a supply of goods and services shall be ascertained in the same manner, with any necessary modifications, as the open market value of any supply of goods and services is ascertained pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section. 41. Section 9(3)(a) provides: Agreements to hire Notwithstanding anything in subsection (1) or subsection (2) of this section,— (a) Where goods are supplied under an agreement to hire, or where services are supplied under any agreement or enactment which provides for periodic payments, they shall be deemed to be successively supplied for successive parts of the period of the agreement or the enactment, and each of the successive supplies shall be deemed to take place when a payment becomes due or is received, whichever is the earlier: Application of the legislation 42. Under section 8(1), GST is chargeable on the supply of goods and services by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person by reference to the value of the supply. The participant under a project agreement is a registered person and any supply made under a project agreement will be made in the course or furtherance of the participant’s taxable activity. Is a supply of goods or services made by the participant to the Crown? 43. The participant has two obligations under the project agreement. 14 • The participant must implement the project in accordance with the specifications in the agreement and the milestone dates specified in the agreement, including completion of the final milestone. A “milestone” is a significant event in the project’s implementation and a “milestone date” is the date by which the participant is required to complete a milestone. • The participant must operate the project so as to ensure that the project results in the minimum emission reductions specified in the project agreement: 44. The term “goods” is defined in section 2(1) as meaning all kinds of personal or real property except choses in action and money. A “chose in action” refers to all property rights that cannot be exercised by taking physical possession and can be enforced only by legal action: Torkington v Magee \[1907\] 2 KB 427; Simperingham v West Haven Marine Centre Ltd (1990) 12 NZTC 7111. As the Crown obtains no rights in respect of any plant or equipment constructed under a project to reduce emissions or other property of the participant, a participant does not provide goods to the Crown under a project agreement. 45. The term “services” encompasses anything other than goods or money and means some action that helps or benefits the recipient: Case S65 (1996) 17 NZTC 7408; F B Duvall Ltd v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,470. tThe activities undertaken by participants in the performance of the participant’s obligations to the Crown under the project agreement constitute the supply of services (emission reduction services) to the Crown, being activities sought by the Crown in order to assist the Crown to meet its obligations under the Kyoto Protocol and to reduce its potential liability under the Kyoto Protocol. Consideration 46. For a payment to be “consideration” for GST purposes, there must be a sufficient relationship between the making of the payment and the supply of goods or services. The legal nature of the transaction must be considered in order to determine whether there is the required nexus between the payment and any supply. See CIR v NZ Refining Co Ltd (1997) 18 NZTC 13,187; Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,075; Taupo Ika Nui Body Corporate v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,147; Trustees & Executors and Agency Co New Zealand Ltd v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,076. 47. To be entitled to receive emission units, the participant must establish that a specific level of emission reductions has been achieved under the project. The Crown is not obliged to transfer emission units unless emission reductions are achieved and may terminate the agreement if the operation of the project fails to achieve less than 10 percent of the required emission reductions in any year: clause 18.2. Emission reductions will not be achieved unless the project is in continuous operation over the Commitment Period. The number of emission units transferred in each year of the agreement will depend on the emission reductions achieved by the project in each year. The participant is required to provide the information specified in the project agreement in order to enable the Crown to verify that a particular level of emission reductions has been achieved from the project. There is, therefore, a clear link between the transfer of 15 emission units by the Crown and the supply of emission reduction services by the participant. 48. The consideration for the supply of emission reduction services by the participant to the Crown is, therefore, in the form of emission units transferred by the Crown to the participant. As emission units are consideration (within the statutory definition) for the supply of services by the participant and as any supply made under a project agreement is in the course or furtherance of the participant’s taxable activity, it is unnecessary to consider whether the emission units are deemed by section 5(6D) to be consideration for the supply of services in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by the participant. Value of the supply 49. The value of a supply is the total of the: • amount of money, to the extent that the consideration is expressed as an amount of money; and • open market value of the consideration, to the extent that the consideration is not expressed as an amount of money: section 10(2). 50. The consideration for the emission reduction services is not consideration expressed as an amount of money. A monetary value is not attributed to the emission reduction services (compare with Case T11 (1997) 18 NZTC 8054). Therefore, it is necessary to establish the open market of the emission units in order to determine the value of the supply of emission reduction services made by the participant to the Crown: section 10(2)(b). Open market value 51. Section 4 sets out rules for determining the open market value of supplies made between associated persons. The same valuation methods are to be used for valuing consideration that is not expressed as an amount in money: section 4(5). 52. If the open market value of the emission units is not able to be ascertained by applying section 4(2), their open market value is to be determined under section 4(3). If the open market value of the emission units cannot be determined by applying section 4(2) or section 4(3), the method in section 4(4) applies. See Newman v CIR (200) 19 NZTC 15,666. 53. Under section 4(2), (3), and (4), the value of the emission units would be determined in the following manner. • The open market value of the emission units under section 4(2) is the amount of the consideration in money that a supply of the emission units would fetch if they were supplied between arm’s length parties in New Zealand. 16 • The open market value of the emission units under section 4(3) is the amount of the consideration in money that would be received from the sale of similar emission units under a supply between arm’s length parties in New Zealand. • The open market value of the emission units under section 4(4) is to be determined “in accordance with a method approved by the Commissioner which provides a sufficiently objective approximation of the consideration in money which could be obtained” for the emission units. 54. There is no formal, organised market in New Zealand or elsewhere for emission units, so there is no institution like a stock exchange where a high volume of transactions takes place, providing reliable information as to the market value of emission units. The emissions market has been primary, bilateral, non-transparent, and with prices heavily influenced by project-specific factors. If the nature of the market does not change, it may not be possible to apply the methods set out in section 4(2) and (3) in determining the market value of emission units. Both subsections (2) and (3) refer to an arm’s length supply in New Zealand. The ability to apply these methods depends on a New Zealand market for emissions unit developing before it is necessary to determine the value of emission units transferred under project agreements. If it is not possible to apply the methods in section 4(2) or section 4(3), the open market value is to be determined in accordance with a method approved by the Commissioner that provides a sufficiently objective approximation of the consideration in money that could be obtained for the supply of those services: section 4(4). 55. If it is not possible to determine the open market value of a formal market for emission units by other means is not established, it is proposed to value the emission units on the basis of the price used to estimate the Crown's contingent liability under the Kyoto Protocol (that is, the price the Crown would be required to pay for emission units, if New Zealand was required to purchase additional emission units in order to comply with New Zealand's obligations under the Kyoto Protocol). This estimate is made annually for the purpose of completing the Crown's accounts. New Zealand has a commitment under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 5% below their 1990 level. If this target is not achieved, the Crown must purchase emission units to make up the shortfall. The Crown is required to hold sufficient emission units at the end of the first Commitment Period to offset its emissions during the first Commitment Period of the Kyoto Protocol. The question is whether the method used by The Treasury to estimate the price that the Crown would be required to pay to purchase emission units in order to satisfy its liability under the Kyoto Protocol would provide a sufficiently objective approximation of the consideration in money that could be obtained for emission units. 55. If a formal market for it is not possible to determine the open market value of emission units by other means, it is proposed to value the emission units on the basis of the price used to estimate the Crown’s contingent liability under the Kyoto Protocol (that is, the price the Crown would be required to pay for emission units, if New Zealand was required to purchase additional emission units in order to comply with New Zealand’s obligations under the Kyoto Protocol). This estimate is made annually for the purpose of completing the Crown’s accounts. New Zealand has a commitment under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 5 percent below their 1990 level. If this target is not achieved, the Crown must purchase emission units to make up the shortfall. The Crown is required to hold sufficient emission units at the end of the first 17 Commitment Period to offset its emissions during the first Commitment Period of the Kyoto Protocol. The question is whether the method used by The Treasury to estimate the price that the Crown would be required to pay to purchase emission units in order to satisfy its liability under the Kyoto Protocol would provide a sufficiently objective approximation of the consideration in money that could be obtained for emission units. 56. There is considerable volatility in the emissions market and uncertainty as to prices for emission units, but as trade volumes and liquidity in the emissions market increase, the quality of information used to calculate the estimate and, therefore, the accuracy of the estimate, is likely to increase. Therefore, at the time emission units are transferred under project agreements, there may be more certainty as to the value of emission units on the international emissions market. 57. The Treasury’s estimate is based on the average price that the Crown could expect to pay for an emission unit. The Crown could purchase emission units for a range of prices, and an average price could be used for calculating the Crown’s contingent liability. The price of emission units is influenced by project risk (that is, the possibility that projects may not result in a particular level of emission reductions). Therefore, not all emission units are of the same quality. 58. AAUs or ERUs will be transferred under project agreements. However, the estimate of the Crown’s contingent liability is based on the international price for certified emission reduction units (CERs). This is because other types of emission units have not been substantially traded to date, so there is insufficient price information on which to assess international prices for these types of emission units. 59. For these reasons, the price for emission units used to estimate the Crown’s contingent liability under the Kyoto Protocol may not necessarily equate to the amount that a participant could obtain for an emission unit received under a project agreement. However, The Treasury’s calculation of the price of emission units will be based on the best available information in relation to international prices for emission units using a methodology that has been peer-reviewed by independent consultants. Therefore, the Commissioner accepts that the price for emission units calculated by The Treasury would provide a sufficiently objective approximation of the price that could be obtained for emission units transferred under a project agreement. 60. Therefore, the Commissioner accepts that if the amount at which emission units transferred under the project agreement (or similar emission units) could be sold on the emissions market cannot be ascertained, the open market value of emission units transferred under the project agreement would be the price (at the time of supply) of emission units calculated by The Treasury for the purpose of estimating the Crown’s contingent liability under the Kyoto Protocol. Time of supply 61. Under section 9(1) the time of supply is the earlier of the time when an invoice is issued by the supplier, or the recipient, or the time when any payment is received by the supplier. However, section 9(3) overrides section 9(1). Section 9(3)(a) applies when 18 services are supplied under any agreement or enactment that provides for periodic payments. In those circumstances, section 9(3)(a) deems services to be supplied successively over successive periods of the agreement and each successive supply is deemed to be made when a payment becomes due or is received, whichever is the earlier. 62. Whether section 9(3)(a) rather than section 9(1) applies, depends on whether the project agreement provides for periodic payments for the supply of emission reduction services. This requires consideration of the meaning of “payment” and what constitutes payment for emission reduction services. Meaning of “payment” 63. The cases indicate the following. • The terms “consideration” and “payment” are not synonymous: Nicholls v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,233. • “Payment” is not limited to the transfer of cash: White v Elmdene Estates Ltd \[1959\] 2 All ER 605; Garforth (Inspector of Taxes) v Naismith Stainless Ltd \[1979\] 2 All ER 73; Case L34 (1989) 11 NZTC 1204; Lanauze v King. • “Payment” includes payment in kind, and includes all methods by which the payer’s obligations are satisfied (including accounting entries, the giving of a mortgage, the delivery of a letter of credit issued by a bank, the issue of fully paid up shares, the transfer of property, and the setting off of obligations): Case L34; Case Q10 (1993) 15 NZTC 5061; Case S99 (1996) 17 NZTC 7622; Case T61 (1998) 18 NZTC 8461; Case U13 (2000) 19 NZTC 9293. • In determining whether payment has been made by the recipient of a supply of goods or services, the issue that needs to be considered is whether the recipient has been unconditionally discharged from liability under the contract in respect of the supply: Case T61; Lanauze v King. 64. The Crown’s obligation under the project agreement is to transfer emission units. The transfer of emission units by the Crown constitutes payment by the Crown for the supply of emission reduction services by the participant. A “payment” need not be in the form of a transfer of cash. The delivery of an asset constitutes payment for GST purposes. 65. As the project agreement requires the Crown to transfer emission units annually, subject to verification of the emission reductions achieved from the project, the emission reduction services are supplied under an agreement that provides for periodic (annual) payments. Therefore, the time of supply in respect of the supply of emission reduction services would be determined under section 9(3)(a) rather than section 9(1). 66. Under section 9(3)(a), the time of supply in respect of each successive supply (that is, each annual supply) is when a payment becomes due or is received, whichever is the earlier. 19 When is the debt due? 67. A debt would not be due where the amount of the debt has not, or has not yet, been established: Malissard Frères Savarzeux et Cie v Freightex \[1976\] 2 Lloyds Rep 665. A debt is “due” when it becomes payable, when payment is enforceable: Re European Life Assurance LR 9 Eq 122; Potel v IRC \[1971\] 2 All ER 504. 68. The participant will not be entitled to the transfer of emission units unless agreement has been reached on the level of emission reductions achieved in the particular year (and, therefore, the number of emission units the Crown must transfer). The participant is entitled to the transfer of the number of emission units calculated in accordance with the formula in clause 5.1 on or before the transfer date: clause 5.1. The transfer date (as defined) is the last day by which the emission units must be transferred. Clause 5.1 provides that the Crown must transfer emission units “on or before the Transfer Date”. The Commissioner considers that payment (the transfer of the emission units) would not become due until each transfer date, as the Crown is not obliged to transfer emission units until the transfer date. When is payment received? 69. A payment is received when the supplier (or the supplier’s agent) receives it for the supplier’s own benefit: CIR v Dormer (1997) 18 NZTC 13,446; Auckland Institute of Studies Ltd v CIR (2002) 20 NZTC 17,685. Payment would be received by the participant when emission units are actually transferred to the participant. When is the supply made? 70. Payment for emission reduction services is due on the “Transfer Date” (as defined in the project agreement). The “Transfer Date” is the latest date on which the Crown is required to transfer the agreed number of emission units. It is possible that payment could be received by the participant between the date when the annual report is accepted or agreement is reached on the emission reductions achieved and the transfer date (which is the fifth business day after the annual report is accepted or agreement is reached on the level of emission reductions achieved). However, when the emission units are transferred on the transfer date, the date when payment becomes due and the date when payment is received by the participant will be the same. 71. Therefore, the time of supply of each successive supply of emission reduction services made under a project agreement is the relevant transfer date (as defined in the project agreement), unless the emission units are transferred before the transfer date, in which case the date on which emission units are actually transferred to the participant will be the time of supply (being the date on which a payment is received by the participant). 20 Adjustments 72. The actual number of emission units that would be transferred in respect of each year of the term of the project agreement is determined by reference to the level of emission reductions that has been achieved in that year. If it is subsequently determined that the number of emission units that has been transferred to the participant in respect of a particular year exceeds the correct number, the project agreement requires the participant to transfer emission units equal to the difference to the Crown. If the number of emission units transferred to the participant is less than the correct number, the Crown must transfer to the participant the number of emission units equal to the difference. 73. Section 25(2), (4), and (5) provides for adjustments to output tax and input tax where the output tax that has been accounted for is incorrect as a consequence of “the previously agreed consideration for \[the\] supply of goods and services has been altered, whether due to a discount or otherwise”. The output tax adjustment must be made in the period in which it becomes apparent that the output tax is incorrect and an input tax adjustment must be made in the period in which the recipient receives knowledge that the input tax previously charged was incorrect. 74. The total number of emission units and the total level of emission reductions agreed under the project agreement will not change. However, if an adjustment in the number of emission units is made in respect of a particular year, the consideration agreed for the supply (a specific number of emission units calculated by reference to level of emission reductions previously accepted by the Crown) made in that year would be altered. Therefore, section 25 would apply when it is determined that the number of emission units previously transferred was incorrect. 75. Section 25(2)(a) deems output tax not accounted for as a consequence of an alteration in the previously agreed consideration to be tax charged on a taxable supply made in the taxable period in which the adjustment is to be made. Section 25(2)(b) allows a deduction where a supplier has accounted for output tax in excess of the supplier’s true liability. As section 25(2) and (4) does not deem a supply to be made; the valuation provisions in section 4 do not apply. Therefore, the value of emission units and emission reduction services is to be determined as at the time of supply, and that value would apply for the purpose of any adjustment required. The adjustments required under section 25 are aimed at reversing the GST position based on the previously agreed consideration. Any adjustments necessary are made in a subsequent taxable period. 76. Therefore, a subsequent adjustment to the number of emission units for the provision of emission reduction services in any particular year will not alter the value of the supply made in that year. Conclusion 21 77. Under a project agreement the participant supplies emission reduction services (the implementation and operation of a project so as to result in reductions in greenhouse gases) to the Crown. 78. The consideration for the supply of emission reduction services by the participant is the supply of emission units. 79. The value of the consideration provided by the Crown is: • an amount equal to the price that emission units transferred under the project agreement would fetch at the time of supply if they were supplied between arm’s length parties in New Zealand; • if is not possible to establish that amount, the price that similar emission units would fetch at the time of supply if they were supplied between arm’s length parties in New Zealand; or • if it is not possible to establish the price at which emission units or similar emission units would fetch at the time of supply if they were supplied between arm’s length parties in New Zealand, an amount equal to the price (at the time of supply) of emission units calculated by The Treasury for the purpose of calculating the Crown’s contingent liability under the Kyoto Protocol. 80. The time of each annual supply of emission reduction services is the earlier of the relevant transfer date (as defined in the project agreement) or the date on which emission units are actually transferred to the participant. Legislative amendments 81. The Climate Change Response Act 2002 has been amended to include provisions relating to an emissions trading scheme under which: • businesses in certain sectors will be required to calculate the emissions from their activities and to surrender one emission unit for each tonne of their emissions; and • the government may allocate “free” emission units to businesses in certain sectors. In conjunction with these amendments, the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 has been amended to ensure that acquisitions and disposals of emission units can take place across international markets, where buyers and sellers will not be known to each other and where transactions may have multiple counterparties. The proposed amendments preserve the existing GST treatment of supplies made by participants under agreements entered into under the Projects to Reduce Emissions programme.
PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 09/01 PAYMENTS MADE BY PARENTS OR GUARDIANS OF STUDENTS TO STATE SCHOOLS – GST TREATMENT Note (not part of ruling): This ruling is a reissue of Public Ruling BR PUB 03/04 (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 15, No 7 (July 2003)) which expired on 20 June 2006. This ruling is substantially the same as the expired ruling but expands some of the examples and takes into account consequential amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, and the Crown Entities Act 2004. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws T h is Ruling applies in respect of sections 8 and 10(2) and the definition of “consideration” in section 2 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the payment of amounts (whether described as “school fees”, “activity fees” or otherwise) by parents or guardians of pupils who are New Zealand citizens or New Zealand residents (or who are otherwise not foreign students under the Education Act 1989) and who are enrolled at state schools (including schools integrated within the state system of education under the Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975) to the Board of Trustees of such a school. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Ta xati on Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: Payments made by parents or guardians of children, who are New Zealand citizens or New Zealand residents (or who are otherwise not foreign students under the Education Act 1989) and who are enrolled at state schools, to the Board of Trustees of such a school for the purpose of a general fund to assist with meeting school costs, are not consideration for the supply of education to which there is a statutory entitlement and which the Board has a statutory obligation to provide free of charge. Therefore, GST is not payable on such amounts. If other services, not integral to the supply of education services to which there is a statutory entitlement, are supplied on the basis that the supply is conditional on payment being made for such services, the payment is consideration for that supply. GST is chargeable on payments made in those circumstances. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 21 June 20 06 to 20 June 2013. This Ruling is signed by me on the 23 rd day of March 2009. Susan Price Director, Public Rulings 1 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 09/01 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 09/01 (“the Ruling”). The subject matter covered in the Ruling was previously dealt with in Public Ruling BR PUB 03/04 (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 15, No 7 (July 2003)). The Ruling applies for the period from 21 June 2006 to 20 June 2013. Background Un der sect ion 93 of the Education Act 1989 (“Education Act”), every state school must have a Board of Trustees. State primary and secondary schools are controlled and managed by their Boards of Trustees: section 75 of the Education Act. Under section 75, except to the extent that any enactment or the general law of New Zealand provides otherwise, a school’s Board has complete discretion to control the management of the school as it thinks fit. Grants are paid out of public money to Boards for the purpose of administering their schools: section 79 of the Education Act. The Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975 (“PSCI Act”) enables private schools originally established to provide education with a special character to become part of the state system of education as an integrated school. As with other state schools, an integrated school’s controlling authority is its Board of Trustees: section 25(5) of the PSCI Act. Every Board must have a written charter. The purpose of the charter is to establish the missions, aims, objectives, directions and targets of the school Board that will give effect to the Government’s national education guidelines and the Board’s priorities: section 61 of the Education Act. The effect of a school charter is that it is an undertaking by the Board to the Minister of Education to take all reasonable steps to ensure the school is managed, organised, and administered for the purposes set out in the school charter and the school, its students, and community achieve the aims and objectives set out in the school charter: section 63 of the Education Act. A school charter will not take effect if the Secretary for Education determines it is inconsistent with the Education Act or the national administration guidelines: section 63A of the Education Act. The national education guidelines are defined in section 60 of the Education Act as being: all the national education goals, foundation curriculum policy statements, national curriculum statements, national standards and national administration guidelines, for the time being in force under section 60A of this Act: Section 60A(1)(c) of the Education Act sets out the national administration guidelines which the Minister may publish from time to time: (c) National administration guidelines, which are guidelines relating to school administration and which may (without limitation)— (i) set out statements of desirable codes or principles of conduct or administration for specified kinds or descriptions of person or body, including guidelines for the purpose of section 61: (ii) set out requirements relating to planning and reporting including— (A) scope and content areas, where appropriate: (B) the timeframe for the annual update of the school charter: 2 (C) broad requirements relating to schools’ consultation with parents, staff, school proprietors (in the case of integrated schools) and school communities, and the broad requirements to ensure that Boards take all reasonable steps to discover and consider the views and concerns of Maori communities living in the geographical area the school serves, in the development of a school charter: (D) variations from the framework for school planning and reporting for certain schools or classes of schools, based on school performance: (iii) communicate the Government's policy objectives: (iv) set out transitional provisions for the purposes of national administration guidelines. Under section 3 of the Education Act, everyone who is not a foreign student (that is, generally a New Zealand citizen or resident) is entitled to free enrolment and free education at any state school during the period beginning on their 5th birthday and ending on the 1 st of January after their 19th birthday. Students enrolled at an integrated school are entitled to free education on the same terms and conditions as students enrolled at other state schools: section 35(1) of the PSCI Act. However, the proprietors of an integrated school may require payment of attendance dues as a condition of enrolment and attendance: section 36 of the PSCI Act. The money received from attendance dues can be used only for the purpose of meeting debts, mortgages, liens, or other charges relating to the school premises or for improvements required under the integration agreement or for capital works required by the Minister of Education under section 40(2)(d) of the PSCI Act: section 36(3) of the PSCI Act. Attendance dues paid to the proprietors of integrated schools are subject to GST, being payments to secure the enrolment of a pupil in a school for which the proprietors provide the buildings and ensure the special character: Turakina Maori Girls College Board of Trustees v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,032. Each year parents or guardians of students enrolled at state schools may be asked by school Boards to pay a nominated amount to assist with meeting school costs. Schools may refer to these payments as “fees”. In the case of integrated schools such fees are in addition to attendance dues payable to the proprietors. The Ministry of Education issued an updated circular (Circular 1998/25) on 23 June 1998 which sets out the rights of Boards of Trustees, parents and students regarding the request for donations and other forms of payments in schools. The circular states that whatever terms are used to describe such payments, they are in fact donations and cannot be made compulsory. Schools may also ask for payments to cover a variety of items, including the cost of class trips, the cost of materials in practical subjects such as workshop technology, or fees for performances by visiting drama groups. These payments are commonly referred to as “activity fees”. The Ruling addresses the issue of whether such payments (however described, but commonly referred to as “school fees” or “activity fees”) are subject to GST. Legislation Under section 8 o f the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (“GST Act”), GST is charged on supplies (other than exempt supplies) made by a registered 3 person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity by reference to the value of the supply. The value of the supply is determined under section 10(2) of the GST Act, which states: (2) Subject to this section, the value of a supply of goods and services shall be such amount as, with the addition of the tax charged, is equal to the aggregate of, (a) To the extent that the consideration for the supply is consideration in money, the amount of the money: (b) To the extent that the consideration for the supply is not consideration in money, the open market value of that consideration. The definition of “consideration” in section 2 of the GST Act reads: Consideration, in relation to the supply of goods and services to any person, includes any payment made or any act or forbearance, whether or not voluntary, in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of, the supply of any goods and services, whether by that person or by any other person; but does not include any payment made by any person as an unconditional gift to any non-profit body: Application of the legislation Scheme of the Goods and Services Tax Ac t 1985 Under section 8(1) of the GST Act, GST is chargeable on the supply of goods and services by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person by reference to the value of the supply. The value of the supply is the consideration provided for the supply (including both monetary and non-monetary consideration): section 10(2) of the GST Act. GST is chargeable on payments made to the Board of Trustees of a state school that is a registered person if such payments are “consideration” as defined in the GST Act. Generally, the Board of Trustees of a state school will be a registered person as the activities of a school Board are a taxable activity for GST purposes. This is on the basis that every Board of Trustees of a state school is a Crown entity for the purposes of the Crown Entities Act 2004: section 7(1)(d). Under section 2 of the GST Act a Crown entity is a “public authority” and pursuant to section 6(1)(b) the term “taxable activity” includes the activities of any public authority. Section 5(6) of the GST Act deems that a school Board (as a public authority) is supplying goods and services where it brings to charge revenue received from the Crown for the supply of outputs (in this case, the supply of education services). For example, the operational funding received by school Boards from the Crown is “revenue from the Crown” and is the consideration for the supply of those services. Any other amounts received by a school Board will also be subject to GST where the amount is “consideration” for GST purposes. As discussed later in this commentary, a payment from a parent for services which a school Board has a statutory obligation to provide free of charge, is not consideration. However, a payment from a parent for other services, not integral to the supply of education services, is consideration. To make this distinction it is necessary to understand what is “consideration” and what education services a school Board has a statutory obligation to provide free of charge. 4 Consideration The sta t utory definition of “consideration” is wider than the contract law meaning of “consideration”. In The Trustee, Executors and Agency Co NZ Ltd v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,076, Chisholm J commented in respect of the definition of “consideration” (at p 13,085): In the context of this matter I am not persuaded that it is helpful or appropriate to reflect upon the ordinary meaning of the word. The statutory definition extends the ordinary meaning and it is the scope of the extended statutory definition which needs to be determined. The following principles can be drawn from the cases on the statutory definition of “consideration”.  Under the first part of the definition of “consideration”, it is irrelevant whether the payment is voluntary. No contract between the person making the supply and the person providing the consideration is necessary. The supply need not be made to the person who makes the payment: Turakina. In Turakina McKay J, referring to the definition, said (at p 10,036): It is clear from this definition that the supply of any service for consideration is part of a “taxable activity” under sec 6, even though it is to a person other than the person who provides the consideration. Likewise, the value of the supply is to be measured by the consideration, whether or not the consideration is provided by the person to whom the service is supplied. It is not necessary that there should be a contract between the supplier and the person providing the consideration, so long as the consideration is “in respect of, in response to or for the inducement of the supply”.  The supply also need not be made by the person who receives the payment. In the Trustee, Executors case Chisholm J said (at p 13,086): in my opinion the crucial factor is the strength of the connection between the payment and the supply. If there is sufficient proximity between the supply and payment to satisfy the requirement that the payment is “in respect of” (or “in response to, or for the inducement of”) the supply of goods then the payment qualifies as “consideration” notwithstanding that the payment is made to a third party .  Although the statutory definition of “consideration” is wider than the contract law meaning, not every payment a registered person receives is “consideration” for GST purposes. A distinction is drawn between a payment in respect of the payee’s taxable activity and a payment that is consideration for a supply of goods and services: Director-General of Social Welfare v De Morgan (1996) 17 NZTC 12,636.  For a payment to be “consideration” within the first part of the definition there must be a sufficient relationship between the making of the payment and the supply of goods or services. See CIR v NZ Refining Co Ltd (1997) 18 NZTC 13,187; Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,075; Taupo Ika Nui Body Corporate v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,147; Trustee, Executors. In NZ Refining Blanchard J said (at p 13,193): It is fundamental to the GST Act that the tax is levied on or in respect of supplies. It is not a tax on receipts or on turnover; it is a tax on transactions: CIR v Databank Systems Ltd. It is therefore necessary, as Mr Green submitted, to distinguish between supplies and the taxable activity (as defined in s 6) in the course of which they are 5 made. The definition in s 6 itself requires a nexus between a supply and consideration, as does s 10. The tax itself is levied by s 8 on a supply in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity and is “by reference to the value of that supply”. Section 10 provides that the value of a supply is “to the extent of the consideration for the supply” the amount of the money involved or the non-monetary open market value of the consideration. Already, before turning to the definition of “consideration”, it can be seen that, again, a linkage between supply and consideration is requisite to the imposition of the tax. The definition of “consideration”, though broad, cannot and does not dispense with that requirement. To constitute consideration for supply a payment must be made for that supply, though it need not be made to the supplier nor does the supply have to be made to the payer. There is a practical necessity for a sufficient connection between the payment and the supply. The mechanics of the legislation will otherwise make it impossible to collect the GST. \[Emphasis added.\]  An expectation that the payee will supply goods and services is not enough. It is not sufficient that the person who receives the payment carries out some activity that has the effect of benefiting either the person making the payment or some other person. It is also not sufficient that the payment enables the payee to carry on its activity. Hence, a payment by the Crown to a charitable trust the Crown had established to promote the economic development and well-being of the Chatham Islands’ inhabitants and the provision of services in the interests of the community was not consideration for GST purposes. The trustees were fulfilling their fiduciary duties under the trust, and the payment was not an inducement for the performance of services by the trustees: Chatham Islands.  The expressions “in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of” in the definition of “consideration” involves an element of reciprocity: Taupo Ika Nui Body Corporate; Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust.  It is necessary to consider the legal arrangements between the parties to determine whether a payment is consideration. In the Chatham Islands case, Blanchard J commented (at para 17): Although the linkage or nexus between a payment and the activity to which it gives rise may be very broad, it is still necessary to have regard to the legal form which is being employed: ... in taxation disputes the Court is concerned with the legal arrangements actually entered into ... not with the economic or other consequences of the arrangements. (C of IR v New Zealand Refining Co Ltd (1997) 18 NZTC 13,187 at p 13,192 citing Marac Life Assurance Ltd v C of IR \[1986\] 1 NZLR 694 at p 706 \[also reported as Marac Life Assurance Ltd v CIR; C IR v Marac Life Assurance Ltd (1986) 8 NZTC 5,086 at pp 5,097, 5,098\]. The tax being one on transactions, it is necessary to pay close attention to the legal nature of what has been done. Statutory arrangement relating to provision of education in state schools Role and accountability of school Bo ards In Maddever v Umawera School Board \[1993\] 2 NZLR 478 Williams J discussed the role of school Boards (at p 505). The \[Education Act 1989\] was based on Administering for Excellence: The Report of the Task Force to Review Education Administration (the Picot report (1988)) which 6 found that the existing administrative structure of the Education Act 1964 was over- centralised and overly complex. Its recommendations for change were largely implemented in the Education Act 1989, the title of which states that it is “An Act to reform the administration of education”. The statute brought about a marked devolution of decision making away from the Minister of Education so that schools became the basic unit of education administration. The primary mechanisms in the statute to achieve the legislative objectives were the novel concept of Boards of Trustees who were given by s 75 broad powers to manage schools and the idea of a school charter. Williams J then referred to the requirements relating to charters in section 61 of the Education Act and went on to say (at p 505): It is thus clear that the \[Education Act 1989\] contemplates that the board, in consultation with the Minister, should have a significant role in determining the school’s educational goals and a degree of independence in deciding how those goals should be achieved. While the Ministry of Education influences a school’s broad objectives through the application of the national educational guidelines established under s 60A ... and the Minister also has a power of approval of school charters, the guidance thus provided is in rather general terms. It is for the parents, staff and other persons to largely determine the distinctive character of the charter for a particular school. Williams J noted that the accountability of school Boards was achieved in several ways, including the requirement that Boards must adhere to their charters. The policy of the Education Act, therefore, is to decentralise the administration of education so that Boards of Trustees are responsible for the control and management of the schools. Although school Boards have considerable power to manage schools, such powers are subject to any enactment and the law of New Zealand: sections 72 and 75 of the Education Act. The Education Act provides for several ways to achieve accountability by Boards, including the obligation for Boards to adhere to their school charters (which must incorporate guidelines specified by the Minister of Education for the education services to be provided). What are education services? The term “education” is defined in the Co ncise Oxford Dictionary (11 th ed, 2006) as: the process of educating or being educated. > the theory and practice of teaching. > information about or training in a particular subject. It is possible to define the limits of the obligation of school Boards to provide education services (and, therefore, the scope of the entitlement to free education). The national education guidelines issued by the Minister of Education specify:  the outcomes desired from the school system;  the policy concerning teaching, learning, and assessment for the purposes of underpinning and giving direction to how curriculum and assessment responsibilities are to be managed;  the subjects in which education is to be provided (including areas and levels of knowledge). The Minister of Education specifies through national education guidelines or by regulation, in broad terms, the type, level, and standard of instruction or education to be provided in state schools. 7 Every school must have a school charter. The purpose of the charter is to establish the missions, aims, objectives, directions and targets of the school Board that will give effect to the Government’s national education guidelines and the Board’s priorities: section 61 of the Education Act. Although the Board has a significant role (through the preparation of the school’s charter) in determining the school’s aims and objectives and how these are to be achieved, the charter does not take effect if the Secretary for Education determines that it is inconsistent with the Education Act or the national administration guidelines: section 63A of the Education Act. The effect of a school charter is that it is an undertaking by the Board to the Minister of Education to take all reasonable steps to ensure the school is managed, organised, and administered for the purposes set out in the school charter and the school, its students, and community achieve the aims and objectives set out in the school charter: section 63 of the Education Act. Therefore, school Boards have an obligation to provide education (which complies with the requirements of the national education guidelines). New Zealand citizens and residents (or children who are otherwise not foreign students under the Education Act 1989) have a statutory right to free enrolment and free education at any state school: section 3 of the Education Act 1989. The provision of free education in state schools is supported by a grant by the Crown: section 79 of the Education Act. Ministry of Education circular The Mi nistry of Education (which is responsible for developing the national education guidelines and reviewing school charters) issued a circular (Circular 1998/25) to Boards of Trustees and principals of state and integrated schools on the rights of Boards, parents, and students in relation to requests for donations and other forms of payments in schools. The Ministry’s views are as follows.  No charge may be imposed for materials used in delivering the curriculum such as photocopying charges, charges for using musical instruments or computer facilities. This is because the right to free education implies that there should be no charge for materials used in the delivery of the curriculum. However, students may be charged for the hire of musical instruments owned by the school and used outside the basic delivery of the music curriculum. A charge may be made for costs involved in project work (such as the production of a T-shirt in a design class) if the student takes ownership of the finished product. Schools cannot, however, insist that the students take the finished product home.  No charge may be imposed for a student’s attendance at a school camp that is a compulsory part of the school’s curriculum or part of the content of a particular course at the school. The Ministry of Education stated in Circular 1998/25 that it considers: It is reasonable, however, for parents to be asked to contribute towards the cost of food and towards the costs which are involved in travel to and from the camp. In cases where parents are unwilling or unable to pay for a camp, teachers should try to provide work which will be an appropriate alternative to the camp. In cases where attendance at an outdoor or recreational activity is voluntary, parents should expect to meet the costs involved if they agree to their children’s participation.  Students should not be excluded from activities organised away from school as part of the curriculum (for example, field work in geography or biology and outdoor education programmes). The Ministry of Education stated in Circular 1998/25 that: 8 It is reasonable to expect parents to pay the travel costs which are inevitably connected with such activities, provided the staff have made every effort to minimise costs by ensuring that the activities are held as close to the school as possible. In cases where parents are unwilling or unable to pay for a trip, teachers should provide an alternative which would give the student an insight into the curriculum experience covered by the trip. To avoid misunderstanding which may lead to later problems with payment, boards should ensure that parents are made aware of the situation at the beginning of the year.  Boards cannot require a student to purchase a workbook that accompanies a course and in which answers are written. However, the Ministry of Education states in Circular 1998/25 that if, a student chooses to purchase a workbook, a charge may be imposed. The Ministry considers that workbooks lie between textbooks, which are provided free to students, and stationery, which students are expected to provide for themselves.  No charge may be imposed for programmes such as Reading Recovery, English for Speakers of Other Languages, special education services (speech therapy, behaviour or learning difficulties), or music tuition. In Circular 1998/25, the Ministry of Education states that resourcing is provided to schools for these programmes as part of the conventional curriculum or through the Ongoing Resource Scheme, Specialist Education Services, or Special Education Grant.  No charge may be imposed where secondary schools purchase tertiary level courses that they offer to senior students as part of the school programme. However, where the school merely facilitates a student’s enrolment in a tertiary course, the student would be enrolled only part time at the school, so would be required to pay the fees associated with the tertiary course.  A charge may be imposed for in-school activities at which attendance is voluntary such as performances by visiting drama groups.  Under the national education guidelines Boards are required to report on student progress and Boards are subject to the Official Information Act 1982 and Privacy Act 1993. Therefore, Boards are not entitled to withhold items such as students’ reports or leaving certificates to encourage parents to pay school donations or resolve unpaid debts for services the school has provided. The Commissioner accepts the Ministry of Education’s views as expressed in Circular 1998/25. The supply of services that are necessary to the supply of education services (in which a school Board has an obligation under its charter to provide instruction and in which participation by students is compulsory) are also within the scope of education services to which there is a statutory entitlement to receive free of charge. Services that are necessary to the supply of education services include the:  use of materials or goods necessary for delivering the curriculum (for example, the use of computers, photocopying charges for materials used in delivering the curriculum, and materials for practical subjects (such as woodwork));  right to participate in activities that are a compulsory part of the curriculum (for example, outdoor education camps that are part of the curriculum or fieldwork in geography or biology); and 9  provision of programmes such as Reading Recovery, English for Speakers of Other Languages, and special education services (for speech therapy or behavioural or learning difficulties). There is a distinction between the supplies described above and supplies made in circumstances where the supply made is not necessary to the supply of education services and students have a choice as to whether to receive the supply. Examples of such supplies include:  goods supplied where there is a very clear take-home component such as stationery or materials where a student is entitled to ownership of a finished product from practical classes such as woodwork. In such circumstances a school may not insist that the student take ownership of such goods; or  attendance at or participation in activities that is voluntary; or  transport to or from school activities (such as a camp) or food supplied at a camp. Whether sufficient relationship bet w een payment and a supply Pursuant to section 5(6) of the GST Act, where a school Board brings to charge as revenue amounts received from the Crown, such as operational grants for the supply of education services, that supply is deemed to be a supply for GST purposes. The amounts paid by the Crown are consideration, being a payment made in respect of the supply of services. The grant the Crown provides for the supply of education services in terms of the undertaking given to the Minister of Education may be taxed only once, but GST is chargeable on any separate supply the Board makes to parents: Case R34 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,190; Suzuki NZ Ltd v CIR (2001) 20 NZTC 17,096. In Suzuki the taxpayer had an obligation to repair defective vehicles under a warranty the taxpayer gave to its customers. In turn, the taxpayer had a warranty from its parent company (from which the taxpayer had purchased the vehicles) and had received payments from the parent company for carrying out the obligations of the parent company under the parent company’s warranty. There were two separate supplies: the supply of repair services under the warranty to customers and the supply of repair services to satisfy the obligations of the parent company under its warranty. As two separate supplies were made, the Court of Appeal did not accept that the Commissioner had sought to impose tax on the same supply (at para 24). The Court of Appeal said (at para 23): This is simply an instance of the common enough situation in which performance obligations under two separate contracts with different counter-parties overlap, so that performance of an obligation under one contract also happens to perform an obligation under another. In such case a supply can simultaneously occur for GST purposes under both contracts. There is a nexus in both cases between the performance and the consideration given by the other party. In some circumstances an existing statutory obligation may mean that there is an insufficient relationship between the payment and a supply. Two GST cases have related to a situation where the parties had statutory rights or obligations outside any contractual relationship there might have been between the parties: Television NZ Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,295; Case U1 (1999) 19 NZTC 9,001. 10 The Television NZ case concerned payments the Department of Maori Affairs made to the Broadcasting Council (whose assets and liabilities were later vested in Television New Zealand) for the purpose of a training scheme operated by the Broadcasting Council (and later Television New Zealand) for Maori trainees. The taxpayer’s argument was that a supply had not been made for the payment because in collaborating with the Department of Maori Affairs, the Broadcasting Council was merely discharging a statutory obligation to be a good employer (which included operating a personnel policy that complied with the principle of being a good employer, including recognition of the aims and aspirations of Maori, the employment requirements of Maori, and the need for greater involvement of Maori as employees of the Broadcasting Council). Tompkins J held that the Broadcasting Council had made a supply of services, being the provision of the training programme. There was a contractual obligation to provide the services, and the fact the supply was in accordance with the statutory obligations of the Broadcasting Council did not affect the conclusion that a supply was made under the contract. Under contract law, the performance of a statutory duty is not consideration, although the undertaking of something more than the bare discharge of the duty can be good consideration: Ward v Byham \[1956\] 2 All ER 318; Williams v Williams \[1957\] 1 All ER 305. The Television NZ case is consistent with that principle. There was reciprocity between the Broadcasting Council and Department of Maori Affairs. Payment would not have been made if the services had not been provided. The Broadcasting Council had discretion about how it would carry out its statutory obligation to be a good employer. The provision of training services under the agreement with the Department of Maori Affairs was in accordance with the Broadcasting Council’s statutory obligations, but there was no direct and specific statutory obligation to provide the training. In Case U1 the taxpayer had granted a lease under which the tenant had an obligation to pay rates (in addition to rental). The tenant was an “occupier” under the Rating Powers Act 1988 (being the lessee of a property under a lease for a term of not less than 12 months). Under that Act the occupier had primary liability to pay rates. The issue in Case U1 was whether the payment of rates formed part of the consideration for the lease. (Hence, the issue considered in Case U1 is slightly different from that considered in the Television NZ case.) Judge Barber considered and rejected the argument that the payment of rates was consideration (as the obligation contained in the lease to pay rates was “in respect of” the lease). He also rejected the argument that the payment of rates by the lessee was part of the inducement to persuade the landlord to lease the farm at the rental figure agreed on and was also part of the lessee’s response to the granting of the lease. Judge Barber considered that the lease merely recorded the legal position and was not consideration, as the payment of rates by the lessee satisfied the lessee’s own statutory obligation rather than an obligation of the lessor. (However, the payment of rates by a lessee under a lease would be part of the consideration for the lease, if the lessor was primarily liable for the payment of rates and the lessee had accepted an obligation under the lease to meet the lessor’s liability.) In the Television NZ case the statutory obligation was expressed in general terms. Ho wever, in Case U1 th e lessee had a specific statutory obligation to pay rates. 11 Payments made by parents or guardians may supplement the Crown grant to the school. School Boards have a considerable degree of autonomy as to how their funds are used. How the amounts paid are used is not the test of whether a supply is made for the payment: Chatham Islands. Turakina also confirms that how payments are used does not determine the nature of the supply for the payments. In Turakina the court (at p 10,037) rejected the taxpayers’ argument that because attendance dues were applied to meet mortgage obligations of the proprietors of the schools, the attendance dues were paid for exempt supplies (being the payment or collection of any amount of interest, principal, or any other amount in respect of a debt security in terms of sections 14(1)(a) (previously section 14(a)) and 3(1)(ka) of the GST Act). There is an expectation that amounts paid by parents will be used for the purposes of the school. However, the Commissioner considers that as the supply of education services is not conditional on payment being made by parents and as students have a statutory right to receive education services in a state school free of charge if they are “domestic students”, there is an insufficient relationship between the payments and the supply of education services to which there is a statutory entitlement. The Commissioner also considers that when the payments made by parents are not made for any particular purpose and the school Boards do not undertake any obligations in return for payment, there is not a sufficient relationship between the payment and any other supply: Chatham Islands. Some school Boards may attempt to collect amounts unpaid by withholding items, for example, reports, leaving certificates, or school magazines, until payment is made. It is possible to argue that although school Boards have an obligation to the Minister of Education to supply education services, if there is a threat to withhold education services unless payment is made, there is a separate obligation to parents to supply education services under a separate transaction with the parents. On that basis it could be argued that the payments are consideration, being a payment for the inducement of the supply of education services. The relationship between the pupils and the school Board is based at least partly on the Education Act: Grant v Victoria University of Wellington 13 November 1997, Ellis J, HC Wellington CP312/96; A-G v Daniels \[2002\] 2 NZLR 742. There is a statutory right to free education. School Boards have a corresponding statutory obligation to provide education in state schools free of charge. Although Boards may represent that education services would not be supplied if payment is not made, the true legal nature of the transaction is that the Board cannot require payment for the supply of education services as students have a statutory entitlement to receive education free of charge. In the Chatham Islands case Tipping J commented (at para 25): GST is payable on transactions. When deciding whether a particular transaction is of a kind which attracts GST, it is important to analyse carefully its legal characteristics. A person may waive a statutory benefit conferred on that person under a statute if the waiver does not infringe some public right or public policy: Bowmaker Ltd v Tabor \[1941\] 2 All ER 72; Reckitt & Colman (NZ) Ltd v Taxation Board of Review \[1966\] NZLR 1032. To determine whether a statutory right to free education can be waived, it is appropriate to consider whether the purpose of the legislation under which the right is conferred would be infringed by the waiver or contracting out: Johnson v Moreton \[1978\] 3 All ER 37; Lieberman v Morris (1944)69 CLR 69. 12 Sections 20 and 25 of the Education Act require all New Zealand citizens and residents between the ages of 6 and 16 to be enrolled at a state-registered school and to attend the school. Private schools must satisfy requirements as to the suitability of premises, staffing, equipment, and curriculum and, in order to be registered, must give students a tuition no lower in standard than that of tuition given to students enrolled at state schools: section 35A of the Education Act. The purpose of the PSCI Act was to enable private schools, originally established to provide education of a special character, to be brought within the state system of education as integrated schools. As with other schools in the state system, the Board of a private integrated school is responsible for providing education free of charge to its pupils. Parents can choose to have their children educated at non-state schools. It could be argued that in that sense the statutory entitlement to free education can be waived. However, the public policy objective expressed in the Education Act is that all children are to receive education of a minimum standard. The provision of public funding for education and the entitlement to free education are intended to ensure that cost is not a barrier to access to education. That free education is provided for a public purpose is confirmed by the 1993 statement of national education goals (New Zealand Gazette No 58, 29 April 1993), which states: Education is at the core of our nation’s efforts to achieve economic and social progress. In recognition of the fundamental importance of education, the Government sets the following goals for the education system of New Zealand. 1. The highest standards of achievement, through programmes which enable all students to realise their full potential as individuals, and to develop the values needed to become full members of New Zealand’s society. 2. Equality of educational opportunity for all New Zealanders, by identifying and removing barriers to achievement ... ... 6. Excellence achieved through the establishment of clear learning objectives, monitoring student performance against those objectives, and programmes to meet individual need. \[Emphasis added.\] Therefore, it can be argued that the right to free education is not solely a private right. If Boards were able to impose a requirement for the payment of “fees” and individual parents were able to waive the right to free education, the purpose of the legislation would be infringed. Although school Boards have wide discretion to manage and control schools, such powers cannot be exercised in a manner inconsistent with a statutory provision: sections 72 and 75 of the Education Act. The Commissioner’s view is that school Boards do not have the power to require the payment as a condition of the provision of education or any other services or items that are properly regarded as being integral to the supply of education to which there is a statutory entitlement. The Commissioner acknowledges that, given that an illegal activity can be a taxable activity and given that the definition of “consideration” does not require a contract to exist between the supplier and recipient for a payment to be consideration, payment need not be enforceable for the payment to be consideration. Therefore, the fact the transaction is invalid because the parties do not have the power to enter into a transaction, does not mean the transaction would not be recognised for GST purposes: C & E Commrs v Oliver \[1980\] 1 All ER 353. However, the statutory entitlement to education cannot be altered by a representation that education services are conditional on the payment of “fees”. 13 Therefore, amounts paid to the Board of Trustees of a state school are not consideration for the supply of education services, even if there were a representation that reports or other information relating to the assessment of students would be withheld unless payment was made (albeit contrary to the legal position). However, if school Boards supplied other goods or services not integral to the supply of education services on the basis that the supply was conditional on payment being made, the payment would be consideration for that supply. If the payment made includes a charge for an item that is not integral to the supply of education services, such as a school magazine, there will be a case for apportionment of the payment. Section 10(18) of the GST Act states: Where a taxable supply is not the only matter to which a consideration relates, the supply shall be deemed to be for such part of the consideration as is properly attributable to it. Conclusion Amounts pa id by parents are not consideration for the supply of education services to which there is a statutory entitlement, for the following reasons:  The definition of consideration under the GST Act is not the same as the contract law definition. A contract is not required between parents and school Boards for the payments to be consideration for GST purposes: Turakina. However, for the payments to be consideration for a supply, there must be a sufficient relationship between payments and a supply: NZ Refining; Chatham Islands; Suzuki; Trustee, Executors.  As there is a statutory right to free education, in circumstances where the amounts are not paid for any particular purpose or for the Board undertaking any specific obligation there is not a sufficient connection between the payments and a supply (whether of education services or a supply of a different nature). This is so even though there is an expectation that the payments would be used for the Board’s taxable activity: Chatham Islands; NZ Refining. The fact the amounts are used to pay for things not covered by the government grant does not establish that they are paid for services of a particular nature: Turakina; Chatham Islands.  It is possible to argue that where a representation is made that education services would be withheld if payment is not made, the payments would be made “in respect of, in response to or for the inducement of” the supply of education services. However, as there is a statutory entitlement to free education in state schools, the true legal position is that education services would be provided whether or not payment was made. Therefore, there would not be a sufficient connection between the payment of “fees” and the supply of education services to which there is a statutory entitlement.  GST consequences are determined on the basis of the legal character of the transaction: Chatham Islands. The relationship between parents and school Boards is based on the Education Act, which requires Boards of state schools to provide education and entitles students to free enrolment and education at state schools, and the PSCI Act, which entitles students enrolled at integrated schools to free education on the same terms and conditions as in state schools. The true legal nature of the arrangement between parents and the school Board is that school Boards have a statutory obligation to provide free education and students have a right to 14 free education. The supply of education services is not conditional on the payment being made, and payment is not required for the supply of education services.  A statutory right conferred on a person may be waived only if the waiver does not infringe the purpose of the legislation: Bowmaker Ltd v Tabor; Reckitt & Colman (NZ) Ltd v Taxation Board of Review; Johnson v Moreton; Lieberman v Morris. The purpose of the Education Act is that all children should receive education of a minimum standard, and there should be no barriers to access to such education. That purpose would be infringed by a waiver of the right to free education and an ability of school Boards to require the payment of “fees” for education.  The scope of the obligation to provide education services is defined by the national education guidelines and by the school’s charter (into which the guidelines are incorporated). The supply of reports and other information relating to the assessment of students is integral to the supply of education services, and such information must be supplied free. The amounts would not be consideration, even if there was a representation that the supply of such information would be withheld unless payment was made (albeit contrary to the legal position). Therefore, GST is not payable on amounts paid for the purpose of a general fund to assist the schools with meeting costs or for “activity fees” for activities that are an integral part of the course requirements in which the school has an obligation to provide instruction and in which participation by pupils is compulsory. However, if other services not integral to the supply of education services are supplied on the basis that the supply is conditional on payment being made, the payment will be consideration for that supply. If a separate charge is not made for such an item, apportionment may apply: section 10(18) of the GST Act. For payments made by parents or guardians to schools to be consideration, it must be possible to identify a supply of goods or services other than the supply of education services that the schools must supply in terms of their charters. The issues that need to be considered are:  whether what is provided to students is within the scope of the statutory entitlement to education services; and  if the supply made is outside the scope of the statutory entitlement, whether there is a sufficient relationship between the supply and the payment. Examples It i s assumed for the purposes of the following examples that the students are either New Zealand citizens or New Zealand residents. Example 1 Ea ch year the Board of Trustees of a state school asks parents or guardians of students enrolled at the school to pay a nominated amount to assist with meeting school costs. The Board is not required to use the fee for any particular purpose, and the fee is paid for the general purposes of the school. The only benefits received by pupils are facilities for common use, such as the school library, swimming pool, or computer facilities. 15 16 The payment is not consideration for the supply of education services as there is a statutory entitlement for students to receive education free of charge. As the payment is received for the general purposes of the school and the Board of Trustees does not undertake any obligation to supply any goods or services, such payments are not consideration for a supply of a different nature by the Board. Therefore, GST is not chargeable on the payments. Example 2 Students at a state school are required to pay a fee for materials used in a clothing class. The students are not required to take ownership of the completed item but will not be entitled to ownership unless payment is made. A charge cannot be made for the use of materials necessary for the delivery of education services to which there is a statutory entitlement, but a charge can be made for the right to ownership of an item completed using such materials. The fee is not consideration for the use of the materials as the use of such materials is necessary for the provision of instruction in the subject. However, if a student elects to take ownership of the completed item, the fee is consideration for the right to ownership of the item and the Board is liable to account for GST on the fee. Example 3 In addi ti on to the general school donation, parents of students at a state school are asked to pay photocopying charges for materials (such as articles, extracts from textbooks, or homework exercises) used in teaching, even though such materials should be provided free of charge. The payment is not consideration. It is implicit in the right to free education that there should be no charge for the cost of materials used in the delivery of the curriculum. The provision of photocopied materials necessary for teaching is integral to the supply of education services. GST is not chargeable on the payment. However, if a student chooses to purchase a photocopy of an optional workbook or magazine produced by students that the student may retain, the payment made would be consideration for the supply of that item and GST would be chargeable on the payment. Example 4 A state school hires a bus to transport students on a field trip to carry out activities that are part of the geography curriculum. Students are asked to pay an amount to cover the cost of hiring the bus. The payment does not relate to the right to participate in the activities carried out on the field trip. Although transport is necessary to enable students to receive instruction in the subject, the supply of transport is not integral to the supply of education. In the same way, transport to the school premises does not constitute education services, although a student must travel to the school in order to receive education services. The payment is consideration for the supply of transport and GST is chargeable on the payment. Example 5 Students at a state school are asked to make a payment to cover the costs of food provided at a school camp and transport to the camp site. Attendance at the camp is a compulsory part of the school’s curriculum. The payment does not relate to the right to participate in activities at the camp. The payment is consideration for the supply of food and transport and GST is chargeable on the payment. (The school may waive payment for food and transport by some students but this does not mean that a payment for food and transport made by other students is not made for the supply of food and transport.) Example 6 A state school asks students to pay for stationery and a workbook that students are entitled to keep. The payment is made for the supply of the stationery and the work book and is consideration. Therefore, GST is chargeable on the payment. Example 7 A drama gr oup p uts on a performance at a state school. Attendance by students is voluntary but if students wish to attend a charge is payable. The payment is consideration for the right to attend the performance and GST is chargeable on the payment. Example 8 The Board o f Trustees of a state school asks parents or guardians of students enrolled at the school to make a single payment in advance, being the estimated cost of future items such as transport for class trips, workshop technology, and visiting drama groups. These activities are not integral to the supply of education which the school has a statutory obligation to provide. The payment is made for the right to participate in the activities to which the payment relates or for the right to ownership of an item. The entitlement of students to these rights is conditional on payment being made and GST is chargeable on the payment. 17
FEDERAL INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS ACT (FICA) – FRINGE BENEFIT TAX (FBT) LIABILITY P UBLIC RULING - BR Pub 09/02 Note (not part of ruling): The key issue considered by this ruling is whether employer contributions made by an American employer, to the United States Federal Government in accordance with the US Federal Insurance Contribution Act, give rise to fringe benefit tax under the 2007 Income Tax Act. The conclusion is that such contributions do not give rise to fringe benefit tax. This ruling replaces Public Ruling BR Pub 07/02 which was published in Tax Information Bulletin Volume 19, No 3 (April 2007). BR Pub 07/02 applies until 30 June 2009 and is a reissue of Pub 01/05 published in Tax Information Bulletin Volume 13, No 7 (July 2001). This new ruling is essentially the same as the previous ruling. However, the new ruling has been updated and applies the Income Tax Act 2007, which came into force on 1 April 2008, instead of the equivalent provisions in the Income Tax Act 2004. The changes between the provisions in the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007 do not affect the conclusions previously reached. BR Pub 09/02 applies for an indefinite period beginning on 1 July 2009. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. T axation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. T his Ruling applies in respect of sections CX 13, CX 14 and CX 37. T he Arrangement to which this Ruling applies T he Arrangement is the deduction of contributions from wages payable to employees and the payment of these contributions, together with employer contributions, to the United States Federal Government in accordance with the Federal Insurance Contribution Act (“FICA”), by an “American employer” (as defined in FICA) who is required to do so because the employer employs a citizen or citizens of the United States of America. H ow the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement T he Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •E mployer contributions paid under FICA do not give rise to a “fringe benefit” under section CX 13 as the contributions are not made for the benefit of employees. •E mployer contributions paid under FICA do not give rise to a “fringe benefit” under section CX 14. As trust funds established for the purpose of paying disability benefits or Medicare and funded by contributions under FICA were not established for the benefit of employees and have not been approved by the Commissioner, they are no t “ sickness, accident or death benefit funds” as defined in section YA 1. •E mployer contributions paid under FICA do not give rise to an “unclassified benefit” in terms of section CX 37 as a benefit is not provided by employers in connection with 2 the employment of employees through the payment of employer contributions under FICA. •E mployee contributions required to be deducted from wages and paid under FICA do not give rise to an “unclassified benefit” as such contributions represent part of the assessable income of employees and are expressly excluded from the definition of “fringe benefit” by section CX 4. T herefore, payments required under FICA are not subject to fringe benefit tax (“FBT”). T he period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for an indefinite period beginning on 1 July 2009. T his Ruling is signed by me on the 30 th day of April 2009. S usan Price Director, Public Rulings 3 C OMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 09/02 T his commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 09/02 (“the Ruling”). Ba ckground The Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) is the part of the US Internal Revenue Code under which employers and employees are required to make payments for the funding of social security benefits. In some circumstances an employer who employs an employee to provide services in New Zealand is required to comply with obligations under the FICA legislation. FICA applies when an “American employer” pays wages for services performed as an employee by a US citizen outside the US: sections 3101 and 3111 and the definition of “employment” in section 3121 Internal Revenue Code. “American employer” means the US Government or its instruments, residents of the US or companies that are organised under the laws of the US. I f FICA applies, employers must make deductions from wages payable to an employee in respect of Old-Age Survivors and Disability Insurance (“OASDI”) and Hospital Insurance (known as “Medicare”), and must pay the deductions to the Internal Revenue Service. In addition, employers are required to make payments for OASDI and Medicare (employer contributions) at the same rate. The current rate in respect of OASDI is 6.2 percent and in respect of Medicare the rate is 1.45 percent. An employer who fails to make the required payments or fails to make the payments on time is liable for a penalty. Under FICA amounts deducted from wages payable to employees are deemed to have been paid to employees at the time of deduction (Internal Revenue Code Title 26 USC, Chapter 21, section 3123). FICA does not provide for recovery of OASDI or Medicare payments imposed on employees from an employee where the employer has failed to make deductions. Payments collected under FICA are paid into the US Treasury’s General Fund and are appropriated to three separate funds: the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund; the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund; and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund. Amounts held in these funds are not held for any particular individual. A person must be a US citizen or legally resident in the US to be entitled to social security benefits (Public Law 104-193; Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996). Under the US social security legislation (Public Health and Welfare Code, 42 USC Chapter 7) a person must hold not less than 40 credits to be entitled to a retirement benefit. The amount needed to gain a credit changes from year to year. For the year 2009 a credit is gained for every quarter in which an employee earns more than $1090 from employment. No more than four credits can be gained in respect of a year. The minimum age to qualify for a retirement benefit depends on when a person was born. However, a person could qualify for a disability benefit with fewer credits, depending on their age. To be entitled to a disability benefit: 4 •A person must have a medical condition that meets the definition of “disability” in the social security legislation; and •2 0 of the 40 credits required to qualify for a disability benefit must have been earned in the 10 years ending in the year in which the person became disabled. If a person who is covered by social security dies, their surviving spouse or dependent children can receive a survivors benefit. The right to retirement, survivors and disability benefits cannot be assigned or transferred. The amount of the monthly benefit paid depends on the person’s earnings during the person’s working life and the age at which the person retires. The amount of the benefit is calculated according to a formula in the legislation. People aged 65 or older are entitled to receive Medicare benefits if they: •Receive a social security benefit; •Have worked long enough to be eligible for a social security benefi t; •Would be entitled to a social security benefit based on their spouse’s work record and their spouse is aged at least 62; o r •H ave worked long enough in a federal, state or local government job to be insured fo r M edicare. People aged under 65 who receive disability benefits or who have permanent kidney failure may qualify for Medicare. L egislation “Fringe benefit” is defined in section CX 2(1) as follows: A fringe benefit is a benefit that— (a)i s provided by an employer to an employee in connection with their employment; and (b)e ither— (i)a rises in a way described in any of sections CX 6, CX 9, CX 10, or CX 12 to CX 16; or (ii)i s an unclassified benefit; and (c)i s not a benefit excluded from being a fringe benefit by any provision of this subpart. Se ction CX 13 provides: (1)A fringe benefit arises when an employer contributes to a superannuation scheme for the benefit of an employee . (2)This section does not apply if the contribution is an employer’s superannuation contribution. Se ction CX 14 provides: A fringe benefit arises when an employer makes a contribution for the benefit of an employee to a sickness, accident, or death benefit fund. “Unclassified benefit” is defined in section CX 37 as follows: 5 Unclassified benefit means a fringe benefit that arises if an employer provides an employee with a benefit in connection with their employment that is— (a)not a benefit referred to in any of sections CX 6 to CX 16; and (b)no t a benefit excluded under this subpart. Se ction CX 4 provides: To the extent to which a benefit that an employer provides to an employee in connection with their employment is assessable income, the benefit is not a fringe benefit. “Superannuation scheme” is defined in section YA 1 as follows: superannuation scheme— (a)m eans— (i)a trust or unit trust established by its trust deed mainly for the purposes of providing retirement benefits to beneficiaries who are natural persons or paying benefits to superannuation funds; or (ii)(r epealed) (iii)a company that is not a unit trust, is not resident in New Zealand, and is established mainly for the purpose of providing retirement benefits to members or relatives of members who are natural persons; or (iv)a n arrangement constituted under an Act of the Parliament of New Zealand, other than the Social Security Act 1964, mainly for the purpose of providing retirement benefits to natural persons; or (v)a n arrangement constituted under the legislation of a country, territory, state, or local authority outside New Zealand mainly for the purpose of providing retireme nt b enefits to natural persons; and (b)f or a superannuation scheme that is a trust, means the trustees of the scheme. T he definition of “arrangement” in section YA 1 reads as follows: Arrangement means an agreement, contract, plan or understanding, whether enforceable or unenforceable, including all steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect. The definition of “sickness, accident or death benefit fund” in section YA 1 reads as follows: sickness, accident, or death benefit fund means a sickness, accident, or death benefit fund that is — (a)established for the benefit of— (i)em ployees; or (ii)t he members of an incorporated society; or (iii)the surviving spouses and dependants of those employees or members; and (b)a pproved by the Commissioner A pplication of the legislation 6 Liability for FBT Whether an employer is required to pay fringe benefit tax (FBT) in respect of either employer or employee contributions made under FICA depends on whether the employer has provided a “fringe benefit” (section RD 26(1)). There will be a “fringe benefit” where: •A benefit arises in a way described in any of section CX 6, section CX 9, section CX 10 or sections CX 12 to CX 16 or a benefit of any other type is provided by an employe r t o an employee in connection with their employment (an “unclassified benefit”); an d •The benefit is not excluded from being a fringe benefit by any provision of subpart CX. I n Australian cases, in the FBT context, the courts have considered that a fringe benefit will not be provided unless there is a link between the benefit and a particular employee: see Essenbourne Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (2002) ATC 5201; Walstern v Commissioner of Taxation 2003 ATC 5076; Cameron Brae Pty Ltd v FCT 2006 ATC 4433. The Commissioner considers that this principle also applies in the New Zealand context. As with the Australian legislation, the wording of the legislation suggests that it contemplates a benefit provided to a particular employee. The definition of “fringe benefit” in section CX 2(1) refers to “a benefit that is provided by an employer to an employee in connection with their employment”. Sections CX 13 and CX 14 also refer to “a contribution for the benefit of an employee”. As with the Australian legislation, under the valuation provisions any payment made by the employee is to be taken into account in determining the taxable value of the fringe benefit. The need for a link between the benefit and an employee is consistent with the purpose of the FBT provisions. FBT was intended to apply to non-cash remuneration provided to an employee and although liability for FBT is imposed on the employer, the theoretical basis for the imposition of FBT is that it is payable in respect of amounts that are essentially (or would be) income of an employee. C ontributions to superannuation scheme: section CX 13 Under section CX 13 a fringe benefit arises when an employer makes a contribution to a superannuation scheme (other than an employer’s superannuation contribution) for the benefit of an employee. The definition of “superannuation scheme” in section YA 1 includes an arrangement constituted under the legislation of a country, territory, state or local authority outside New Zealand mainly for the purpose of providing retirement benefits to natural persons (paragraph (a)(v) of the definition). S uperannuation scheme T he definition of “superannuation scheme” specifically includes an arrangement constituted under legislation. FICA requires employer and employee contributions to fund social security benefits, including retirement benefits. The US social security legislation contains the provisions relating to eligibility for retirement benefits and the payment of retirement benefits. These two pieces of legislation together establish a system for the funding and payment of social security benefits, including retirement benefits. Therefore, there is an arrangement that is constituted under US legislation (the US social security legislation and FICA). 7 The Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund were established under US Code Title 42 Public Health and Welfare Code, Chapter 7 Social Security, Subchapter II, section 401). Under the US social security legislation an amount equal to 100 percent of the amount collected from employees and employers in respect of OASDI is appropriated to those trust funds (42 USC, section 401). Monthly retirement benefits and survivors benefits are paid out of the Federal Old- Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and benefits to disabled workers and their families are paid out of the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund. The social security legislation sets out the conditions for entitlement to retirement benefits and provides for the payment of retirement benefits (42 USC, section 402). For paragraph (a)(v) of the definition of “superannuation scheme” to apply, the arrangement must be mainly for the purpose of providing retirement benefits. Payments under FICA are appropriated to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and are to be used for the purpose of funding retirement benefits. Survivors’ benefits are also paid out of the fund to the widows, widowers and children of people who would have been entitled to receive a retirement benefit (that is, benefits could be paid out of the trust fund to people who have not reached retirement age). However, such people would be entitled to receive a benefit only if a person who qualifies for a retirement benefit has died. The principal object of creating the trust fund is to provide for the payment of retirement benefits. FICA is part of a legislative scheme for the provision of social security benefits by the US Federal Government, which is the equivalent of provision of benefits under the New Zealand Social Security Act 1964. In Roe v Social Security Commission (10 April 1987) (unreported, High Court, Wellington, M 270/86, Davison CJ) the plaintiff was the recipient of a social security retirement benefit paid by the US Government. The issue was whether the benefit formed part of a programme providing benefits, pensions or periodical allowances for any of the contingencies for which benefits, pensions or allowances could be paid under the New Zealand Social Security Act. Davison CJ commented: The US retirement benefit is clearly on the evidence a benefit paid by the US Government of the same type as a NZ national superannuation benefit. Both are paid by the respective Governments and both are part and parcel of programmes for assistance to age-related beneficiaries. (p. 8) The Commissioner considers that payments made under FICA and appropriated to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund are paid under an arrangement constituted under US legislation mainly for the purpose of providing retirement benefits to natural persons. Therefore, there is a superannuation scheme that is constituted under the social security legislation and FICA in terms of paragraph (a)(v) of the definition of “superannuation scheme”. This differs from the view expressed in the Commissioner’s first ruling on this issue (BR Pub 01/05). However, for section CX 13 to apply, payments made by employers under FICA must be contributions for the benefit of an employee. W hether contributions are for the benefit of employees Payments employers are required to make under section 3111(a) of FICA are tax. Section 3111(a) imposes on every employer “an excise tax, with respect to having individuals in his employ”. An excise tax is “a tax upon an activity” (CCH Federal Tax Guide Reports paragraph 21,001); in this case a tax imposed in respect of employment (Helvering v Davis 57 SC 904). 8 However, a payment by an employer could be a contribution although the employer has a statutory obligation to make the payment. In Case M9 (1990) 12 NZTC 2069 it was held that the predecessor of section CX 13 applied to contributions made by a local authority to the National Provident Fund, although the employer did not have a choice about making the contributions. Judge Bathgate considered that the focus of the FBT legislation was whether the contributions could be regarded as a benefit from the employees’ point of view. Judge Bathgate said: The objector’s claim that the superannuation payments by the objector on behalf of its employees compulsorily paid by it under the National Provident Fund Act, are not benefits because it had no choice as to whether to make the payments is to an extent understandable, from the employer’s point of view. A benefit is often regarded as being given voluntarily, rather than compulsorily. A benefit may however be given under compulsion in some circumstances — Yates v Starkey \[1951\] 1 All ER 732. From the employees’ point of view, and after all Pt XB of the Income Tax Act is only concerned with benefits received by employees, albeit from employers, the contributions to the superannuation fund can be considered as a benefit. (p. 2073) In Yates v Starkey, referred to by Judge Bathgate, the Court of Appeal held that a person who had been ordered by the court to pay his wife an annual amount in trust for his children had provided funds for the purpose of the settlement of a trust. Jenkins LJ commented: I do not agree that the words “has provided” necessarily connote an exercise of free will. It seems to me that the taxpayer here if asked “Who is providing for the maintenance for your children?” could with perfect accuracy have replied “I am doing so under an order of the court”. (p. 479) However, for section CX 13 to apply the contribution must be for the benefit of an employee. In Case M9, although the employer was required by the National Provident Fund Act to make contributions, the objective of the contributions was to provide a benefit to employees under the National Provident Fund. In NZI Bank Ltd v Euro-National Corporation Ltd \[1992\] NZLR 528 Richardson J made the following comments in respect of the interpretation of the phrase “for the benefit of employees”: It is not sufficient to satisfy para (b) that the shares are to be held on trust for employees. The shares must be held “for the benefit” of employees. “For” in that context means with the object and purpose of benefiting employees and the “benefit” to employees must be discernible and real. As in the case of the exercise of trustees’ powers to make advances for a person’s benefit, it must confer an advantage which can be enjoyed by employees. It must be of value to employees. An arrangement does not qualify as being “for the benefit of employees” unless employees actually stand to benefit. (p. 544) Hence, for a contribution to be “for the benefit of an employee” in terms of section CX 13, the contribution must be made for the purpose of benefiting the employee and the contribution must provide something of real value to the employee. Employer contributions required under FICA are not held in trust for any employee. The US Social Security system for the payment of retirement benefits is a pay-as -you-go scheme under which current employer and employee contributions are used to fund the payment of retirement benefits to current recipients of retirement benefits. Neither employer nor employee contributions are allocated to, or held for, individual employees. Payments that an employer must make under FICA are not attributable to any particular employee. Excise tax is calculated on the total wages paid by the employer. Employees are not entitled to receive a refund of payments made either by employers or employees under FICA. The entitlement of employees to a retirement benefit does not depend on whether the employer has paid the excise tax imposed on the employer under FICA. To 9 qualify for a retirement benefit, a person must be a “fully insured individual” (42 USC, section 402(a)(1)). To be a “fully insured individual” a person must hold sufficient credits (that is, a minimum of 40 credits). The number of credits earned is based on the amount of the employees’ earnings over their working life and not on the payment of employer contributions. Payments made by employers under FICA also do not affect the amount of the benefit payable. The amount of the retirement benefit is based on average earnings over a person’s working life, indexed to account for changes in average wages. Employees cannot transfer or assign their right to any future benefit (42 USC, section 407). Flemming v Nestor 363 US 603 establishes that a person who makes payments under FICA does not as a consequence acquire a right to a benefit analogous to a property right. The Commissioner considers that payments of excise tax under FICA are not made by employers for the benefit of any particular employee as: •Employee contributions are not held in trust for any individual employee; •Employees are not entitled to receive any part of the contributions made by employers; •Employees do not obtain the right to a retirement benefit as a consequence of the payments made by employers; an d •T he payment of employer contributions by employers does not affect the amount of the benefit payable to employees. T herefore, such payments do not give rise to a fringe benefit in terms of section CX 13. Contributions to sickness, accident or death benefit fund: section CX 14 Under section CX 14 a fringe benefit arises when an employer makes a contribution for the benefit of an employee to a sickness, an accident or a death benefit fund. The definition of “sickness, accident, or death benefit fund” in section YA 1 refers to a sickness, an accident, or a death fund that is: •Established for the benefit of employees, the members of an incorporated society, o r th e surviving spouses and dependants of those employees; and •Approved by the Commissioner. Under the US social security legislation separate funds are established for the payment of disability benefits and Medicare (the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund and the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund). Self-employed people can also earn credits so that they are entitled to receive disability benefits or Medicare. The funds are not limited to the employees of a particular employer or to employees in general. They were established to fund the payment of government-provided disability benefits and hospital and medical benefits that are available to all people who earn sufficient credits to qualify for benefits and satisfy the other conditions set out in the US legislation. Payments by employers do not directly affect employees’ entitlement to disability benefits or Medicare. Whether the employer pays employer contributions does not affect the employees’ entitlement to disability benefits or Medicare or the amount of the benefit. The Commissioner considers that neither the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund nor the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund was established for the benefit of employees. The 10 funds were not established for the benefit of a particular employer’s employees and were not established for the benefit of employees alone. Employees do not obtain a right to receive Medicare or disability benefits as a consequence of the payments made by their employer. To be a sickness, an accident or a death fund within the statutory definition, a fund must also be approved by the Commissioner. As the Commissioner has not approved either the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund or the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, the funds cannot be sickness, accident or death benefit funds for the purpose of section CX 14. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that a benefit does not arise in terms of section CX 14 as a consequence of payments required to be made by employers in respect of the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund or the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund under FICA as these funds are not sickness, accident or death funds as defined in section YA 1. Unclassified benefit: section CX 37 The definition of “unclassified benefit” in section CX 37 refers to a benefit an employer provides to an employee “in connection with their employment” other than the benefits referred to in any of sections CX 6 to CX 16. “ Benefit” is not defined for FBT purposes. Therefore, the ordinary meaning of “benefit” applies. In CIR v Dick (2001) 20 NZTC 17,396 Glazebrook J commented as follows on the meaning of “benefit”: \[48\]The New Shorter Oxford Dictionary (1993 ed) defines benefit (in relevant part) as: a favour, gift, a benefaction, an advantage, a good, pecuniary profit. Likewise the definition of advantage is: a favouring circumstance, something which gives one a better position, benefit. Looking at the dictionary meaning of those words it would appear that something may not be a benefit or advantage if it has been acquired through the provision of services or goods at market value. This, therefore, is i n contrast to the definition of income. T he Commissioner considers that in the FBT context a “benefit” is an advantage, a material acquisition that confers an economic benefit on an employee. As outlined in “QB0043 The meaning of ‘benefit’ for FBT purposes” (published in Taxation Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 2 (March 2006)), in considering whether a benefit has been provided to an employee it is not relevant that the employee made a payment for what is provided. For there to be a “fringe benefit”, the benefit must be provided by an employer to an employee in connection with their employment. The meaning of the phrase “in connection with” was considered in Claremont Petroleum NL v Cummings (1992) 110 ALR 239. Wilcox J said: The phrase “in connection” is one of wide import, as I had occasion to observe in a different context in Our Town FM Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (1987) 16 FCR 465 at 479-80; 77 ALR 577 at 591-592: The words “in connection with”.... do not necessarily require a causal relationship between two things: see Commissioner for Superannuation v Miller (1985) FCR 153 at 154, 160, 163; 63 ALR 237 at 238, 244, 247. They may be used to describe a relationship with a contemplated future event, see Koppen v Commissioner for Community Relations (1986) 11 FCR 360 at 364; 67 ALR 215; Johnson v Johnson \[1952\] P47 at 50-1. In the latter case the United Kingdom Court of Appeal applied a decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal, Re Nanaimo Community Hotel Ltd \[1945\] 3 DLR 225, in which the question was whether a particular court, which was given “jurisdiction to hear and determine all questions that may arise in connection with any assessment made under this Act”, had jurisdiction to deal with a matter which preceded the issue of an assessment. The trial judge held that it did, that 11 the phrase “in connection with” covered matters leading up to, or which might lead up to an assessment. He said: “One of the very generally accepted meanings of ‘connection’ is ‘relation between things one of which is bound up with or involved in another’, or again ‘having to do with’. The words include matters occurring prior to as well as subsequent to or consequent upon so long as they are related to the principal thing. The phrase ‘having to do with’ perhaps gives as good a suggestion of the meaning as could be had.” This statement was upheld on appeal. (p 280) Ha rdie Boys J made the following comments on the meaning of “in connection with” in Strachan v Marriott \[1995\] 3 NZLR 272: “In connection with” may signify no more than a relationship between one thing and another. The expression does not necessarily require that it be a causal relationship: Our Town FM Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (1987) 16 FCR 465, 479 per Wilcox J. But, as Davies J warned in Hatfield v Health Insurance Commission (1987) 15 FCR 487, at p 491: Expressions such as ‘relating to’, ‘in relation to’, ‘in connection with’ and ‘in respect of’ are commonly found in legislation but invariably raise problems of statutory interpretation. They are terms which fluctuate in operation from statute to statute . ... The terms may have a very wide operation but they do not usually carry the widest possible ambit, for they are subject to the context in which they are used, to the words with which they are associated, and to the object or purpose of the statutory provision in which they appear. (pp. 279-281) In The Queen v Savage \[1983\] CTC 393 Dickson J in the Supreme Court of Canada commented: 23 ....Our Act contains the stipulation, not found in the English statutes referred to, “benefits of any kind whatever ... in respect of, in the course of, or by virtue of an office or employment”. ... Further, our Act speaks of a benefit “in respect of” an office or employment. In Nowegijick v The Queen, \[1983\] C.T.C. 20, 83 D.T.C. 5041 this Court said, at 25 \[5045\], that: The words “in respect of” are, in my opinion, words of the widest possible scope. They import such meanings as “in relation to”, “with reference to” or “in connection with”. The phrase “in respect of” probably the widest of any expression intended to convey some connection between two related subject matters. See also Paterson v. Chadwick, \[1974\] 2 All ER 772 (QBD) at 775. \[Emphasis added\] T herefore, the phrase “in connection with” is used to describe a relationship between two things, but not necessarily a causal relationship. The phrases “in connection with”, “in relation to” and “in respect of” have similar meanings. These expressions are capable of having a very wide meaning. The degree of the relationship required depends on the context in which the expression is used. In the Australian FBT context, the courts have considered that it cannot be said that any causal relationship between the benefit and the employment is a sufficient relationship for FBT purposes and that a sufficient or material rather than a causal connection or relationship between the benefit and the employment must be established: see J & G Knowles & Associates Pty Ltd v FCT 2000 ATC 4151. In that case, the court considered that it was helpful to consider whether the benefit is a product or incident of the employment. The Commissioner considers that this approach would also be appropriate in the New Zealand context, given that FBT was intended to apply to non-cash remuneration provided to employees. The Commissioner considers that where the employment is a substantial reason for the provision of the benefit, there would be a sufficient relationship between the benefit and 12 the employment (see “QB0043 The meaning of ‘benefit’ for FBT purposes” (published in Taxation Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 2 (March 2006))). Employer contributions The Commissioner considers that employer contributions do not give rise to a benefit that is provided by the employer in connection with the employment of any employee. It is not possible to establish a link between a benefit arising from the payment of employer contributions and any particular employee. The reasons are as follows: •Employees do not obtain a benefit in the form of an entitlement to receive payments made by employers under FICA. Employees have no beneficial entitlement to amounts paid by them or by their employer under FICA. •An employee’s right to receive a social security benefit is conditional on the employee satisfying the eligibility requirements in the social security legislation. When the right to receive payment from a fund is conditional, a benefit would not be provided when payment is made to the fund (Constable v Commissioner of Taxation 5 ATD 83). In Constable the taxpayer was the member of a provident fund established for the employees of the Shell group of companies. Both employer and employee contributions were paid to the fund. The fund’s regulations permitted members to withdraw the amount held on their behalf if an amendment was made to the regulations that curtailed their rights. Such an amendment was made with effect from 30 September 1947. The taxpayer withdrew amounts held to his cred it ( including the employer’s contributions and interest earned on the amount contributed). The High Court of Australia held that these amounts did not constitute an allowance, a gratuity, compensation, a benefit, a bonus or a premium in respect of or for or in relation to the taxpayer’s employment or services rendered by him. Dixon CJ and McTiernan, Williams and Fullager JJ in their joint judgment commented: It appears to us that the taxpayer becomes entitled to a payment out of the fund by reason of a contingency (viz an alteration of the regulations curtailing the rights of members) which occurred in the year enabling him to call for the amounts shown by his account. It was a contingent right which became absolute. The happening of the event which made it absolute did not, and could not amount to an allowing, giving or granting to him of any allowance, gratuity, compensation, benefit, bonus or premium . T he fund existed as one to a share in which he had a contractual, if not a proprietary title. All tha t o ccurred in the year of income with respect to the sums in question was that the future and contingent or conditional right became \[a\] right to present payment and payment was made accordingly . .... It is not of course, a matter which arises for decisi on in the present case, but to avoid misunderstanding it is we think desirable to say that on the frame of the regulations we find it by no means easy to see how the sums so contributed can be regarded as allowed, granted or given to the employee when they are paid to the Administrators of the Fund. It is only after the Administrators have exercised their discretion that the moneys paid to the special account are reflected in the member’s (employee’s) account and even then that does not mean that the member becomes presently entitled to the moneys credited to that account. (pp. 95-96) •A benefit (either in the form of a social security benefit or the right to receive a social security benefit) would not be provided when payments are made by the employer under FICA. Employees must satisfy the statutory criteria (including citizenship or residence requirements, reaching retirement age, disability, earning the minimu m n umber of credits) before a benefit would be paid to the employees. Fleming v Nestor 363 US 603 confirms that a right to receive future benefits does not accrue as a consequence of payments made by the employer under FICA. •The substantial reason for payment or the provision of retirement, disability or M edicare benefits to an employee is that the employee satisfies the statutory criteria 13 for eligibility to receive the benefit. The amount of any benefit paid is not related to the payments made under FICA. The amount depends on a person’s earnings history (whether as an employee or a self-employed person). Therefore, there is an insufficient relationship between the payment of a social security benefit and payments made by the employer under FICA. E mployee contributions T he Commissioner considers that the deduction of employee contributions from wages and the payment of such contributions under FICA also do not give rise to a benefit in connection with the employee’s employment. As employee contributions form part of the salary or wages paid to employees, employee contributions are assessable income of employees in terms of section CE 1(a). That being the case, such contributions are specifically excluded from the definition of “fringe benefit” by section CX 4. In Case 207 CTBR(NS) 91 it was accepted that deductions made under FICA from the salary paid to an Australian resident who was a visiting professor at a university in the US\_ was assessable income of the taxpayer. The issue was whether the amount deducted under FI CA was exempt income (on the basis that a liability for income tax in the US had been paid). S ummary For there to be an FBT liability, the employer must have provided a “fringe benefit” to an employee. •E mployer contributions paid under FICA do not give rise to a “fringe benefit” under section CX 13 as the contributions are not made for the benefit of employees. •E mployer contributions paid under FICA do not give rise to a “fringe benefit” under section CX 14. As trust funds established for the purpose of paying disability benefits or Medicare and funded by payments under FICA were not established for the benefi t o f employees and have not been approved by the Commissioner, the funds are no t “ sickness, accident or death benefit funds” as defined in section YA 1. •E mployer contributions under FICA do not give rise to an “unclassified benefit” in terms of section CX 37 as a benefit is not provided by employers in connection with the employment of employees through the payment of employer contributions under FICA. •E mployee contributions do not give rise to an “unclassified benefit”. Employee contributions required to be deducted from wages and paid under FICA represent par t of employees’ assessable income and are expressly excluded from the definition of “fringe benefit” by section CX 4. T herefore, payments required under FICA are not subject to FBT.
PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 09/03: Charitable Organisations and Fringe Benefit Tax Note (not part of the Ruling): This ruling is essentially the same as public ruling BR Pub 00/08 published in Public In formation Bulletin Vol 12, No 9 (September 2000). BR Pub 00/08 was a reissue of Public Ruling Pub 97/6 which was published in Public Information Bulletin Vol 9, No.5 (May 1997). This Ruling has been updated to take into account the Income Tax Act 2007 and reaches the same conclusion as the earlier rulings, despite the legislative changes that have occurred since the earlier rulings expired. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless othe rwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section CX 25. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the provision of a non-monetary benefit by a charitable organisat ion, other than a benefit by way of short-term charge facilities as described in section CX 25(2) and (3), to an employee of that organisation. In this Ruling, the term “charitable organisation” has the meaning that it has in the Act for t he purposes of the fringe benefit tax (FBT) rules; that is, in relation to any quarter or (where FBT is payable on an income year basis under section RD 60) any income year, any association, fund, institution, organisation, society, or trust to which section LD 3(2) or schedule 32 applies. A local authority, a public authority, or a university are not “charitable organisations” for the purposes of section CX 25 and are therefore excluded from this fringe benefit exemption. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows. •For the purposes of se ction CX 25(1), a fringe benefit is not provided by a charitable organisation, if a non-monetary benefit is received by an employee of the organisation mainly in connection with employment in an activity that either: −carries out any of the organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural, or philanthropic purposes; or −does not constitute a profession, a trade, or an undertaking that is carried on for profit. 1 WITHDRAWN - see BR Pub 17/06 • For the purposes of section CX 25(1), a fringe benefit is provided by a charitable organisation, if a non-monetary benefit is received by an employee of the organisation mainly in connection with employment in an activity that: − cannot be characterised as carrying out any of the orga nisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural, or philanthropic purposes; and − consti tutes a profession, a trade, or an undertaking that is carried on for profit (even if that profit is to be applied solely for the purposes of the charitable organisation). • For the purposes of section CX 25(1), a non-monetary benefit that is provided to an employee of a charitable organisation is received by an employee “mainly in connection with” their employment in a business activity outside of the organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural, or philanthropic purposes, if: − the employee is emplo yed solely in the business activity of the organisation; or − the employee is employed in both the business activity and in activities related to the charitable purpose of the organisation, and the benefit arises mainly in connection with the employment in the business activity; or − the employee is emplo yed in both the business activity and in activities related to the charitable purpose of the organisation, the benefit arises equally in connection with both the business and non-business activities, and the employee is predominantly employed in the business activities of the employer. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for an indefinite period beginning on th e first day of the 2008/09 income year. This Ruling is signed by me on 30 June 2009. Susan Price Director, Public Rulings 2 WITHDRAWN COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 09/03 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understa nding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 09/03 (“the Ruling”). All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated. Overview 1. Benefits provided by charitable or ganisations to their employees are excluded from being fringe benefits by section CX 25. The exclusion does not apply, however, to any benefit that is provided mainly in connection with an employee’s employment in a business activity that is outside the organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural, or philanthropic purposes. The exclusion also does not apply to benefits provided to an employee by way of short-term charge facilities if the value of those benefits in a tax year is more than 5% of the employee’s salary or wages for the tax year. 2. The issues that the Ruling addresses are when: • an acti vity will be a business activity that is outside the organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural, or philanthropic purposes; and • a ben efit will be received by an employee mainly in connection with such activities. Legislation 3. Section CX 25 states: CX 25 Benefits provided by charitable organisations When not fringe benefit (1) A charitable organisation that provide s a benefit to an employee does not provide a fringe benefit except to the extent to which— (a) the employee receives the benefit mainly in connection with their e mployment; and (b) the employment consists of the carrying on by the organisation of a business w hose activity is outside its benevolent, charitable, cultural, or philanthropic purposes. When employer provides charge facilities (2) Subsection (1) does not apply, and th e benefit provided is a fringe benefit, if a charitable organisation provides a benefit to an employee by way of short-term charge facilities and the value of the benefit from the short-term charge facilities for the employee in a tax year is more than 5% of the employee’s salary or wages for the tax year. Meaning of short-term charge facilities (3) For the purposes of the FBT rules, a sho rt-term charge facility means an arrangement that— (a) enables an employee of a charitabl e organisation to obtain goods or services that have no connection with the organisation or its 3 WITHDRAWN operations by buying or hiring the goods or services or charging the cost of the goods or services to an account; and (b) places the liability for some or all of the payment for the goods or services on the organisation; and (c) is not a fringe benefit under section CX 10. 4. “Business” is defined in section YA 1 as including: any profession, trade, or undertaking carried on for profit. 5. “Charitable organisation” is defined in section YA 1: charitable organisation — (a) means, for a quarter or an income yea r, an association, fund, institution, organisation, society, or trust to which section LD 3(2) (Meaning of charitable or other public benefit gift) or schedule 32 (Recipients of charitable or other public benefit gifts) applies— (i) in the quarter; or (ii) in the income year, if fringe be nefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section RD 60 (Close company option); and (b) does not include a local authority, a public authority, or a university. 6. Section LD 3(2) states: LD 3 Meaning of charitable or other public benefit gift ... Description of organisations (2) The following are the entities refer red to in subsection (1)(a): (a) a society, institution, association, organisation, or trust that is not carri ed on for the private pecuniary profit of an individual, and whose funds are applied wholly or mainly to charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand: (b) a public institution maintained exclusively for any 1 or more of the pu rposes within New Zealand set out in paragraph (a): (bb) a Board of Trustees that is constit uted under Part 9 of the Education Act 1989 and is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual: (bc) a tertiary education institution that is esta blished under Part 14 of the Education Act 1989 and is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual: (c) a fund established and maintained exclusively for the purpose of providing mo ney for any 1 or more of the purposes within New Zealand set out in paragraph (a), by a society, institution, association, organisation, or trust that is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of an individual: (d) a public fund established and maintained exclusively for the pur pose of providing money for any 1 or more of the purposes within New Zealand set out in paragraph (a). 4 WITHDRAWN 7. Schedule 32 lists certain named organisations that are “recipients of charitable or other public benefit gifts”. It should be noted that the application of the exclusion from fringe benefit tax applies to a wider category of organisations (including those listed in schedule 32) than the stricter requirements for organisations to be registered under the Charities Act 2005. Section CX 25(1) applies to those organisations that are commonly referred to as “donee organisations” for the donations tax credit available under section LD 1. 8. “ Charitable purpose” is defined in section YA 1 as including: every charitable purpose, whether it relates to the relief of poverty, the advancement of education or religion, or any other matter beneficial to the community. 9. The Act does not define what is meant by benevolent, cultural, or philanthropic purposes. Application of the Legislation Business activities outside an organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural, o r philanthropic purposes 10. Benefits provided by charitable or ganisations to their employees are excluded from being fringe benefits by section CX 25. Section CX 25(1) states that the exclusion does not apply, however, to any benefit that is provided mainly in connection with an employee’s employment in a business activity that is outside the organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural, or philanthropic purposes. The first issue to be considered, therefore, is when an activity undertaken by a charitable organisation will be a business activity that is outside of the organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural, or philanthropic purposes. 11. “ Business” is defined in section YA 1 as including “any profession, trade, or undertaking carried on for profit”. 12. The Court of Appeal in Grieve v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,682 considered that underlying the use of the word “business” in the context of a taxation statute is the fundamental notion of the exercise of an activity in an organised and coherent way that is directed to an end result – the making of pecuniary profits. The Court said that the existence of a business activity is determined on the basis of the nature of the activity and whether the taxpayer has the intention of making a pecuniary profit in carrying out that activity. The Court stated (at p 61,691): Statements by the taxpayer as to his intentions are of course relevant but actions will often speak louder than words. Amongst the matters which may properly be considered in that inquiry are the nature of the activity, the period over which it is engaged in, the scale of operations and the volume of transactions, the commitment of time, money and effort, the pattern of activity, and the financial results. 13. Many charitable organisations engage in activities on a continuous and ongoing basis, commit time, money, and effort to those activities, and 5 WITHDRAWN conduct a large volume of transactions, so will have these characteristics of a business. 14. The issue is therefore whether a charitable organisation that budgets for, and has a record of making surpluses of income over expenditure has the “intention of making a profit”. If it is carried on for profit, it will be a "business" for the purposes of the Income Tax Act. 15. E nglish cases have held that the fact that a charity makes a profit does not mean that it is carried on "for profit". In Trustees of the National Deposit Friendly Society v Skegness UDC \[1958\] 2 All ER 601, the House of Lords found that a charity's objects are to advance the charitable purposes for which it is established. If profit-making is not one of their purposes but is only a means of achieving those purposes, the charity is not carried on "for profit". In Customs and Excise Commissioners v Bell Concord Educational Trust Ltd \[1989\] 2 All ER 217, the Court held that the question of whether or not an organisation is carried on "for profit" must be answered by reference to the objects for which that organisation is established, as contained in its constitution, and not by reference to the budgeting policy of that organisation. 16. T hus, a charitable organisation that carries on its activities in a business- like manner and which has the intention and record of making surpluses is not carried on "for profit", unless the organisation's constitution states that one of its purposes is to make a profit. As such organisations are not carried on "for pecuniary profit"; they are not carrying on a "business" for the purposes of the Income Tax Act and the FBT exemption. 17. For the purposes of section CX 25, however, it is only benefits provided in connection with business activities that fall outside the organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural, or philanthropic purposes that will be fringe benefits. Once an activity is identified, applying the test outlined in Grieve that an activity undertaken by a charitable organisation is a business activity, the issue is whether the activity is outside of the organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural, or philanthropic purposes. 18. A dist inction between the charitable (ie, running and administering a charity and providing charitable services) and the non-charitable purposes of a charity was drawn in Oxfam v City of Birmingham District Council \[1975\] 2 All ER 289 (HL). 19. Oxfam v City of Birmingham District Council concerned section 40 of the United Kingdom General Rate Act 1967, which applied to premises or heriditaments that were occupied by a charity and wholly or mainly used for charitable purposes. The House of Lords considered whether Oxfam’s gift shops were on premises wholly or mainly used for charitable purposes. The House of Lords found that, although the gift shops were used for purposes that indirectly related to the achievement of the objects of the charity (ie, selling donated goods to raise money for the charity), the premises were not wholly or mainly used for charitable purposes. 6 WITHDRAWN 20. In reaching this conclusion, the House of Lords drew a line between the use of premises for purposes that are the charitable purposes of the charity and the use of premises for purposes that, though purposes of the charity, are not charitable purposes. Lord Cross said (at p 293): The wording of s 40(1) of the \[General Rate Act 1967\] shows that the Legislature did not consider that the mere fact that a hereditament in question is occupied by a charity justifies any relief from rates. That is only justified if the hereditament is being used for the “charitable purposes” of the charity. So the first question which arises is: what are the 'charitable purposes' of a charity as distinct from its other purposes? The answer must be, I think, those purposes or objects the pursuit of which make it a charity — that is to say in this case the relief of poverty, suffering and distress. 21. As well as “those purposes or objects the pursuit of which make it a charity” Lord Cross recognised that activities that are “wholly ancillary to” or “directly facilitate” the carrying out of an organisation’s charitable objects will be considered to be part of fulfilling the organisation’s charitable objects. 22. Act ivities involved in carrying out the charitable objects of a charitable organisation or directly facilitating the carrying out of the charitable objects (such as administrative or clerical activities) will be within the benevolent, charitable, cultural, or philanthropic purposes of the organisation for the purposes of section CX 25. However, trading activities carried on to raise funds for the charity that are not themselves the charitable purposes of the charity will not be within the benevolent charitable, cultural, or philanthropic purposes of the organisation for the purposes of section CX 25, even if all funds raised from the activity are applied to the charity’s purpose. 23. The distinction between an orga nisation carrying out the functions for which the organisation was established and an organisation carrying on a business was examined in Port Chalmers Waterfront Workers Union v CIR; New Zealand Waterfront Workers Union v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,059 (High Court); CIR v Port Chalmers Waterfront Workers Union (1996) 17 NZTC 12,523 (Court of Appeal). That case concerned section 61(23) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Section 61(23) (section CW 44 of the Income Tax Act 2007) provides an exemption from income tax for the income of a friendly society, except so far as that income is derived from business carried on beyond the circle of its membership. 24. In Port Chalmers, the High Court drew a distinction between a friendly society carrying on a business as a trading organisation and a friendly society discharging its functions as a friendly society. It said that where the friendly society is discharging its functions as a friendly society, it is not carrying on a business even though it may conduct transactions that have a commercial flavour. This distinction was accepted by the Court of Appeal. 25. T he Ruling interprets section CX 25(1) as drawing a similar distinction as that drawn in Port Chalmers between the activities of a charitable organisation which discharge the purposes for which the organisation was established (ie, the discharging of its charitable, benevolent, or 7 WITHDRAWN philanthropic objects) and the charitable organisation carrying on a business as a trading organisation. A charitable organisation is not carrying on a business for the purposes of section CX 25(1) when it discharges its charitable objects, even though it may discharge those purposes in a business-like manner. 26. The effect o f the Ruling is that the activities involved in carrying out the charitable objects of a charitable organisation, or directly facilitating the carrying out of the charitable objects (such as fundraising or administrative or clerical activities) will not be treated as being business activities for the purposes of section CX 25(1). However, trading activities which are carried on to raise funds for the charity, and which are not themselves the charitable purposes of the charity, will be treated as business activities of the charitable organisation, if they satisfy the “business” test set out in the Income Tax Act (ie, those activities are carried on for the purpose of making a pecuniary profit). 27. Thus, when a charitable organisation’s employees are engaged in carrying out the charitable purposes of the organisation, benefits provided to them will not attract fringe benefit tax (FBT) liability because of section CX 25 (unless the benefits are provided by way of short-term charge facilities). However, when a charitable organisation's employees are engaged in activities of the organisation that are not in themselves charitable and that constitute business activities of the organisation, any benefits provided to them will not fall within the exclusion provided by section CX 25, so will attract FBT liability where applicable. “Mainly in connection with” 28. T he second issue arising is when a benefit will be treated as being received by an employee “mainly in connection with” business activities that fall outside a charitable organisation’s benevolent charitable, cultural, or philanthropic purposes. It is necessary to consider this issue because an employee may be employed by a charitable organisation in a range of activities, some of which relate to the carrying out of the organisation’s charitable purposes or other non-business activities of the organisation, and some of which are non-charitable business activities. It is only benefits provided “mainly in connection with” the non-charitable business activities that fall outside of the exclusion provided in section CX 25. 29. The expired ruling BR Pub 00 /08 was issued in the context of section CI 1(m) of the Income Tax Act 1994, which is the equivalent provision to section CX 25. This section used the words “primarily and principally” where section CX 25 uses “mainly”. 30. Lord Morto n of Henryton discussed the meaning of the word “mainly” in Fawcett Properties Ltd v Buckingham County Council \[1961\] AC 636 (at p 639): The word “mainly” at once gives rise to difficulties. Probably it means “more than half”. \[Emphasis added.\] 31. This meaning was accepted in CIR v Mitchell (1986) 8 NZTC 5,181 where Davison CJ, after stating that he regarded “mainly” as the best synonym 8 WITHDRAWN for “principally”, held that for a room to be “principally” used in connection with carrying on the employment of the taxpayer, the employment-related use of the room must be “greater than the total of all other uses”. This equates to the room being used for employment purposes more than half the time. 32. The Conci se Oxford English Dictionary (11th ed, revised) defines “primarily” and “principally” as follows: Primarily: for the most part; mainly Principally: for the most part; chiefly 33. Therefore, based on the cases discussed above and the dictionary definitions, it is considered that the replacement of the phrase “primarily and principally” with “mainly” does not change the meaning of the provision. 34. The c hange of the phrase “primarily and principally” to “mainly” occurred as a result of the rewrite of the Income Tax Act. This change is discussed in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 16, No 5 (June 2004) (at p 71): Mainly The rewritten provisions use “mainly” in place of “primarily and principally” and similar expressions. The expression “primarily and principally” was considered by Eichelbaum J in Newman Tours Ltd v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,027 (High Court). The judge interpreted the expression as requiring that the purpose not only be the main one, in the sense of outweighing all the other purposes, singly or collectively, but also the primary one - that is, the first one. Sufficiently similar connotations can be conveyed in the single word “mainly”. 35. This reasoning supports the above conclusion that “mainly” conveys a similar meaning to “primarily and principally”. 36. A ben efit will be provided to an employee of a charitable organisation mainly in connection with employment in a non-charitable business activity of the organisation if the benefit arises primarily in connection with such a business activity. If an employee is employed only in a non- charitable business activity of a charitable organisation, then any benefits provided to that employee will be provided mainly in connection with employment in a non-charitable business activity. If an employee is employed both in activities relating to the charitable purpose of the organisation and in non-charitable business activities, it will be necessary to determine which activity the benefit arises primarily in relation to. 37. If a bene fit arises equally in connection with both the business and non- business activities carried out by an employee, the benefit will be provided mainly in connection with the activity in which the employee is predominantly employed. 38. Section CX 25(1) excludes benefits provided by charitable organisations from being fringe benefits except “to the extent to which” the benefits are provided mainly in connection with employment in a non-charitable business activity of the organisation. The use of “to the extent to which” does not, in this instance, mean that a benefit should be apportioned. 9 WITHDRAWN 39. In the context of section CX 25(1) what must be considered is the scope of the employee’s involvement in the business activities of the employer. The term “to the extent that” combined with the requirement of “mainly” is directed at making a comparison (as opposed to contemplating apportionment, as in other contexts within the Act, for example, section DA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 which uses a similar phrase – “to the extent to which”). This comparison is necessary to determine whether the benefit is in connection with the employee’s employment in the business or charitable activities or both. Where such benefits are not mainly due to the employer’s business activities then the benefit is not a fringe benefit. 40. In summary, if a benefit is provided mainly in connection with employment in a non-charitable business activity of an organisation, then the entire benefit will be a fringe benefit - it will not be apportioned between its relation to charitable activities and non-charitable business activities. This is because the use of the word “mainly” in the section is inconsistent with the concept of apportionment; rather “mainly” means that where the requirement is for the most part true for that element, the section is satisfied completely. There is no need for an apportionment, so in the context of section CX 25 the phrase “to the extent to which” is to be interpreted as meaning “where”. Organisations to which the Ruling does not apply 41. T he Ruling does not apply to employers that are local authorities, public authorities, or universities. These organisations are excluded from the definition of “charitable organisation” for the purposes of the FBT rules, so the charitable organisation exclusion contained in section CX 25 does not apply to them. Benefits provided by these organisations will be subject to FBT unless some other exclusion or limitation applies to them. The Ruling does not apply to short–term charge facilities 42. As previously stated the exclusion from being a fringe benefit provided under section CX 25(1) does not apply to the provision of short-term charge facilities in specified circumstances. Section CX 25(2) states that a fringe benefit will be provided if a charitable organisation provides a benefit to an employee by way of a short term charge facility and the value of the benefit is more than 5% of the employee’s salary and wages for a tax year. Subsection (3) defines the term “short–term charge facility”. Example 6, set out below, illustrates this point. Period of Ruling 43. This ruling commences on the first day of the 2008/09 income year. The previous ruling expired on 30 June 2004. Given the terms of section 91C of the Tax Administration Act 1994, it is not possible to issue a ruling in respect of the Income Tax Act 1994 or Income Tax Act 2004 for the period from 1 July 2004 to the end of the 2007/08 income year. However, the Commissioner is of the view that the same principles and conclusions as set out in this Ruling apply in respect of any benefits provided to employees by charitable organisations during this period. 10 WITHDRAWN Examples 43. Some acti vities will usually be characterised as being within the charitable objectives of an organisation. Examples of such activities include: • appeals for funds for the charity’s purpose; • passi ve investment and management of the funds of the charity, as long as the charitable organisation does not carry on a business of fund investment; and • the admi nistration of the above activities. 44. It will be a question of fact in each case whether other activities of a charitable organisation are activities that are not inherently charitable activities that the organisation was established to carry out. It is, therefore, possible that two organisations may carry out similar activities, with different FBT consequences for each organisation. An example of this is the sale of goods or services for valuable and adequate consideration on a similar basis to business enterprises carried on by non- charitable entities and with a view to making a profit. This type of activity would generally be considered to be outside an organisation’s charitable objectives, although in some situations such an activity would fall within their charitable objectives. Examples of such cases could include if the production or provision of the goods or services served the purpose of creating job opportunities for a group that the organisation was established to assist, or if the goods or services were provided at low cost to a group that the organisation was established to assist. 45. The examples that follo w provide further guidance as to when charitable organisations will and will not be liable for FBT on benefits provided to employees. Example 1 46. A ch aritable organisation has the principal purpose of providing education through a private school. The organisation is a charitable organisation for the purposes of the FBT rules, because it is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual and its funds are applied wholly or principally for charitable purposes (ie, the advancement of education) within New Zealand. 47. The organisation charges tuition fe es and has had surpluses of income over expenditure for the last three income years. It provides a car to its school principal for work and private use. 48. The organi sation is not liable for FBT on the benefit arising from the private use or availability for private use of the car provided to the principal. This is because the benefit is provided by a charitable organisation to an employee who is employed in respect of the charitable organisation carrying out its charitable purposes. The employee is not employed in a separate business activity carried on by the school. 11 WITHDRAWN Example 2 49. The charitable organisa tion from example 1 also conducts a farming business on land adjacent to the school. The farming operation is carried out in a business-like manner for the purpose of the practical component of the school’s agricultural courses. The organisation provides a car to its farm manager for work and private use. 50. The organi sation is not liable for FBT on the benefit arising from the private use or availability for private use of the car provided to the farm manager. This is because the farm manager is employed in respect of the charitable organisation carrying out its charitable purposes (ie, the advancement of education). As the farming business falls within the charitable purposes of the organisation, it is not significant that the farm is run in a business-like manner. Example 3 51. This example has the same facts as example 2, except the farming operat ion is carried out in a business-like manner for the purpose of making a profit that is applied to the promotion of the organisation’s charitable purposes. The farm is not used to educate students at the school. 52. In this situation the organisation is liable for FBT on the benefit arising from the private use or availability for private use of the car provided to the farm manager. This is because the farm manager is employed in respect of a business activity that falls outside the charitable purposes of the organisation. It is not significant that the profit that is made from the farming activity is applied to the promotion of the organisation’s charitable purposes. Example 4 53. A charitable organisation ha s the principal purpose of relieving poverty by running a food bank. The organisation is a charitable organisation for the purposes of the FBT rules, because it is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual and its funds are applied wholly or principally for charitable purposes (ie, the relief of poverty) within New Zealand. The organisation also runs a shop that sells office supplies (purchased from a wholesaler) to the public. The profit made from the shop is used to purchase food for the food bank. 54. T he organisation has a policy of providing low interest loans to employees who work in the food bank. The loans are not available to those whose employment consists solely of working in the shop. Peter works for the organisation three days a week in the shop and two days a week in the food bank. He receives a low interest loan from the organisation. 55. T he charitable organisation is not liable for FBT on the benefit arising from the provision of the low interest loan to Peter. This is because the benefit arises in relation to Peter’s employment in the food bank, which is a charitable activity of the organisation. It does not matter that the 12 WITHDRAWN majority of Peter’s employment with the organisation is in a non- charitable business activity of the organisation, because the benefit does not arise in relation to this activity. Example 5 56. This example has the same facts as example 4, except the low interest loans are availab le to all employees of the organisation. 57. In this situation the organisation is liable for FBT on the benefit arising from the provision of the low interest loan to Peter. As the low interest loans are available to all employees of the organisation, the benefit arises in relation to both Peter’s employment in the charitable activities of the organisation and his employment in the non-charitable business activities of the organisation. As Peter is predominantly employed in the non- charitable business activities of the organisation, the benefit arises “mainly in connection with” those activities. Example 6 58. A charitable organisation employs a secretary at its head office whose employment involves administrative matters relating to the running of the organisation. The secretary’s salary is $40,000 for the tax year. On top of the salary, the organisation provides the secretary with a fuel card for use at a local petrol station. The fuel card is in the organisation’s name and the organisation is liable to pay any amounts charged to the card. The secretary uses the card to obtain $80 worth of petrol every week. 59. T he organisation is liable for FBT on the benefit arising from the provision of the fuel card to the secretary, even though the secretary is employed in respect of the charitable organisation carrying out its charitable purposes (administrative work at an organisation’s head office “directly facilitates” the carrying out of an organisation’s charitable purposes). The reason the organisation is liable for FBT in this situation is that the benefit is provided by way of a short-term charge facility and the value of the benefit is more than 5% of the secretary’s salary or wages for the tax year. The benefit, therefore, is a fringe benefit under section CX 25(2). 13 WITHDRAWN
Note (not part of the rulings): BR Pub 09/04 and BR Pub 09/05 are essentially the same as public rulings BR Pub 03/07 and BR Pub 03/10 which were published with BR Pub 03/08 and BR Pub 03/09 in Tax Information Bulletin Vol. 15, No 12 (December 2003). The four previous rulings expired on 12 November 2006. It was considered appropriate to issue four separate rulings with a shared commentary given the different nature of the different marine farming authorisations and fishing quota. BR Pub 03/08 and BR Pub 03/09 on marine farming leases and licences respectively will not be reissued, because marine farming leases and licences are now deemed to be coastal permits granted under the Resource Management Act 1991. Marine farming permits (previously covered by BR Pub 03/10) are no longer required under section 67J of the Fisheries Act 1983, which was repealed in 2004. Therefore, the reissued rulings do not consider marine farming permits. BR Pub 03/07 and BR Pub 03/10 have been updated to take into account changes to the Fisheries Act 1983, the Fisheries Act 1996, and the Resource Management Act 1991, and the enactment of the Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004. No changes to these Acts, nor the enactment of the Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004, affect the conclusions reached in these Rulings. The reissued rulings consider whether a secondhand goods input tax credit can be claimed on the purchase of fishing quota, coastal permits, or certificates of compliance. The rulings conclude that secondhand goods input tax credits cannot be claimed on such purchases. A single commentary applies to BR Pub 09/04 and BR Pub 09/05. Both rulings apply until 30 June 2014. FISHING QUOTA - SECONDHAND GOODS INPUT TAX CREDITS PUBLIC RULING – BR Pub 09/04 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section 20(3), the definitions of “goods” and “secondhand goods” in section 2, and the definition of “input tax” in section 3A. Definitions For the purposes of this ruling, “fishing quota” means – (a) individual transferable quota that has been granted under the Fisheries Act 1983; or (b) individual transferable quota that has been granted under the Fisheries Act 1996; or (c) annual catch entitlements that have been generated by individual transferable quota under section 66 of the Fisheries Act 1996. 1 The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies is the supply of fishing quota. The supply of fishing quota must satisfy the following conditions: 1. The supply by the vendor is a supply made by way of sale. 2. The supply is not a taxable supply. 3. The supply is made to the purchaser, who is a GST-registered person. 4. The fishing quota is situated in New Zealand at the time of supply. 5. The fishing quota is acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • Fishing quota is not a good in accordance with the definition of “goods” in section 2. As a result, fishing quota will not constitute “secondhand goods” for the purposes of the Act. • The purchaser of such fishing quota will not be entitled under section 20(3) to deduct from the amount of output tax payable in a taxable period any amount of input tax in respect of the supply of the fishing quota. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling applies to a supply of fishing quota where the time of the supply occurs or occurred at any time during the period 13 November 2006 to 30 June 2014. This Ruling is signed by me on 26 June 2009. Susan Price Director, Public Rulings 2 COASTAL PERMITS AND CERTIFICATES OF COMPLIANCE - SECONDHAND GOODS INPUT TAX CREDITS PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 09/05 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section 20(3), the definitions of “goods” and “secondhand goods” in section 2, and the definition of “input tax” in section 3A. Definitions For the purposes of this ruling— • “coastal permit” means a resource consent in the form of a coastal permit granted under the Resource Management Act 1991; and • “certificate of compliance” means a certificate of compliance granted under the Resource Management Act 1991. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies is the supply of a: • coastal permit; or • certificate of compliance. The supply of a coastal permit or certificate of compliance must satisfy the following conditions: 1. The supply by the vendor is a supply made by way of sale. 2. The supply is not a taxable supply. 3. The supply is made to the purchaser, who is a GST-registered person. 4. The coastal permit or certificate of compliance is situated in New Zealand at the time of supply. 5. The coastal permit or certificate of compliance is acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • A coastal permit or certificate of compliance is not a good in accordance with the definition of “goods” in section 2. As a result, the coastal permit or certificate of compliance will not constitute “secondhand goods” for the purposes of the Act. • The purchaser of a coastal permit or certificate of compliance will not be entitled under section 20(3) to deduct from the amount of output tax payable in a taxable period any amount of input tax in respect of the supply of the coastal permit or certificate of compliance. 1 The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling applies to a supply of a coastal permit or a certificate of compliance where the time of the supply occurs or occurred at any time during the period 13 November 2006 to 30 June 2014. This Ruling is signed by me on 26 June 2009. Susan Price Director, Public Rulings 2 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULINGS BR PUB 09/04 and BR PUB 09/05 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Rulings BR Pub 09/04 and BR Pub 09/05 (“the rulings”). Summary Individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements cannot be categorised as usufruct rights, sales of goods coupled with a licence, or profits à prendre. Individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements have to be regarded as unique property rights, with their characteristics determined from the provisions of the fishing legislation. Individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements are personal property, however, these rights are choses in action. Therefore individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements are not “goods”, and therefore not “secondhand goods”, for the purposes of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Coastal permits and certificates of compliance are not personal or real property but are unique statutory rights created under the Resource Management Act 1991. Therefore, coastal permits and certificates of compliance are not “goods”, and therefore not “secondhand goods”, for the purposes of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Background BR Pub 09/04 and BR Pub 09/05 consider whether a GST input tax credit is available to registered persons who acquire fishing quota or coastal permits and certificates of compliance from unregistered persons. While this commentary considers both fishing quota and coastal permits and certificates of compliance, fishing quota need to be dealt with separately from coastal permits and certificates of compliance because different statutory requirements exist for each. Before looking at the relevant GST legislation, the natures of fishing quota and coastal permits and certificates of compliance need to be considered. Fishing quota The fishing quota being considered are individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements as defined in section 2 of the Fisheries Act 1996. Individual transferable quota were established and allocated in 1986 under the Fisheries (Quota Management Areas, Total Allowable Catches, and Catch Histories) Notice 1986, which was issued under the Fisheries Act 1983. They appear to have been allocated based on a person’s commercial fishing history. No charge was made for the quota initially allocated. Individual transferable quota does not provide a “free” right, however, because an annual levy must be paid. These levies are typically significant. The annual catch entitlement was introduced under the Fisheries Act 1996, and section 66 of that Act provides that the annual catch entitlement is generated by the individual transferable quota at the beginning of each fishing year. Section 74 provides that the annual catch entitlement confers the immediate right to catch fish in a given year. Section 132 and 133 provide that the individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlement may be transferred. Individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements are not the same, but they are both unique statutory rights that may be bought, sold and, in the 1 case of individual transferable quota, may have interests registered against them. Even though annual catch entitlements are generated from individual transferable quota and are separate property rights, this commentary will use the term “fishing quota” to refer to both rights for the sake of convenience. While most fishing quota are held by large organisations, individual fishers hold some small parcels of fishing quota. Some of these fishers may not make supplies in excess of $60,000 in a 12-month period ($40,000 prior to 1 April 2009), so are not required to register for GST under section 51 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. One of these non-registered fishers may sell their fishing quota (individual transferable quota or annual catch entitlements) to a person who is registered for GST. The question arises as to whether the purchaser may claim a GST input tax credit. Nature of fishing quota There is no definitive statement in any of the fisheries legislation as to the nature of fishing quota. The expression “individual transferable quota” was not defined in the Fisheries Act 1983. While the term is defined in the Fisheries Act 1996, the definition appears to have been added to ensure all quota allocated under the different Acts are regarded as fishing quota for the purposes of the Fisheries Act 1996. The change between the Fisheries Act 1983 and Fisheries Act 1996 appears to have affected the characteristics that could be ascribed to fishing quota. Under the 1983 Act, the fundamental rights acquired by the holder of fishing quota (as determined from the legislation) were that the quota holder had the right to catch and take away for their own purposes:  a specified quantity  of a particular fish species  from a particular area (the quota management area)  in a specific period (in a year, although a quota is issued in perpetuity). These rights could be dealt with in ordinary commercial dealings; they could be bought and sold, used as security, and have interests registered against them. The nature of individual transferable quota granted under the Fisheries Act 1983 has been considered in court decisions. Under the 1983 Act the individual transferable quota granted the right to fish rather than the right to receive annual catch entitlements. The Court of Appeal considered the nature of fishing quota in New Zealand Fishing Industry Association (Inc) v Minister of Fisheries 22 July 1997, CA 82/97). The case involved the judicial review of a decision made by the Minister of Fisheries to reduce the total allowable commercial catch for snapper in quota management area 1. The Court of Appeal made various comments regarding the nature of fishing quota. Tipping J stated (at page 16): While quota are undoubtedly a species of property and a valuable one at that, the rights inherent in that property are not absolute. They are subject to the provisions of the legislation establishing them. That legislation contains the capacity for quota to be reduced. If such reduction is otherwise lawfully made, the fact that quota are a “property right”, to use the appellants’ expression, cannot save them from reduction. That would be to deny an incident integral to the property concerned. The Court of Appeal confirmed that individual transferable quota are property under the Fisheries Act 1983, although the court provides little in the way of further guidance on the precise nature of individual transferable quota except to state that the characteristics of quota must be determined from the legislation. 2 Further clarification of individual transferable quota was provided by Baragwanath J in Antons Trawling Co Ltd v Smith \[2003\] 2 NZLR 23. In dealing with a contractual dispute, Baragwanath J stated that individual transferable quota are statutory choses in action (at paragraph 5): The root of title is the issue under the quota management system ... of individual transferable quota (ITQ) which is a statutory chose in action comprising a fraction of the total of exclusive rights to fish commercially a particular species of fish within one of the ten quota management areas into which the exclusive economic zone is divided. Rights to ITQ are codified by the relevant legislation, especially the Fisheries Amendment Act 1986 and the Fisheries Act 1996. This dicta, while useful, does not fully explain the rights and obligations that arise in relation to individual transferable quota, particularly in relation to the change in the nature of the entitlement under the Fisheries Act 1996. One of the major differences in relation to the rights derived by holding fishing quota is the introduction of the concept of an “annual catch entitlement”. Instead of the individual transferable quota providing a right to catch a specified amount of fish, the individual transferable quota now “generates” an annual catch entitlement on the first day of the fishing year under section 67 of the 1996 Act. Fish are now generally caught under the authority of a fishing permit and an annual catch entitlement (there is also a deemed value payment procedure set out in the legislation). For holders of an individual transferable quota, the annual catch entitlement is separately tradeable, so that for a particular year a quota owner may sell their annual catch entitlement while retaining the individual transferable quota that will generate another annual catch entitlement the following year. The lack of an in-depth judicial analysis of the nature of fishing quota in general means it is necessary to examine the characteristics and rights granted under the fisheries legislation. These can then be compared with recognised categories of property. If they are sufficiently similar, it may be appropriate to conclude that the individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements should be regarded as belonging to that particular category. Alternatively, it may be that the most appropriate conclusion is that individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements are not sufficiently similar to anything else and must be regarded as a separate category of property. Several suggestions have been made as to the nature of fishing quota. The terms “usufruct right” and “profit à prendre” have been suggested to describe fishing quota. A further possibility is that a fishing quota might be regarded as the sale of goods coupled with a licence to retrieve the goods. This commentary considers these possible classifications in the following order:  Is fishing quota a “usufruct right”?  Is fishing quota the sale of goods coupled with a licence to remove the goods?  Is fishing quota a “profit à prendre”? Is fishing quota a usufruct right? The term “usufruct right” is a civil law rather than common law term. As New Zealand’s jurisprudence is based on the common law and doctrine of precedent, the term “usufruct right” is largely unknown to New Zealand law. The basis of this term in the civil law as opposed to common law is confirmed by the definition of the word “usufruct” in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary (11 th edition, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2006), which provides: usufruct n. (Roman law) the right to enjoy the use of another’s property short of the destruction or waste of its substance. 3 A more expansive definition of the term “usufruct” is found in Black’s Law Dictionary (8th edition, West Group,2004): usufruct n. \[fr. Latin usufructis\] Roman & civil law. A right to use and enjoy the fruits of another’s property for a period without damaging or diminishing it, although the property might naturally deteriorate over time. ... In modern civil law, the owner of the usufruct is similar to a life tenant, and the owner of the thing burdened is the naked owner. ... The South African case Geldenhuys v CIR (1947) 14 SATC 419 provided a full judicial consideration of the nature of a usufruct right. The case concerned the assessability of an amount of income that arose from the sale of a flock of sheep. The taxpayer’s husband died leaving the taxpayer with a “life interest” in her husband’s estate, with their children as the ultimate beneficiaries. The flock of sheep was valued at £1,451 at the date of the husband’s death. The flock declined in number after the husband’s death due to drought, and a lesser number of sheep were sold for £4,941 some years later. The taxpayer used the proceeds from the sale to invest, purportedly for her own benefit. The Commissioner sought to include the difference in the taxpayer’s assessable income. The taxpayer argued that she was unable to be assessed on this amount as she was only a usufructuary in relation to the sheep. This meant she had a right only to use the sheep, with no liability for waste due to circumstances beyond her control. She accepted that this also meant the investment did not belong to her. Steyn J (with whom Herbstein and Ogilvie Thompson AJJ agreed) delivered the leading judgment. In considering the nature of a usufruct right, Steyn J made the following observations (at page 424): According to some authorities, ... movables which are consumed or impaired (consumuntur et minuuntur) by use cannot be subject to a full and complete usufruct, but they can be made the subject of an incomplete usufruct, a quasi-usufruct. In this class of movables cattle and animals are, according to the authorities, included. After referring to further texts and commentaries, Steyn J reached the following conclusions (at page 428): The passages from Domat and Huber which I have set out above, however, make it clear in my judgment, that with regard to the cattle and other animals to which they refer these authorities hold that the dominium remains with the remainderman; the usufructuary, according to the passage from Huber cited above having no right to sell or kill them and being obliged to restore them. ... The authorities appear to be agreed that the usufructuary is only entitled to the young or progeny over and above the full complement of the flock. The full number of the flock must be maintained, the young replacing the old as they die, but the flock as an entity must be returned. Application to fishing quota It seems difficult to apply the concept of a “usufruct right” to fish except perhaps in a fish-farming situation. The nature of a usufruct right, even if it did apply in a New Zealand context, appears inconsistent with the characteristics of either individual transferable quota or annual catch entitlements. A usufruct right is a right to use property without liability for waste. However, under the individual transferable quota or annual catch entitlements a person obtains the right directly or indirectly to take the relevant fish from the sea and provide these for consumption. In the case of the direct right, the owner of an annual catch entitlement is under no obligation in relation to all the other fish in the sea. Further, the owner of an individual transferable quota or an annual catch entitlement does not have to give a school of fish back at the end of the period, although it will obviously be in their best interests to manage the 4 fisheries resources to ensure sustainability in accordance with the principles in the Fisheries Act 1996. It is also noted that a usufruct right is typically granted for a finite period, which is consistent with the annual catch entitlement, but the individual transferable quota is granted in perpetuity. However, in neither case is there an obligation to restore fish at the end of the year or to maintain the resource generally. The characteristics of a usufruct right are not sufficiently similar to the characteristics of either individual transferable quota or annual catch entitlements for there to be any serious possibility that either of them could be a usufruct right. Is fishing quota the sale of goods coupled with a licence to remove the goods? The concept of a sale of goods with a licence to remove the goods refers to a contract for the sale of goods, where a licence is granted to the purchaser to go onto land (typically the vendor’s land) to get the goods. For instance, an agreement for the right to take trees from a property could be the sale of goods coupled with a licence to enter onto the land and remove the trees. Alternatively, the agreement might constitute a profit à prendre, which is discussed below. The distinction between an agreement for the sale of goods with a licence and a profit à prendre appears to turn on whether the purchaser is obliged to take the trees, or simply may take the trees. This follows from the definition of “goods” in the Sale of Goods Act 1908. The definition provides that the term “goods” “includes emblements, growing crops, and things attached to or forming part of the land which are agreed to be severed before sale or under the contract of sale”. Thus, unless the agreement between the parties requires that the trees shall be severed, the trees will not be goods under the Sale of Goods Act 1908. If the purchaser is obliged to take the trees, then the agreement is more likely a contract for the sale of goods coupled with a licence to retrieve the trees, but if the purchaser may take the trees, then the agreement between the parties is more likely to be a profit à prendre. This issue was addressed by Young J in the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Ellison v Vukicevic (1986) 7 NSWLR 104. The case concerned the nature of an agreement between a landowner and a quarrying company. In return for the payment of a royalty, the quarrying company was entitled to quarry for sand and sandstone on the landowner’s property. In distinguishing between a profit à prendre and a contract for the sale of goods, Young J states (at page 116): Taking all these factors together it seems to me that the document looks more like a profit à prendre than a licence, but I must also look at the distinction between profits and sale of goods. After a considerable search, it seems to me that the most accurate statement of the law in this connection is provided by Hinde McMorland Sim (...at 715), where the authors say: “... profits à prendre and contracts for the sale of goods are seen as mutually exclusive, the former consist only of contracts relating to fructus naturales or other parts of the realty where the purchaser has merely a right or option to sever, while the latter consist of: (1) All sales of fructus industriales regardless of who is to sever them; (2) All sales of fructus naturales or other parts of the realty which are to be severed by the vendor before property passes to the purchaser; and (3) All sales of fructus naturales or other parts of the realty which the purchaser is under a contractual obligation to sever.” 5 Thus if the document puts on the purchaser an obligation to sever there is a contract for the sale of goods including a licence to go onto the land for the purpose of carrying out the contract, but if the purchaser merely has the option to sever then there is a profit à prendre. In dealing with this issue, Young J referred to a statement in Hinde McMorland and Sim Land Law (Butterworths, Wellington, 1978–79). That statement still represents the view of the authors as it is included in the latest edition of Hinde McMorland and Sim’s Land Law in New Zealand (Vol 2, LexisNexis NZ, Wellington 2003). On the basis of this, the key distinguishing feature between a profit à prendre and a sale of goods coupled with a licence to retrieve the goods is that a profit à prendre gives rise only to an option to sever and take the goods, while there is an obligation to take the goods under a contract for sale. This is consistent with the New Zealand Supreme Court decision in Egmont Box Ltd v Registrar General of Lands \[1920\] NZLR 741. Application to fishing quota In determining whether either individual transferable quota or annual catch entitlements could be regarded as the sale of goods coupled with a licence to remove the fish, assistance can be derived from the Fisheries Act 1983. The individual transferable quota were originally allocated without cost to fishers based on their prior catch histories. However, in order to exercise the rights under the individual transferable quota (and now the associated annual catch entitlement) the fishers must pay an annual levy. In determining whether either individual transferable quota or annual catch entitlements is the sale of goods coupled with a licence to remove the fish, the key distinction is whether there is an obligation or merely an option to take the fish. This question appears to be answered in regulation 5(3) of the Fisheries (Cost Recovery Levies for Fisheries Services) Order 2008 (similar to now- repealed section 28ZC(3) of the Fisheries Act 1983). The regulation provides that the levy is payable by holders of individual transferable quota irrespective of whether they take the fish, aquatic life, or seaweed to which the quota relates is taken. Given that the levy is payable regardless of whether the fish are caught in relation to the quota, individual transferable quota should not be regarded as a sale of the fish because there is no obligation to take the fish. It is also noted that the levy charged is for administering the quota management system rather than necessarily being a “price” payable for the fish. Further, the fish are not “made available” – the owner of an annual catch entitlement must still catch the fish. Thus, situations might exist where the owner of an annual catch entitlement is unable to catch the amount of the particular species for which they have an entitlement. The characteristics of a fishing quota are more consistent with the owner of an individual transferable quota or annual catch entitlement having only a right, directly or indirectly, to catch the fish. Therefore, the terms of the ownership of the individual transferable quota or annual catch entitlement are inconsistent with it being an agreement for the sale of goods. Is fishing quota a profit à prendre? The concept of profit à prendre has been referred to in relation to fishing quota in other contexts. The New Zealand Law Commission in “The Treaty of Waitangi and Maori Fisheries” (Preliminary Paper No 9, Wellington, 1989) referred to fishing quota in the form of individual transferable quota as being in the nature of a profit à prendre. The Law Commission stated (at paragraph 4.20): 6 In economic terms the \[individual transferable quota\] scheme has created a new limited monopoly akin to those arising from other restrictive licensing schemes, such as liquor licences and taxi licences. In legal terms it has converted a public right to fish commercially (subject, of course, to regulation) into a series of private rights. It has created a new property right in the nature of a profit à prendre – broadly an ongoing right to take something tangible that is present on another person’s land – and allocated that right to those who held, or had recently held, commercial fishing licences at the time of its commencement. What is a profit à prendre? The nature of a profit à prendre can be gained from the definition in “Easements and Profits à Prendre”, Halsbury’s Laws of England (vol 14, 5th ed, Butterworths, London, 2008) paragraph 254: A profit à prendre is a right to take something off another person's land. It may be more fully defined as a right to enter another's land and to take some profit of the soil, or a portion of the soil itself, for the use of the owner of the right. A profit à prendre is a servitude. Profits à prendre are often contrasted with easements or licences. All three items (profits à prendre, easements and licences) confer a right to enter onto land for a particular purpose. However, the distinguishing feature of a profit à prendre is that it confers an additional right to remove something from the land. While this concept has been used in relation to rights to take trees, turf and minerals, it has also been applied to the taking of fish and other game from land. One of the earlier cases on point is Wickham v Hawker \[1835–42\] All ER 1. The case was concerned with the nature of the right provided to an individual providing the “liberty of hawking, hunting, fishing, and fowling”. The issue was whether this was a personal licence in which case it could be exercised only by the individual or whether it was a right in the nature of a profit à prendre that could be exercised by servants of the indivdual. Parke B made the following observation (at page 5): This being the rule of law on the subject, the point to be decided here is whether the liberty granted is a mere personal licence of pleasure, or a grant of a licence of profit – a profit à prendre. The liberty of fowling has been decided, in one case, to be a profit à prendre, and may be prescribed for as such (Davies’ Case (1688) 3 Mod Rep 246). The liberty to hawk is one species of ancupium ..., the taking of birds by hawks, and seems to follow the same rule. The liberty of fishing appears to be of the same nature; it implies that the person who takes the fish, takes for his own benefit: it is common of fishing. The conclusion of the court was that this grant of the liberty of hawking, hunting, fishing, and fowling was a profit à prendre. This decision was followed by the English Court of Appeal decision in Fitzgerald v Firbank \[1895–9\] All ER 445. This case concerned the nature of a grant of exclusive fishing rights in respect of a section of a river. The court considered the nature of the fishing rights because the defendant had polluted the river by discharging waste products from a gravel works into the river which had a significant detrimental effect on the fish in the river. The plaintiffs brought an action for an injunction to stop further pollution and for damages for the pollution to date. The Court of Appeal decided the case in favour of the plaintiffs. The comments of the various members of the court are useful in terms of identifying the nature of the fishing rights. Lindley LJ made the following comments at page 448: The right of fishing includes the right to take away fish unless the contrary is expressly stipulated. I have not the slightest doubt about that. Therefore, the plaintiffs have got a right of some sort as distinguished from a mere revocable licence. What is that? It is a good deal more than an easement; it is what is commonly called a profit à prendre. It is of such a nature that a person who enjoys that right has possessory rights that he can bring an action for trespass at common law for the infringement of those rights. Rigby LJ, in agreeing with Lindley LJ, went on to state at page 450: 7 I hold that, on the incorporeal hereditament, there is a right of action against any person who disturbs them, either by trespass, or by nuisance, or in any other substantial manner. This decision was followed by Farwell J in Nicholls v Ely Beet Sugar Factory Ltd \[1931\] All ER 154. That case concerned the plaintiff’s ability to bring an action of nuisance seeking an injunction to stop the defendant polluting a river in which the plaintiff held two fishing rights. The defendant sought to defend the action by arguing that the plaintiff’s title was not sufficient title to maintain the action in nuisance. The court held that the plaintiff’s title, which was a profit à prendre, was sufficient to enable the plaintiff to bring an action in trespass or nuisance to protect that right. The above cases demonstrate that a feature of a profit à prendre is the right to remove something from the land. The cases also show that the courts have applied this concept to fishing rights. Therefore, on the basis that fishing quota is a “fishing right”, it is possible that either the individual transferable quota or the annual catch entitlement is a profit à prendre. An interest in land So far, the cases have concluded that the grant of fishing rights is generally a profit à prendre because it includes the right not only to catch the fish but also to take them away. Another important feature of a profit à prendre is identified in Nicholls. This feature is that a profit à prendre is considered an interest in land that, while not explicitly stated in Nicholls, is necessarily assumed by the parties, as the plaintiff was bringing an action of nuisance. A nuisance, according to the definition accepted by Goddard CJ in the English case Howard v Walker \[1947\] 2 All ER 197, 199: Nuisance is the unlawful interference with a person’s use or enjoyment of land, or of some right over, or in connection with it. That a profit à prendre is an interest in land was addressed more directly in Webber v Lee (1882) 9 QBD 315. This case concerned the nature of a right that had been granted over certain land to shoot game and to take it away. The plaintiff was arguing that what had been granted was a mere licence, the defendant argued that the right was a profit à prendre. The English Court of Appeal unanimously decided that the interest was a profit à prendre and an interest in land. While all three judges delivered separate judgments, they all made statements similar to that delivered by Jessel MR (at page 318): The right to shoot game and to take it away when shot has been decided to be an interest in land and a profit à prendre. One consequence of a profit à prendre being an interest in land is that a profit à prendre can be created or granted only by the owner of a sufficient estate or interest in the land. Hinde McMorland & Sim’s Land Law in New Zealand (Vol 2, LexisNexis NZ, Wellington, 2003) states (at page 705): It is also necessary to ensure that the proposed grantor both has title to the product involved and has capacity as grantor if he or she owns an estate less than the fee simple. Therefore, a profit à prendre is a right to take something off someone else’s land. A profit à prendre has been held in several cases to describe certain fishing rights. Further, it is an interest in land. As it is an interest in land, the fishing rights, if they were to constitute a profit à prendre would need to be granted by a person with a legal estate in the land concerned. However, the cases considered so far have only dealt with fishing rights granted over inland waterways, being lakes, rivers, and streams. While some fishing quota are granted in respect of freshwater species, most fishing quota are granted in 8 respect of species that live in the sea. It needs to be considered whether this makes any difference. Can a profit à prendre exist in relation to the sea? The principles identified in the cases considered regarding fishing rights and profits à prendre have been applied to inland waterways. The current situation also involves fishing quota granted over the open seas. The issue is whether the same principles involving profits à prendre can be applied in this instance. Some assistance on this issue can be found in the Privy Council decision in Attorney General for the Province of British Columbia v Attorney General for the Dominion of Canada \[1914\] AC 153. This case concerned the ability of the Government of British Columbia to grant various fishing rights. The Government of the Dominion had exclusive authority over the sea coast and inland fisheries, but the Government of British Columbia had exclusive authority over property and civil rights in the province. The case concerned an area known as the “railway belt”, which included non-tidal and tidal waters. The question was whether the granting of fishing rights over this area was in the domain of the Government of the Dominion or whether such rights were property rights properly in the domain of the Government of British Columbia. The Privy Council acknowledged the distinction between tidal and non-tidal waters. Non-tidal waters are those such as lakes, rivers, and other inland waterways, excluding those parts of rivers and other waterways that meet the sea and as such are tidal. Tidal waters include those areas where non-tidal waters meet tidal waters, at the mouths of streams and in estuaries, as well as the sea coast. The open seas appear to fall into a separate category. The Privy Council held that in respect of non-tidal waters, the right to grant fishing rights is a property right and as such exists with the owner of the underlying land. It is a private property right. In the case of rivers, title to the underlying land may be held by private individuals, but in the case of lakes, the title to the underlying land is typically reserved to the Crown. On the facts of the case, this should have meant that the Government of British Columbia had exclusive authority to grant fishing rights. However, the Government of British Columbia had specifically granted ownership of the particular land in question back to the Government of the Dominion. The railway belt also included tidal waters. The issue was whether the principles that applied to non-tidal waters could have equal application to tidal waters. The Privy Council concluded that the same principles did not apply. In respect of the tidal waters, there was an overriding public right to fish in tidal waters, which was subject to regulation only by the Government of the Dominion. Viscount Haldane stated (at pages 167 and 168): The general principle is that fisheries are in their nature mere profits of the soil over which the water flows, and that title to a fishery arises from the right to the solum. A fishery may of course be severed from the solum, and then it becomes a profit à prendre in alieno solo and an incorporeal hereditament. The severance may be effected by grant or by prescription, but it cannot be brought about by custom, for the origin of such a custom would be an unlawful act. But apart from the existence of such severance by grant or prescription the fishing rights go with the property in the solum. The authorities treat this broad principle as being of general application. They do not regard it as restricted to inland or non-tidal waters. They recognise it as giving to the owners of land on the foreshore or within an estuary or elsewhere where the tide flows and reflows a title to fish in the waters over such lands, and this is equally the case whether the owner be the Crown or a private individual. But in the case of tidal waters (whether on the foreshore or in estuaries or tidal rivers) the exclusive character of the title is qualified by another and paramount title which is prima facie in the public. 9 From these passages, it can be seen that the Privy Council accepted the general principle that fishing rights attach to the land under the water. These rights can be severed, at which point they become profits à prendre. The Privy Council noted that the authorities had treated this general principle as applying to inland waterways as well as tidal waters. However, Viscount Haldane noted a further factor that affected the application of the principle to tidal waters: the overriding public right to fish in tidal waters. The Privy Council noted that the nature of the public right was “not easy to define”. However, the public right was regarded as paramount, which led Viscount Haldane to conclude (at page 173): So far as the waters are tidal the right of fishing in them is a public right subject only to regulation by the Dominion Parliament. Therefore, while the general principle is accepted in respect of non-tidal or inland waterways, the Privy Council concluded that it does not apply in respect of tidal waters. The reason for this is that there is an overriding public right to fish in tidal waters. The Privy Council also reached the same conclusion in relation to the open seas. In specifically addressing fishing rights in waters below the mean low water mark and in the open seas, Viscount Haldane stated (at page 173): Their Lordships have already expressed their opinion that the right of fishing in the sea is a right of the public in general which does not depend on any proprietary title, and that the Dominion has the exclusive right of legislating with regard to it. The effect of this is that the Privy Council rejected the application of the profit à prendre concept in respect of fishing rights relating to tidal waters and the open seas. The basis for the rejection of the profit à prendre concept in relation to fishing rights in respect of tidal waters and the open seas is the existence of an overriding public right to fish in the sea. According to the Privy Council, this title is “paramount” and subject only to regulation by Parliament. The existence of the overriding public right to fish in the sea was a sufficient basis for the Privy Council to decide the matter in British Columbia. However, it is noted that even if the public right had not existed, the Privy Council would not automatically have concluded that the fishing rights were profits à prendre. As a profit à prendre is an interest in land, the person granting the fishing rights needs to have a sufficient interest in the land before the fishing right can be a profit à prendre. Therefore, before the Privy Council could have concluded that the fishing rights were profits à prendre (in the absence of the public right to fish), it would need to be established that the Crown owned the land under the sea in respect of which the fishing rights were granted. The Privy Council regarded the issue as a difficult one, and one that it considered it did not need to answer. Viscount Haldane stated (at page 174): But their Lordships feel themselves relieved from expressing any opinion on the question whether the Crown has a right of property in the bed of the sea below low water mark to what is known as the three-mile limit because they are of the opinion that the right of the public to fish in the sea has been well established in English law for many centuries and does not depend on the assertion or maintenance of any title in the Crown to the subjacent land. Therefore, the particular issue of whether the Crown owns the seabed appears to be a complex issue in English law. While the Privy Council did not reach a conclusion in respect of this matter, it seems clear that the court considered it would have been relevant to a positive finding that the fishing rights were profits à prendre (although the Privy Council concluded that it was not a profit à prendre because of the overriding public right). 10 Application to fishing quota In determining whether fishing quota might be in the nature of a profit à prendre, it is necessary to consider the factors established by the cases and then compare these with the individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements. The first characteristic of a profit à prendre is that it is a right to take something from land. The cases have held that this extends to taking fish from water that flows over land. Under the Fisheries Act 1983, fishing quota might have been argued to satisfy this requirement as being a right to take fish from water that flows over land. Under the Fisheries Act 1996, the position is less arguable. The introduction of the concept of an annual catch entitlement that is severable from the fishing quota perhaps indicates that the right to fish is one step removed from the individual transferable quota. However, given that the annual catch entitlement is generated by the individual transferable quota it is considered that individual transferable quota and the annual catch entitlement can still be regarded as ultimately giving rise to a right to take fish from water that flows over land. The second point is that fishing quota are granted in relation to several different species. These include freshwater species (found in internal waterways) as well as deep sea species. It is considered that there is no express differentiation in the Fisheries Acts of the rights provided in relation to the different species. Accordingly, it is considered that any determination of the nature of the property rights obtained in relation to fishing quota has to apply equally to all quota across the various species. Against this background, the Privy Council decision in British Columbia that an overriding public right to fish in the sea was inconsistent with the existence of a fishing right in the nature of a profit à prendre in relation to the seas poses a potential problem for the characterisation of fishing quota as a profit à prendre. The Privy Council considered that the public right was “paramount” and subject only to regulation by Parliament. The acknowledgement that this public right is subject to regulation by Parliament is important in the New Zealand context. It appears that Parliament in New Zealand has regulated the right to fish in the sea through the Fisheries Acts and associated legislation. While a public right to fish in the sea still appears to exist (with the right being limited as to the size and number of fish that may be caught), it seems clear that this is no longer an overriding public right to fish. The rights created under the quota management system now appear to be the paramount rights. The effect of this is that it is considered that the primary concern of the Privy Council in British Columbia does not appear to be as relevant in a New Zealand context. The final characteristic of a profit à prendre is that it is an interest in land. This means that the profit à prendre needs to have been created by a person with a legal interest in the land. In this regard, problems may exist for fishing quota granted in respect of freshwater species. In relation to inland waterways, the owner of the adjacent land generally owns the land lying under the waterway where the waterway is contained on the land owned by the person, and to the midpoint where the waterway forms a border of the property. This principle is subject to certain exceptions where the Crown has asserted ownership of the underlying land – as may have occurred in the case of lakes and navigable rivers. Thus, the case for a fishing quota being regarded as a profit à prendre encounters difficulties in relation to fishing quota allocated in respect of freshwater species, because it is not clear whether the Crown would own all of the underlying land in question, from which it could grant an interest in land in the nature of a profit à prendre. 11 The situation is even more uncertain in relation to the seabed and foreshore. “Sovereign rights” are conferred on New Zealand in respect of its exclusive economic zone (comprising those areas of the sea, seabed, and subsoil that are beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea, and extending 200 nautical miles from the coast) through article 56 of the United Nations Convention on the Laws of the Sea. However, New Zealand did not ratify the convention until 19 July 1996, meaning that any fishing quota allocated between 1986 and 1996 could not have been granted by the Crown relying on the rights conferred under the convention. In any case, in Ngati Apa v Attorney-General \[2003\] NZCA 117 (19 June 2003), the Court of Appeal held that the vesting provision in section 7 of the Territorial Sea, Contiguous Zone, and Exclusive Economic Zone Act 1977 was not sufficient to extinguish the customary title where it was found to exist. The court found that the Act was primarily concerned with sovereignty, not property rights. The title vested in the Crown was “radical title” (title acquired with the acquisition of sovereignty), which was not inconsistent with native title. The Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004 was subsequently enacted, and expressly vested the “public foreshore and seabed”, as defined under that Act, in the Crown. Section 13(1) of the Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004 provides that full legal and beneficial ownership of the “public foreshore and seabed” is vested in the Crown. The “public foreshore and seabed” as defined in that Act, extends only as far as the outer limits of the territorial sea, which remains at 12 nautical miles from the coast of New Zealand. The effect of this legislative amendment is to ‘reinstate’ the Crown’s full ownership of the seabed of the territorial sea. However, fishing quota are granted in respect of quota management areas, which extend 200 nautical miles from the mean high water mark along the coast of New Zealand. The Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004 does not deal with the areas that extend beyond the territorial sea. Accordingly, whether the Crown owns a sufficient interest in the land from which it could grant an interest in the nature of a profit à prendre is unclear. There are further factors from which guidance can be obtained as to whether fishing quota can be regarded as a profit à prendre. When the fisheries legislation is considered as a whole and in a wider statutory setting, it is considered that other factors support a conclusion that Parliament did not intend a fishing quota to be a profit à prendre. An example is the Forestry Rights Registration Act 1983, where Parliament specifically refers to a forestry right being a profit à prendre. The absence of a similar provision in relation to fishing quota perhaps becomes more significant. A further example is the Personal Property Securities Act 1999 where individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements are specifically excluded from the ambit of that Act under section 23(e)(xii). While excluding fishing quota in general from an Act dealing with personal property might tend to support a conclusion that individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements are perhaps rights that arise under a profit à prendre, an interest in land, and not personal property, the method of exclusion suggests that Parliament did not exclude them on this basis. The exclusion provisions in section 23(e) of the Personal Property Securities Act 1999 contain general exclusions for interests in land, and a specific exclusion for individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements. If individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements were regarded as rights that arise under a profit à prendre and an interest in land, the specific exclusion would not have been needed. The result is that there are difficulties with individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements being regarded as rights that arise under a profit à prendre. While there are similarities between their characteristics and the 12 characteristics of a profit à prendre, there are also fundamental inconsistencies in the characteristics that indicate that individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements are not rights that arise under a profit à prendre. For example, regarding fishing quota (whether individual transferable quota or annual catch entitlements) as a profit à prendre leads to difficulties in relation to individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements allocated in respect of freshwater species because the Crown would not own all of the underlying land in question, from which it could grant an interest in land in the nature of a profit à prendre. The effect of these conclusions on the nature of individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements leads to the possibility that individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements are unique property rights, with the rights and obligations in respect of the property determined from the statute creating the right (as alluded to earlier). Unique property right The decision in British Columbia was cited with approval by the full High Court of Australia in Harper v Minister for Sea Fisheries (1989) 168 CLR 314. While this case concerned whether payments made by commercial fishers for fishing licences were a “tax”, the court made useful observations regarding the nature of the Australian fishing licence system. The court noted the similarities between the rights obtained under a commercial licence and the rights obtained under a profit à prendre. However, the court concluded that the fishing rights were not profits à prendre, but instead were statutory rights created under the particular statutory regime. Mason CJ and Deane and Gaudron JJ stated (at page 325): The right of commercial exploitation of a public resource for personal profit has become a privilege confined to those who hold commercial licences. This privilege can be compared to a profit à prendre. In truth, however, it is an entitlement of a new kind created as part of a system for preserving a limited public natural resource in a society which is coming to recognize that, in so far as such resources are concerned, to fail to protect may destroy and to preserve the right of everyone to take what he or she will may eventually deprive that right of all context. Conclusion on the nature of fishing quota From the above analysis, it is concluded that individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements are not usufruct rights nor are they the sale of goods coupled with a licence. It is noted, however, that the rights granted under the individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements are similar to the rights that arise under a profit à prendre. The individual transferable quota generates an annual catch entitlement that provides a person with the right to take a certain amount of a certain item (being a species of fish) from a certain area. These are the basic characteristics of a profit à prendre. While the rights seem similar, the courts have held that a profit à prendre cannot exist in respect of tidal waters and the open seas, and further that only the owner of an interest in land can create a profit à prendre. As the Crown ownership of the land under the water in respect of which an individual transferable quota is granted is not completely determined and for the various other reasons considered above, it is concluded that individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements are not profits à prendre. The effect of this is that individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements cannot be categorised as usufruct rights, sales of goods coupled with a licence, or profits à prendre. Individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements have to be regarded as unique property rights, with their characteristics determined from the provisions of the fishing legislation as set out by Tipping J in New Zealand Fishing Industry Association. This is consistent with the Australian decision in Harper. It could also be seen to be consistent 13 with the position set out by the Law Commission referred to above, where the rights are akin to, but not the same as, a profit à prendre. It also reflects the statement made by Baragwanath J in Antons Trawling Co Ltd. It is noted that the general characteristics of individual transferable quota were set out in section 27 of the Fisheries Act 1996, but that section has since been repealed. It is considered that section 27 was repealed as being redundant, in that it merely summarised the characteristics found in other sections of the Fisheries Act 1996. Coastal permits and certificates of compliance The definition of “goods” in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 requires that the item concerned be either real or personal property. The nature of coastal permits and certificates of compliance needs to be considered. Nature of a resource consent and certificate of compliance Section 87 of the Resource Management Act 1991 defines a “resource consent” to include a consent to do something in a coastal marine area that otherwise would contravene certain provisions of the Resource Management Act and calls this kind of consent a “coastal permit”. Both these terms, “resource consent” and “coastal permit” are relevant because some provisions of the Resource Management Act relate to coastal permits and some relate to the more general resource consent. Section 88 of the Resource Management Act 1991 provides that resource consents are to be obtained from the local or regional council by application. Section 139 of the Resource Management Act provides that where an activity may be lawfully carried out without a resource consent, a certificate of compliance must be applied for instead. Section 139(6) deems a certificate of compliance to be a resource consent with the result that the provisions of the Resource Management Act are to apply accordingly. Being a “resource consent” means that the rights attaching to the resource consent are governed by section 122 of the Resource Management Act. Section 122 of the Resource Management Act 1991 states that “a resource consent is neither real nor personal property”. This statement is interesting. It is well established that all property is either real or personal property. On this basis, the only sensible interpretation that can be placed on this provision is that Parliament did not want all of the common law and other rights that would automatically attach to property of this nature to attach to resource consents. Parliament must have wanted to regulate the rights that attach to a resource consent. This is consistent with the rest of the section, which goes on to deal with the characteristics of resource consents for the purposes of other legislation. Unfortunately, there is no statement regarding the revenue Acts. The issue, therefore, is whether the statement in section 122 of the Resource Management Act 1991 applies to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Not real nor personal property In determining whether section 122 of the Resource Management Act 1991 affects the classification of a resource consent as a “good” under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, several observations can be made. The first observation is that the definition in section 122 of the Resource Management Act 1991 is not a standard definition. It is not contained in section 2 of the Resource Management Act along with all the other definitions that are 14 prefaced with the words “for the purposes of this Act”. Therefore, Parliament may well have intended section 122 to have an application wider than simply the Resource Management Act. A second observation can be derived from the wording of section 122 of the Resource Management Act 1991. After making the initial statement that a resource consent is not real or personal property, the section provides specific exceptions where resource consents are to be regarded as having the characteristics of personal property in several specific Acts and circumstances. One of these Acts is the Personal Property Securities Act 1999. The Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 is not included as one of the exceptions in section 122. This seems a clear indication from Parliament that the opening statement was intended to apply to the Acts that are dealt with in the section. To take the Personal Property Securities Act 1999 as an example, it seems from the plain wording of the section that Parliament intended that the opening words of the section would have meant that resource consents were not real or personal property for the purposes of that Act. This was why Parliament inserted subsection (4) to make it clear that for the purposes of that Act, it was appropriate for a resource consent to be regarded as goods within the meaning of that Act. This, however, does not make a resource consent goods or personal property for other purposes though. On this basis, it seems that the statement in section 122 of the Resource Management Act 1991, that resource consents are neither real nor personal property, would also apply for the purposes of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. By not making a specific exception for the Goods and Services Tax Act, it is only possible to assume that Parliament was content with the initial statement applying to the Goods and Services Tax Act. The third observation, which follows from the second, is that the intention of the section is apparent from the words used. By making the statement that a resource consent is neither real nor personal property, Parliament has created a legal fiction. A resource consent has the general characteristics of property, and the law has only two categorisations of that property – real and personal. Therefore, in discerning the intention of Parliament in making this statement, the most logical conclusion is that Parliament did not want the natural common law rights to attach to a resource consent that would attach as a matter of course if the resource consent were real or personal property. It has been established that resource consents, and therefore coastal permits and certificates of compliance, are deemed not to be “personal or real property” under section 122 of the Resource Management Act 1991. It has also been established that this deeming provision operates for purposes outside the Resource Management Act and so also affects the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Unlike the Personal Property Securities Act 1999, the Goods and Services Tax Act is not excluded from the operation of section 122. Therefore, coastal permits and certificates of compliance are not personal or real property but, as resource consents, are statutory rights created under the Resource Management Act. Legislation Having established the nature of fishing quota and coastal permits and certificates of compliance, the next issue involves determining the relevant GST legislation. Section 20 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 concerns the calculation of the amount of tax payable. Section 20(1) provides that every registered person 15 shall calculate the amount of GST payable by that person in accordance with the provisions of section 20. In relation to secondhand goods, section 20(2) requires sufficient records to be maintained of supplies of secondhand goods. Section 20 also deals with input tax deductions. In particular, section 20(3) provides that a person may deduct input tax paid in relation to the supply of secondhand goods to which section 3A(1)(c) of the input tax definition applies, to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during that taxable period in calculating the amount of output tax payable by that person. Section 20(3) also takes account of taxpayers who operate on different accounting bases. Under section 20(3) of the Goods and Services Tax 1985, a registered person may deduct from the amount of output tax payable, an amount of “input tax” in accordance with paragraph (a) or paragraph (b). “Input tax” is defined in section 3A. Section 3A(1)–(3) provides: (1) Input tax, in relation to a registered person, means (a) tax charged under section 8(1) on the supply of goods and services made to that person, being goods and services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies: (b) tax levied under section 12(1) of this Act on goods entered for home consumption under the Customs and Excise Act 1996 by that person, being goods applied or acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies: (c) an amount determined under subsection (3) after applying subsection (2). (2) In the case of a supply by way of sale to a registered person of secondhand goods situated in New Zealand, the amount of input tax is determined under subsection (3) if— (a) The supply is not a taxable supply; and (b) The goods are not supplied by a supplier who— (i) Is a non-resident; and (ii) Has previously supplied the goods to a registered person who has entered them for home consumption under the Customs and Excise Act 1996; and (c) The goods are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies and— (i) The taxable supplies are not charged with tax at the rate of 0% under section 11A(1)(q) or (r); or (ii) The taxable supplies are charged with tax at the rate of 0% under section 11A(1)(q) or (r) and the goods have never, before the acquisition, been owned or used by the registered person or by a person associated with the registered person. (3) The amount of input tax is – (a) if the supplier and the recipient are associated persons, the lesser of - (i) the tax included in the original cost of the goods to the supplier; and (ii) the tax fraction of the purchase price; and (iii) the tax fraction of the open market value of the supply; or (b) if the supplier and the recipient are associated persons and the supplier is deemed to have made a supply of the goods under section 5(3) that has been valued under section 10(7A), the lesser of – (i) the tax fraction of the open market value of the deemed supply under section 5(3); and (ii) the tax fraction of the purchase price; and (iii) the tax fraction of the open market value of the supply; or (c) if the supplier and the recipient are associated persons and the supplier is deemed to have made a supply of the goods under section 5(3) that has been valued under section 10(8), the lesser of (i) the tax fraction of the valuation under section 10(8) of the deemed supply under section 5(3); and (ii) the tax fraction of the purchase price; and (iii) the tax fraction of the open market value of the supply; or (d) if the supplier and the recipient are not associated persons and the supply is not the only matter to which the consideration relates, the lesser of – 16 (i) the tax fraction of the purchase price; and (ii) the tax fraction of the open market value of the supply; or (e) in all other cases, the tax fraction of the consideration in money for the supply. Section 3A(1)(c) of the definition of “input tax” is the relevant provision. It refers to the calculation of input tax through subsections (2) and (3) when the supply is one of “secondhand goods”. The term “secondhand goods” is defined in section 2: Secondhand goods does not include (a) Secondhand goods consisting of any fine metal; or (b) Secondhand goods which are, or to the extent to which they are, manufactured or made from gold, silver, platinum, or any other substance which, if it were of the required fineness, would be fine metal: or (c) Livestock: Section 2 also defines the term “goods”: Goods means all kinds of personal or real property; but does not include choses in action, money or a product that is transmitted by a non-resident to a resident by means of a wire, cable, radio, optical or other electromagnetic system or by means of a similar technical system: Application of the legislation The starting place to determine whether a GST input tax credit is available to a registered person is section 20(3) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Irrespective of the basis of registration, the Act provides similar tests for claiming an input tax credit in respect of supplies of secondhand goods. The claim is limited to the amount of “input tax” in relation to a supply of goods or services to that registered person, “to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during the taxable period”. The relevant definition of “input tax” is in section 3A(1)(c) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. In determining the input tax under paragraph (c) it is necessary to consider subsections (2) and (3). Leaving aside the associated persons provisions (which are not relevant to the current rulings), six requirements need to be satisfied under the two subsections. These requirements are that: (i) there be a supply by way of sale; (ii) the supply not be a taxable supply; (iii) the supply be made to a GST-registered person; (iv) the supply be of secondhand goods; (v) the secondhand goods be situated in New Zealand at the time of supply; and (vi) the secondhand goods are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Most of these requirements are specified in the rulings to ensure they will be satisfied in every instance in which the ruling applies. However, the requirement that the supply be of secondhand goods needs to be considered in detail because it cannot be specified in the rulings. Therefore, it is necessary to determine whether individual transferable quota, annual catch entitlements, coastal permits and certificates of compliance can be secondhand goods. 17 “Secondhand goods” The definition of “secondhand goods” does not define the term, but prescribes a list of things that are not included in the meaning of “secondhand goods”. Fishing quota, coastal permits, and certificates of compliance are not excluded under the definition. As the definition gives little indication as to what is included in the term, regard needs to be had to the ordinary meaning of “secondhand goods”. The first observation is that “secondhand goods” is a composite term. It relates to items that are first of all “goods”, and then the subset of those goods that can be described as “secondhand”. “Goods” In considering what is comprised in the term “goods”, assistance can be found in section 2 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. “Goods” is defined widely in the initial part of the definition, and then subjected to three specific exclusions. It includes all kinds of real and personal property, but excludes choses in action, money and electronic products (only the first of which is relevant here). Therefore, it is necessary to establish whether fishing quota, coastal permits, and certificates of compliance are real or personal property and then, whether they are choses in action. “Property” Before considering the “real” or “personal” aspects of property, the nature of “property” should first be established. The term “property” is not defined in the Act. “Stamp Duty”, Halsbury's Laws of England (vol 44, 5th ed, Butterworths, London, 2008, paragraph 1,032), provides the following description of “property”: “Property” is that which belongs to a person exclusively of others, and can be the subject of bargain and sale. It includes goodwill, trade marks, licences to use a patent, book debts, options to purchase and other rights under a contract... A revocable licence is not property. An owner of unworked minerals who gives an undertaking to the surface owner not to work them does not thereby convey property, and a grant of a purported exclusive right to carry on a certain business in an area when the grantor has no such right is not a conveyance of property. A similar view is taken in Garrow and Fenton’s Law of Personal Property (6th ed, Butterworths, Welington, 1998, at page 2): The term “property” has at least two meanings within the law of Commonwealth countries including New Zealand. It may signify the title to all rights of ownership in goods or other property; for example, when s 20 of the Sale of Goods Act 1908 provides by r 1 that in a contract for the sale of ascertained goods in a deliverable state the “property” in the goods passes at the time the contract is made, “property” means the title to or ownership of the goods in question. The second, more general use, signifies the thing owned, that over which title is exercised. For example, when it is said that a person’s property includes cars, books, royalty rights, and other property it is normally the second sense of the word “property” that is intended. In the first sense a person has property in a particular item; in the second sense, it is said that a person owns certain items of property. The context generally indicates which form is used. From this, it can be seen that the term “property” is used to describe a wide range of things, both tangible and intangible. Its fundamental characteristics seem to be that it is capable of being owned and that the rights of ownership are capable of being transferred (see, for instance, the House of Lords decision in National Provincial Bank Ltd v Ainsworth \[1965\] 2 All ER 472). “Property” needs to be able to be defined and identified, and have a degree of permanence or stability. Further, it needs to able to be transferred. 18 “Real” and “personal” property It is a well-established principle of English law that all “property” can be categorised as real property or personal property. As Garrow and Fenton in Law of Personal Property (6 th ed, Butterworths, Wellington, 1998, page 1) explain: The distinction between real property (or realty) and personal property (personalty) is procedural in origin and is derived from the ancient forms of action in English law. In the twelfth century, the possession of freehold land and hereditaments was recoverable by certain actions called “real” actions; by “mixed” actions if both land and damages were claimed and “personal” actions if only damages were claimed. Remedies for interference with goods were seen to be in personam, giving rise to damages, rather than in rem. The existence of only two classes of property has its origin in these two types of action. The acknowledgement that property is either real or personal is contained in the first sentence of the following quotation from Garrow and Fenton (at page 3): The distinction between land and personalty requires further qualification. Real property includes, besides estates and interests in land, things which are said to “savour of the realty”. The effect of there being only two classes of property, one being real and the other personal, is that a finding that something is property necessarily means that it will be either real or personal property. There is no third category. Therefore, in terms of the definition of “goods”, if the item is “property”, then it will be either real or personal property. A question arises as to to the necessity of determining whether fishing quota are real or personal property. The section includes both types of property and as long as property is one or the other a final determination should not be needed. While this is true, attempting to classify the property as either real or personal helps to determine whether the item is a chose in action. The reason for this is that the distinction between chose in action and chose in possession appears to be limited to personal property. Exclusion for “choses in action” The term “chose in action” is used to describe various types of personal property. It is not a term that is applied to real property. This observation was made in the English case Torkington v Magee \[1900–3\] All ER 991 where Channell J defined the term (at page 994): Chose in action is a known legal expression used to describe all personal rights of property which can only be claimed or enforced by action, and not by taking physical possession. \[Emphasis added\]. Therefore, a finding that an item is real property means that the exclusion for choses in action will not be relevant. However, a finding that the item is personal property means that the exclusion for choses in action could be relevant. In determining the characteristics of a chose in action, several commentators refer to the above quotation from Torkington v Magee as providing a useful working definition. In a New Zealand context, the Court of Appeal considered the issue in Re Marshall (Deceased), CIR v Public Trustee \[1965\] NZLR 851. This case considered a situation involving a right to demand interest on a loan, and whether this was a chose in action for the purposes of the Death Duties Act 1921. In considering the issue of a “chose in action”, McCarthy J stated (at page 860): The right was property, for property in its wider sense includes all things of value. It was personal property and “all personal things are either in possession or in action. The law knows no tertium quid between the two”. This celebrated statement of Fry LJ in Colonial Bank v Whinney (1885) 30 Ch D 261 at p 285, is familiar to every lawyer. It received, I 19 think the express, but certainly the implied approval of the House of Lords on appeal ((1886) 11 AC 426). McCarthy J provides further guidance on the characteristics of choses in action (at page 861): That is so because if the right to give the notice and the corresponding duty to accept it had been denied, there was no possible method of enforcement other than going to law and thereby securing not the physical possession of the thing but the advantages of its ownership. This, says Mr Cyprian Williams in his article in (1895) 11 LQR 223, is the true test, and I agree. ... The characteristics that one cannot take the right into physical possession (even after judgment in one’s favour) and that it can only be vindicated by Court action, are the qualifying features of a chose in action and have become the bases of most modern definitions \[Emphasis added\]. The fundamental characteristic of a chose in action is the same in both authorities. Both authorities refer to the fact that in respect of a chose in action, one cannot take the right into physical possession. Being able to take the thing into possession is a characteristic of a chose in possession. Even if court action is taken to enforce the chose in action, the result may well be that the advantages of ownership are secured rather than actual physical possession of the thing. “Secondhand” There have been few cases on the meaning of the term “secondhand goods” in the GST context. In Case N16 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,142 District Court Judge Barber had to consider whether deer velvet purchased direct from producers by means of commission agents was a secondhand good when it was purchased by a distributor and exporter of deer velvet. Judge Barber concluded that the deer velvet was not a secondhand good. Judge Barber accepted that the two key concepts underlying whether something is secondhand are previous ownership and previous use. He stated at page 3,148: I agree with counsel that the concept of secondhand relates to pre-ownership or pre-use. I agree ... that the emphasis is on pre-use. I consider that there is quite some commonsense flexibility in ascertaining whether a good is still new or has become secondhand. I do not regard second ownership as necessarily rendering an item secondhand. Many goods pass from manufacturer to wholesaler or retailer to customer or consumer (with other levels of distributors sometimes also involved), and yet are not regarded as secondhand at the consumer purchaser level, even though the item has been used as stock-in-trade at the various distribution levels. The good is not usually regarded as secondhand until it has been used for its intrinsic purpose. The Taxation Review Authority felt that previous ownership of goods is not in itself necessarily sufficient to meet the test of secondhand in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Usually a previous owner must have also used the goods for their intrinsic purpose. Subsequently the Court of Appeal considered the meaning of secondhand in LR McLean & Co Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,211. McKay J expressly referred to and agreed with Judge Barber’s comments in Case N16 as to the ordinary meaning of the term “secondhand”. Justice Richardson (as he then was) stated (at page 11,213): The short point of the appeal is whether wool purchased by registered persons from unregistered persons is secondhand goods for the purposes of the 1985 Act. If the expression secondhand goods is given its ordinary and natural meaning it is common ground that it is not within that description. In ordinary usage the expression refers to goods which have been used, although depending on the context it may apply to goods which are no longer new or even in some contexts goods which have simply been previously owned. Mr Harley for the appellants did not seek to draw any distinction based on “use” of the wool by the sellers. The argument for the appellants is that to accord with the scheme 20 and purpose of the legislation the expression has to be given the meaning of any goods which have been purchased by a registered person. The judgments of the Court of Appeal state that the term “secondhand” should be given its ordinary or normal meaning. While “secondhand” can mean pre- owned or pre-used, the court concluded that it is not sufficient that the goods were previously owned. If an item were “secondhand” simply through being previously owned, the term “secondhand” would be deprived of any practical meaning according to Richardson J. Therefore, the Court of Appeal concluded that the more relevant factor is whether the goods have been previously used. The effect of this is that the courts have not extended the meaning of the term “secondhand goods” to goods that have been previously owned but not previously used for their intrinsic purpose. Application to fishing quota Is fishing quota “property”? When these concepts are applied to fishing quota, it seems that both individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements constitute property. They are definable and identifiable through being granted under a statutory regime. Both are capable of being owned and specific legislative provisions in the Fisheries Act 1996 deal with the ability of individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements to be transferred. On this basis, it can be accepted that a fishing quota is “property”. Is fishing quota real or personal property? The next issue is whether individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements are real or personal property. Their characteristics are determined by considering the legislation under which they are created. Under section 66 of the Fisheries Act 1996 (previously section 28O of the Fisheries Act 1983) the holders of individual transferable quota obtain a right to receive an annual catch entitlement for the species that is the subject of the quota. While the annual catch entitlement is defined by reference to a “quota management area”, nothing in either of the Fisheries Acts suggests that it was intended that individual transferable quota or annual catch entitlements gives rise to an interest in land. Therefore, based on this and the earlier conclusion that neither individual transferable quota nor annual catch entitlements are profits à prendre, it is considered that they are neither an interest in land nor real property. As individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements are “property” and property is either “real” or “personal”, the conclusion that individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements are not real property leads also to the conclusion that they must be personal property. As individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements are personal property, they will fall within the words “all kinds of real and personal property” in the definition of “goods” in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Therefore, it is considered that this first part of the definition is satisfied. The next question is whether either of the two exclusions to the definition applies. Is fishing quota a “chose in action”? On the issue of whether individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements are choses in action, it is established by the cases that the fundamental characteristic of a chose in action is that one cannot take the right into physical possession. 21 Both individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements appear to possess this characteristic. The right to catch fish directly or indirectly cannot be taken into possession. While an argument could be made that a person could simply catch the fish under the quota, this seems to confuse the fish (which could be taken into possession) with the right to catch those fish (which, it is considered, cannot be taken into possession). The result is that it is concluded that both individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements are choses in action. While they are capable of satisfying the first part of the definition of “goods”, being a form of personal property, they are then excluded from the definition of “goods” by reason that they are choses in action. The effect of this is that neither can be regarded as being “goods” for the purposes of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Given that it is concluded that individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements are not “goods” in terms of the definition in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, there is no need to consider the further issue of whether they could be regarded as “secondhand”. Because it is concluded that individual transferable quota and annual catch entitlements are not “goods”, it is also concluded that they cannot be “secondhand goods”. Application to coastal permits and certificates of compliance The consequences of section 122 of the Resource Management Act 1991 need to be applied to the definition of “goods” in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The term “goods” means “all kinds of personal or real property”. It has been established that, under section 122, coastal permits and certificates of compliance are deemed not to be “personal or real property”. It has also been established that the deeming provision operates for purposes outside the Resource Management Act and so affects the Goods and Services Tax Act. As there is no legislative modification of the statement in respect of the Goods and Services Tax Act, coastal permits and certificates of compliance do not constitute “goods” for the purposes of the Goods and Services Tax Act as they are not personal or real property. Therefore, the further issue of whether they are “secondhand goods” does not need to be considered. 22
LEASE SURRENDER PAYMENTS RECEIVED BY A LANDLORD—INCOME TAX TREATMENT Note (not part of ruling): This ruling is essentially the same as Public Ruling BR Pub 00/12 which was published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 13, No 1 (January 2001). BR Pub 00/12 was a reissue of BR Pub 97/1 and BR Pub 97/1A which were published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 9, No 1 (January 1997). The Ruling has been amended to take into account the Income Tax Act 2007 and to clarify the Commissioner’s position as taken in BR Pub 00/12. BR Pub 00/12 expired on 31 March 2005. BR Pub 09/06 will apply for an indefinite period beginning on the first day of the 2008/09 income year. PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 09/06 T his is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CB 1, CC 1(1) and CC 1(2). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the receipt of a lease surrender payment by a landlord from a tenant when the landlord, who is in the business of leasing property, agrees to accept the early termination of the lease. For the purposes of this Ruling, and for the avoidance of doubt, the term “business of leasing” has the same meaning as the term “business of renting”, and means the business of letting property for a rent. The business of leasing property need not be the sole activity or the principal activity of the person. However, the activity must be sufficient, of itself, to amount to a business. This Ruling applies only in respect of landlords in the business of leasing. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows:  A lease surrender payment received by a landlord in the business of leasing property is income under section CB 1(1) as an amount derived from a business, unless the surrender of the lease is of such significance to the business that it constitutes the loss of a structural asset and the payment is thereby a capital amount. This will be a question of fact and degree to be determined in the particular circumstances of each case.  A lease surrender payment is not income under sections CC 1(1) and CC 1(2) where the payment is not provided for in the terms of the lease. 1 The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply to payments received by a landlord in the business of leasing for an indefinite period beginning on the first day of the 2008/09 income year. This Ruling is signed by me on 30 June 2009. Susan Price Director, Public Rulings 2 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 09/06 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 09/06 (“the Ruling”). Background The subject matter covered in the Ruling was previously dealt with in Public Rulings BR Pub 97/1, BR Pub 97/1A (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 9, No 1 (January 1997)) and BR Pub 00/12 (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 13, No 1 (January 2001)). The Ruling has been amended to take into account the Income Tax Act 2007 and to clarify the Commissioner’s position as taken in BR Pub 00/12. The Ruling sets out the tax treatment of lease surrender payments received by a landlord who is in the business of leasing. The Ruling does not apply if the landlord is not in the business of leasing. However, it is to be noted that a lease surrender payment received by a landlord who is not in the business of leasing could still be considered to be income of that landlord. Legislation Section CB 1 provides: (1) An amount that a person derives from a business is income of the person. (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to an amount that is of a capital nature. Subsections (1) and (2) of section CC 1 include within a person’s income: (1) An amount described in subsection (2) is income of the owner of land if they derive the amount from— (a) a lease, licence, or easement affecting the land; or (b) the grant of a right to take the profits of the land. (2) The amounts are— (a) rent: (b) a fine: (c) a premium: (d) a payment for the goodwill of a business: (e) a payment for the benefit of a statutory licence: (f) a payment for the benefit of a statutory privilege; or (g) other revenues. Application of the Legislation 1. Section CB 1(1) From a business Under section CB 1(1), the income of a person includes an amount derived from a business. In the Court of Appeal decision in CIR v City Motor Service Ltd; CIR v Napier Motors Ltd \[1969\] NZLR 1,010, Turner J considered what was meant by the words “from any business” in a predecessor provision. His Honour stated (at pages 1,017-1,018): I think perhaps I do no more than reach his conclusion using other words when I say that in my opinion in the words “from the business” of the company something 3 more is meant than merely “as a result of the fact that the company was carrying on this business”. I think that from the business must mean from the current operations of the business. The distinction between capital accretions and revenue operations runs all through the law of income tax. ... and remembering that “Income Tax is always a tax on Income” I conclude without difficulty that the words “from any business” in an Income Tax Act must mean “from the current operations of any business” and no more. They are not, in my opinion, apt to include accretions to the capital assets of the taxpayer which, although they may result from the fact of this carrying on business, yet do not arise from the actual current operations of that business. His Honour went on to consider the decision of the majority of the High Court of Australia in Dickenson v FCT (1958) 98 CLR 460, and then concluded (at page 1,019): But income tax being “always a tax on income”, the crucial question in New Zealand must therefore in result be the same as that in Australia. Is the receipt income or capital? If it is gains or profits from a business, then the question reduces itself to whether these were derived from the current operations of the business, and therefore income, or whether no more can be contended, as regards their connection with the business, than that without the existence of the business they would not have accrued. If no more than this last can be proved, the gains cannot be assessable income, and simply because they are not derived from the current operations of the business. Thus, if a receipt is an amount from a business, it is necessary only to consider whether or not that amount was derived from the current operations of the business in order to determine whether it is within the words “from a business” in section CB 1(1) ie, a revenue amount rather than a capital amount. Richardson J summarised it succinctly when delivering the Court of Appeal judgment in AA Finance Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,383 as follows (at page 11,391): Whether gains produced in a business are revenue or capital depends on the nature of the business and the relationship of the transactions producing the gain to the conduct of the business. ... A transaction may be part of the ordinary business of the taxpayer or, short of that, an ordinary incident of the business activity of the taxpayer although not its main activity. A gain made in the ordinary course of carrying on the business is thus stamped with an income character. Sometimes the amount will not arise from the ordinary course of carrying on a business. The classic statement covering such situations is that of the Lord Justice Clerk in Californian Copper Syndicate Ltd (Limited and Reduced) v Harris (Surveyor of Taxes) (1904) 5 TC 159 (at pages 165-166): It is quite a well settled principle in dealing with questions of assessment of Income Tax, that where the owner of an ordinary investment chooses to realise it, and obtains a greater price for it than he originally acquired it at, the enhanced price is not profit in the sense of Schedule D of the Income Tax Act of 1842 assessable to Income Tax. But it is equally well established that enhanced values obtained from realisation or conversion of securities may be so assessable, where what is done is not merely a realisation or change of investment, but an act done in what is truly the carrying on, or carrying out, of a business. ... ... What is the line which separates the two classes of cases may be difficult to define, and each case must be considered according to its facts; the question to be determined being – Is the sum of gain that has been made a mere enhancement of value by realising a security, or is it a gain made in an operation of business carrying out a scheme for profit-making? 4 This point was further considered by the New Zealand Court of Appeal in Wattie & Anor v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,297, when rejecting the argument that the High Court of Australia decision in FCT v The Myer Emporium Ltd (1987) 87 ATC 4,363 had extended the categories of profit or gain that are treated as revenue amounts. The Court of Appeal considered the following extract from Myer: Although it is well settled that a profit or gain made in the ordinary course of carrying on a business constitutes income, it does not follow that a profit or gain made in a transaction entered into otherwise than in the ordinary course of carrying on the taxpayer’s business is not income. Because a business is carried on with a view to a profit, a gain made in the ordinary course of carrying on the business is invested with the profit-making purpose, thereby stamping the profit with the character of income. But a gain made otherwise than in the ordinary course of carrying on the business which nevertheless arises from a transaction entered into by the taxpayer with the intention or purpose of making a profit or gain may well constitute income. Whether it does depends very much on the circumstances of the case. Generally speaking, however, it may be said that if the circumstances are such as to give rise to the inference that the taxpayer’s intention or purpose in entering into the transaction was to make a profit or gain, the profit or gain will be income, notwithstanding that the transaction was extraordinary judged by reference to the ordinary course of the taxpayer’s business. Nor does the fact that a profit or gain is made as the result of an isolated venture or a “one-off” transaction preclude it from being properly characterized as income ... . The authorities establish that a profit or gain so made will constitute income if the property generating the profit or gain was acquired in a business operation or commercial transaction for the purpose of profit-making by the means giving rise to the profit. The Court of Appeal in Wattie then continued: Immediately afterwards the Court referred to the decision in Californian Copper Syndicate Ltd v Harris (Surveyor of Taxes), (1904) 5 TC 159 as making the point. But that is simply the classic example of the well recognised assessability of a profit derived from an adventure in the nature of trade or, as it is put in a passage then quoted from Californian Copper, “a gain made in an operation of business in carrying out a scheme for profit making”. At p211 the High Court observed that the important proposition to be derived from Californian Copper Syndicate: “... is that a receipt may constitute income, if it arises from an isolated business operation or commercial transaction entered into otherwise than in the ordinary course of the carrying on of the taxpayer’s business, so long as the taxpayer entered into the transaction with the intention or purpose of making a relevant profit or gain from the transaction.” That seems to be a description of an adventure in the nature of trade, a description well able to be applied to what occurred in Myer itself. A gain from an adventure deliberately entered into with a view to the profit, though perhaps unprecedented for the taxpayer, will constitute income. It is a profit-making scheme. The profit is income in accordance with ordinary concepts. Although the decision in Wattie was appealed to the Privy Council ((1998) 18 NZTC 1,991), counsel accepted the Court of Appeal’s interpretation of Myer as “contemplating a profit arising from what is commonly referred to as an adventure in the nature of trade, of the kind illustrated by the decision in Californian Copper”. In circumstances where profits or gains are made outside the ordinary course of a taxpayer’s business, it is necessary to consider whether such a profit or gain is of a revenue or capital nature. If the gain is made by way of the mere realisation of 5 a capital asset, it will be a capital amount. However, if the gain is made by way of what has become known as “an adventure in the nature of trade”, the gain will be a revenue amount. In summary, therefore, the following statements can be made:  An amount arising in the ordinary course of a taxpayer’s business will automatically be treated as having a profit-making purpose and will thus be a revenue amount.  Similarly, an amount arising as an ordinary incident of a taxpayer’s business activity will be a revenue amount.  An amount arising outside the ordinary course of a taxpayer’s business will be a revenue amount if it arises from a business operation or commercial transaction with a profit-making purpose, e.g. an adventure in the nature of trade.  An amount arising outside the ordinary course of a taxpayer’s business will be a capital amount if it arises from the mere realisation of a capital asset, or if the amount is received in circumstances in which it is not possible to find a measurable profit or gain. The critical question in the present case, therefore, is whether the receipt of a lease surrender payment by a landlord in the business of leasing is a receipt arising in the ordinary course of the landlord’s business or as an ordinary incident of that business activity. Ordinary incident of the business activity of leasing In the Commissioner’s opinion, the receipt of a lease surrender payment by a landlord is an ordinary incident of the business activity of leasing. The only exception to this is if the surrender payment is received in respect of a lease which is of such significance to the business that it constitutes a structural asset. This will be a question of fact in the particular circumstances of each case. No New Zealand authorities on the taxation of a lease surrender payment received by a landlord exist, and there are very few overseas authorities on this issue. The New Zealand Court of Appeal did consider a lease surrender payment in CIR v McKenzies New Zealand Ltd (1988) 10 NZTC 5,233. However, this decision concerned the deductibility for a lessee of a lease surrender payment paid to a lessor. While the decision is considered to be good authority in relation to the deductibility of a lease surrender payment for a lessee, the comments made by the Court in that context cannot automatically be applied to the question of the assessability of such a payment to a lessor (ie, symmetrical tax treatment is not required in terms of different parties to the same transaction). The character of a payment for assessability and deductibility purposes has to be tested in the hands of the particular taxpayer. Similarly, the Privy Council decision in Wattie considered the character of leases from the point of view of the lessee. It is considered that the nature of a lease in a lessor’s business is different to that of a lessee. In most cases, a lessee will use the property as accommodation for carrying out its income earning process. The lease will not directly form part of the taxpayer’s profit making activities. The lease will also provide the lessee with an interest in the land which could be considered to be an enduring benefit. However, as far as a taxpayer in the business of leasing is concerned, the lease or leases will generally be part of the income earning process rather than the capital structure. On the surrender of the lease, the lessee no longer has an interest in the land or 6 premises and no longer has a capital asset. The lessor, in contrast, retains possession of the underlying land or premises. A Canadian decision that is potentially relevant is the decision in Monart Corporation v Minister of National Revenue \[1967\] CTC 263. The taxpayer in that case owned a large office building. One of its tenants, occupying one-tenth of the leased floor area of the building, gave notice that it was going to vacate and the taxpayer accepted $75,000 to cancel the lease for the remaining six years of its term. The Court concluded that the sum of $75,000 paid to the taxpayer was in lieu of future rent and was also in the nature of profit derived from a property or business of the taxpayer. It was therefore assessable to the taxpayer. Although Canadian and New Zealand law differs on the characterisation of a lease asset (and the Privy Council in Wattie expressed some doubt as to whether Canadian law in this area could be applied in New Zealand), for present purposes it is relevant to note that Dumoulin J in Monart Corporation stated that the taxpayer corporation’s, “raison d’être, and sole pursuit, consist in the business of renting office accommodation”. His Honour then went on to expressly accept the submission of counsel for the respondent that (at page 271): ... the amount received by the Appellant was paid to it for damages suffered or to be suffered as the result of the premature termination of the lease, and that the termination can be considered as a normal incident in the activities of a landlord renting properties. Some guidance on the question of whether a lease surrender payment is a capital or revenue receipt may be gained from considering cases concerning compensation for termination of agency contracts. An analogy can be drawn between receiving a lease surrender payment (compensation for terminating a lease) and receiving compensation for termination of an agency contract. In Kelsall Parsons & Co v Commissioners of Inland Revenue (1938) 21 TC 608, the taxpayers carried on business as commission agents for the sale in Scotland of the products of various manufacturers, and entered agency agreements for that purpose. One particular agency was cancelled and the taxpayers were paid £1,500 in compensation. The taxpayers claimed it was a capital amount, whereas the Commissioners claimed it was a revenue amount. The Court upheld the Commissioners’ view. The Lord President, Lord Normand, stated (at pages 619-620): The sum which the Appellants received was, as the Commissioners have found, paid as compensation for the cancellation of the agency contract. That was a contract incidental to the normal course of the Appellants’ business. Their business, indeed, was to obtain as many contracts of this kind as they could, and their profits were gained by rendering services in fulfilment of such contracts. ... It was a normal incident of a business such as that of the Appellants that the contracts might be modified, altered or discharged from time to time, and it was quite normal that the business carried on by the Appellants should be adjustable to variations in the number and importance of the agencies held by them, and to modifications of the agency agreements, including modifications of their duration, which might be made from time to time. ... In parting with the benefit of the contract, moreover, the Appellants were not parting with something which could be described as an enduring asset of the business. The contract would have been terminated in any event as at the 30th September, 1935. In Commissioners of Inland Revenue v Fleming & Co (Machinery) Ltd (1951) 33 TC 57, the taxpayer company carried on the business of agents and merchants 7 for the sale of machinery and explosives; the agency work greatly predominating. In 1948 one of its agencies was cancelled and the company received a sum in compensation. The Court of Session (First Division) held that the sum was a revenue receipt. The Lord President, Lord Cooper, noted (at page 61) that the issue belonged to a type exemplified by a number of earlier cases in which, broadly speaking, the line had been drawn between: ... (a) the cancellation of a contract which affects the profit-making structure of the recipient of compensation and involves the loss by him of an enduring trading asset; and (b) the cancellation of a contract which does not affect the recipient’s trading structure nor deprive him of any enduring trading asset, but leaves him free to devote his energies and organisation released by the cancellation of the contract to replacing the contract which has been lost by other like contracts. Lord Russell explained this distinction further (at page 63): When the rights and advantages surrendered on cancellation are such as to destroy or materially to cripple the whole structure of the recipient’s profit-making apparatus, involving the serious dislocation of the normal commercial organisation, and resulting perhaps in the cutting down of the staff previously required, the recipient of the compensation may properly affirm that the compensation represents the price paid for the loss or sterilisation of a capital asset and is therefore a capital and not a revenue receipt. ... On the other hand when the benefit surrendered on cancellation does not represent the loss of an enduring asset in circumstances such as those above mentioned – where for example the structure of the recipient’s business is so fashioned as to absorb the shock as one of the normal incidents to be looked for and where it appears that the compensation received is no more than a surrogatum for the future profits surrendered – the compensation received is in use to be treated as a revenue receipt and not a capital receipt. It was held that the company’s main business consisted of acquiring agencies, and the diminution or increase in the number of agencies (whether prior to the due date of expiration or not) could be regarded as a normal incident of its business. The structure of the company’s business was not affected. The sum received had to be regarded as compensation for loss of profits and not for loss of a profit earning asset. In Wiseburgh v Domville (Inspector of Taxes) \[1956\] 1 All ER 754 (CA), the taxpayer was a manufacturers’ agent. One agency was determined by the principals without the required notice, and the taxpayer suffered a serious reduction in his earnings. The taxpayer brought an action for damages for breach of the contract and for commission due up to the breach. The action was settled and the taxpayer received £4,000, expressed to be damages for the breach of agreement and costs; the claim for commission having been abandoned. Lord Evershed MR noted that at the time the agency was terminated the taxpayer held only two agencies, although he had held a varying number of agencies during his time as an agent. It was also noted that, “the effect of the loss of this contract, quoad the taxpayer’s agency business, was very substantially to depreciate his earnings”. Nevertheless, his Lordship stated (at pages 758-759): Here, the taxpayer has been carrying on a business which for thirteen years has shown variations in the actual agreements which it has comprehended. The business has suffered something perhaps of a disaster by reason of this quarrel with a valuable customer. But, beyond that, it seems to me it is not right to say that the taxpayer had his undertaking as a sales agent partially destroyed or taken away. 8 ... Harman J. said (\[1955\] 3 All ER at p.551): “The taxpayer was a manufacturers’ agent. He had other agencies from time to time and carried on business as an agent, and one of the incidents of such businesses is that one agency may be stopped and another begun. The fact that an agency was a key agency, and was therefore important to him and represented half of his income, seems to me to be irrelevant.” With the possible exception of substituting “inconclusive” for “irrelevant”, I agree entirely with that statement; and I agree with what the judge said later (ibid.): “... it was a normal incident in this kind of business that an agency should come to an end, and it seems to me that the compensation paid is quite clearly income.” Van den Berghs Ltd v Clark (Inspector of Taxes) \[1935\] All ER 874 concerned payments made under agreements entered between competitor companies (both margarine manufacturers) for the sharing of profits and losses and the regulation of their activities. Following a dispute under the agreements, the taxpayer received a payment of £450,000 as “damages” and in consideration of the termination of the agreements. The House of Lords held that the payment was a capital receipt. Lord MacMillan discussed Atherton v The British Insulated & Helsby Cables Ltd \[1926\] AC 213 and then proceeded to consider the facts before him. He considered that it was important to bear in mind that the taxpayer’s trade was to manufacture and deal in margarine. The payment received was in consideration for the taxpayer giving up its rights under the agreements for the following 13 years. Lord MacMillan said (at page 888) that these agreements: ... were not ordinary commercial contracts made in the course of carrying on their trade; they were not contracts for the disposal of their products or for the engagement of agents or other employees necessary for the conduct of their business; nor were they merely agreements as to how their trading profits, when earned, should be distributed as between the contracting parties. On the contrary, the cancelled agreements related to the whole structure of the appellants’ profit-making apparatus. They regulated the appellants’ activities, defined what they might and what they might not do, and affected the whole conduct of their business. I have difficulty in seeing how money laid out to secure, or money received for the cancellation of, so fundamental an organisation of a trader’s activities can be regarded as an income disbursement or an income receipt. ... In the present case, however, it is not the largeness of the sum that is important but the nature of the asset that was surrendered. In my opinion that asset, the congeries of rights which the appellants enjoyed under the agreements and which, for a price they surrendered, was a capital asset. In Barr, Crombie & Co Ltd v CIR (1945) 26 TC 406, from the formation of a shipping company in 1924, the appellant company managed its ships under certain agreements, the latest of which provided that the appellant company should continue to act as managers for the shipping company for 15 years from 1 January 1936. A clause in the contract provided that if the shipping company went into liquidation or ceased to trade, then the remuneration owing to the appellant from that day until the date on which it was due to expire would become immediately payable to the appellant. In 1942 this occurred and the appellant received the amount due. The Lord President, Lord Normand, found that the appellant’s business had consisted almost entirely of the agency. For the previous 16 years it had contributed about 84 percent of the appellant’s income. Upon liquidation of the other company, it lost almost its entire business. Despite the fact that the sum 9 payable was calculated by reference to what the appellant would have received had the company not gone into liquidation, the Lord President found that the sum received was a capital amount. He quoted Lord Buckmaster in Glenboig Union Fireclay Co Ltd v CIR (1922) 12 TC 427 where he said (at page 464): ... although annual payments in the nature of profits may be used as the measure by which to calculate the sum which is to be paid, the resultant sum is not thereby made itself an annual payment or a profit. His Lordship distinguished Kelsall Parsons & Co. He regarded the payment before him as being “once and for all” ie, the price of the surrender of its only important capital asset. In contrast, in Kelsall, the payment was in return for the loss of a single agency contract out of about a dozen, and the fact that the payment in that case did not represent the whole capital asset of the company was shown by the fact that the next year its profits were no less than they had been before. Another contrasting feature was that in that case there was a single payment for the surrender of profits over one year, as opposed to a payment for the surrender of an agreement while there was still a substantial period to run. Lord President Normand considered the case analogous to Van den Berghs in that the structure of the company was radically affected and its whole character as a business decisively altered. He said: ... where you have a payment for the loss of the contract upon which the whole trade of the Company has been built, where the expected profits of the contract are used to measure the loss of them for a period of future years, and where in consequence of the loss the Company’s structure and character are greatly affected, the payment seems to me to be beyond doubt a capital payment. The leading case in New Zealand, regarding the characterisation of a payment received for cancellation of a contract, is the Court of Appeal judgment of CIR v Thomas Borthwick & Sons (Australasia) Ltd (1992) 14 NZTC 9,101. That case involved the receipt by the taxpayer of $2.25m as consideration for the variation and partial surrender of its rights under a long-term supply contract. The issue was how to characterise the receipt in the hands of the recipient. The Court of Appeal stated that the crucial consideration in the case was whether, on the facts, the 1972 supply and marketing contract was to be characterised as providing an advantage for the enduring benefit of Borthwick’s trade and as forming part of the structure of Borthwick’s marketing operations. The Court of Appeal rejected the Commissioner’s argument that in deciding this issue Gallen J had placed too much emphasis on the duration of the marketing rights and too little on its limited impact on the taxpayer’s business as a whole. In applying what it described as being the leading case in which a contract was held to be a structural asset, Van den Berghs Ltd v Clark \[1935\] AC 431, the Court of Appeal stated that “whether a supply and agency contract is structural or revenue turns on the nature and significance of the contract in the operations of the business” (at page 9,105). The Court confirmed that duration, arguably over business share, is significant. Applying the observations of Lord Pearce in BP Australia Ltd v C of T \[1966\] AC 224, the longer the duration, the greater the indication that a structural solution is being sought. The Court, deciding the sum was capital, found on the facts that:  the marketing agreement assured the taxpayer of a long-term source of supply of produce for its marketing business; 10  the supply of produce replaced the previously held capital asset, i.e. the freezing works, and in that way the agreement was then the framework for making profits from the South Island;  globally the agreement was of major significance to the taxpayer’s business ie, 40 percent increase in share of New Zealand lamb kill;  the size of the payment indicated the agreement’s value and importance to the business. An analogy can be drawn between the receipt of compensation for the termination of a contract, and the receipt of a lease surrender payment on the termination of a lease. Whether a lease is always a capital asset Some commentators have suggested that McKenzies is authority for the proposition that a lease will always be a capital asset to both a lessor and a lessee (unless the taxpayer is in the business of buying and selling leases). Certain quotes in the judgment could be seen to support this view – most notably Richardson J’s comment that “\[h\]ere, as in the case of most taxpayers, the lease was part of the profit making structure of the business”. However, it is not clear from the judgment whether Richardson J was intending to include lessors within this, or whether he was referring to lessees whose leases would (unless the lessee was in the business of acquiring leases to sell) generally be capital assets. To the extent that Richardson J was suggesting that the quote applied more widely to lessors as well, such comments are obiter dicta, not being relevant to deciding the issue in dispute (which involved McKenzies as a lessee making a lease surrender payment). Further, if the case is suggesting that a lease will always be some kind of capital “asset” for a lessor, in whatever circumstances, it is the Commissioner's view that this interpretation of the judgment overstates the situation for the reasons set out above. Summary In general, it is a normal incident of the business of leasing that leases might be modified, altered, or surrendered from time to time and it is quite normal that such a business should be able to take into account such modifications, alterations, or surrenders. However, in certain circumstances the surrender of a lease may constitute the loss of an enduring asset of the business and the receipt of a lease surrender payment by the landlord may be a capital amount. The more fundamental to the landlord’s business a particular lease is, the more likely the payment will relate to the giving up of an enduring asset in the form of part of the business structure and will be considered capital in nature. This will be a question of fact in any particular case. The cases discussed above indicate that the following principles will apply:  It is necessary to ascertain whether the cancelled lease is of such a nature and significance to the landlord’s business so as to form part of the profit-making structure. If this is the case, then the related payment will be capital. However, where the cancelled lease does not form part of the profit-making structure or deprive the landlord of an enduring asset, then the cancellation of such a lease returns the underlying capital asset to the taxpayer to use to earn income. In such 11  In determining the nature and significance of the lease in relation to the landlord’s activity, regard may be had to the duration of the agreement and also to whether the landlord ordinarily enters into such agreements. In this respect, the more fundamental the agreement is to the landlord’s business (ie, the more “crippled” the business is subsequent to the agreement’s cancellation) the more likely it is to be capital.  Where a lease is surrendered and the property concerned cannot readily be leased again (for example where the property has been set up for a particular purpose which is specific to the lessee), the lease surrender payment may be considered to be a capital amount.  The method of calculation of the sum payable is not determinative (however, where a lease surrender payment is merely commutation of rent that would otherwise have been payable under the lease, this may point towards the payment being revenue in nature).  If the lease constitutes the whole structure of the profit making apparatus, the receipt may be on capital account.  If the landlord has several leases as part of its business structure and the receipt relates to only one of them, then generally the receipt will not relate to the capital structure. However, this may not be the position if the one lease out of several constitutes a significant part of the business. It is to be noted, in this regard, that if the facts of a situation suggest that a taxpayer has structured its, or its group’s, affairs in a particular way for the purpose or effect of converting a revenue receipt into a capital receipt, the Commissioner may consider the application of the anti-avoidance provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007. Conclusion The receipt of a lease surrender payment by a landlord in the business of leasing is a normal incident of that business. Such a receipt will therefore constitute income within section CB 1(1) as an amount derived from a business. The only exception to this is where the surrender payment is received in respect of a lease that is of such significance to the landlord’s business that it constitutes a structural asset. This will be a question of fact in the particular circumstances of each case. Although the Ruling deals only with the receipt of a lease surrender payment by a landlord in the business of leasing, it should be noted that the fact that a lease surrender payment is received by a landlord who is not in the business of leasing will not automatically exclude that payment from the landlord’s income. It will still be necessary to consider whether the payment is to be included as a revenue amount on some other basis, such as on the basis that the amount arose from an adventure in the nature of trade. Equally, the receipt could be a normal incident of some other business activity of the recipient and thus a revenue receipt. If the lease surrender payment is simply a lump sum payment to reflect lost rent, it is likely that it would be a revenue receipt. 12 Example 1 Landlord A owns a number of commercial properties, and is in the business of leasing them. She leases one building to Tenant. Landlord A and Tenant execute a lease for 15 years at a rental of $50,000 per annum: the rental being reviewable every five years. The lease provides for one right of renewal for a further 15-year period. Five years into the lease, Tenant’s business outgrows Landlord A’s building. Tenant moves the business to another property. Tenant offers to pay Landlord A $200,000 if she will accept a surrender of the lease by Tenant and the cancellation of all Tenant’s obligations under the lease. Landlord A agrees, the lease is cancelled, and Tenant pays Landlord A the $200,000. Under section CB 1(1), the amount is income of Landlord A. Example 2 Landlord Z is a company and is the landlord of a commercial property that was purpose built for a particular tenant. The management of the leasing arrangements takes considerable time and effort and is carried out solely by Landlord Z, which has no other business activities. The lease was for 50 years and has 30 years still to run. The building is now in an unfashionable area and the tenant has to move to survive. There is no possibility of securing a further tenant. The tenant negotiates a lease surrender payment with Landlord Z. Landlord Z is in the business of leasing and is therefore subject to the Ruling. However, the surrender payment is in respect of a significant asset of the Landlord’s business and affects the profit-making structure of the business. The surrender payment received by Landlord Z will be a capital amount. 2. Subsections (1) and (2) of section CC 1 Section CC 1 potentially applies to a lease surrender payment. That section includes within the landowner’s income, “other revenues” derived by a land owner “from a lease”. The words “other revenues” are potentially wide enough to include a lease surrender payment. In the Commissioner’s view, the words “from a lease” require that there is a nexus between the payment and the lease ie, that the payment can be said to arise or emanate from the lease or have the lease as its source. The Commissioner considers that the amounts listed in section CC 1(2) are amounts paid for the use of land. A lease surrender payment is paid to terminate a person’s use of land. It therefore does not come within any of the types of payment listed. As a lease surrender payment is paid to prematurely end the relationship between lessee and lessor, does not enhance or further that relationship, and cannot be said to flow from the lease, there is not a sufficient nexus between the payment and the lease. Therefore, a lease surrender payment is not an amount to which section CC 1 applies. The conclusion that the section does not apply is also supported by obiter dicta of Richardson J in CIR v McKenzies NZ Ltd (1988) 10 NZTC 5,233, at 5,235, where His Honour said that premiums paid or received on the surrender of a lease were not dealt with in a predecessor section to section CC 1. This Ruling only applies in the more common situation where the terms of the lease do not provide for a lease surrender payment. In the event that a lease 13 provided for what is to occur upon the surrender of a lease, the specific terms would have to be considered to determine whether section CC 1 applies. 3. When a landlord’s activity amounts to a business The term “business” is defined in section YA 1 as including any profession, trade, or undertaking carried on for profit. The leading case on the test and criteria for whether a business exists is Grieve v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,682. In Grieve, Richardson J noted there were two factors in deciding if there was a business: first, whether the taxpayer had an intention to make a profit; second, the nature of the activities carried on. He went on to set out the following factors relevant to the inquiry as to whether a taxpayer is in business:  The nature of the taxpayer’s activities.  The period over which the taxpayer engages in the activity.  The scope of the taxpayer’s operations.  The volume of transactions undertaken.  The commitment of time, money, and effort by the taxpayer.  The pattern of activity.  The financial results achieved by the activity. Ultimately, whether a landlord is in business is a question of fact. In seeking to determine whether a landlord is in business, the Commissioner uses the criteria identified above from the Grieve decision. The question of whether a business existed or not also arose in Slater v CIR (1996) 17 NZTC 12,453. The High Court examined, discussed, and approved Grieve and the tests proposed in that case. A taxpayer who is in doubt as to whether or not a leasing activity amounts to a business should contact a tax adviser or Inland Revenue. Case law on whether a landlord’s leasing activity amounts to a business Several cases consider whether the leasing of property for rents amounts to a business. In L D Nathan Group Properties Ltd v CIR (1980) 4 NZTC 61,602, the taxpayer was the property-owning subsidiary of the group. Davison CJ said that the deriving of rents by a company such as the taxpayer was income from a business. This confirms the approach in Smith v Anderson (1880) 15 Ch D 258, CIT v Hanover Agencies Ltd \[1967\] 1 All ER 954 (PC), and American Leaf Blending Co Sdn Bhd v Director-General of Inland Revenue \[1978\] 3 All ER 1185 (PC) that companies involved in leasing will more readily be held to be in the business of property leasing. However, this classification is not limited to company taxpayers. For example, in Case F111 (1984) 6 NZTC 60,094 the taxpayer owned two houses and a block of five flats. She collected the rents, interviewed tenants and did some of the maintenance and repair work. The Taxation Review Authority was of the view that the taxpayer was in business as a landlord. From these cases, it would appear that leasing several buildings is likely to mean a taxpayer is in the business of property leasing. Leasing only one building can also mean a taxpayer is in the business of property leasing, if the requirements of the building mean the landlord is actively and regularly involved with the property (eg, negotiating new leases, maintenance, and renovations). It is also possible that leasing a single building will not mean the landlord is in the business of 14 property leasing (eg, when the landlord does not need to have much involvement with the day-to-day running of the property, or when new lessees, maintenance, or renovation work are rare). It is interesting to note that the cases suggest that the business threshold is lower when the landlord is a company than when the landlord is an individual or individuals. Two Australian cases discussed below found the renting of property did not amount to a business. To the extent that these cases are inconsistent with the cases discussed above they are not considered to be precedential, and the above authorities, being Privy Council and New Zealand High Court and Taxation Review Authority cases, are more persuasive authorities in a New Zealand court. In Case 24 (1944) 11 TBRD 85, the taxpayer owned three properties returning rental income of over £10,000. The taxpayer employed a manager who collected and banked rents, attended to repairs and supervised them, and controlled the caretaker and cleaners. However, the taxpayer personally carried out the management of his rent-producing properties and directed policy; attending to the financial arrangements and making decisions regarding repairs. He employed an accountant to prepare accounts. The Board of Review (in a 2-1 decision) found that the taxpayer did not have a business of renting property. In light of subsequent case law, particularly Case F111, this decision is unlikely to be persuasive authority in New Zealand. In Kennedy Holdings & Property Management Pty Ltd v FCT 92 ATC 4,918, the taxpayer co-owned a building that it rented out. It paid its lessee a sum of money to surrender the lease and sought to deduct the sum. The deduction was denied by the Commissioner, and the Federal Court (NSW) upheld the Commissioner’s assessment. The Court found the taxpayer was not carrying on a business. Hill J said (at page 4,921): It cannot be said on the evidence of the present case that the applicant is, for purposes relevant to s.51(1), carrying on a business. The applicant and its co- owner own one property which they lease out and from which they derive rental income. The freehold held in co-ownership is, in such circumstances, the income producing entity, structure or organisation for the earning of the rental income of the co-owners. The freehold is the profit-making structure. Again, there must be some doubt as to the persuasiveness of this case in New Zealand. However, it may be seen as an example of a company owning one building and not needing to undertake much effort in its management, and therefore not being in the business of renting property. Another example of a company renting out property without carrying on a business is R & C Commissioners v Salaried Persons Postal Loans Ltd v R & C Commissioners \[2006\] BTR 423. In this case a company had carried on a trade from one set of premises which it owned. In 1966 the company moved its trade to other premises and let its own premises out. In 1995 the company stopped its trade. Since then the rent received for its original premises had been the sole source of income. The company had had no employees or a bank account and had not paid any money to directors or made any distributions. The tenant of the original premises had remained the same throughout the years. The Court found that a company whose sole activity is the collection of a modest amount of rent under a longstanding lease is not carrying on a business. Example 3 15 16 Landlord B is retired and owns two properties: a family home, and another house rented to an architect for use as an office. The rent is direct credited to Landlord B’s bank account. Landlord B has no day-to-day involvement with the tenant or the building, and only very rarely needs to arrange for repairs and maintenance to be carried out. The tenant has tenanted the building for five years, and has a further five-year lease over the building. In terms of the Grieve tests, the scope of Landlord B’s operations, the volume of transactions undertaken, the commitment of time, money, and effort by the taxpayer, the pattern of the activity, and so on, all suggest that her renting does not amount to a business. Example 4 Landlord C is in part-time employment, but also owns six houses that he rents out to tenants. Before renting out a house, Landlord C totally renovates it. Thereafter, Landlord C carries out any repairs that may be required. He undertakes advertising for new tenants, collection of rents, and associated duties. Landlord C is in the business of renting on the strength of both Case F111 and the Grieve test. Unlike Landlord B in example 3, the nature of Landlord C’s activities, the scope of the operations, the volume of transactions undertaken, and the commitment of time, money, and effort all suggest a business exists. Period of the Ruling The Ruling commences on the first day of the 2008/09 income year. The previous ruling expired on 31 March 2005. Given the terms of section 91C of the Tax Administration Act 1994, it is not possible to issue a ruling in respect of the Income Tax Act 2004 for the period beginning 1 April 2005 to the end of the 2007/08 income year. However, the Commissioner is of the view that the same principles and conclusions as set out in this ruling apply to any lease surrender payments received by a landlord in the business of leasing during this period.
PROVISION OF BENEFITS BY THIRD PARTIES—FRINGE BENEFIT TAX CONSEQUENCES—SECTION CX 2(2) PUBLIC RULING—BR Pub 09/07 ——————————————————————————————————------------------------- Note (not part of ruling): This Public Ruling is a reissue of Public Ruling BR Pub 04/05, “The provision of benefits by third parties: Fringe benefit tax (FBT) consequences – Section CI 2(1)”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 16, No 5 (June 2004). BR Pub 04/05 applied from 20 May 2004 until 19 May 2007. The Commissioner’s view, as expressed in this Ruling, is not intended to differ from that in BR Pub 04/05. Differences between this Ruling and BR Pub 04/05 reflect the subsequent enactment of the Income Tax Act 2007 or editorial amendments made only to assist readers’ understanding, and updates case law. ——————————————————————————————————------------------------- This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section CX 2(2) and the definition of “arrangement” in section YA 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the receipt of a benefit by an employee from a third party where there is an arrangement between the employer and the third party and where the benefit would amount to a “fringe benefit” if it had been provided by the employer. The Arrangement does not include situations where the remuneration given by an employer to an employee is reduced because a benefit has been received from the third party, or otherwise takes the receipt of a benefit provided by a third party into account (including salary sacrifice situations). There cannot be any trade-off between the benefits provided and the remuneration that would otherwise have been received by the employee, or any difference between the remuneration levels of employees who receive benefits and those who do not. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: (a) For the purposes of section CX 2(2), there will be an arrangement for the provision of a benefit to employees where: (i) consideration passes from the employer to the third party in respect of the benefit being provided; or (ii) the employer requests (other than merely initiating contact), instructs, or directs, the third party to provide a benefit; or (iii) there is negotiation or discussion between the employer and the third party that (explicitly or implicitly) involves the threat or suggestion that the 1 employer would withhold business or other benefits from the third party unless a benefit is provided to the employees; or (iv) the third party and the employer are associated parties, and there is a group policy (whether formal or informal), or any other agreement between the associated parties, that employees of the group will be entitled to receive benefits from the other companies in the group. (b) Where it has been determined that the benefit has not been provided in circumstances within any of the categories identified above, section CX 2(2) will not apply where the benefit it provided in any of the following circumstances: (i) there is negotiation or discussion between the employer and the third party that results in no more than: (A) the employer granting the third party access to the premises or work environment to discuss the benefit with employees; and/or (B) agreement between the parties as to the level of benefit that is to be offered by the third party to employees; and/or (C) the employer agreeing to advertise or make known the availability of the benefit; or (ii) the employer has done no more than initiate contact or discussions with the third party; or (iii) there is no significant contact between the employer and the third party. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for a period beginning on the first day of the 2008/09 income year and ending on the last day of the 2013/14 income year. This Ruling is signed by me on the 31 st day of July 2009. Susan Price Director, Public Rulings 2 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 09/07 Introduction 1. This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 09/07 (“the Ruling”). 2. The Ruling is a reissue of Public Ruling BR Pub 04/05, “The provision of benefits by third parties: Fringe benefit tax (FBT) consequences – section CI 2(1)”, Tax Information Bulletin vol 16, no 5 (June 2004), which applied from 20 May 2004 to 19 May 2007. 3. BR Pub 04/05 concerned the application of section CI 2(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994 to the Arrangement. The Income Tax Act 1994 has since been repealed. The relevant provision is now section CX 2(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007. 4. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated. Background 5. This Ruling arises from several private ruling applications that the Rulings Unit has considered. It considers the scope of section CX 2(2) and what will be an “arrangement” that falls within the scope of this provision. Legislation 6. Section CX 2(2) provides: A benefit that is provided to an employee through an arrangement made between their employer and another person for the benefit to be provided is treated as having been provided by the employer. 7. “Arrangement” is defined in section YA 1 to mean, unless the context otherwise requires: an agreement, contract, plan, or understanding, whether enforceable or unenforceable, including all steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect Application of the Legislation 8. Under the Act, an employer may be liable to pay fringe benefit tax (FBT) on fringe benefits that it provides to an employee. As a rule, an employer will not be liable to pay FBT on a benefit provided to an employee by a third party. However, under section CX 2(2) an employer may be liable to pay FBT on a benefit provided to an employee by a third party if that benefit is provided through an “arrangement” made between the employer and the third party. If section CX 2(2) applies, the benefit provided by the third party is treated as if it were provided by the employer to the employee directly. This enables the other provisions of subpart CX to be applied to determine whether FBT is payable on the benefit. 9. Understood in this way, section CX 2(2) is an anti-avoidance provision. Its purpose is to prevent employers avoiding liability for FBT by arranging for a third party to 3 provide a benefit to an employee in circumstances where FBT would have been payable had that benefit been provided by the employer directly. 10. It is important to note that liability for FBT does not necessarily arise if section CX 2(2) applies. For liability for FBT to arise, the benefit provided through the arrangement must amount to a “fringe benefit” within the meaning of section CX 2(1). It is possible that an arrangement may satisfy the requirements of section CX 2(2), but no FBT will be payable, as a result of the other provisions of subpart CX or because of the operation of the valuation rules in subpart RD. For instance, the benefit provided to the employee will not be a “fringe benefit” if section CX 23 or section CX 33 applies. Section CX 23 exempts from FBT certain benefits provided on the premises of the employer or of a company that is part of the same group of companies as the employer. Section CX 33 provides that in certain circumstances a discount on goods provided by a third party will not amount to a “fringe benefit”. 11. This Ruling considers only what will be an “arrangement” that comes within the scope of section CX 2(2). It does not consider whether FBT will be payable on a benefit that is provided through an arrangement to which section CX 2(2) applies. 12. It is clear that section CX 2(2) applies where any form of consideration passes from the employer to the third party to compensate for, or is otherwise in relation to, the benefit provided by the third party to the employee. The wording of section CX 2(2) is broad and seems to apply in a variety of cases wider than this obvious one. The issue is: where there is no direct or indirect consideration (in any form) provided by the employer to the third party, in what circumstances will the provision apply? Conclusion on the scope of section CX 2(2) 13. The conclusions reached in this commentary on the requirements of section CX 2(2) are summarised in the following paragraphs. 14. For section CX 2(2) to apply, a “benefit” must be “provided” to an employee through an “arrangement” made between the employee’s employer and another person “for” the benefit to be “provided” to the employee. 15. The term “arrangement” is defined in section YA 1. Under this definition, the term “arrangement” encompasses various degrees of formality and enforceability. An “arrangement” may be a legally enforceable contract, a less formal agreement or plan that may or may not be legally enforceable, or an informal, unenforceable understanding. An implication of this is that an “arrangement” may exist even if no consideration is given by the employer to the third party so as to create a legally binding contract. 16. In the context of section CX 2(2), the term “arrangement” will include situations where the employer arranges with the third party to provide a benefit, where the employer agrees to allow the third party to approach the employees, or where the employer agrees to allow an employee to join a scheme promoted by the third party. 17. Section CX 2(2) provides that the arrangement made between the employer and another party be “for the benefit to be provided”. These words mean that the 4 arrangement must be “made for the purpose” of providing a benefit to an employee or “with the object” of providing such a benefit. This requires consideration of the purpose or object of the employer and third party in making the arrangement. 18. Where the employer and the third party have a different purpose or object in making the arrangement, section CX 2(2) will apply only if the employer’s purpose or object for making the arrangement was to provide a benefit to an employee. 19. In determining the employer’s purpose or object, the relevant consideration is the subjective purpose of the employer in making the “arrangement”. In order for section CX 2(2) to apply, the employer must have, at least, the more than incidental purpose or object of providing a benefit to an employee in making the arrangement. 20. That it can be argued that the benefit has been provided to the employee through an employee-third party arrangement does not mean that the same benefit cannot be regarded as having also been provided through an employer-third party arrangement that satisfies the requirements of section CX 2(2). 21. For there to be a “benefit” for the purposes of section CX 2(2), the thing provided to an employee must be a “fringe benefit” (as defined in section CX 2(1)) and the employee must take advantage of or use that thing. 22. For section CX 2(2) to apply, the benefit must have been “provided” to an employee by a third party. The word “provided” requires that the benefit must have been supplied, furnished or made available to the employee. 23. The Commissioner does not consider that all situations involving associated persons will necessarily fall within section CX 2(2). It is only in those situations where there is a group policy, or any other agreement between the associated parties, regarding the provision of benefits that the Commissioner considers that the section will apply. 24. It is concluded that these requirements will be fulfilled and section CX 2(2) will apply where:  consideration passes from the employer to the third party in respect of the benefit being provided;  the employer requests (other than merely initiating contact), instructs or directs the third party to provide a benefit;  there is negotiation or discussion between the employer and the third party that (explicitly or implicitly) involves the threat or suggestion that the employer would withhold business or other benefits from the third party unless a benefit is provided to the employees; or  the third party and the employer are associated parties, and there is a group policy (whether formal or informal), or any other agreement between the associated parties, that employees of the group will be entitled to receive benefits from the other companies in the group. 25. Where it has been determined that the benefit has not been provided in circumstances within any of the categories identified above, section CX 2(2) will not apply where the benefit is provided in any of the following circumstances: 5  there is negotiation or discussion between the employer and the third party that results in no more than: (i) the employer granting the third party access to the premises or work environment to discuss the benefit with employees; and/or (ii) agreement between the parties as to the level of benefit that is to be offered by the third party to employees; and/or (iii) the employer agreeing to advertise or make known the availability of the benefit; or  the employer has done no more that initiate contact or discussions with the third party; or  there is no significant contact or arrangement between the employer and the third party. 26. Under the heading “How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement”, the Ruling identifies, in paragraph (a), categories where the requirements of section CX 2(2) will be satisfied. In addition, the Ruling identifies, in paragraph (b), categories where the requirements of section CX 2(2) will not be satisfied. Some categories in paragraphs (a) and (b) may overlap. Accordingly, it is possible that a benefit may be provided in circumstances that come within a category in both paragraphs (a) and (b). In such cases, the requirements of section CX 2(2) are considered to have been satisfied. For this reason, the Ruling qualifies the categories in paragraph (b) with the words “\[w\]here it has been determined that the benefit has not been provided in circumstances within any of the categories identified above”. For example, if a benefit is provided in circumstances that come within the “requests ..., instructs or directs” category in paragraph (a), section CX 2(2) applies even if it can be argued that those circumstances also come within the “agreement ... as to the level of benefit that is to be offered” subcategory in paragraph (b). 27. A consequence of this Ruling may be that the employer is required to put into place systems to enable them to obtain the relevant information required to fulfil their FBT obligations. In the Commissioner’s opinion, where the employer is involved in the types of arrangement contemplated by the first four of the bullet points set out in paragraph 24, the employer will generally be in a sufficient relationship with the third party to obtain the information they require to fulfil their obligations. The onus is on employers who are involved in arrangements for the provision of benefits in any of these ways to ensure that they can do so (for example, by requiring this of the third party). What is meant by the term “arrangement”? 28. The definition of “arrangement” in section YA 1 makes it clear that the term “arrangement” is very wide in its application, and that it encompasses not only legally binding contracts, but also unenforceable understandings. It is clear that what is required for an arrangement to exist is less than that required for a binding contract. 29. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary (11th ed, revised, 2006) defines the individual words contained in the section YA 1 definition as follows:  “Agreement” – a negotiated and typically legally binding arrangement. 6  “Contract” – a written or spoken agreement intended to be enforceable by law.  “Plan” – a detailed proposal for doing or achieving something.  “Understanding” – an informal or unspoken agreement or arrangement. 30. The above definitions show that the words used to describe an “arrangement” in section YA 1 all appear to be slightly different concepts. They indicate that the term “arrangement” is defined to encompass varying degrees of formality and enforceability. The term “arrangement” may be a legally enforceable contract, a less formal agreement or plan that may or may not be legally enforceable, or an informal, unenforceable understanding. 31. That an “arrangement” does not need to be legally enforceable is confirmed by the section YA 1 definition providing that “arrangement” means “an agreement, contract, plan or understanding, whether enforceable or unenforceable” (emphasis added). An implication of this is that an “arrangement” may exist even if there is no consideration given by the employer to the third party so as to create a legally binding contract. 32. The courts have not considered the definition of “arrangement” in the context of section CX 2(2), but have considered the same definition in the context of the general anti-avoidance rule in section BG 1. 33. The predecessor to the definition of “arrangement” in section YA 1 is section 99(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976. This defined the term “arrangement” for the purposes of the general anti-avoidance provision (as then enacted) as: any contract, agreement, plan, or understanding (whether enforceable or unenforceable) including all steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect: 34. This definition was discussed by Richardson P in CIR v BNZ Investments Ltd (2001) 20 NZTC 17,103 (CA). His Honour stated (at page 17,116): The words contract, agreement, plan and understanding appear to be in descending order of formality. A contract is more formal than an agreement, and in ordinary usage is usually written while an agreement is generally more formal than a plan, and a plan more formal or more structured that an understanding. And it is accepted in the definition of arrangement that the contract, agreement, plan or understanding need not be enforceable. Section 99 thus contemplates arrangements which are binding only in honour. 35. The courts have considered the meaning of “arrangement” in several other cases. They have generally held that the term “arrangement” applies in a wide variety of situations. 36. The High Court of Australia in Bell v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1953) 87 CLR 548 considered the meaning of “arrangement” and stated (at page 573): it may be said that the word “arrangement” is the third in a series which as regards comprehensiveness is an ascending series, and that the word extends beyond contracts and agreements so as to embrace all kinds of concerted action by which persons may arrange their affairs for a particular purpose or so as to produce a particular effect. 37. The Privy Council in Newton v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia \[1958\] 2 All ER 759 held (at page 763): 7 Their Lordships are of opinion that the word “arrangement” is apt to describe something less than a binding contract or agreement, something in the nature of an understanding between two or more persons – a plan arranged between them which may not be enforceable at law. But it must in this section comprehend, not only the initial plan but also all the transactions by which it is carried into effect – all the transactions, that is, which have the effect of avoiding taxation, be they conveyances, transfers or anything else. 38. In the context of section BG 1, the courts have considered whether the term “arrangement” requires consensus or meeting of minds. This issue was considered by the Court of Appeal in BNZ Investments. In that decision, the majority of the court held that consensus or meeting of minds was required. Thomas J dissented in holding that there was no such requirement. His Honour held that the term “arrangement” does not require that one party knew of, or agreed to, all the steps and transactions undertaken by the other party in order to discharge its obligations under the “agreement, contract, plan or understanding”. Thomas J’s approach was endorsed by the majority of the Privy Council in Peterson v CIR (2005) 22 NZTC 19,098 (at paragraph 34). 39. However, it is noted that other elements of section CX 2(2) require that the employer must be aware that a benefit would be provided to an employee by the third party. In section CX 2(2), the term “arrangement” is qualified by the words “made between their employer and another person for the benefit to be provided”. As will be discussed, these words mean that section CX 2(2) applies only if the employer’s purpose or object in making the arrangement is for a benefit to be provided to an employee: see paragraphs 73–79. For this requisite purpose or object to exist, the employer must have authorised the third party to provide a benefit to an employee. 40. The section BG 1 case law is consistent with the case law on the meaning of “arrangement” as used in commerce-related legislation (for example, the Commerce Act 1986). This case law makes clear the following:  An “arrangement” exists where each party intentionally creates in the other party an expectation that the first party will act in a certain way. In so doing, the parties agree to mutual rights and obligations in respect of the course of action to be undertaken.  An “arrangement” is unlikely to exist when only one party makes a commitment to the proposed course of action. (See New Zealand Apple and Pear Marketing Board v Apple Fields Ltd \[1991\] 1 NZLR 257; Re British Basic Slag Ltd’s Agreements \[1963\] 2 All ER 807; Trade Practices Commission v Email Ltd (1980) 31 ALR 53.) 41. In summary, the definition of “arrangement” in section YA 1 encompasses various degrees of formality and enforceability. An “arrangement” may be a legally enforceable contract, a less formal agreement or plan that may or may not be legally enforceable, or an informal, unenforceable understanding. An implication of this is that an “arrangement” may exist even if no consideration is given by the employer to the third party so as to create a legally binding contract. 42. In the context of section CX 2(2), the term “arrangement” will include situations where the employer arranges with the third party to provide a benefit, where the employer agrees to allow the third party to approach the employees, or where the 8 employer agrees to allow an employee to join a scheme promoted by the third party. 43. In terms of the application to section CX 2(2), for there to be an “arrangement” that is caught under the section, it must be an arrangement “for” a benefit to be “provided” to an employee. This means that not every “arrangement” that exists between an employer and a third party will be caught by section CX 2(2). Similarly, not every instance where a benefit is provided to an employee by a person who is not their employer will be caught by the section. What is the meaning of “for” as used in section CX 2(2)? 44. Section CX 2(2) provides that the “arrangement” made between the employer and another party be “for the benefit to be provided”. 45. The word “for” can have a wide variety of meanings depending on its context. The Court of Appeal in Wilson & Horton v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,325 stated (at page 12,330): Reference to any standard dictionary brings home the wide variety of senses in which the preposition “for” may be employed. The Oxford English Dictionary (2nd ed) identifies 11 separate categories of meaning and many distinct usages within particular categories. The discussion in the text extends over 9 columns in the dictionary. Again the Tasman Dictionary which as its name suggests is directed to Australian English and New Zealand English, lists 33 meanings of the word. The particular meaning intended necessarily hinges on the context in which the word is used and how it is used in that context. \[Emphasis added.\] 46. The use of the word “for” was interpreted in Patrick Harrison & Co v AG for Manitoba \[1967\] SCR 274 as imposing a purpose test. In this case, the court held that “for the extraction of minerals” meant “with the object or purpose of extracting minerals”. 47. In G v CIR \[1961\] NZLR 994, McCarthy J held that the word “for” points to intention, which is similar to looking at a person’s purpose. McCarthy J stated (at page 999): “For” points to intention ... the essential test as to whether a business exists is the intention of the taxpayer as evidenced by his conduct, and that the various tests discussed in the decided cases are merely tests to ascertain the existence of that intention. I think that it conforms with this approach to construe the word “for”, when considering a phrase such as “carried on for pecuniary profit” used in relation to an occupation, as importing intention. 48. These cases show that in several statutory contexts the courts have interpreted the word “for” to mean “for the purpose” or “with the object of” something. It is noted that in this context, a person’s purpose is similar to their intention. However, to determine the word’s meaning in the current section, it is necessary to look at the section’s wording. 49. As already noted, section CX 2(2) requires that the benefit provided to the employee was through an arrangement made between the employer and another person “for the benefit to be provided” (emphasis added). The use of the term “for” in this context can mean that the arrangement entered into is concerned only 9 with the provision of these benefits. That is to say, the “arrangement” must have been made “for” the provision of a benefit to an employee. 50. In the Commissioner’s opinion, based on the case law and dictionary definitions, for an “arrangement” to satisfy section CX 2(2) it must be “made for the purpose” of providing a benefit to an employee or “with the object” of providing such a benefit. Is section CX 2(2) concerned with the purpose of the arrangement or the purpose of the parties in making the arrangement? 51. Given that the words “for the benefit to be provided” mean for the purpose or object of providing the benefit, the issue arises as to who or what must have this purpose or object. This requires interpreting the words “an arrangement made between the employer and another person for the benefit to be provided”. There are two possible interpretations of these words. 52. First, the words “for the benefit to be provided” could be read as relating to the word “made”. Under this interpretation, section CX 2(2) applies if the purpose or object of the parties in making the arrangement was for a benefit to be provided to an employee of the employer. 53. Second, the words “for the benefit to be provided” could be read as relating to the word “arrangement”. Under this interpretation, section CX 2(2) applies if the arrangement has the purpose or object of providing a benefit to an employee of the employer. This would require an objective inquiry into the arrangement itself, and would not consider the purpose or object of the parties to the arrangement. 54. Under this second interpretation, section CX 2(2) could have a wider scope of application than under the first interpretation. It could be possible that, objectively, an arrangement has the purpose or object of providing an employee of the employer with a benefit in circumstances where, subjectively, the parties did not make the arrangement for the purpose or object of providing a benefit to an employee. 55. The other words in section CX 2(2) do not appear to suggest that one interpretation is preferable to the other. It is consequently considered that the meaning of the words “an agreement made between their employer and another person for the benefit to be provided” is ambiguous. Therefore, it is necessary to consider whether the scheme of the FBT regime, and of the Act as a whole, favours one interpretation over the other. 56. Interpreting section CX 2(2) as requiring consideration of the purpose or object of the parties could be seen as consistent with the FBT regime. The FBT regime applies where there is a “fringe benefit”, which is defined in section CX 2(1)(a) as being a benefit that “is provided by an employer to an employee in connection with their employment”. This indicates that the focus of the FBT regime is on benefits that the employer has chosen to give its employees. Understood in this way, the purpose of section CX 2(2) appears to be to prevent employers from deliberately avoiding liability for FBT by arranging for the third party to provide the benefit instead. 57. An argument favouring interpreting section CX 2(2) as requiring consideration of the purpose or object of the arrangement is that this interpretation is consistent 10 with section BG 1. Under section BG 1, it is only the objective purpose or effect of the “arrangement”, and not the intention of the parties to the arrangement, that is relevant to whether there is a “tax avoidance arrangement”: Newton v FC of T (1958) 11 ATD 442; Glenharrow Holdings Ltd v CIR \[2008\] NZSC 116; Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures v CIR, Accent Management v CIR \[2008\] NZSC 115. Arguably, it is appropriate that section CX 2(2) is interpreted consistently with section BG 1, given they both have an anti-avoidance purpose and share the same definition of “arrangement”. 58. However, it might be argued that interpreting section CX 2(2) as requiring consideration of the purpose or object of the parties is not inconsistent with section BG 1. Unlike section CX 2(2), the wording in section BG 1 is unambiguous in requiring consideration of the purpose or effect of the arrangement. Section YA 1 provides that “tax avoidance arrangement”: Means an arrangement, whether entered into by the person affected by the arrangement or by another person, that directly or indirectly— (a) has tax avoidance as its purpose or effect; or (b) has tax avoidance as 1 of its purposes or effects, whether or not any other purpose or effect is referable to ordinary business or family dealings, if the tax avoidance purpose or effect is not merely incidental. 59. Moreover, interpreting section CX 2(2) as requiring consideration of the purpose or object of the arrangement arguably creates the potential for overlap with section GB 31. Section GB 31 provides an anti-avoidance rule that applies when “a purpose or effect of the arrangement \[entered into by two or more persons\] is to defeat the intent and application of any of the FBT rules”. Section CX 2(5)(a) provides that a benefit may be treated as having been provided by an employer to an employee under section GB 31. 60. Section GB 31(1) makes clear that it is concerned with the purpose or effect of the arrangement and not with the purpose or object of the parties to the arrangement. This arguably suggests that if section CX 2(2) were interpreted as requiring consideration of the purpose or object of the arrangement, then section CX 2(2) might cover only situations that would fall within section GB 31. By contrast, interpreting section CX 2(2) as requiring consideration of the purpose or object of the parties might reduce the potential for overlap, because sections CX 2(2) and GB 31 would have different focuses and apply in different circumstances. If the drafters had intended the purpose or object of the arrangement to be relevant under section CX 2(2), it would be reasonable to expect that the drafters would have adopted language similar to that used in sections BG 1 and GB 31. 61. This suggests that the scheme of the FBT regime favours interpreting section CX 2(2) as requiring consideration of the purpose or object of the parties. The legislative history to section CX 2(2) will now be examined to assess whether this conclusion is correct. 62. The background to section CX 2(2) and its predecessors in the Income Tax Acts 1994 and 2004 does not provide useful guidance on this issue. However, the background to section 336N(2) of the Income Tax Act 1976, which is the earliest predecessor to section CX 2(2), does assist in understanding Parliament’s purpose in enacting that provision and the FBT regime generally. Section 336N(2) provided: 11 For the purposes of this Part of this Act, where a benefit is provided for or granted to an employee by a person with whom the employer of the employee has entered into an arrangement for that benefit to be so provided or granted, that benefit shall be deemed to be a benefit provided for or granted to the employee by the employer of the employee. Section 336N of the Income Tax Act 1976 was enacted by the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1985, which also enacted the FBT regime. 63. The FBT regime was enacted in light of the recommendations in Report of the Task Force on Tax Reform (Wellington, Government Printer, 1982). The task force was chaired by P M McCaw. Before the enactment of the FBT regime, fringe benefits were generally not taxed. The task force noted that generally fringe benefits did not amount to assessable income under the tax legislation at that time. It considered that the non-taxable status of fringe benefits was unsatisfactory, because it increased the inequity in the tax system and narrowed the tax base (at paragraph 6.185). The task force did not discuss the situation where an employer arranges for a third party to provide an employee with a benefit. 64. Also relevant is the speech of the then Minister of Finance, the Hon R O Douglas, in the third reading debate of the Income Tax Amendment Bill (No 2). The Minister stated that the purpose of the fringe benefit tax was to “close ... off loopholes that are a major source of unfairness in income distribution”, and that (NZPD vol 462 1985, at page 3,920): In the Government’s view it is fair to tax the employers, the basic reason being that it is the employers which have been using fringe benefit payments to lower the cost structures of their business. I gave the example in the Committee of an employer who might want to put together a package of $100,000. He could pay $40,000 in terms of salary, then put together a fringe benefit package of about $20,000 in various forms, which was the equivalent of tax paid income of $60,000. In other words, for $60,000 in terms of cost structure to the business the employer was able to put together a salary package equivalent of $100,000. In those circumstances the Government believes it is fair and equitable to tax the employer. 65. The Minister of Finance’s speech indicates that the mischief Parliament sought to remedy by enacting the FBT regime was the ability of employers to decrease the costs of employment by substituting assessable income with non-assessable fringe benefits. While the Minister did not specifically discuss the clause of the Bill that became section 336N(2) of the Income Tax Act 1976, his comments suggest that section 336N(2) was intended to cover the specific situation of an employer that knowingly seeks to avoid liability for FBT by arranging for a benefit to be provided to an employee by a third party. 66. In summary, the words “an arrangement made between their employer and another person for the benefit to be provided” are ambiguous. These words can be interpreted as requiring consideration of the purpose or object of the arrangement or the purpose or object of the parties in making that arrangement. It is considered that the scheme of the FBT regime and the legislative history suggest that the better view is that section CX 2(2) requires determining the purpose or object of the parties in making the arrangement. Whose “purpose” is relevant under section CX 2(2)? 67. The discussion so far has proceeded on the basis that the parties’ (that is, the employer’s and the third party’s) purpose or object in making the arrangement is 12 relevant. Where both the employer and the third party share the same purpose, then determining whether section CX 2(2) applies will be straightforward. However, in some situations it might be possible to argue that the employer and third party each have a different purpose for making the arrangement. For example, where the third party agrees to provide the benefit because the employer has stated that it will withhold business from the third party unless it does so, it might be argued that the third party has not made the arrangement for the purpose or object of providing a benefit to an employee. Instead it might be argued that the third party made the arrangement for the purpose or object of preserving its business with the employer. In such situations, the issue arises as to whose purpose should be considered determinative when deciding whether section CX 2(2) applies. 68. It is considered that the scheme of the FBT regime supports the employer’s purpose being determinative in both these situations. 69. Liability for FBT is imposed on benefits provided by employers to their employees. The FBT regime is not, as a rule, concerned with benefits provided to employees by persons who are not their employers. An exception to this rule is in section CX 2(2). Section CX 2(2) has an anti-avoidance purpose. It seeks to prevent employers from avoiding liability for FBT by arranging for third parties to provide benefits to their employees. 70. The scheme of the FBT regime supports section CX 2(2) applying where the employer, but not the third party, makes the arrangement with the purpose of providing a benefit to an employer. In such cases, liability for FBT is avoided in circumstances where it would have arisen if the benefit had instead been provided by the employer directly. Moreover, the third party is not seeking to avoid liability for FBT, because it has no prospective liability. At most, the third party might be a knowing participant in the employer’s arrangement. More likely, perhaps, the third parties would be pursuing their own commercial non-tax objectives and may be ignorant of, or indifferent to, the employer’s purpose. 71. By contrast, the scheme of the FBT regime does not support section CX 2(2) applying where the third party, but not the employer, makes the arrangement with the purpose of providing a benefit to an employee. If section CX 2(2) were to apply in such cases because of the third party’s purpose, then FBT would be imposed despite the employer not having the purpose of providing a benefit to its employee. The imposition of FBT in these circumstances seems unfair and illogical. 72. In summary, it is considered that section CX 2(2) applies where the purpose of the employer for making the arrangement is for a benefit to be provided to an employee of the employer. Should the test to determine the employer’s purpose in making the arrangement with the third party be objective or subjective? 73. The above conclusions combine to show that for an “arrangement” to be caught under section CX 2(2), the purpose of the employer must have been to provide the employee with a benefit. This part of the commentary considers whether the test to determine whether the employer’s purpose in making the arrangement is for the purpose of providing a benefit should be a subjective or an objective one. 13 74. A subjective approach requires consideration of the intention of the parties in entering into the arrangement. In the current context, a subjective test would look at what the particular employer had in mind when the arrangement with the third party was entered into. An objective approach, however, might consider what a reasonable person in the position of the employer ought to have had in mind. 75. Additionally, case law, particularly in the area of GST, indicates that the correct test for determining purpose is a mixed test, considering both subjective and objective factors in reaching a conclusion as to the taxpayer’s purpose. In several cases the courts have held that the test for purpose is dependent on the statutory context in which it is found (see, for example, CIR v Haenga (1985) 7 NZTC 5,198). 76. It is, therefore, necessary to look closely at the wording of the section. Section CX 2(2) does not contain the word “purpose”. It requires that the “arrangement” be “made between” the employer and the third party “for the benefit to be provided”. 77. In the Commissioner’s view, section CX 2(2) requires consideration of the reason that the employer “made” the “arrangement” with the third party. This means the test to determine the employer’s purpose in making the arrangement should be subjective, looking at the particular reasons the employer had in mind. However, objective factors may be taken into account to aid in this interpretation. 78. This approach could be seen as being supported by McCarthy J in G v CIR where he held that the word “for” points to intention, clearly indicating a subjective approach. McCarthy J stated (at page 999): “For” points to intention. ...the essential test as to whether a business exists is the intention of the taxpayer as evidenced by his conduct, and that the various tests discussed in the decided cases are merely tests to ascertain the existence of that intention. I think that it conforms with this approach to construe the word “for”, when considering a phrase such as “carried on for pecuniary profit” used in relation to an occupation, as importing intention. 79. Therefore, the test to determine the employer’s purpose is a subjective one that looks at the intention of the employer, but objective factors should be considered to ensure the employer’s stated purpose is honestly held. That is, for section CX 2(2) to apply, the reason the employer made the arrangement must have been to provide a benefit to its employee. What test should be used to determine the employer’s purpose? 80. This part of the commentary considers the appropriate test to be used in determining the purpose of the employer making the “arrangement” with a third party. 81. A spectrum of tests could be used to determine the purpose of the employer in making the arrangement with the third party. 82. At one end of the spectrum is a sole purpose test. This test requires that the provision of a benefit to an employee is the sole or only purpose of the employer in making the arrangement. In the Commissioner’s opinion, this would be an unduly restrictive test for section CX 2(2), because it would not apply in any situation where there was another purpose, no matter how secondary or minor. 14 83. At the other end of the spectrum, is the test that the section will apply if any one of the purposes of the employer in making the arrangement is that the employee be provided with a benefit. In the Commissioner’s opinion, this is also not an appropriate test in the context of section CX 2(2), because the section would catch all benefits that were provided to employees if the employer had some form of arrangement with the third party and the fact the employees were receiving a benefit had crossed the employer’s mind when they entered into the arrangement with the third party. If the provision of the benefit is not a part of the arrangement between the parties, but is truly incidental to the purpose of the employer, then the section should not apply. 84. Between these two extremes are the dominant purpose test and the more than incidental purpose test. 85. A dominant purpose test would require that the main reason why the employer made the arrangement with the third party is for the benefit to be provided to the employee. This test would allow the employer to have other purposes in making the arrangement, but that, in order for the section to apply, the main purpose of the employer in making the “arrangement” needs to be the provision of a benefit. This test would also mean that if the employer had more than one purpose in making the “arrangement” and the provision of a benefit to employees was not the most important purpose, then section CX 2(2) would not apply. 86. Several cases have determined that the word “purpose” used on its own in statutory language without any apparent qualifier means the dominant purpose of the taxpayer, for example, in relation to the third limb of section CB 4 (and predecessor provisions) and in relation to section 108 of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 (the former section BG 1). 87. In the Commissioner’s opinion, there is no reason to conclude that section CX 2(2) requires a dominant purpose test. There is no indication on the words of section CX 2(2) that a dominant purpose test is necessary. This can be contrasted with section CD 4, where the section clearly refers to “the purpose” (emphasis added). Therefore, it is the Commissioner’s opinion that it would not be appropriate to apply a dominant purpose test in determining whether section CX 2(2) applies. 88. A more than incidental purpose test would be similar to the test in section BG 1, where, as long as the purpose of providing a benefit is more than incidental to any other purpose of the employer in making the “arrangement”, the section will apply. In the context of section CX 2(2), this means that if the provision of the benefit is incidental to other purposes of the “arrangement”, such as the provision of credit cards to employees or obtaining a good package deal for the employer, then the section would not apply. The use of this test could be seen as being supported by the fact section CX 2(2) is an anti-avoidance provision and that it is appropriate to have a similar test as in other avoidance contexts. Alternatively, it could be argued that a more than incidental test is not appropriate, because the language of section BG 1 explicitly provides for the test of more than merely incidental in the legislation itself, whereas section CX 2(2) does not. 89. Overall, it is the Commissioner’s opinion that the more than incidental test is the appropriate test to be adopted in interpreting section CX 2(2). This approach means that if the purpose of providing a benefi t to the employees is no more than 15 incidental to some other purpose of the employer making the arrangement, the arrangement would not be caught within the section. A more than incidental test means that the purpose of the employer must be significant in order for the benefit to be caught within the section, but does not need to be the most important (or dominant) reason or purpose of the employer in making the “arrangement”. 90. In the Commissioner’s opinion, if an employer has more than one purpose when they made the “arrangement” with the third party, it is appropriate to exclude incidental purposes from section CX 2(2), but there is no reason why an employer with a significant, but not dominant, purpose of providing a benefit to employees should not be caught by the section. 91. Therefore, to establish whether section CX 2(2) applies, it is necessary to look at what the arrangement between the employer and the third party is for, and whether the provision of the benefit to employees is incidental to another purpose of the employer, or whether it is a separate, significant purpose in its own right. If the provision of a benefit is no more than incidental to some other purpose of the employer in making the arrangement with the third party, then section CX 2(2) will not apply. 92. The relevant consideration is whether the purpose of the employer of providing a benefit to employees is incidental to another purpose of the employer, not whether the benefit received is incidental to the arrangement with the third party. It is the purpose of the employer that is relevant, not the purpose of the arrangement. 93. If the employer does not have a purpose of providing a benefit to employees (or the purpose is not more than incidental), section CX 2(2) will not apply to any benefit that may be provided by a third party. Which “arrangement” must be the one “for” the benefit? 94. In some cases where a benefit is provided to an employee by a third party, it might be possible to argue that there are two arrangements “for” that benefit to be provided: one arrangement between the employer and the third party and another between the employee and the third party. In such cases, the issue may arise as to whether the presence of an arrangement between the employee and third party for the provision of a benefit means that same benefit cannot have been provided under an arrangement between the employer and third party. 95. For instance, an employer makes an arrangement with a local gym under which the gym agrees to provide free membership to the employer’s employees. To obtain this free membership, employees must undertake the gym’s membership process (including agreeing to its standard terms and conditions of use). In this situation it might be argued that section CX 2(2) cannot apply, because the gym membership should be considered to have been provided through an arrangement between the gym and the employee, and therefore, not through the arrangement between the employer and the third party. 96. In the Commissioner’s view, there appears to be no reason to conclude that merely because there is an employee-third party arrangement for a benefit to be provided that it is not also possible for that same benefit to be considered to have been provided through an employer-third party arrangement to which section CX 2(2) 16 applies. Section CX 2(2) does not expressly or implicitly exclude itself from applying only because the benefit concerned can also be considered to have been provided through an employee-third party arrangement. Accordingly, section CX 2(2) may apply even if the benefit can also be considered to have been provided through an employee-third party arrangement. What is required for there to be a benefit to the employees? 97. Under section CX 2(1), the definition of what amounts to a fringe benefit is broad and intended to include all non-cash payments made by an employer to an employee in respect of their employment. However, it is not clear, given that section CX 2(2) is an anti-avoidance provision, whether what the employee receives from the third party needs to be a benefit that the employee would not usually be able to receive or if something else is needed. The issue arises of whether a benefit under section CX 2(2) must be something that the public is unable to receive. 98. In Case M9 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,069, District Court Judge Bathgate held that the provision of the motor vehicle was subject to FBT and stated (at page 2,073): A benefit is often regarded as being given voluntarily, rather than compulsorily. A benefit may however be given under compulsion in some circumstances – Yates v Starkey \[1951\] 1 All ER 732 ... “Fringe benefits” are defined in s 336N(1) \[of the Income Tax Act 1976\] as the benefits “received or enjoyed”, in the sense that it is from the employee’s view they are to be considered a benefit, which is the object and purpose of such. 99. In Case M59 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,339, District Court Judge Bathgate stated (at page 2,343): Only the receipt or enjoyment occurred after FBT was imposed, but that was not sufficient, as that is only a part of a fringe benefit, and not the whole fringe benefit. By 31 March 1985 the objector had provided a benefit, although it was not enjoyed by B and C until after that date. That enjoyment however was not for the purposes of the Act a fringe benefit. Although the objectors would be taxable in that period after 1 April 1985, they were not subject to the tax because when the benefit was provided by them it was not chargeable to FBT. 100. This means two separate elements must exist for there to be a “benefit” for FBT purposes: provision to the employee and enjoyment by that employee. Accordingly, for a benefit to exist under section CX 2(2), there must be both the provision of something by a third party who has entered into an arrangement with the employer to provide that benefit, and enjoyment by the employee. 101. Accordingly, on the basis of the above cases, all that is necessary for there to be a benefit to an employee under section CX 2(2) is for the employee to receive, or be provided, something by a third party, and to enjoy, or take advantage of, that thing. There is no requirement that a fringe benefit is something the employee could not receive on their own account, or that the public cannot receive it provided the requirements of the definition in section CX 2(1) are met and the benefit is provided in respect of the employment of the employee. 102. This interpretation is supported by the scheme of the FBT rules. Section CX 2(1) defines the term “fringe benefit” broadly. It is not necessary for the purposes of the FBT rules for the benefit to be something that the employee could not otherwise be able to receive or that the public is unable to receive. All that is required is that something needs to be provided to the employee that falls within the definition of 17 “fringe benefit” in section CX 2(1). In the Commissioner’s opinion, this applies equally to section CX 2(2). If something is provided to the employee by a third party that would have been a fringe benefit had it been provided by the employer, it will be subject to FBT by virtue of section CX 2(2). 103. Therefore, for there to be a benefit under section CX 2(2) all that is required is that a “fringe benefit” (as defined in section CX 2(1)) is provided to the employee by a third party (in addition to regular salary or wages) pursuant to an arrangement between the employer and the third party for the provision of that thing, and the employee must take advantage of or use that thing. This conclusion is consistent with “The meaning of ‘benefit’ for FBT purposes”, Tax Information Bulletin vol 18, no 2 (March 2006), which states that “\[i\]n terms of the scheme of the FBT regime, a ‘benefit’ means what is received by the employee, without regard to any contribution made by the employee.” Meaning of “provision” 104. Section CX 2(2) requires that a benefit be “provided to an employee through an arrangement”. For a benefit to be caught under section CX 2(2) it must have been provided to the employee by the third party. It is not sufficient that there is an “arrangement” between the parties that is merely for access to premises, the “arrangement” must be “for” the provision of a benefit for section CX 2(2) to apply. 105. The Oxford English Dictionary (11th ed, revised, 2006) defines the term “provide” as “make available for use; supply”. 106. Several cases have discussed the meaning of the word “provide”. These cases show that the meaning of “provide” depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. For example, in Ginty v Belmont Building Supplies Ltd \[1959\] 1 All ER 414, Pearson J stated (at page 422): I do not think that there is any hard and fast meaning of the word “provided”; it must depend on the circumstances of the case as to what is “provided” and how what is “provided” is going to be used. 107. In Norris v Syndi Manufacturing Co Ltd \[1952\] 1 All ER 935, an employee had removed the safety guard from a machine in order to carry out tests. His employer was aware that the employee took the guard off to test the machine, and had told him to replace it “after testing and before operation”. The employee inadvertently injured himself while working without the guard one day. The Court of Appeal found that the guard had been “provided” by the employer, and that the duty to provide the guard did not require that the employer should have to order the workers to use it. Romer LJ stated (at page 940): The primary meaning of the word “provide” is to “furnish” or “supply”, and accordingly, on the plain, ordinary interpretation of s. 119 (1), a workman’s statutory obligation is to use safety devices which are furnished or supplied for his use by his employers. 108. The meaning of “provide” has been considered by the Employment Court of New Zealand in Tranz Rail Ltd (T/A Interisland Line) v New Zealand Seafarers’ Union \[1996\] 1 ERNZ 216. In that case, the issue was whether a statutory requirement that the employer provide food and water to the seafarers meant the employer had to provide them with free food and water or merely ensure facilities were available 18 for the employees to have access to food and water. Colgan J stated (at page 227): The applicant’s principal argument is that the plain words of the statute allow an employer of seafarers either to agree to provide food and water without cost to an employee or to do otherwise whether by negotiation as part of a collective employment contract or by the imposition of charges for such provisions. Ms Dyhrberg submitted that to achieve an interpretation as sought by the respondents, the Court would be required to add to the statutory words a phrase such as “without cost to such employees” or the like. Ms Dyhrberg submitted that the word “provide” means make available but no more. Counsel conceded that this interpretation would mean that an employer of seafarers would be entitled to charge an employee for water consumed, although stressed that such an outcome would be unlikely in any event. Ms Dyhrberg submitted that to “provide” is to provide the opportunity of having the appropriate supplies of food and water. I find however that in this context the natural and ordinary meaning of the word “provide” in relation to food and water on ships is to supply without cost to the recipient seafarer. 109. The Australian Administrative Appeals Tribunal in Pierce v FCT 98 ATC 2240, considered whether a car had been provided to an employee. The tribunal stated (at page 2,247): There is no reason why “provides” should not be given its ordinary English meaning, namely “to furnish or supply” (Macquarie Dictionary). 110. For something to have been “provided” to an employee by a third party in the context of section CX 2(2), it must be supplied, furnished, or made available to that employee. Salary sacrifice situations 111. This Ruling does not consider or rule on the taxation implications of salary sacrifice situations. In the context of the Ruling, this includes situations where the remuneration given by an employer to an employee is reduced because of a benefit being received by the employee from the third party (or because of the possibility of a benefit being received), or where the remuneration of the employee otherwise takes the receipt of a benefit provided by a third party into account. 112. It is considered that different considerations may apply to the tax treatment of such situations, for example, the benefit may have been provided by the employer in such a situation, or there may be other relevant aspects of the arrangement, and this Ruling has not considered the taxation implications of salary sacrifice situations. Period of Ruling 113. This Ruling commences on the first day of the 2008/09 income year. The previous Ruling expired on 19 May 2007. Given the terms of section 91C of the Tax Administration Act 1994, it is not possible to issue a ruling in respect of the Income Tax Act 2004 for the period beginning 20 May 2007 to the end of the 2007/08 income year. However, the Commissioner’s view is that the same principles and conclusions as set out in this Ruling apply to an arrangement of the type covered by the Ruling for this period. 19 Examples 114. The following examples are included to assist in explaining the application of the law. They consider whether the requirements of section CX 2(2) are satisfied. The examples do not consider whether FBT will be payable on a benefit provided through an arrangement to which section CX 2(2) applies. It might be possible that section CX 2(2) applies but FBT will not be payable, as a result of the other provisions in subpart CX or because of the operation of the valuation rules contained in subpart RD. 115. These examples all assume that there has been no sacrifice of salary by the employee receiving the benefit. Example 1 116. ABC Bank wishes to offer the employees of XYZ Ltd a low interest loan facility. ABC approaches XYZ, which agrees to ABC’s offer and agrees to pay ABC the difference between the interest rate offered to employees and the current market interest rate. 117. On the facts of this example, the requirements of section CX 2(2) are clearly satisfied. An “arrangement” exists between ABC and XYZ, and the purpose of the employer is to allow the provision of a benefit to XYZ’s employees. This is evidenced by the fact consideration has been passed between the employer and the third party in respect of the benefit being provided. Example 2 118. A credit card company approaches the manager of BCE, and asks whether BCE would allow it to approach BCE’s employees to offer them credit cards (for the employees’ personal use). The credit card company proposes that all staff members who choose to receive cards would be allowed to join the credit card company’s loyalty scheme (which has no joining fee, but is available only to selected cardholders). BCE agrees to this request, but suggests that the credit card company might wish to provide a slightly discounted interest rate to the employees, so that the offer does not waste the employees’ time. The credit card company agrees to this change. BCE provides no consideration to the credit card company. The credit card company is keen to secure BCE employees as customers and is happy to agree to offer the employees the additional benefits. 119. In this example, there is an “arrangement” between the employer and the third party. The employer and third party have agreed to the third party undertaking a particular course of action. However, section CX 2(2) will not apply in this situation. The agreement does not include the provision of a benefit, but merely allows the credit card company access to BCE’s employees to offer them a benefit. The main purpose of the employer in entering into the arrangement is to allow the credit card company to offer a benefit to their employees that will be of potential interest to the employees. The provision of a benefit, if it is a purpose of the employer, will be incidental to this. Therefore, any benefit received by the employee from the credit card company will not amount to a “fringe benefit” under section CX 2(2). 20 Example 3 120. A local retailer approaches MNO Ltd, and asks permission to display advertising brochures on MNO’s premises and for MNO to place an advertisement on the company’s intranet. After a cursory inspection of the brochures and advertisement, MNO agrees. MNO also agrees to allow the retailer to email interested staff with updated specials (staff are given the opportunity not to receive the email updates). The brochures and subsequent email messages invite the employees to join a loyalty programme, which gives them the possibility of receiving rewards. 121. In this example, there will be an “arrangement” between the employer and the third party, as they have agreed on a future course of action. However, the arrangement will not be “for” the provision of a benefit. The employer has agreed only to allow the third party access to its employees, and this is their main purpose in entering into the arrangement. Any purpose the employer may have of benefiting their employees is incidental to this purpose. The “arrangement” is “for” access to the employer’s premises or to allow the third party to communicate with the employees directly or by electronic means, not to provide a benefit to employees. Hence, any reward received by an employee under the loyalty programme will not amount to a “fringe benefit” under section CX 2(2). Example 4 122. BB Ltd is a large company with several high net worth employees. BB contacts its bank and asks the bank to offer a low interest mortgage facility to BB’s employees, which would also permit employees to obtain a mortgage with a smaller deposit than would usually be required. BB believes the bank will agree to this request because BB has a lot of business with the bank. Additionally, it is expected that the bank will get a great deal of business from the employees of BB, because BB has told the bank it is aware of a reasonable number of staff members who would be interested in such a facility. The bank is attracted by the level of business it might achieve with the employees, and is also keen to maintain the good relationship it has with BB, so it puts together a proposal, which it presents to BB. BB considers that the proposal is worthwhile, so asks the bank to make the facility available to employees. BB also agrees to help promote the facility by putting up posters and making brochures available in the workplace, and by sending an email message to staff informing them of the facility. 123. In this example, there is an “arrangement” between BB and the bank that is “for” the provision of a benefit to employees. The course of action agreed to by the parties involves the provision of a benefit to employees. BB has not simply entered into the arrangement with the purpose of allowing the bank access to the employees. Rather, BB has entered into the arrangement with a more than incidental purpose of providing employees with a benefit. This is evidenced by the fact BB has an expectation that the bank would comply with its request and because it is aware of staff members who would be interested in the facility. Therefore, section CX 2(2) will apply to this arrangement. 21 Example 5 124. STU Ltd and VWX Ltd are both companies in the same group of companies. The group has a widely understood policy that all companies in the group will provide discounted products or services to all employees of companies in the group, although this policy has never been put into writing. STU, therefore, provides interested VWX employees with discounts on its products. 125. In this example, there will be an “arrangement” for the provision of a benefit, and VWX will be liable to FBT on any benefits received by its employees from STU. There is a group policy that each company will provide the employees of the other companies in the group with benefits. Therefore, there is an understanding between the employer and the third party that each will act in a particular way, that understanding extending to the provision of a benefit, and the purpose of the policy is to allow employees to be provided with benefits by a third party. Therefore, section CX 2(2) will apply. Example 6 126. DFG, a travel agent, employs several staff and enters into a scheme with YTR, an airline, to strengthen its relationship with YTR. The scheme involves YTR agreeing to give a certain number of free domestic flights per year to employees of DFG who excel in promoting and selling YTR flights. In return, DFG agrees to have its employees promote YTR flights and convert flights to YTR wherever possible. To determine which employees are entitled to free flights, DFG awards its staff with points for outstanding customer service. Once a staff member has accumulated the required number of points, they are entitled to a free flight from YTR. There is no cost to DFG for those flights. 127. In this example, section CX 2(2) will apply. There is an “arrangement” between the parties, as the course of action agreed to by DFG and YTR involves the provision of a benefit to employees. One of the main purposes of DFG in entering into the arrangement is to provide the staff with free flights. Although DFG has another significant purpose in entering into the arrangement, which is to strengthen its relationship, the purpose of providing a benefit to employees is not incidental to that purpose. Example 7 128. HJK is a large nationwide employer with many staff. A senior manager of HJK approaches LMN, a nationwide chain of retail stores, and suggests that LMN might like to consider offering a discount to HJK employees. LMN agrees to consider this idea, and later decides to allow a 10% discount to all HJK staff at all of its stores. (This is achieved by providing all employees with a discount card.) HJK does not give any consideration for this, has made no suggestion that it will do business with LMN if a discount is permitted, and has not been involved in discussions about the level of the discount or any other details of the offer. LMN has decided to offer the employees the discount, because it believes LMN will obtain a substantial amount of business. 129. Section CX 2(2) will not apply in this situation. There is no “arrangement” between the parties that encompasses the provision of the benefit, as the only course of 22 action agreed to by the parties is that LMN will consider the idea. HJK has done no more than initiate discussions with LMN, and the decision to offer a benefit to employees was made unilaterally by LMN. Although the purpose of HJK could be argued to be the provision of a benefit, there is no “arrangement” with LMN that is “for” such provision. Example 8 130. An employee works for a company. She obtains a personal credit card and joins its associated points reward scheme. Under that scheme, she can accumulate points as goods and services are charged on the credit card. After the employee accumulates 10,000 points, she can transfer those points, at her option, to any one of several airlines’ frequent flyer schemes affiliated to the credit card company’s points reward scheme. Once she accumulates a specified number of points on the airline frequent flyer scheme, she can exchange them for free or discounted travel. 131. In the course of the employee’s work, she incurs several employment-related charges on the credit card as well as private expenditure. The employee accumulates points on the credit card points reward scheme for both types of expenditure. She soon reaches the specified threshold of points, and transfers them to a particular airline’s frequent flyer scheme, exchanging them for a free trip to Fiji. 132. Section CX 2(2) will not apply on the facts of this example. The receipt of the points under the credit card company’s points reward scheme is because of the contractual arrangement between the credit card company and the employee. No arrangement exists between the employer and the credit card company to provide the employee with entitlements under its points reward scheme or the associated airline’s frequent flyer scheme. It does not matter that some of the points that give the entitlement result from employment-related expenditure. Example 9 133. Following from example 8, in the following year the employee is promoted in the company and receives a corporate charge card on which she is specified as the cardholder. The charge card is from a different company to that which issued her personal card. This particular charge card company also allows cardholders to join its points reward scheme. The employee joins the points rewards scheme as an individual member and pays the membership fee personally. The employee’s employer is not involved in encouraging the employee to join the scheme. This scheme also allows an accumulation of points as goods and services are charged on the card and a transfer of points, subject to certain conditions, to a participating airline’s frequent flyer scheme. 134. Any entitlement received by the employee under the credit card company’s points reward scheme will not amount to a “fringe benefit” under section CX 2(2). There is no arrangement between the employer and the credit card company to provide entitlements to the employee under the points reward scheme. The employee receives those entitlements because of her contractual relationship with the credit card company. 23 24 Example 10 135. QRS purchases motor vehicles for business purposes from a motor vehicle dealer. As a result of QRS’ substantial custom, the dealer states that it will discount QRS’ future purchases. It also informs QRS that the more vehicles purchased, the greater the discount. In order to increase the discount, QRS suggests to the dealer that it offer the same discount to the employees of QRS. QRS tells the dealer that many of its employees would like to purchase vehicles and it expects that they would be induced to buy vehicles from the dealer if they were offered the same discount. The dealer agrees that it will offer the employees the same discount as it provides to QRS. 136. In this example, QRS has requested that the dealer provide its employees with a discount on any vehicles they purchase. Because of QRS’ substantial custom, the dealer agreed to offer the discount to the employees. There is an arrangement between the dealer and QRS that is for the provision of a benefit (i.e. the discount) to the employees. Although the dominant purpose of QRS may be to obtain a higher discount on its future vehicle purchases, a significant purpose of it entering into the arrangement is so that the same discount is offered to its employees. Therefore section CX 2(2) will apply, because QRS made the arrangement with a more than incidental purpose to provide its employees with a benefit.
“COST PRICE OF THE VEHICLE” – MEANING OF THE TERM FOR FRINGE BENEFIT TAX PURPOSES Public Ruling - BR Pub 09/08 Note (not part of ruling): The key issue considered by this ruling is what is included in the “cost price” of a motor vehicle for fringe benefit tax purposes. The conclusion is that the cost price includes the vehicle’s purchase price, initial registration and licence plate fees, the cost of accessories (other than “business accessories”), and the cost of transporting the vehicle to the place where it is first to be used (each of these costs being on a GST-inclusive basis). This ruling replaces public ruling BR Pub 03/06, which was published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 15, No 9 (September 2003). BR Pub 03/06 applied until 31 October 2008 and was a reissue of BR Pub 00/10, which was published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 10 (October 2000). This ruling is essentially the same as BR Pub 03/06, but now indicates that the Commissioner is prepared to accept that sign-writing the vehicle in the employer’s colours (in physical terms, the addition of paint or other graphics) is not part of the cost price of the vehicle for FBT purposes. A reference is also made to road user charges. The ruling has been updated to apply the Income Tax Act 2007, which came into force on 1 April 2008. The changes between the provisions in the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Income Tax Act 2007 do not affect the conclusions previously reached. BR Pub 09/08 applies for an indefinite period beginning on 1 November 2008. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section CX 6(a) and Schedule 5 (and the meaning of “cost price” for the purposes of determining the value of a benefit to an employee). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the provision of a motor vehicle by an employer, who owns, leases, or rents a motor vehicle, to an employee for the employee’s private use and enjoyment. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: The “cost price of the vehicle” for the purposes of the calculation of fringe benefit tax under section CX 6(a) and Schedule 5 will be determined as follows. • The “cost price of the vehicle” will include the: - purchase price of the vehicle (inclusive of goods and services tax (GST)); 1 - cost of initial registration and licence plate fees (inclusive of GST); - cost of accessories, components, and equipment (other than “business accessories”) fitted to the vehicle at the time of purchase or at any time thereafter (all costs inclusive of GST); - cost (if any), including freight insurance costs and any customs duty, of transporting the motor vehicle to the place where the motor vehicle is to be first used (all charges inclusive of GST). • The “cost price of the vehicle” will not include the cost of: - annual vehicle re-licensing fees; - road user charges; - sign-writing the vehicle in the employer’s colours or style (in physical terms, the addition of paint or other graphics such as magnetic signs, decals or transfers); - “business accessories”, fitted to the motor vehicle at the time of purchase or at any time thereafter; and - financing the purchase of the vehicle. For the purposes of this Ruling the terms “business accessories” and “fitted to the vehicle” have the following meanings. • The term “business accessories” means accessories, components, and equipment fitted to the vehicle, required for and relating solely to the business operations for which the vehicle is used, and that are in themselves “depreciable property” for the purposes of the Act. Where powered, they will usually require the vehicle’s power source to operate them (for example, a two-way radio, roof-mounted flashing warning lights, and electronic testing/monitoring equipment). • The term “fitted to the vehicle” means permanently affixed to the vehicle. Permanency would not be negated if the accessory were removed from the vehicle on a temporary basis, for repair or maintenance, or on the removal of the accessory at the time of sale or disposal of the vehicle or the accessory itself. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for an indefinite period beginning on 1 November 2008. This Ruling is signed by me on the 30 th day of November 2009. Susan Price Director, Public Rulings 2 Commentary on Public Ruling BR Pub 09/08 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusion reached in public ruling BR Pub 09/08 (“the Ruling”). All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. Background If an employee has the private use or enjoyment, or the availability for private use or enjoyment, of a motor vehicle that is made available by the employer of the employee, the employer must pay fringe benefit tax (FBT) on the value of the benefit. An employer has the option (since 1 April 2006) of valuing owned, leased, or rented motor vehicles at either the vehicle’s cost price or tax value. When choosing the cost price option the benefit is calculated by reference to the cost price of the vehicle to the employer, not the value of the benefit to the employee. If an employer purchases, leases, or rents a motor vehicle to be used by, or to be made available for use by, an employee, costs are incurred in addition to the purchase price of the vehicle for the vehicle to be in a state where it can be used by the employee. Additional costs include: • on-road costs – under section 5 of the Transport (Vehicle and Driver Registration and Licensing) Act 1986, no motor vehicle can be driven on the road unless the: - motor vehicle is registered; and - registration plates and a current licence issued for the vehicle are affixed and displayed on the vehicle; and - full amount of the accident compensation levy has been paid; • road user charges – under section 5 of the Road User Charges Act 1977 subject to section 7 of the Road User Charges Act 1977, no person shall operate certain motor vehicles on a road unless there is carried on the motor vehicle in accordance with the Road User Charges Act 1977 a distance licence; • the cost, including freight insurance costs and any customs duty, of transporting the vehicle to the initial place where it is to be used; • the cost of fitted accessories, components, or equipment required for and relating solely to the business operations for which the vehicle is used; and • the cost of accessories, components, and equipment, such as tow bars, roof racks, and stereos, fitted to the car at the time of purchase or at some later time. This Ruling identifies the costs that form part of the “cost price of the vehicle” for the purposes of calculating FBT. The Commissioner considers the cost of a motor vehicle includes any accessories that are permanently affixed to the vehicle. Everything that is permanently affixed to the vehicle, including accessories such as CD players, tow bars, and radio-telephone sets, is part of the cost to the employer of making the vehicle available to the employee. Accessories that are not permanently affixed are not part of the cost price of the vehicle in the first place and their FBT (or other income tax) status is to be determined separately. However, the Commissioner 3 considers that certain accessories, permanently fitted to the vehicle and relating solely to the business operations for which the vehicle is used, should not be treated as part of the cost of the vehicle for FBT purposes. For example, a radio- telephone set fitted to the vehicle and able to be used only for business purposes would be excluded from the vehicle’s cost price because it is a “business accessory”. On the other hand, a mobile phone is an example of an item considered not to be part of the cost price of the vehicle because it does not meet the test of being permanently affixed to the vehicle. Legislation The legislative provisions relevant to the subsequent analysis in this commentary are set out below. Section CX 6 provides that a fringe benefit arises, when a motor vehicle is made available to an employee for their private use, and section RD 29(2) and (4) sets out the formulae for calculating the value of such a benefit: RD 29 Private use of motor vehicle: formulas ... Quarterly payment (2) If FBT is paid quarterly, the value of the benefit is calculated using the formula— 90 amount5scheduledays× ... Payment by income year (4) If FBT is paid on an income year basis, the value of the benefit is calculated using the formula— 365 amount5scheduledays× Clause 1 paragraphs (a)(i) and (b)(i) of Schedule 5 state: Fringe benefit values for motor vehicles 1 The following paragraphs apply to determine the value of the benefit that an employee has for a quarter, tax year, or income year when section RD 60 applies, if in the quarter, tax year, or income year, a motor vehicle is provided by a person for the private use of an employee, or is made available for their private use: (a) if the vehicle is owned by the person, jointly or otherwise,— (i) on the basis of the cost price of the vehicle to the person: for a quarter, 5% of the cost price, and for a tax year or income year, 20% of the cost price: (ii) ... (b) if the vehicle is leased or rented by the person from another person, whether they are associated or not,— (i) on the basis of the cost price of the vehicle to its owner at the time the benefit is provided to the employee: for a quarter, 5% of the cost price, and for a tax year or income year, 20% of the cost price : \[Emphasis added.\] 4 Clause 8 of Schedule 5 provides: To determine the value of a benefit under clause 1⎯ (a) any GST paid on the acquisition of a vehicle by the owner or lessor of the vehicle is⎯ (i) included in the cost price of the motor vehicle or in the calculation of the motor vehicle’s tax value: (ii) not reduced by an amount of input tax on the supply of the vehicle to the owner or lessor: The definition of “adjusted tax value” in section YA 1(a) provides: adjusted tax value— (a) is defined in sections EE 55 to EE 60 ... Sections EE 55(1)(a), EE 56(1) and (2), and EE 57(1) and (2), which are particularly relevant to this matter, provide: EE 55 Meaning of adjusted tax value (1) Adjusted tax value means,— (a) for an item of depreciable property, the amount calculated using the formula in section EE 56: ... EE 56 Formula Formula (1) The formula referred to in section EE 55 is— base value – total deductions. Definition of items in formula (2) In the formula,— (a) base value has the applicable meaning in sections EE 57, EE 58, EE 59, and EZ 22(1) (Base value and total deductions in section EE 56: before 1 April 1995): ... EE 57 Base value in section EE 56 when none of sections EE 58, EE 59, and EZ 22(1) applies When this section applies (1) This section applies when none of sections EE 58, EE 59, and EZ 22(1) (Base value and total deductions in section EE 56: before 1 April 1995) applies. Base value (2) Base value is the cost of the item to the person. Application of the legislation The determinative factor in the calculation of FBT on motor vehicles is the “cost price of the vehicle to the person” (that is, the employer, as provided in CIR v Atlas Copco (NZ) Ltd (1990) 12 NZTC 7,327) where the employer is the owner or, if the vehicle is leased or rented, the cost price of the vehicle to its owner at the time the benefit is provided to the employee: Schedule 5. The High Court decision of CIR v Atlas Copco (NZ) Ltd was a test case regarding the meaning of “cost price” for the purposes of FBT. More specifically the issue in this case was whether “cost price” included or excluded GST. Sinclair J held that “cost price” is the GST exclusive cost to the employer of providing the benefit to the employee. 5 Following this decision Parliament amended the law to expressly provide that “cost price” included GST and to reflect that the intention of the FBT rules is to equate the “cost price” of motor vehicles with the cost that the employee would have had to pay had the employee purchased the vehicle (see: Tax Amendment Act (No. 3) 1991). This amendment only dealt with GST. There were no other changes made to the existing legislative wording for valuing the benefit to an employee. The reference to the cost price remained “the cost price of the motor vehicle to that person” (being the person providing the benefit). A set rate (now 5% for a quarter and 20% for a tax or income year under clause 8 of Schedule 5) is then applied to the GST inclusive cost price to arrive at the value of the benefit to an employee. Meaning of “cost price” “Cost price” is not defined in the Act for the purposes of the FBT rules. It is therefore not clear whether it is limited to the purchase price of the vehicle, as some suggest, or whether it includes costs incidental to the purchase, such as on road costs and the costs of transporting the vehicle to the place where it is to be used. However, as shown below, the use of the term throughout the Act - in the trading stock rules, the depreciation rules and in other contexts - and as reflected in accounting practice and relevant case law, indicates that “cost” and “cost price” are interchangeable. Consequently, “cost price” includes costs incidental to the purchase, such as on road costs and the costs of transporting the vehicle to the place where it will be used. “Cost” and “cost price” in the Act The words “cost” and “cost price” are used extensively throughout the Act. The definitions of “cost” and “cost price” in section YA 1, which defines the words for a limited number of sections, indicate that the two words are effectively synonymous and that they include more than simply the purchase price. Examples include the following: • For the purposes of Part EB (Valuation of trading stock) “cost” is defined as: In subpart EB (...) for trading stock, means costs incurred in the ordinary course of business to bring trading stock to its present location and condition including purchase costs and costs of production calculated under sections EB 6 to EB 8. \[Emphasis added.\] • “Cost price” in relation to “specified leases” means: the amount of expenditure of a capital nature that is incurred, in acquiring and installing the asset,— (i) by the lessor; \[Emphasis added.\] The significance of these two definitions (even though they have limited application in the Act) is that they both include a reference to costs (“bringing to its present location” and “installing”) that are more than simply the purchase price of the item in question. In the definition of “cost” (for the purposes of the trading stock rules), it could be argued that getting the stock “to its present location” is synonymous with “installing” as used in the definition of “cost price”. “Install” is defined in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary (11 th ed, 2006) as “place or fix (equipment) in position ready for use”. While the two definitions relate to the two different sides of the revenue–capital distinction, they both relate to the assets used in a business. 6 Where the words are used in other parts of the Act and there is no specific definition, it is considered that “cost price” should be given a similar interpretation. This means that “cost price” as used for FBT purposes also means “cost”. Trading stock context The definition of “cost” applying to the valuation of trading stock requires the “cost” to include (section YA 1): Costs incurred in the ordinary course of business to bring trading stock to its present location and condition, including purchase costs and costs of production, calculated under sections EB 6 to EB 8. The requirements for valuing trading stock under section EB 6, which essentially says that the trading stock valuation must comply with the New Zealand International Accounting standard NZIAS2 or an equivalent standard issued in its place, endorse the view that “cost” and “cost price” are effectively interchangeable. Under NZIAS2, Inventories it is stated that: 10 The cost of inventories shall comprise all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. \[Emphasis added.\] Similarly the predecessor of NZIAS2, FRS4, which applied from 1994, indicated “cost” and “cost price” were interchangeable by taxpayers in valuing trading stock under the former valuation option, “cost price”, and that the Commissioner accepted similar calculations to FRS 4. That is illustrated by the contents of an item on the valuation of trading stock published in Public Information Bulletin No 82 (December 1974). This item set out the three options available to taxpayers: cost price, market selling value, or replacement price. The item then went on to define “cost” (note, not “cost price”). In respect of purchases of finished goods, the item said (at page 2): Here the cost should include freight inwards, customs duty, insurance, and sales tax in addition to the actual purchase price of the goods. \[Emphasis added.\] This view that “cost” and “cost price” have the same meaning finds support in the decisions referred to below. Both the Australian decisions of Phillip Morris Ltd v FCT \[1979\] ATC 4, 352, and Australasian Jam Company Proprietary Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation 88 CLR, 23, considered section 31(1) of the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, which gave taxpayers an option of valuing trading stock at its “cost price”. The wording of the section was very similar to the former New Zealand equivalent - section EE 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994 before amendments that applied from the 1998/99 income year (that is, the same “cost price” option applied to New Zealand taxpayers). It follows that in considering the use of the words “cost price” in New Zealand, New Zealand courts would arguably adopt the same position the Australian courts adopted in those decisions. • In Phillip Morris Ltd v FCT \[1979\] ATC 4, 352, the Supreme Court of Victoria had to decide what constituted “cost price” for the valuation of cigarettes (trading stock) on hand at the end of an income year under section 31(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Australia). Jenkinson J said: 7 the words “cost price” in section 31(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 should be understood as meaning “cost” (page 355). The statutory conception of “cost price” or, in the case of manufacturer’s stock, “cost” is merely a value at a particular time... \[Emphasis added. Page 360\] ... • In Australasian Jam Company Proprietary Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation 88 CLR, 23, Fullagar J said (at page 529): The words “cost price” in the section \[relating to the valuation of trading stock\] are perhaps not literally appropriate to goods manufactured, as distinct from goods purchased, by the taxpayer, but I feel no difficulty in reading them as meaning simply “cost”. \[Emphasis added.\] \[See also “Some Aspects of Valuation of Trading Stock for Income Tax Purposes” (1964) 1 NZULR 256, ILM Richardson (now Sir Ivor) which endorsed Fullagar J’s view in Australasian Jam at page 261 – “If “price” adds anything to “cost” it is only in emphasis, in stressing that what is involved is the actual expenditure of money by the taxpayer with relation to the trading stock”.\] • In TRA Case S12 (1995) 17 NZTC 7,102, Barber DJ considered what is meant by “its cost price” in relation to the valuation of foals born to broodmares owned by a horse breeder. He determined that the foal’s cost price should include the write-down (depreciation) of the broodmare. Barber DJ said (at page 7,107): The Legislature has provided that the breeder or farmer must take progeny into account at “its cost price”. Those words do not seem to me to be a particularly happy choice because “cost price” is normally that which a merchant buys something (refer Sixth Edition of the Concise Oxford Dictionary). The cost is the price to be paid for a thing and the price is the money or other consideration for which a thing is bought or sold. The taxpayer has not purchased the foal but has had the foal created through the mare after servicing from the stallion. However, in their context, the words “its cost price” must be given a sensible interpretation. In the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (3rd Edition) a meaning for “cost” is “That which must be given in order to acquire, produce or effect something”. \[Emphasis added.\] Accounting practice more generally The Atlas Copco decision also provides support for the view that “cost” and “cost price” effectively have the same meaning. In Atlas Copco, for example: • Sinclair J (at page 7,332) referred to expert accounting evidence on the meaning of “cost” and stated: This accords with the expert evidence given by two accountants, Mr John Hagen and Professor David Emanuel. Professor Emanuel cited a number of definitions of “cost” from leading textbooks on accounting: “(a) ‘Costs represent the financial sacrifices which are involved in acquiring or producing assets.’ Ma, Matthews and MacMullen, The Accounting Framework (2 nd Ed, \[Longman Cheshire\] 1986) at p 43. (b) ‘Accountants have placed a great deal of emphasis upon the principle of objective evidence, and nowhere is it more apparent 8 than in accounting for the acquisition of plant and equipment. Cost is used as the valuation method in this instance because it is more easily identified than any other valuation and because it is said to be the sacrifice given up now to accomplish future objectives.’ \[McCullers and Schroeder, Accounting Theory: Text and Readings (Wiley, 1978,)\] at p 233. (c) ‘We define cost here as the sum of the quantitative representations of the sacrifices necessarily incurred to bring the fixed asset to its place and state of use.’ Most, Accounting Theory (\[Grid\] 1977) at p 235. \[Emphasis added.\] (d) ‘Cost is thus the economic sacrifice expressed in monetary terms required to obtain a specific asset or group of assets.’ Hendriksen, Accounting Theory (3 rd Ed, \[Irwin, by ES Hendriksen\] 1977) at p 270. (e) ‘Cost is an economic sacrifice, an outflow of wealth, by giving up asset value or incurring liability value.’ Staubus, Activity Costing for Decisions (\[Garland Publishers, New York,\] 1988) at p 192.” Professor Emanuel then summarised the position by saying that: “Cost is the economic sacrifice associated with getting the purchased item to its current location and condition.” \[Emphasis added.\] \[It is interesting to note that here the accountants used the term “cost” rather than “cost price” – the term (as used in Schedule 5) that the court was considering.\] • When the Commissioner objected to the evidence of the accountants Sinclair J said (at page 7,333): Counsel for the Commissioner objected to the evidence of the two accountants on the basis that the interpretation of “cost price” is a question of law for the Court, and to rely upon the interpretation of accountants would infringe the “ultimate issue” rule. Moreover, counsel felt that the accountants had mistakenly placed economic substance over legal form in analysing the nature of the payment paid by the purchaser. It is true that defining “cost price” is a question of statutory interpretation and, as such, must be resolved by the Court. Where the meaning of words in a statutory context is unclear or ambiguous, however, the Court may derive some assistance from common business parlance and practice, as well as international standards. Moreover, as I have already discussed, the approach of the accountants accords with both the economic substance and the legal form of the transaction: the GST component of the purchase price which may be recovered by a registered purchaser cannot be considered part of the effective “cost price”. \[Emphasis added.\] Here, the Court accepts that where there is uncertainty in the legislation common business practice can be taken into account in defining terms or words. As sufficient doubt surrounds the use of the words in question, accounting or business usage may be of assistance. Generally, the accounting treatment is that the initial cost of a fixed asset includes the costs of putting it into the working condition necessary for its intended use, installation costs, freight and so on (see, for example, NZIAS2 and the expert evidence given in Atlas Copco). 9 Depreciation context The only provisions that deal with valuation of capital assets in the Act are the depreciation rules set out in Subpart EE. Generally, business assets are “depreciable property” as defined in section EE 6. Section EE 6 provides that depreciable property is property that: ...might reasonably be expected to decline in value while it is used or available for use ... in carrying on a business for the purposes of deriving assessable income. This is provided the assets are not trading stock, land, financial arrangements, or intangible property. Motor vehicles are “depreciable property” and qualify for depreciation deductions under Part EE. Under section EE 17(4) the value or cost to calculate depreciation is, where the: • diminishing value method is being used, on the “adjusted tax value” of the item; or • straight-line method is being used, on the “cost of the item” to the taxpayer. “Cost” is not defined in the Act for the purposes of section EE 17. Section YA 1 provides that “adjusted tax value” is defined in sections EE 55 to EE 60. The main component of the formula to calculate the adjusted tax value is the “base value” of the property (section 56). “Base value” in most cases, especially in respect of property acquired after the beginning of the 1993/94 income year, will be its “cost” (sections EE 57(2), EE 58, and EE 59). As stated above, as far as trading stock is concerned there appears to be no difference between the use of the words “cost” and “cost price”. The words are interchangeable. If the same applies in respect of the word “cost” used in Subpart EE, it could mean that “cost” and “cost price” are interchangeable elsewhere in the Act (for example, in Schedule 5, in determining the “cost price” of a motor vehicle for FBT purposes). Conclusion On the above analysis, it is concluded that “cost” and “cost price” as used in the Act are interchangeable. The calculations of both terms, using accepted accounting principles, include costs in addition to what can be termed the “purchase price”. This means that for the purposes of the phrase “cost price of the motor vehicle” in the FBT rules, the “cost price” of a motor vehicle will be more than just its purchase price. What is the “cost price” of a motor vehicle for fringe benefit tax purposes? When a new motor vehicle is purchased, government charges have to be paid before the purchaser can use the vehicle on the road. The purchaser may also have accessories fitted to the vehicle at the time of purchase or later. Some of these accessories may be of a non-business nature, such as a tow bar, a CD player, conversion to compressed natural gas (CNG) or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), air conditioning, or alloy wheels. Generally, unless these accessories are part of a special deal, they will be additional costs to the purchaser. In some instances, the purchaser may have a business accessory, such as a radio- telephone, fitted to the vehicle at the time of purchase or later. 10 The question to be considered is whether all or any of the cost of these items forms part of the “cost price” of the vehicle. Government charges Fees payable at the time of the purchase of a new car so that it can be driven on the road include: • once-only payments: the registration fee and number plate fee; and • ongoing (recurring) fees: the annual re-licensing fee, the accident compensation levy, the label fee, and road user charges. It is arguable that without payment of the initial registration and plate fees (as distinct from the recurring annual re-licensing fees) by the owner the vehicle cannot be used immediately. The owner has to pay these costs before the vehicle can be “put on the road” or in a position to be used. This suggests these costs are properly to be treated as part of the “cost price” of the car. Support for the view that “cost” includes such items as getting the vehicle “on the road” so that it can be used, is found in the High Court of Australia case BP Refinery (Kwinana) Ltd v FCT (1960) 8 AITR 113. Kitto J, in considering the issue of what was included in the term “cost”, said (at page 117): ...in my opinion, the word “cost” in section 56(1)(b) \[of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936\] bears the meaning which it has in the business life of the community. It seems to me impossible to suppose that the depreciation provisions of the Act are intended to apply only to those simple cases in which the ascertainment of cost is a purely arithmetical process. I interpret it as embracing the whole sum which, according to accepted accountancy practice as applied to the circumstances of the case, ought to be considered as having been laid out by the taxpayer in order to acquire the subject-matter as plant, that is to say installed and ready for use as plant for the purpose of producing assessable income. \[Emphasis added.\] Therefore, the cost of the vehicle must include expenditure making it “ready for use” by the taxpayer. Without payment of the registration and plate fees, the vehicle is not ready for the purpose intended. Whether the costs of the initial registration fee and the plate fee form part of the cost of the vehicle is not entirely clear. The Commissioner considers the better view of the law, and the likely intent of Parliament, is that such expenses form part of the cost price of the vehicle, particularly given that they are one-off costs that fall into the “once and for all payments” category (see BP Australia Ltd v FCT \[1965\] 3 All ER 209). Therefore, they are capital in nature. These fees are intended to make the vehicle able to be used. The remaining fees are annual or ongoing charges and normal accounting practice would treat them as revenue expenditure, even if they were incurred upon the purchase of the vehicle. In summary, the better view is that registration and plate fees are “once and for all” payments, are of a capital nature, make the vehicle able to be used, and are part of the “cost price” of the vehicle. Ongoing charges (such as licensing, the accident compensation levy, and road user charges) are revenue expenditure, so are not part of the “cost price”. 11 Business accessories Generally, accessories permanently fitted to the motor vehicle are properly to be included as part of the vehicle’s cost. As discussed earlier, accessories, such as stereos, tow bars, and roof racks, fitted to a vehicle will form part of its cost price. However, some components or equipment fitted to vehicles may be of a purely business nature. The issue arises as to whether such components or equipment should also be included in the “cost price of the vehicle” for FBT purposes. There is no legislative direction on this issue. This may indicate that all accessories, components, or equipment attached to the vehicle form part of its “cost price”. It is arguable, however, that business accessories, components, and equipment fitted to the vehicle should not be treated as forming part of the cost price where they are required and relate solely to the special business operations for which the vehicle is used, and are in themselves depreciable property for the purposes of the Act (for example, a two-way radio-telephone in a salesperson’s vehicle). Such components or equipment are fitted to the vehicle to facilitate the business use of the vehicle and may be considered as separate business assets located in the vehicle. Another factor (relevant to this last-mentioned aspect) possibly pointing to the components or equipment as not being part of the cost price, is the nature of the assets and how they are treated by businesses for accounting purposes. For example, it is most likely that components such as two-way radios are accounted for and depreciated separately. The radios can be removed from vehicles or moved from one vehicle to another, so it seems logical that they be treated as separate assets for depreciation purposes. \[Note that motor vehicles and radio- telephone equipment are listed separately in the Commissioner’s Table of Depreciation Rates.\] Two-way radios have their own depreciation rate because they are regarded as assets in their own right and not accessories to a motor vehicle. They form part of a larger asset, for example, the entire radio-telephone network, consisting of radios in vehicles and the central control unit in the employer’s premises. In such circumstances, even though they are a form of accessory or addition to the motor vehicle, they are an asset in their own right, and therefore require a separate asset classification. Usually, radio networks are purchased as a package consisting of radios (one for each vehicle) plus the central control station. To treat the network as part of the cost price of each car would require an apportionment of the overall expense, including installation costs to each vehicle. The Commissioner does not consider this to be a sensible approach. The same could be said of accessories such as roof-mounted flashing lights and electronic monitoring equipment. If these types of assets are added to the vehicle because they are required for and relate solely to the business operations for which the vehicle is used, they will be treated similarly to the two-way radio system. Therefore, where business components, such as two-way radios, roof-mounted flashing lights, and electronic testing or monitoring equipment, are fitted to the vehicle and are paid for by the employer, they do not form part of the vehicle’s “cost price” for FBT purposes. As mentioned earlier, such accessories are business assets of the employer, coming within the definition of “depreciable property” for the purposes of the Act. 12 As previously discussed under the heading “Application of the legislation”, it was the intent of Parliament to equate the “cost price” of motor vehicles with the cost that the employee would have had to pay had the employee purchased the vehicle rather than having it provided by the employer. It follows that if the employee had to pay for the vehicle, the cost to the employee must also include accessories fitted to the vehicle as already discussed. Exceptions are the cost of separately depreciable components or equipment fitted to the vehicle solely to meet the special needs of any business operations for which the vehicle is used. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that business components fitted to the vehicle that are required for and relate solely to the business operations for which the vehicle is used and are in themselves depreciable property should be excluded from the “cost price” of motor vehicles for FBT purposes. This covers assets requiring the vehicle’s power source in order to operate: they are not part of the cost price of the car itself. There may be isolated instances, where the type of business asset mentioned above will unavoidably be used for non-business purposes. The Commissioner considers that any extraordinary and unenvisaged use of the accessory for non- business use over the life of the asset will not in itself negate the purpose of fitting the accessory to be “solely for business purposes” in this context. Cost of non-business accessories Commonly, when a vehicle is purchased the owner asks for certain “extras” or accessories (other than business accessories) to be fitted to the vehicle. If these accessories are not “optioned” (and included in the purchase price), the dealer will charge for their cost and fitting to the vehicle. Such accessories can include: a stereo, a tow bar, a sunroof, a roof rack, CNG/LPG conversion, alloy wheels, air-conditioning, electric windows and locking systems, and higher specification tyres. Where the vendor charges for any of these accessories, the question arises as to whether they should be added to the “cost price” of the vehicle for FBT purposes. The same issue arises if the accessories are acquired from another person or supplier, or acquired later. Such accessories are of a capital nature and should be added to the vehicle’s purchase price to arrive at its “cost price”. They are part of the vehicle as a whole and are not generally removed at the time the vehicle is sold or otherwise disposed of. They are either singularly or collectively “once and for all” payment(s), culminating in the “cost price” of the vehicle that is provided to the employee by the employer for the employee’s “private use and enjoyment”. Under this interpretation, the cost price may vary from period to period, depending on when accessories are added (or in the unlikely or rarer event of an accessory being removed). Therefore, in summary, accessories fitted to a vehicle form part of its “cost price” for FBT purposes (as contemplated in Schedule 5), irrespective of the time they are purchased and fitted to the vehicle. Cost of sign-writing or painting the vehicle in the employer’s colours or design There are different types of sign-writing that fall into some broad categories including magnetic decals or door magnets that can be removed, decals or 13 transfers that cannot be easily removed and colour or paint that is applied permanently to a motor vehicle. So far as magnetic decals or door magnets that are designed to be easily removed are concerned they do not become part of a vehicle and it seems reasonably clear that they should not form part of a vehicle’s cost price for FBT purposes. Other non removable sign-writing is, however, potentially part of the cost price of a vehicle in the same way that accessories such as stereos, tow bars and roof racks, fitted to a vehicle will form part of its cost price. However, it is accepted that sign-writing costs are purely of a business nature. Given this, although they are not in every case able to be separately depreciated, the Commissioner accepts that such costs do not form part of the cost price of the vehicle for FBT purposes. Transporting or freighting the vehicle to its place of use In the above discussion on “cost price”, it is clear that the courts have accepted that the cost of transporting or freighting goods (whether those goods are trading stock or capital assets of the business) to the place where they are to be used is part of the cost of the goods. Generally, the initial cost of fixed assets will include expenditure incurred to put the asset into the working condition necessary for its intended use. In Atlas Copco (at page 333) there was reference to, “cost is ... associated with getting the purchased item to its current location and condition”, which includes installation costs and freight. The cost of transporting a purchased motor vehicle to the place where it can be used by the taxpayer is clearly part of its “cost price”, both for FBT and depreciation purposes; for example, the purchase of vehicles direct from a manufacturer or from another source overseas, where the purchaser pays for the cost of transporting the vehicle to New Zealand. Transport costs incurred may include the physical transportation costs as well as freight insurance costs and any customs duty. It is the Commissioner’s view that these transport costs form part of the “cost price” of the vehicle for FBT purposes. However, these costs relate only to the initial cost of getting the vehicle to the place it will first be used by the owner after acquisition. Subsequent transport costs of moving the vehicle within New Zealand (say from one branch of the employer’s firm to another), including any costs of insuring the vehicle for such transport, are considered part of the employer’s normal business operations and on revenue account. Cost of repairs and maintenance and capital expenditure Another issue relates to the costs of repairs and maintenance to the vehicle and/or accessories, and whether they should be added to the cost price as capital expenditure. Generally, repairs and maintenance expenditure on the vehicle or accessories will not increase the vehicle’s “cost price” for FBT purposes. However, if work on the car is more than normal repairs and maintenance, such as replacing the existing motor with one of larger capacity, the question arises whether that alteration increases the cost price of the vehicle for FBT purposes. If the repair or replacement is considered to be of a revenue nature and deductible for income 14 tax purposes, the cost price of the vehicle will not increase in value for the calculation of FBT. On the other hand, if the repair or replacement is of a capital nature, the cost price for FBT purposes must be increased by the amount of that capitalisation. Each case needs to be considered on the basis of its own facts, applying the established capital/revenue tests. If the FBT cost price is increased, the recalculation of FBT (on the increased cost price) will apply from the quarter in which that capital expenditure was incurred. Examples Example 1 Employer A purchases a second-hand motor vehicle as a company car for the use of a salesperson employee. The employee will be travelling long distances, so the employer purchases a CD player and has it fitted to the vehicle. The employee has full use of the vehicle for private use and is likely to tow his own trailer from time to time, so he asks the employer to purchase and fit a tow bar to the vehicle. The employer agrees. The “cost price” of the vehicle for FBT purposes will be the total of the purchase price plus the cost of acquiring and fitting the CD player and the tow bar (all costs GST inclusive). Example 2 Employer B is looking for a vehicle to replace an existing vehicle written-off by the firm’s Wellington-based accountant. The accountant will be entitled to use the vehicle for private purposes when it is not being used for business purposes. While on a trip to Auckland, the employer locates a suitable second-hand car, purchases it, and has it transported to Wellington where the accountant will use it. The “cost price” of the car for FBT purposes will be the purchase price plus the cost, including freight insurance costs, of transporting it to Wellington (all costs GST inclusive). Example 3 Employer C decides to replace the company’s fleet of cars used by its sales representatives, because of the high cost of maintaining the existing fleet. The sales representatives are permitted to use the vehicles for private use when they are not required for business purposes. Through a contact with a motor vehicle dealer, the company decides to purchase 10 second-hand diesel powered cars direct from Japan. The employer agrees on a purchase price with a Japanese car dealer and arranges for the vehicles to be shipped to New Zealand. In New Zealand employer C arranges for the company logo to be painted onto the vehicles and purchases a 1000 km road user charge distance licence for each vehicle. The “cost price” of the vehicles for FBT purposes will be the total of: • the purchase price of the cars, including any costs or commissions paid in Japan or New Zealand; • the cost of transporting the cars to New Zealand, including freight insurance costs and any customs duty; 15 • GST and any import or inspection levies payable at the time of importation; • the cost of initial registration and licence plate fees; and • the cost of any accessories fitted to the cars at the time of purchase or any time after purchase, either in Japan or New Zealand. The “cost price” of the vehicles for FBT purposes will not include: • the cost of road user charges; and • the cost of sign-writing the vehicles with employer C’s logo. Example 4 Employer D is a forestry contracting firm that has recently purchased a four- wheel drive motor vehicle for its forestry foreman. The foreman has the full use and enjoyment of the vehicle for private purposes while not working. As with the employer’s other work vehicles, the car is fitted with a radio-telephone used only for communication between the company’s headquarters and its own vehicles. The radio-telephone is fitted solely for business purposes and may be considered a separately depreciable business asset located in the vehicle, so it does not form part of the cost price of the vehicle for FBT purposes. Example 5 An employee of employer E is a travelling salesperson. When the employer purchased a new vehicle for the employee’s use, a mobile phone kit (mobile phone and car kit) was installed in the car at the employer’s expense. The cost of the mobile phone is excluded from the cost price of the motor vehicle because it is not “permanently affixed to the vehicle”. Whether use of the mobile phone gives rise to a fringe benefit in its own right will need to be considered under the FBT rules generally, including section CX 21, which applies to the use of “business tools”. 16
Note (not part of the Rulings): These rulings deal with the payment of a break fee by a landlord to exit early from, or vary the interest rate of, a fixed interest rate loan. It was considered appropriate to issue two separate rulings to deal with the two scenarios. However, a single commentary applies to both rulings. DEDUCTIBILITY OF BREAK FEE PAID BY A LANDLORD TO EXIT EARLY FROM A FIXED INTEREST RATE LOAN PUBLIC RULING – BR PUB 09/09 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This ruling applies in respect of sections DA 1, DB 6, DB 7, and EW 31 and the definition of “interest” in section YA 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is where a person has entered into a fixed interest rate loan and the money has been used to acquire a property from which rental income is derived or to refinance another loan used for that purpose. The person subsequently pays a break fee to the lender to repay in full and terminate that loan earlier than its agreed repayment date. It does not matter whether the loan is replaced by further borrowing from either the same or a different lender. This Ruling will not apply where the loan is not used solely for the deriving of rental income, or where the loan is part of or connected with one or more other financial arrangements between the lender and the borrower. This Ruling will also not apply if the taxpayer has adopted the IFRS financial reporting method in section EW 15D. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the arrangement as follows: • A base price adjustment will be required. • The amount of any break fee will be included in the “consideration” element of the base price adjustment formula for a borrower and will increase the overall negative figure that the base price adjustment provides. • The negative amount under the base price adjustment will be expenditure incurred under the financial arrangements rules and will be interest. • An automatic deduction will be available for companies (other than qualifying companies) for the negative base price adjustment amount as interest under section DB 7. • A deduction will be available for other taxpayers under section DB 6, provided the general permission in section DA 1 is satisfied. 1 • Where the money was borrowed to purchase a property from which rental income is derived, the general permission will be satisfied. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This ruling will apply from the first day of the 2008/09 income year to the last day of the 2011/12 income year. This ruling is signed by me on the 16 th day of December 2009. Martin Smith Chief Tax Counsel 2 DEDUCTIBILITY OF BREAK FEE PAID BY LANDLORD TO VARY THE INTEREST RATE OF AN EXISTING FIXED INTEREST RATE LOAN PUBLIC RULING – BR PUB 09/10 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This ruling applies in respect of sections DA 1, DB 6, DB 7, and EW 31 and the definition of “interest” in section YA 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is where a person has entered into a fixed interest rate loan and the money has been used to acquire a property from which rental income is derived or to refinance another loan used for that purpose. The person then subsequently pays a break fee to the lender for a variation of that loan to adjust the interest rate. This Ruling will not apply where the loan is not used solely for the deriving of rental income, or where the loan is part of or connected with one or more other financial arrangements between the lender and the borrower. This Ruling will also not apply if the taxpayer has adopted the IFRS financial reporting method in section EW 15D. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the arrangement as follows: • No base price adjustment will be required. • Taxpayers who are not cash basis persons, and cash basis persons who have chosen to adopt a spreading method, will be required to apply Determination G25 in relation to the variation to the terms of the loan. The amount of the break fee will be included in the calculation under the determination. This means an adjustment will be made in the year of variation and the deduction of the break fee will effectively be spread over the term of the loan. • Cash basis persons will be able to deduct the amount of the break fee when it is incurred under the general permission, provided the money was borrowed to purchase a property from which rental income is derived. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This ruling will apply from the first day of the 2008/09 income year to the last day of the 2011/12 income year. 3 This ruling is signed by me on the 16 th day of December 2009. Martin Smith Chief Tax Counsel 4 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULINGS – BR PUB 09/09 AND BR PUB 09/10 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 09/09 and Public Ruling BR Pub 09/10 (“the Rulings”). All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. Background The Rulings deal with the deductibility of fees charged by banks to permit landlords to repay a fixed interest rate loan early or to vary the existing terms of such a loan. These fees are variously referred to by terms such as “early repayment fees”, “early repayment adjustment charge”, “early exit fees” or “mortgage break fees”. In these Rulings, the term “break fee” is used to refer to all such charges. The amount of the fee and the circumstances that trigger the charging of the fee vary from lender to lender. The fee is generally seen as compensation for the loss the lender may have suffered if their current interest rate for a similar loan for a fixed interest rate period closest to the borrower’s unexpired fixed interest period is lower than the fixed interest rate applying to the borrower’s loan. A break fee is charged in two primary scenarios: • the loan is repaid early (whether replaced by further borrowing from the same or another financial institution or not); and • the interest rate of the loan is simply renegotiated during the term of the loan and the existing loan continues. Legislation Note that the Income Tax Act 2007 was amended by the Taxation (Business Tax Measures) Act 2009 with effect from the 2009/10 income year. The amendments allow non-individuals to return income tax for financial arrangements on a cash accounting basis. Where necessary, the following legislation includes the relevant provisions for the 2008/09 income year and the 2009/10 and later income years. Section DA 1(1) and (2) reads as follows: DA 1 General permission Nexus with income (1) A person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss, including an amount of depreciation loss, to the extent to which the expenditure or loss is— (a) incurred by them in deriving— (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income; or (b) incurred by them in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving— (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income. 5 General permission (2) Subsection (1) is called the general permission. Section DA 2(1) and (2) reads as follows: DA 2 General limitations Capital limitation (1) A person is denied a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a capital nature. This rule is called the capital limitation. Private limitation (2) A person is denied a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a private or domestic nature. This rule is called the private limitation. Section DB 6(1) and (4) reads as follows: DB 6 Interest: Not capital expenditure Deduction (1) A person is allowed a deduction for interest incurred. ... Link with subpart DA (4) This section overrides the capital limitation. The general permission must still be satisfied and the other general limitations still apply. Section DB 7(1), (2) and (8) reads as follows: DB 7 Interest: Most companies need no nexus with income Deduction (1) A company is allowed a deduction for interest incurred. Exclusion: Qualifying company (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to a qualifying company. ... Link with subpart DA (8) This section supplements the general permission and overrides the capital limitation, the exempt income limitation, and the withholding tax limitation. The other general limitations still apply. Section DB 11 reads as follows: DB 11 Negative base price adjustment Deduction (1) A person who has a negative base price adjustment under section EW 31(4) (Base price adjustment formula) is allowed a deduction for the expenditure to the extent to which it arises from assessable income, under section CC 3 (Financial arrangements), derived by the person under the financial arrangement in earlier income years. Link with subpart DA (2) This section supplements the general permission and overrides all the general limitations. Section EW 3(2) and (3) reads as follows: EW 3 What is a financial arrangement? Money received for money provided (2) A financial arrangement is an arrangement under which a person receives money in consideration for that person, or another person, providing money to any person— (a) at a future time; or 6 (b) on the occurrence or non-occurrence of a future event, whether or not the event occurs because notice is given or not given. Examples of money received for money provided (3) Without limiting subsection (2), each of the following is a financial arrangement— (a) a debt, including a debt that arises by law: (b) a debt instrument: (c) the deferral of the payment of some or all of the consideration for an absolute assignment of some or all of a person’s rights under another financial arrangement or under an excepted financial arrangement: (d) the deferral of the payment of some or all of the consideration for a legal defeasance releasing a person from some or all of their obligations under another financial arrangement or under an excepted financial arrangement. Section EW 29(3) reads as follows: EW 29 When calculation of base price adjustment required Maturity (3) A party to a financial arrangement must calculate a base price adjustment as at the date on which the arrangement matures. Section EW 31 reads as follows: EW 31 Base price adjustment formula Calculation of base price adjustment (1) A person calculates a base price adjustment using the formula in subsection (5). When formula applies (2) The person calculates the base price adjustment for the income year in which section EW 29 applies to them. Positive base price adjustment (3) A base price adjustment, if positive, is income, under section CC 3 (Financial arrangements), derived by the person in the income year for which the calculation is made. However, it is not income to the extent to which it arises from expenditure incurred by the person under the financial arrangement in earlier income years and for which a deduction was denied in those income years. Negative base price adjustment (4) A base price adjustment, if negative, is expenditure incurred by the person in the income year for which the calculation is made. The person is allowed a deduction for the expenditure under section DB 11 (Negative base price adjustment). Formula (5) The formula is— consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted Definition of items in formula (6) The items in the formula are defined in subsections (7) to (11). Consideration (7) Consideration is all consideration that has been paid, and all consideration that is or will be payable, to the person for or under the financial arrangement, ignoring non-contingent fees, minus all consideration that has been paid, and all consideration that is or will be payable, by the person for or under the financial arrangement. For the purposes of this subsection, the following are ignored: (a) non-contingent fees, if the relevant method is not the IFRS financial reporting method in section EW 15D: (b) non-integral fees, if the relevant method is the IFRS financial reporting method in section EW 15D. 7 Consideration in particular cases (8) If any of sections EW 32 to EW 48 applies, the consideration referred to in subsection (7) is adjusted under the relevant section. Income (9) Income is— (a) income derived by the person under the financial arrangement in earlier income years; and (b) dividends derived by the person from the release of the obligation to repay the amount lent; and (c) income derived under section CF 2(2) and (3) (Remission of specified suspensory loans). Expenditure (10) Expenditure is expenditure incurred by the person under the financial arrangement in earlier income years. Amount remitted (11) Amount remitted is an amount that is not included in the consideration paid or payable to the person because it has been remitted— (a) by the person; or (b) by law. For the 2008/09 income year, section EW 54 reads as follows: EW 54 Meaning of cash basis person Who is cash basis person (1) A cash basis person is— (a) a natural person who meets the criteria in section EW 56: (b) a trustee of a deceased’s estate, whether or not a natural person, in the circumstances described in section EW 60 . Natural persons excluded by Commissioner (2) A natural person may be excluded under section EW 59 from being a cash basis person for a class of financial arrangements. For the 2009/10 and later income years, section EW 54 reads as follows: EW 54 Meaning of cash basis person Who is cash basis person (1) A person is a cash basis person for an income year if— (a) 1 of the following applies in the person’s case for the income year: (i) section EW 57(1); or (ii) section EW 57(2); and (b) section EW 57(3) applies in the person's case for the income year. Persons excluded by Commissioner (2) A person may be excluded under section EW 59 from being a cash basis person for a class of financial arrangements. Section EW 55 reads as follows: EW 55 Effect of being cash basis person Use of spreading method (1) A cash basis person is not required to apply any of the spreading methods to any of their financial arrangements, but may choose to do so under section EW 61. Calculation of base price adjustment (2) The fact that a cash basis person does not use any of the spreading methods for the financial arrangement does not excuse them from the requirement to calculate a base price adjustment when any of section EW 29(1) to (12) applies to them. 8 For the 2008/09 income year, section EW 56 reads as follows: EW 56 Natural person Criteria for natural person as cash basis person (1) A natural person is a cash basis person for an income year if— (a) 1 of the following applies in the person’s case for the income year: (i) section EW 57(1); or (ii) section EW 57(2); and (b) section EW 57(3) applies in the person's case for the income year; and (c) the person is not a trustee.

Increase in specified sums (3) The Governor-General may make an Order in Council increasing a sum specified in any of sections EW 57(1) to (3). Section EW 56 was repealed with effect from the 2009/10 income year. For the 2009/10 and later income years, section EW 57(1)–(9) reads as follows: EW 57 Thresholds Income and expenditure threshold (1) For the purposes of section EW 54(1)(a)(i), this subsection applies if the absolute value of the person’s income and expenditure in the income year under all financial arrangements to which the person is a party is $100,000 or less. Absolute value threshold (2) For the purposes of section EW 54(1)(a)(ii), this subsection applies if, on every day in the income year, the absolute value of all financial arrangements to which the person is a party added together is $1,000,000 or less. The value of each arrangement is,— (a) for a fixed principal financial arrangement, its face value: (b) for a variable principal debt instrument, the amount owing by or to the person under the financial arrangement: (c) for a financial arrangement to which the old financial arrangements rules apply, the value determined under those rules. Deferral threshold (3) For the purposes of section EW 54(1)(b), this subsection applies if the result of applying the formula in subsection (4) to each financial arrangement to which the person is a party at the end of the income year and adding the outcomes together is $40,000 or less. Formula (4) The formula is— (accrual income – cash basis income) + (cash basis expenditure – accrual expenditure) Definition of items in formula (5) The items in the formula are defined in subsections (6) to (9). Accrual income (6) Accrual income is the amount that would have been income derived by the person under the financial arrangement if the person had been required to use a spreading method in the period starting on the date on which they became a party to the arrangement and ending on the last day of the income year for which the calculation is made. It is calculated using 1 of the following methods, as chosen by the person: (a) the yield to maturity method, whether or not the person may use it, or has chosen to use it, for their financial arrangement; or 9 (b) the straight-line method, whether or not the person may use it, or has chosen to use it, for their financial arrangement; or (c) an alternative method approved by the Commissioner. Cash basis income (7) Cash basis income is the amount that would have been income derived by the person under the financial arrangement if the person had been a cash basis person in the period starting on the date on which they became a party to the arrangement and ending on the last day of the income year for which the calculation is made. Cash basis expenditure (8) Cash basis expenditure is the amount that would have been expenditure incurred by the person under the financial arrangement if the person had been a cash basis person in the period starting on the date on which they became a party to the arrangement and ending on the last day of the income year for which the calculation is made. Accrual expenditure (9) Accrual expenditure is the amount that would have been expenditure incurred under the financial arrangement if the person had been required to use a spreading method in the period starting on the date on which they became a party to the arrangement and ending on the last day of the income year for which the calculation is made. It is calculated using 1 of the following methods, as chosen by the person: (a) the yield to maturity method, whether or not the person may use it, or has chosen to use it, for their financial arrangement; or (b) the straight-line method, whether or not the person may use it, or has chosen to use it, for their financial arrangement; or (c) an alternative method approved by the Commissioner. Increase in specified sums (10) The Governor-General may make an Order in Council increasing a sum specified in any of subsections (1) to (3). For the 2008/09 income year, sections EW 57(1), (2) and (3) referred to sections EW 56(1)(a)(i), EW 56(1)(a)(ii) and EW 56(1)(b) respectively. In section YA 1, the definitions of “interest”, “maturity”, “non-contingent fee”, and “non-integral fee” read as follows: YA 1 Definitions interest,— ... (c) in sections DB 6 (Interest: not capital expenditure), DB 7 (Interest: most companies need no nexus with income), and DB 8 (Interest: money borrowed to acquire shares in group companies),— (i) includes expenditure incurred under the financial arrangements rules or the old financial arrangements rules ... maturity,— (a) in the financial arrangements rules, means,— (i) for an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services or an option, the date on which the agreement or option ends: (ii) for any other financial arrangement, the date on which the last payment contingent on the financial arrangement is made: ... non-contingent fee means a fee that— (a) is for services provided for a person becoming a party to a financial arrangement; and (b) is payable whether or not the financial arrangement proceeds 10 non-integral fee means a fee or transaction cost that, for the purposes of financial reporting under IFRSs, is not an integral part of the effective interest rate of a financial arrangement In Determination G25: Variations in the Terms of a Financial Arrangement, the definition of “Variable Rate Financial Arrangement” reads as follows: Variable Rate Financial Arrangement means a financial arrangement under which: (a) the interest rate is determined by a fixed relationship to economic, commodity, industrial or financial indices or prices, or banking or general commercial rates; or (b) the interest rate is set periodically by reference to market interest rates. Application of the legislation The application of the legislation depends on whether the loan is repaid in full and terminated or the loan remains in existence and there is simply a variation of the interest rate. Loan repaid in full A fixed interest rate loan is a financial arrangement pursuant to section EW 3. The financial arrangements rules (“FA rules”) will therefore apply. When a loan is repaid in full, a base price adjustment (“BPA”) is required under section EW 29. Although many landlords are likely to be cash basis persons under the FA rules and not required to use a spreading method, they are still subject to the FA rules and will be required to do a BPA if the loan is repaid in full. The formula for calculating a BPA is in section EW 31(5). The formula for a borrower is: consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted A break fee charged by a bank in respect of the early repayment of the loan will fall within the definition of “consideration” in section EW 31(7) as “consideration that has been paid ... by the person for or under the financial arrangement”. The break fee will not be ignored as a “non-contingent fee” because the fee is not “for services provided for the taxpayer becoming a party to the financial arrangement and payable whether or not the financial arrangement proceeds”. The fee is payable to allow the taxpayer to cease being a party to the financial arrangement. As the scope of these rulings excludes landlords who have adopted the International Financial Reporting Standard (“IFRS”) financial reporting method under section EW 15D, it is unnecessary to consider whether the break fee constitutes a non-integral fee. As part of the consideration paid by a borrower, the amount of the break fee will increase the overall negative figure that the BPA provides in this scenario (see Example 1 below). A negative BPA is expenditure incurred under the FA rules pursuant to section EW 31(4). In the case of taxpayers who have previously returned income under a financial arrangement (such as lenders), an automatic deduction is allowed for the negative BPA expenditure under section DB 11 to the extent of that previously returned income. However, as landlords are generally borrowers who will not have derived income from their loans, section DB 11 will have no application in those circumstances. 11 Negative BPA expenditure is also “interest” for the purposes of sections DB 6 and DB 7 (see the definition of “interest” in section YA 1). An individual taxpayer or qualifying company will be able to deduct the amount of the negative BPA as interest under section DB 6, provided the general permission in section DA 1 is satisfied and none of the general limitations (excluding the capital limitation) apply. Section DB 6 specifically provides that the capital limitation will not apply, so it is unnecessary to consider whether the amount is of a capital or revenue nature. Where the borrowed money was used to purchase property from which rental income is derived, the Commissioner’s view is that the general permission will be satisfied and the amount of the negative BPA will be deductible under section DB 6. Note that if the borrowing was used for a private or domestic purpose, a deduction would be denied under the private limitation in section DA 2(2). In the case of a company (other than a qualifying company), the amount of the negative BPA will be automatically deductible under section DB 7 without any requirement to consider the general permission. The Commissioner notes that some commentators have suggested section DB 5 may have application when the loan amount is refinanced. Section DB 5 provides a deduction for expenditure incurred in borrowing money used as capital in deriving income. The Commissioner’s view is that section DB 5 has no application where the FA rules apply. The amount of the break fee is dealt with under the BPA on repayment of the original loan, as set out above. This will be the case whether or not the amount of the loan is refinanced. Interest rate varied Instead of repaying a loan in full and then refinancing with a new loan, a borrower may negotiate with their lender to vary the rate of interest on an existing loan. This is sometimes referred to as an “interest rate switch”. A break fee will often be charged in these circumstances. Where the renegotiation of the interest rate is simply a variation of the loan and that same loan continues in existence, a BPA is not required. In these circumstances, the deductibility of the break fee depends on whether or not the taxpayer is a cash basis person. Note that if the change in the interest rate is effected by way of the existing loan being discharged and a new loan agreement being entered into, a BPA will be required as discussed above. A taxpayer who is not a cash basis person will have been required to adopt a spreading method in relation to the loan under the FA rules. As the loan is a fixed interest rate loan at the time of the variation, it will not be a variable rate financial arrangement (as defined in Determination G25: Variations in the terms of a financial arrangement). Therefore, the taxpayer will need to apply Determination G25 when the loan is varied, rather than Determination G26: Variable rate financial arrangements. The break fee will be brought into the Determination G25 calculation. This means an adjustment is made in the year of variation and the deduction of the break fee is effectively spread over the term of the loan (see Example 2 below). A cash basis person is not required to adopt a spreading method, although they may choose to do so. A person will be a cash basis person if: • the income and expenditure under all the person’s financial arrangements for the income year does not exceed $100,000, or 12 • the value of all the person’s financial arrangements on every day of the income year does not exceed $1 million. In addition, the difference between the accrual treatment and the cash treatment of all the person’s financial arrangements cannot exceed $40,000 for the income year. Where a significant break fee is paid, it is possible that these thresholds may be breached and a person may cease to be a cash basis person. In those circumstances the treatment of the break fee set out above for a non- cash basis person will apply. Note that as a result of the changes made by the Taxation (Business Tax Measures) Act 2009 (referred to in Legislation above) with effect from the 2009/10 income year a non-natural person may be a cash basis person. Where a cash basis person does not adopt a spreading method, the deductibility of the break fee is determined outside the FA rules. The break fee will be incurred whether it is actually paid or simply added to the balance of the loan: King v CIR (1973) 1 NZTC 61,107. The break fee will be deductible if it satisfies the general permission and none of the general limitations apply. Where the borrowed money was used to purchase property from which rental income is derived, the Commissioner’s view is that the general permission will be satisfied. Note that if the borrowing was used for a private or domestic purpose, a deduction would be denied under the private limitation in section DA 2(2). Note that section DB 5 will also have no application in these circumstances. Where all that occurs is a variation of the interest rate applicable to a loan, the break fee cannot be said to have been incurred in borrowing money. Examples Example 1 – Loan repaid in full At the beginning of year 1, B borrows $200,000 at a flat 10% per annum fixed interest rate to purchase a rental property from which rental income is derived. The loan is interest only. At the end of year 2, B breaks the loan in order to refinance at a lower interest rate with another bank. B repays the loan and pays an additional $10,000 break fee. B will have to calculate a BPA in relation to the loan as follows: consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted The consideration received by B is the original loan amount of $200,000. The consideration paid by B is the return of the principal, two instalments of interest at $20,000 each, and the break fee of $10,000, or $250,000: ($200,000 + $20,000 + $20,000 + $10,000). There is no income amount or amount remitted. The expenditure amount is the $20,000 interest incurred under the loan in year 1. The BPA is thus: ($200,000 – $250,000) – $0 + $20,000 + $0 = –$50,000 + $20,000 13 = –$30,000 The negative BPA amount of $30,000 represents the $20,000 interest expense for year 2 and the amount of the break fee. The negative BPA amount is expenditure incurred under the FA rules and is deemed to be interest. It will be deductible to B in the year in which it is incurred under section DB 7 (if B is a company) or section DB 6 and the general permission (if B is a non-corporate or qualifying company). Example 2 – Interest rate varied A and B are the shareholders in S Ltd. S Ltd owns two residential rental properties. S Ltd borrows $100,000 for three years. Interest is fixed at 10% payable annually in arrears. S Ltd is not a cash basis person. Assuming a straight-line spreading method, the total annual expenditure incurred under the FA rules would be: ($100,000 + $30,000 – $100,000)/3 = $30,000/3 = $10,000 per annum In year 2 the loan is renegotiated to an 8% interest rate. A break fee of $2,500 is charged. The revised annual finance charges are: ($100,000 + $26,000 + $2,500 – $100,000)/3 = $28,500/3 = $9,500 pa Determination G25 will apply. The formula is: a – b – c + d where a is the sum of all amounts that would have been income derived by the person in respect of the financial arrangement from the date it was acquired or issued to the end of the income year, if the changes had been known as at the date the financial arrangement was acquired or issued; b is the sum of all amounts that would have been expenditure incurred by the person in respect of the financial arrangement from the date it was acquired or issued to the end of the income year, if the changes had been known as at the date the financial arrangement was acquired or issued; c is the sum of all amounts treated as income derived of the person in respect of the financial arrangement since it was acquired or issued to the end of the previous income year; and d is the sum of all amounts treated as expenditure incurred of the person in respect of the financial arrangement since it was acquired or issued to the end of the previous income year. Applying the Determination G25 formula, the adjustment in year 2 is: $0 – $19,000 – $0 + $10,000 = –$9,000 This gives total expenditure for years 1 and 2 of $19,000 ($10,000 + $9,000), the equivalent position by the end of year 2 had the revised annual expenditure of $9,500 been claimed from the outset of the financial arrangement. This means the deduction for the break fee is effectively spread over the term of the loan. 14
Note (not part of the Rulings): These five public rulings, BR Pub 10/01 to BR Pub 10/05, deal with the ability of a New Zealand resident partner of an Australian limited partnership to claim foreign tax credits in respect of two forms of Australian tax, including Australian company tax, paid on income earned by an Australian limited partnership. It does not consider any other situations involving foreign income and foreign tax paid. The particular focus is on Australian limited partnerships that are corporate limited partnerships for Australian tax purposes and are treated under Australian tax law as companies while in New Zealand they retain partnership and flow through tax treatment. A foreign tax credit will be available to the New Zealand partners when the tax paid is equivalent to New Zealand income tax or non-resident withholding tax and it is paid in respect of foreign income that is assessable in New Zealand. The differing ways in which the income can be earned, and tax can be paid, by an Australian limited partnership means it is appropriate to issue five rulings covering various situations. However, a single commentary applies to all five rulings. The Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and Income Tax Rates Act 1986 are all Australian legislation.

Susan Price Director, Public Rulings 8 TAX PAID BY AN AUSTRALIAN LIMITED PARTNERSHIP AS A “HEAD COMPANY” AND FOREIGN TAX CREDITS PUBLIC RULING – BR Pub 10/05 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This ruling applies in respect of sections HG 2 and LJ 1. Definitions For the purpose of this ruling: • Limited partnership means a partnership that does not meet the definition of company under section YA 1 and under Division 5A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Aust) is defined as a corporate limited partnership and treated as a company for Australian income tax purposes. • New Zealand partner means a partner that is resident under either section YD 1 (residence of natural persons) or section YD 2 (residence of companies) and is not treated as non-resident under a double tax agreement. • Australian income tax means tax paid to the Australian Government that meets the definition of income tax in section YA 2(5). • Australian company tax means tax levied under section 23(2) of the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 (Aust). • Partnership share is defined in section YA 1 as meaning for a particular right, obligation, or other property, status or thing, the share that a partner has in respect of it. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is as follows: • An Australian limited partnership is a head company under section 703- 15(2) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Aust). 9 • The limited partnership pays income tax, in the form of Australian company tax, in Australia on all the taxable income of the consolidated group. • The taxable income of the consolidated group in Australia includes income, such as business income earned by Australian subsidiary companies, which does not form part of the New Zealand partners’ partnership share of the partnership income under sections HG 2 and CB 35. For the avoidance of doubt the Arrangement does not include arrangements where subpart BG of the Act applies to void the arrangement. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • New Zealand partners in the limited partnership are allowed a foreign tax credit under sections LJ 1 and HG 2 for the Australian income tax paid by the limited partnership to the extent that the Australian income tax is paid in relation to their partnership share of the income earned by the partnership under sections HG 2 and CB 35. • New Zealand partners in the limited partnership are not allowed a foreign tax credit under sections LJ 1 and HG 2 for the Australian income tax paid by the limited partnership to the extent that the Australian income tax is not paid in relation to their partnership share of the income earned by the partnership under sections HG 2 and CB 35. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This ruling will apply from the first day of the 2009/10 income year to the last day of the 2012/13 income year. This ruling is signed by me on the 25 th day of March 2010. Susan Price Director, Public Rulings 10 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULINGS BR 10/01 to BR 10/05 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in the five public rulings BR Pub 10/01 to BR 10/05. SUMMARY Foreign tax credits for Australian tax paid by Australian limited partnerships are available to New Zealand resident partners, in proportion to their partnership share, when all the following are met: • the Australian limited partnership is treated as a company for Australian income tax purposes but not for New Zealand tax purposes; • the Australian tax paid, by or on behalf of the Australian limited partnership, is the equivalent of income tax or non-resident withholding tax; • the income on which the tax was paid is assessable in New Zealand; and • the Australian tax paid was paid on the income that is assessable in New Zealand. BACKGROUND The question being considered is whether a foreign tax credit is available to New Zealand residents that earn Australian source income through a limited partnership registered in a state of Australia (that is an Australian limited partnership). The Australian limited partnerships that are under consideration are ones that are treated as corporate limited partnerships for Australian income tax purposes, under section 94D of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Aust), but do not meet the definition of “company” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Before looking at the relevant foreign tax credit legislation in New Zealand law, the underlying Australian law surrounding limited partnerships registered in Australia, as well as their tax treatment in Australia, needs to be considered. AUSTRALIAN PARTNERSHIPS Three forms of Australian partnerships exist: • (ordinary) partnerships 1 ; • limited partnerships; and • incorporated limited partnerships. 1 Referred to as “partnerships” in Australian state legislation. 11 (Ordinary) partnerships The regulation of partnerships in Australia falls under State law which includes the: • Partnership Act 1958 (Victoria); • Partnership Act 1892 (New South Wales); • Partnership Act 1891 (Queensland); • Partnership Act 1963 (Australian Capital Territory); • Partnership Act 1891 (South Australia); • Partnership Act 1891 (Tasmania); • Partnership Act 1997 (Northern Territory); and • The Partnership Act 1895 (Western Australia). These Acts provide that an ordinary partnership is one where the partners are jointly and severally liable for the legal actions and debts of the partnership, have management control, share the profits of the firm in predefined proportions, and have apparent authority as agents of the firm to bind all the other partners in contracts with third parties. An ordinary partnership is not a separate legal entity. Limited partnerships Limited partnerships in Australia can be formed and registered only under: • Part 3, sections 49 -79 Partnership Act 1958 (Victoria) • Part 3, sections 50A – 81A Partnership Act 1892 (New South Wales) • Chapter 3, sections 48 – 69 Partnership Act 1891 (Queensland) • Part 3, sections 47-84 - Partnership Act 1891 (South Australia) • Limited Partnership Act, 1908 (Tasmania) • Limited Partnership Act, 1909 (Western Australia). Neither the partnership laws of the Australian Capital Territory nor the Northern Territory have provision for limited partnerships although the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory have provision for incorporated limited partnerships, as do New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia mentioned below. The provisions, listed above, provide that a limited partnership is one where there are both general partners and limited partners. The general partners have the rights and obligations as in an ordinary partnership. The limited partners are not jointly and severally liable for the debts of the partnership and their exposure is limited to their partnership investments, and a corresponding share of the profits. They also cannot participate in the management of the company or act as agents for the partnership. Despite the limited liability of the limited partners the limited partnership, which is not also an incorporated limited partnership, does not have a separate legal identity. 12 Incorporated limited partnerships An incorporated limited partnership is a partnership which must have at least one general partner and one limited partner and the partnership is a separate legal entity with the powers and capacity of a natural person subject to the limitations in the partnership agreement. AUSTRALIAN TAX TREATMENT OF AUSTRALIAN LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS A “limited partnership” is defined in section 995-1 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Aust) 2 as: (a) an association of persons (other than a company) carrying on business as partners or in receipt of ordinary income or statutory income jointly, where the liability of at least one of those persons is limited; or (b) an association of persons (other than one referred to in paragraph (a)) with legal personality separate from those persons that was formed solely for the purpose of becoming a VCLP, an ESVCLP, an AFOF or a VCMP and to carry on activities that are carried on by a body of that kind. 3 Corporate limited partnerships Section 94D of Division 5A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Aust), Income of Certain Limited Partnerships, provides that a limited partnership is a corporate limited partnership if it is an association of persons (other than a company) carrying on business as partners or in receipt of ordinary or statutory income jointly where the liability of at least one of the associated persons is limited and: • the relevant year of income is 1995-96 year of income or a later year of income or • the partnership was formed on or after 19 August 1992 or • if the partnership was formed before 19 August 1992 either it does not pass the continuity of business test set out in Division 5A at s 94E or there has been a change in composition of the partnership after 19 August 1992 and no election has been made by the partners under section 94F that the partnership not be treated as a corporate limited partnership and • the limited partnership is not a foreign hybrid limited partnership in relation to the particular year of income, a VCLP, an ESVCLP, an AFOF or a venture capital management partnership. 2 The definition in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 is the same and referenced to that in the 1997 Act. 3 A foreign hybrid limited partnership is formed outside Australia as defined ss830-(1) and (2) of ITAA97. A VCLP is a venture capital limited partnership and defined in section 118-405(2) of the 1997 Act; an ESVCLP is an early stage venture capital partnership and defined in section 118-407(4) of the 1997 Act; an AFOF is an Australian venture capital fund of funds defined in section 118-410(3) of the 1997 Act and a venture capital management partnership is defined in section 118-405(2). In all cases these types of limited partnership must have been registered under Part 2 of the Venture Capital Act 2002. 13 These rulings apply only to limited partnerships that are also corporate limited partnerships under section 94D of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Aust) and do not have identities separate from their members. That is, they will not apply to limited partnerships which are also a foreign hybrid limited partnership, VCLPs, ESVCLPs, AFOFs or venture management partnerships. Nothing in Division 5A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Aust) overrides the state partnership laws by recharacterising limited partnerships as companies. Division 5A simply treats a limited partnership that also meets the test for a corporate limited partnership as a company for Australian income tax purposes only. In particular, subdivision C of Division A provides that a: • company includes a reference to a corporate limited partnership; section 94J • partnership does not include a reference to a corporate limited partnership; section 94K • dividend includes a reference to a distribution made by a corporate limited partnership; section 94L. This is discussed in the explanatory memorandum, to the Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No. 6) 1992, that accompanied the introduction of subdivision C Division 5A: Under the existing law, limited partnerships are treated as partnerships for taxation purposes. However, the structure of a limited partnership is comparable to that of a limited liability company in that there are "limited partners" who are similar to shareholders in a company; they do not take part in the management of the business, and their liability generally is limited to the extent of their investment. Limited partners are not at risk beyond the limit of their liability. Generally, their liability is limited to their investment. They are not required to make good losses of their partnership, nor are they liable to meet the obligations of the partnership. If limited partners are treated in the same way as partners in any other partnership, however, they may benefit from distributions of losses that exceed their limited liability. Those losses could be used to reduce taxable income, and so tax paid, even though the loss is not one that exposes the partner to any risk of having to meet obligations or make good losses. State legislation enabling the formation of limited partnerships currently exists in New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, Queensland and Tasmania. Explanation of proposed amendments The Bill will amend the Principal Act to introduce taxation arrangements in new Division 5A of Part III of the Act for taxing limited partnerships ... The object of this new Division is to ensure that limited partnerships will be treated as companies for taxation purposes. This is not confined to the payment of income tax by limited partnerships, but includes all other purposes under income tax law, including the payment of tax by partners in limited partnerships; for instance, imputation and the taxation of dividends to shareholders ... (Emphasis added) 14 Australian tax consolidated groups The concept that limited partnerships that are corporate limited partnerships are to be treated as companies for the purpose of the Australian income tax law was reinforced with the introduction of Australia’s consolidation rules. The explanatory memorandum, to the New Business Tax System (Consolidation) Act (No. 1) 2002 (Aust) , makes it clear that corporate limited partnerships can also be head companies within that regime because they are sufficiently equivalent to a company for Australian income tax purposes. 3.29 To qualify as a head company, an entity must be a company as defined in section 995-1 of the ITAA 1997. 3.30 A corporate limited partnership will also satisfy this requirement. This is consistent with the objective of ensuring consolidated groups generally receive a tax treatment like ordinary companies because these partnerships are effectively treated as companies for income tax purposes. The effect of becoming a head company in an Australian consolidated group is that all the income of the group is deemed to have been earned by the head company and not by the individual companies in the group: section 701 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Aust). AUSTRALIAN LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS UNDER NEW ZEALAND INCOME TAX LAW Legislation As these rulings focus on the ability of New Zealand partners to claim foreign tax credits for tax paid or deducted by an Australian limited partnership the key provisions in the Act are: • the definitions of “company”, “partnership”, and “limited partnership” in section YA 1; • section HG 2 which sets out that partnerships are transparent; • section CB 35 which sets out that income arising from subpart HG is assessable income to the partner; and • subpart LJ which sets out the rules for the allowance of credits for foreign tax paid. These provisions are discussed below. 15 Limited partnerships In terms of entity definitions in the Act, section YA 1 sets out the definition of a company: Company - (a) means a body corporate or other entity that has a legal existence separate from that of its members, whether it is incorporated or created in New Zealand or elsewhere: (ab) does not include a partnership: (ac) includes a listed limited partnership: (ad) includes a foreign corporate limited partnership: (b) includes a unit trust: ... A listed limited partnership and a foreign corporate limited partnership are also defined in section YA 1. In essence, they are defined respectively as a New Zealand or foreign limited partnership that is listed on a recognised exchange and a foreign limited partnership that is treated as a separate entity under the non- tax laws of the country concerned. Therefore, unless an Australian limited partnership is listed on a recognised exchange or the underlying state partnership laws give it a separate legal personality, it will not meet the definition of company in New Zealand. This is irrespective of whether or not it is treated as a corporate limited partnership for Australian income tax purposes. Therefore Australian limited partnerships, which are not treated as companies, will be treated as partnerships for New Zealand income tax purposes. This arises from the interface between section YA 1 and section 4 of the Limited Partnerships Act 2008. Section YA 1 defines: • “partnership” in paragraph (d) as meaning a limited partnership; and • “limited partnership” as including an overseas limited partnership as defined in section 4 of the Limited Partnerships Act 2008 but excluding a listed limited partnership or a foreign corporate partnership. Section 4 of the Limited Partnerships Act 2008 defines an overseas limited partnership as: a partnership formed or incorporated outside New Zealand with: (a) 1 or more general partners who are liable for all of the debts and liabilities of the partnership; and 16 (b) 1 or more limited partners who have only limited liability for the debts and liabilities of the partnership That is, an Australian limited partnership that meets the definition of an “overseas limited partnership” under section 4 of the Limited Partnerships Act 2008; is not listed on a recognised exchange; and is not treated as a separate entity in Australia will be treated as a partnership under New Zealand tax law. Partners in limited partnerships For partners in Australian limited partnerships that meet the definition of “partnership” in section YA 1 because they are not listed on a recognised exchange or have a separate legal personality, the tax treatment is set out in section HG 2(2): ... for a partner in their capacity of partner of a partnership, the amount of income, tax credit, rebate, gain, expenditure, or loss that they have from a particular source, or of a particular nature, is calculated by multiplying the total income, tax credit, rebate, gain, expenditure, or loss of the partners of the partnership from the particular source or of the particular nature by the partner’s partnership share in the partnership income. “Partnership share” is defined in section YA 1 as meaning: for a particular right, obligation, or other property, status or thing, the share that a partner has in respect of it. The effect of section HG 2(2) and the definition of “‘partnership share” is that for partners in a partnership, their assessable income includes their “partnership share” of the partnership income. Section CB 35 also confirms that this is assessable income of the partner: A person who is a partner has an amount of income to the extent to which an amount of income results from the application of subpart HG (Joint venturers, partners, and partnerships) to them and their partnership. Section HG 2(2) also makes reference to tax credits, which would include foreign tax credits, being in proportion to the partner’s partnership share. This then flows into sections LJ 1 to LJ 4 (Tax credits for foreign income tax). Foreign tax credits The key sections relating to foreign tax credits with respect to these rulings are sections LJ 1 to LJ 4. Sections LJ 1(1), LJ 1(2)(a), and LJ 2(1) state: LJ 1 What this subpart does When tax credits allowed (1) This subpart provides the rules for dividing assessable income from foreign sourced amounts into segments and allows a tax credit for foreign income tax paid in relation to a segment of that income. Limited application of rules (2) The rules in this subpart apply only when— 17 (a) a person resident in New Zealand derives assessable income that is not derived from New Zealand; and ... LJ 2 Tax credits for foreign income tax Amount of credit (1) A person described in section LJ 1(2)(a) has a tax credit for a tax year for an amount of foreign income tax paid on a segment of foreign- sourced income, determined as if the segment were the net income of the person for the tax year. The amount of the New Zealand tax payable is calculated under section LJ 5. (Emphasis added). Therefore the key terms, in determining whether a foreign tax credit is available, are “foreign income tax” and “segment of foreign-sourced income”. “Foreign income tax” is defined in section LJ 3 and reinforced by section YA 2(5) and “segment of foreign-sourced income” is defined in section LJ 4. Section LJ 3 states that “foreign income tax” is: an amount that, if paid, would satisfy a person’s obligations in a foreign country in relation to amounts that have the same nature as income tax. Section YA 2(5) states that “income tax” when used in relation to foreign tax: (a) means a tax of substantially the same nature as income tax imposed under section BB 1 (Imposition of income tax); and (b) includes a tax, imposed as a collection mechanism for the foreign tax, that is of substantially the same nature as ... non-resident withholding tax (NRWT). The Australian tax considered in these rulings is company tax and dividend withholding tax. In Australia, taxable income of a company is calculated under section 4-15 of Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Aust), the Australian core provisions, which is comparable to section BB 1 in New Zealand. Dividend withholding tax that is deducted under section 128B of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Aust), is deducted from the gross amount of dividend and is otherwise excluded from the non-resident’s assessable income. This is comparable to the deduction of non-resident withholding tax from dividends in New Zealand under subpart RF of the Act. A “segment of foreign-sourced income” is defined in section LJ 4 as: an amount of assessable income derived from 1 foreign country that comes from 1 source or is of 1 nature. 18 Therefore for a New Zealand resident partner of an Australian limited partnership to be allowed a foreign tax credit under sections LJ 1 and HG 2, three key elements must be satisfied once income has been allocated to the partner under section HG 2: 1. A person resident in New Zealand must derive assessable income from a foreign source. 2. Foreign income tax must be paid. 3. The foreign income tax paid must be in respect of that assessable income from a foreign source. It follows that a foreign tax credit is not available where a person has not actually paid foreign income tax; the foreign income tax has been paid but it is not in respect of income that is assessable in New Zealand; or there is no assessable income calculated under New Zealand tax law. The foreign income tax could be Australian company tax or dividend withholding tax as appropriate. Double Tax Agreement with Australia In the arrangements covered by the five rulings, the application of the treaty that came into force on 19 March 2010 or the previous treaty does not result in any relief that is different from the foreign tax credits granted under domestic law, as discussed above. EXAMPLES This section of the commentary discusses the specific factual scenarios related to each of the five public rulings. In all cases they involve Australian tax being paid at some level, but the issue is whether or not the Australian tax will be available to the New Zealand partners as a foreign tax credit. In all five examples the Australian limited partnership (“ALP”) has three partners: • one general partner (“GP”) based in Australia having a 1% partnership share; and • two New Zealand resident limited partners (“NZLP 1” and “NZLP 2”) with 50% and 49% partnership shares respectively (the 50% and 49% partners). In examples one, two and five, “NZLP 1” and “NZLP 2” are either a company or a natural person but are only a natural person in examples three and four. The Australian limited partnership is treated as a corporate limited partnership for Australian income tax law but is treated as a partnership for New Zealand income tax law. To avoid currency exchange issues, the reference to “$” is not a reference to any particular currency; it is used simply for illustrative purposes. 19 Example 1: Australian source income ALP earns trading income in Australia of $100 and pays Australian company tax of $30 on it. The trading income is partnership income to the partners, so they must include their partnership share in their taxable income. The Australian company tax is allowed as a foreign tax credit (“FTC”) in the same proportion as the partner’s partnership share. This is because the three key elements are met: 1. The partnership income is assessable to the partners under sections HG 2 and CB 35. 2. The Australian company tax was paid to the Australian Government by the ALP. 3. The Australian company tax was paid because the ALP earned trading income. In the specific example, the 50% partner – NZLP 1 - has assessable income of $50 and a foreign tax credit of $15 and the 49% partner – NZLP 2 - has assessable income of $49 and a foreign tax credit of $14.70. This is their respective partnership share of the trading income and the Australian company tax paid. 20 Example 2: Distribution made by Australian limited partnership The ALP makes an unfranked distribution to the partners of $100. For Australian income tax purposes, this distribution is treated as a dividend and Australian dividend withholding tax of 15% is deducted. The net amount distributed is then $85 in total. In this situation only the second of the three elements has been met. While the income tax – dividend withholding tax of 15% - has been paid to the Australian Government, it has not been paid in respect of New Zealand assessable income. This is because for New Zealand income tax purposes, the distribution from a partnership would have the nature of drawings and not be subject to New Zealand income tax. Therefore, no foreign tax credit is available to the New Zealand partners. 21 Example 3: Distribution made from subsidiary unit trust In example 3, the ALP owns a subsidiary unit trust and the New Zealand partners are natural persons. As seen previously, a unit trust is included in the definition of “company” for New Zealand income tax purposes. The unit trust distributes income of $100 to the ALP and the ALP pays company income tax on the income from the unit trust of $30. Under New Zealand income tax law the distribution from a unit trust is a dividend under section CD 1. In this case all three elements are met: 1. The dividend will be assessable income to the partners under sections CD 1 and HG 2. 2. The income tax on that dividend has been paid to the Australian Government. 3. The Australian company tax was paid because the ALP received that distribution/dividend. Therefore a foreign tax credit will be allowed in proportion to the partner’s partnership share of partnership income. This means that the 50% partner – NZLP 1- has dividend income of $50 and a foreign tax credit of $15 while the 49% partner – NZLP 2 - has dividend income of $49 and a foreign tax credit of $14.70. 22 Example 4: Franked dividend received by Australian limited partnership The ALP owns a subsidiary company that pays a $70 franked dividend to it and the New Zealand partners are natural persons. The underlying basis of the franking credit was company tax the subsidiary company had paid previously on its trading income. While the dividends received by the ALP are subject to tax in Australia, the attached franking credit means that the ALP does not pay tax on that income as the franking credit offsets any tax liability on the dividend. In this case only the first and the second of the three elements are met: 1. The dividend will be assessable income to the partners under sections CD 1 and HG 2(2). 2. Income tax was paid to the Australian Government by the subsidiary company on its trading profits. 3. However, this income tax was not paid because the ALP received a dividend and so the franking credit is not available as a foreign tax credit for the New Zealand partners, as is the general case with franking credits attached to Australian dividends. Therefore, no foreign tax credit is available to the New Zealand partners. In terms of New Zealand assessable income, however, there is dividend income of $35 and $34.30 to the 50% partner and 49% partner respectively. 23 Example 5: Tax paid by Australian limited partnership as “head company” of an Australian tax consolidated group The ALP as the head company for a consolidated group of companies (COY1, COY2 and COY3) pays tax on all the taxable income of the consolidated group in Australia. The taxable income of the consolidated group is $3,200 and the company tax paid is $960. This includes income from subsidiary companies that is not earned by the ALP of $3,000 which is calculated after allowing for the fees paid to the ALP. The New Zealand partners’ partnership share of the partnership income does not include any part of the income that is not earned by the ALP and includes only their partnership share of the $200 earned directly by the ALP. That is, $100 and $98 for the 50% partner and 49% partner respectively. In this case, the three elements are met and a foreign tax credit will be available to the partners of the ALP but only to the extent that the tax paid relates to income that is subject to tax in New Zealand. A foreign tax credit potentially will be available only for the Australian company tax paid on the income earned directly by the ALP; that is $60 being the company tax on $200. In this case the foreign tax credit of $30 will be allowed to the 50% partner – NZLP 1 - and $29.40 to the 49% partner – NZLP 2. 24
Note (not part of ruling): This ruling is a re-issue of public ruling BR Pub 05/14, which was first published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 17, No 10 (December 2005). BR Pub 05/14 applied until 31 December 2008. This ruling is essentially the same as BR Pub 05/14, but has been updated for the Income Tax Act 2007, which came into force on 1 April 2008. MEANING OF “ANYTHING OCCURRING ON LIQUIDATION” WHEN A COMPANY REQUESTS REMOVAL FROM THE REGISTER OF COMPANIES PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 10/06 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of paragraph (b)(i) of the definition of “liquidation” in section YA 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the liquidation of a company when a request is made under section 318(1)(d) of the Companies Act 1993 that the company be removed from the New Zealand register of companies. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows. The first step legally necessary to achieve liquidation when a request is made to the Registrar of Companies to remove a company from the New Zealand register of companies under section 318(1)(d) of the Companies Act 1993 is a resolution by the shareholders or board of directors or, where applicable, another overt decision-making act provided for in a company’s constitution to adopt a course of action that will end in removal from the register. That first step starts the period specified in paragraph (b)(i) of the definition of “liquidation” in section YA 1. Anything done after that first step to enable liquidation occurs “on liquidation” for the purposes of the Income Tax Act. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for a five year period beginning on 1 January 2009 and ending on 31 December 2014. This Ruling is signed by me on the 29th day of April 2010. Susan Price Director, Public Rulings COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 10/06 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 10/06 (“the Ruling”). All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. The purpose of this ruling is to clarify the first step legally necessary to achieve liquidation when a request is made to the Registrar of Companies to remove a company from the New Zealand register of companies under section 318(1)(d) of the Companies Act 1993. The conclusion is that the first step is a resolution or another overt decision-making act that is provided for in a company’s constitution to adopt a course of action that will end in the removal of the company from the register. Interpretative issue 1. The Ruling concerns the meaning of the phrase “anything occurring on liquidation” in paragraph (b) of the definition of “liquidation” in section YA 1 when a request for removal from the register of companies is made under section 318(1)(d) of the Companies Act 1993. 2. The term “liquidation” includes the removal of a company from the register of companies. The removal of a liquidated company from the register occurs under the Companies Act 1993 after the full liquidation process or after the shorter, alternative process provided by section 318(1)(d) of the Companies Act 1993. The alternative process is sometimes referred to as a “short-form liquidation”. 3. A short-form liquidation is cheaper and simpler than a full liquidation. A short-form liquidation involves a request for the company’s removal from the register by: • an authorised shareholder; or • the board of directors; or • any other person required or permitted to do so by the constitution of the company. Such a request can be made to the Registrar of Companies only after the company has paid its debts and distributed any surplus to its members: section 318(2) of the Companies Act 1993. 4. Paragraph (b) of the definition of “liquidation” in section YA 1 prescribes the period during which an action or event will be considered to be occurring “on liquidation”. This definition is important because specific tax consequences flow from acts that occur “on liquidation”. Paragraph (b) of the definition of “liquidation” provides that the period known as “on liquidation” starts with “a step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation”. 5. Paragraph (b)(i) includes two examples of steps that are legally necessary to achieve liquidation: • the appointment of a liquidator; or • a request for removal under section 318(1)(d) of the Companies Act 1993. 6. The second example of a step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation has given rise to uncertainty and is why the Commissioner has issued this Ruling. 2 7. The issue is whether a request for removal under section 318(1)(d) of the Companies Act 1993 is the first step legally necessary to achieve liquidation. If so, on a short-form liquidation the period known as “on liquidation” will not begin until the request for removal from the register has been made under section 318(1)(d). Under the Companies Act 1993, that request cannot be made until any surplus has been distributed. 8. Such an interpretation would mean that companies that follow the short- form liquidation process may be unable to make tax-free distributions “on liquidation” under section CD 26(2). If a request for removal is the start of the “on liquidation” period then all surplus assets must have been distributed before the request is made. Therefore, the purpose of this Ruling is to determine the correct interpretation of the phrase “anything occurring on liquidation” in the context of a short-form liquidation. In particular, the Ruling considers the meaning of the words “on liquidation”. Conclusion 9. In the Commissioner’s view, the phrase “anything occurring on liquidation”, in particular the words “on liquidation”, refer to a period. That period starts with the occurrence of the first step legally necessary to achieve liquidation. The Commissioner considers that when a removal request is made under section 318(1)(d) of the Companies Act 1993, the first step legally necessary to achieve liquidation will ordinarily be the passing of the resolution to cease business, pay all creditors, distribute surplus assets, and to then request removal from the register. That step starts the period specified in paragraph (b)(i) of the definition of “liquidation” in section YA 1. Anything done after that step to enable liquidation occurs “on liquidation” for the purposes of the Income Tax Act. 10. Therefore, on a short-form liquidation any capital distributions a company makes after the passing of a resolution to enable liquidation will be made “on the liquidation of the company” and may be excluded from being dividends under section CD 26. Legislation 11. Section YA 1 provides: YA 1 Definitions In this Act, unless the context requires otherwise,— ... liquidation, for a company,— (a) includes— (i) removal of the company from the register of companies under the Companies Act 1993; and (ii) termination of the company's existence under any other procedure of New Zealand or foreign law; and (b) includes, in references in this Act to anything occurring on liquidation, anything occurring— (i) during the period that starts with a step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation, including the appointment of a liquidator or a request of the kind referred to in section 318(1)(d) of the Companies Act 1993; and (ii) for the purpose of enabling liquidation 3 12. A request to remove a company from the New Zealand register of companies can be made under section 318 of the Companies Act 1993. Section 318(1)(d) provides: (1) Subject to this section, the Registrar must remove a company from the New Zealand register if— ... (d) there is sent or delivered to the Registrar a request in the prescribed form made by— (i) A shareholder authorised to make the request by a special resolution of shareholders entitled to vote and voting on the question; or (ii) The board of directors or any other person, if the constitution of the company so requires or permits— that the company be removed from the New Zealand register on either of the grounds specified in subsection (2) of this section; ... 13. Section 318(2) of the Companies Act 1993 sets out the grounds for making such a request: (2) A request that a company be removed from the New Zealand register under subsection (1)(d) of this section may be made on the grounds— (a) that the company has ceased to carry on business, has discharged in full its liabilities to all its known creditors, and has distributed its surplus assets in accordance with its constitution and this Act; or (b) that the company has no surplus assets after paying its debts in full or in part, and no creditor has applied to the Court under section 241 of this Act for an order putting the company into liquidation. Application of the legislation 14. A request to remove a company from the register of companies under section 318(1)(d) of the Companies Act 1993 can be made by: • a shareholder authorised by shareholders’ special resolution; or • the board of directors; or • any other person required or permitted by the constitution to do so. 15. It is clear from section 318(2)(a) and (b) of the Companies Act 1993 that at the time a request for removal is made under section 318(1)(d) of the Companies Act 1993 any surplus assets must have already been distributed. 16. The function of paragraph (b) of the definition of “liquidation” in the Income Tax Act is to set out the period when anything may occur on liquidation. Subparagraph (i) of paragraph (b) defines the period. The beginning of the period is most important and starts with “a step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation”. This puts the focus on the first steps. Subparagraph (ii) limits the “anything occurring on liquidation” to things occurring within that period that are for the purpose of enabling liquidation. Things that occur for another purpose will not occur “on liquidation”. What is meant by “a step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation”? 17. The phrase “a step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation” distinguishes between: • steps that are legally necessary and any other steps; and • steps that are to achieve liquidation and steps that are taken for another purpose. 4 18. The ordinary meaning of the word “step” implies an “action”. Therefore, the focus is on overt acts rather than, for example, the existence of circumstances or beliefs. 19. Some steps necessary to achieve liquidation in practice may not be legally necessary. For example, a step that is necessary in practice for a liquidation by special resolution of shareholders is to decide who the liquidator will be. That decision is not a legally required step even though it must have occurred. The closest legally necessary step would be appointing the liquidator or obtaining the liquidator’s written consent to appointment. 20. The words “to achieve liquidation” further narrow the range of steps that can start the period. Some steps legally necessary to achieve liquidation may be taken for a purpose other than to achieve liquidation. For example, paying all creditors is necessary before making a request under section 318(1)(d) of the Companies Act 1993. However, those payments may be made in the ordinary course of business rather than for the purpose of enabling liquidation. 21. Other steps undertaken may not reach the required threshold “to achieve liquidation”. For each liquidation procedure, the series of steps involved will largely be settled by the governing legislation, usually the Companies Act 1993. However, in relation to each procedure some preliminary steps will usually occur before any decision to liquidate is made and will end in that decision being made. The decision to liquidate is then followed by a further series of steps that achieve the liquidation and removal of the company from the register of companies. 22. The word “achieve” requires an end or goal to have been established and committed to. In paragraph (b) of the definition of “liquidation”, the words “to achieve liquidation” mean the steps must be taken with liquidation as the established end. Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, until the decision to liquidate is established and committed to, steps cannot be said to have been taken “to achieve liquidation”. 23. This emphasis on the established goal of liquidation means some steps that are preparatory to the removal of the company from the register (for example, the exercise by the liquidator of his or her functions) are capable of being the first step to achieve liquidation. However, a decision to liquidate must have been made. 24. While a decision to liquidate has to be made in practice, the step required by law in relation to a company’s decision is usually the passing of a resolution. The silent making of a decision is not an overt act, so is not a “step” as required by paragraph (b) of the definition of “liquidation”. The passing of a resolution is an overt act – a “step” – and will, in most cases in the Commissioner’s view, be the first step legally necessary to achieve liquidation. The passing of such a resolution will also satisfy paragraph (b)(ii) as being for the purpose of enabling liquidation. What is the first step legally necessary to achieve liquidation on a short- form liquidation? 25. One of the two grounds in section 318(2) of the Companies Act 1993 must be satisfied before a request for removal from the register of companies under section 318(1)(d) can be made. However, only the first ground applies where the company has surplus assets to distribute. Therefore, the first ground is the only ground considered in this Ruling. The first ground requires the company to have ceased business, paid its creditors, and distributed any surplus assets in accordance with its constitution and the Companies Act 1993. 5 26. Therefore, it follows that in those circumstances the first step that is legally necessary when a request is made to remove the company from the register should relate to ceasing business, paying all creditors, and distributing surplus assets. Section 318(2)(a) of the Companies Act 1993 does not specify the order in which these events must occur. 27. Accordingly, the Commissioner accepts that the first step legally necessary to achieve liquidation when a request is made to remove a company from the register of companies under section 318(1)(d) of the Companies Act 1993 is a resolution to: • cease business; • pay all creditors; • distribute surplus assets; and then • request removal from the register of companies. 28. Other steps may be taken that could also be the first step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation. For example, a company may act less formally than by passing a resolution to carry out the grounds in section 318(2) of the Companies Act 1993. If the step is overt and carried out with the aim of achieving removal from the register, it may still be the first step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation. However, a company taking a less formal course of action may be required to produce evidence establishing that the taking of the step was carried out with the aim of achieving liquidation. What is the significance of the examples in paragraph (b)(i) of the definition of “liquidation” in section YA 1? 29. After the phrase “a step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation”, paragraph (b)(i) of the definition of “liquidation” in section YA 1 sets out two examples: “including the appointment of a liquidator or a request of the kind referred to in section 318(1)(d) of the Companies Act 1993”. 30. The examples can be read as being the first steps of the relevant processes that Parliament put in the section as specific illustrations of first steps that start the period. However, in the Commissioner’ view, the wording of paragraph (b) is ambiguous. The steps could be examples of: • a step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation; or • the first step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation. 31. Possibly, the more obvious meaning is that the examples are of first steps – suggested by the immediate context and the emphasis in the section. The focus of paragraph (b)(i) is on determining “the period” and its commencement, which suggests the examples are of first steps rather than any steps of the processes to which they are relevant. However, this is not conclusive. Whether the examples should be taken to be the first steps or just any steps in the processes they are relevant to becomes clearer when the examples are examined. 32. The first example refers to the appointment of a liquidator. In the processes of liquidation, the appointment of a liquidator is not the first step legally necessary to achieve liquidation. For example, where the shareholders of a company resolve to appoint a liquidator, obviously the resolution is a legally necessary step that precedes the appointment. 33. Regarding the second example, when removal from the register is requested under section 318(1)(d) of the Companies Act 1993, the request is also not the first step legally necessary to achieve liquidation. In the Commissioner’s view passing a resolution to cease business, pay all 6 7 creditors, distribute surplus assets, and to then request removal will usually be the first step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation. 34. Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, the better interpretation of paragraph (b)(i) is that the steps given as examples are not the first steps legally necessary to achieve liquidation in the liquidation processes they relate to. Instead, they are examples of steps (in fact, fundamental steps) in those processes. The Commissioner considers that a step other than one of the two examples included in paragraph (b)(i) could be the first step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation. And, as noted above, the Commissioner considers that step will usually be the passing of a resolution to cease business, pay all creditors, distribute surplus assets, and then request removal. What is the tax treatment of capital distributions made on a short-form liquidation? 35. The importance of determining the first step legally necessary to achieve liquidation is highlighted when determining the tax treatment of capital distributions made on a short-form liquidation. Capital distributions may not be dividends for tax purposes when they are made “on the liquidation” of a company under section CD 26. 36. Under section CD 3, the term “dividends” includes a wide variety of payments, distributions, and transactions that essentially transfer value to shareholders. Section CD 26(1) and (2) exclude from being a dividend any amounts distributed to shareholders that are essentially subscribed capital (“available subscribed capital per share”) and capital gains (“available capital distribution amount”) where the amounts are distributed “on the liquidation of the company”. 37. Paragraph (b) of the definition of “liquidation” in section YA 1 provides that the period known as “on liquidation” starts with the first step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation. As discussed above, the Commissioner’s view is that the first step is not the making of the request. The first step will ordinarily be the passing of the resolution to cease business, pay all creditors, distribute surplus assets, and then request removal. 38. Therefore, any capital distributions made after the passing of such a resolution will be made “on the liquidation of the company” and may be excluded from being dividends under section CD 26. 39. In some cases there may be an extended period between the first step legally necessary to achieve liquidation and the removal of the company from the register. The period may even span different tax years, so that a distribution is made in a period preceding the removal of the company from the register. The Commissioner will assume that such distributions are made pursuant to a genuine intention to liquidate. However, if the liquidation is not completed then such a distribution will not have occurred “on liquidation”, and the exclusion under section CD 26 (and this Ruling) will not apply. 40. Taxpayers making distributions should ensure they keep adequate records of relevant resolutions or other decision-making acts. This is so they can demonstrate that the essential genuineness of the resolution or other act preceded the distribution of the company’s assets, and that the distributions were for the purpose of enabling liquidation.
Note (not part of Rulings): The issues dealt with by these Rulings were first covered in Public Ruling BR Pub 96/9A, published in Tax Information Bulletin Volume 8, Number 8 (November 1996). The arrangements became the subject of two separate rulings. The taxation of commissions issue was covered in BR Pub 00/01 and the fringe benefit issue in BR Pub 00/02. BR Pub 00/01 and BR Pub 00/02, published in Tax Information Bulletin Volume 12, Number 4 (April 2000), expired on 31 December 2004. COMMISSIONS RECEIVED BY LIFE AGENTS ON THEIR OWN POLICIES AND THOSE OF ASSOCIATED PERSONS – INCOME IMPLICATIONS PUBLIC RULING – BR Pub 10/07 This is a Public Ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CB 1 and CE 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the provision of a life insurance policy by a life insurer to a life agent or persons associated with the life agent. The life agent either: • receives commissions on those policies; or • sets off commissions on those policies against premiums payable on the life agent's own life policy or those of associated persons. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • Commissions received by a life agent on the life agent’s own life policy or policies of persons associated with the life agent are income under section CB 1 (if the life agent is an independent contractor) and section CE 1 (if the life agent is an employee). • When a life agent sets off commissions against premiums payable on these policies, the amount of commission set off is income under section CB 1 or CE 1. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for an indefinite period beginning on the first day of the 2008/09 income year. This Ruling is signed by me on the 29 th day of April 2010. Susan Price Director, Public Rulings 1 DISCOUNTED PREMIUMS ON LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES PROVIDED TO LIFE AGENTS AND ASSOCIATED PERSONS – FRINGE BENEFIT TAX IMPLICATIONS PUBLIC RULING – BR Pub 10/08 This is a Public Ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section CX 2. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the provision of a life insurance policy by a life insurer to a life agent or persons associated with the life agent in return for discounted premiums. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: • When a life agent or persons associated with the life agent receive discounted premiums on a life insurance policy from the life agent’s employer, the policy will be a fringe benefit under section CX 2 if it is provided in connection with the life agent’s employment. The life insurer will be liable for fringe benefit tax (FBT) on the taxable value of the benefit. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for an indefinite period beginning on the first day of the 2008/09 income year. This Ruling is signed by me on the 29 th day of April 2010. Susan Price Director, Public Rulings 2 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULINGS BR Pub 10/07 and BR Pub 10/08 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but provides assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Rulings BR Pub 10/07 and BR Pub 10/08. All references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. Summary These Rulings and commentary are about situations where life agents sell life insurance policies to themselves or persons associated with them. The issues that the Rulings and commentary are particularly concerned with are as follows:  Which arrangements are subject to income tax and which are subject to fringe benefit tax;  Whether commissions received by agents on their own life insurance policies are amounts received from trading with themselves and so are not income;  Whether income is received when the agent does not directly receive commissions and they are instead set off against premiums they are obliged to pay on their own life insurance policies;  Whether a life insurer will be liable for FBT when it provides a life insurance policy to a life agent at a discount. The Rulings conclude:  Commissions received by life agents on their own policies, or policies of persons associated with the life agent, are income.  When a life agent sets off a commission against premiums due on a life insurance policy purchased from their employer, the amount of commission is income.  Life agents, who agree that no commission entitlement will arise on their own policies or policies of associated persons, are not assessable on any notional commission; that is, the amount of commission that would have been received. When a life agent agrees that no commission entitlement will arise, no income comes in.  A life insurer will be liable for FBT when the life insurer provides a life insurance policy at a discount to a life agent or persons associated with the life agent and that policy is provided in connection with the life agent’s employment. The life insurer will be liable for FBT on the taxable value of the benefit. Background The subject matter covered in these Rulings was previously dealt with by BR Pub 96/9A published in Tax Information Bulletin Volume 8, Number 8 (November 1996), page 6. Public Ruling BR Pub 96/9A dealt with the income tax and fringe benefit consequences when life agents take out life policies on their own lives and those of their families. That Ruling expired on 31 December 1999. The arrangements covered by BR Pub 96/9A became the subject of two separate rulings. The taxation of commissions issue was covered in BR Pub 00/01 and the fringe benefit issue in BR Pub 00/02. A single commentary accompanied both Rulings. BR Pub 00/01 and BR Pub 00/02 expired on 31 December 2004. 3 The Commissioner is satisfied that the conclusions in BR Pub 00/01 are correct. BR Pub 00/02 and the commentary to the Rulings required minor adjustments to reflect the Commissioner’s view that for the purposes of FBT, “benefit” refers to the provision of a life insurance policy in connection with the employment relationship (and not the amount of the discounted premiums). Both Rulings have also been updated for the 2007 Act. Legislation Section CB 1 states: Amounts derived from business Income (1) An amount that a person derives from a business is income of the person. Exclusion (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to an amount that is of a capital nature. Section CE 1 states: Amounts derived in connection with employment The following amounts derived by a person in connection with their employment or service are income of the person: (a) salary or wages or an allowance, bonus, extra pay, or gratuity: (b) expenditure on account of an employee that is expenditure on account of the person: (c) the market value of board that the person receives in connection with their employment or service: (d) a benefit received under a share purchase agreement: (e) directors’ fees: (f) compensation for loss of employment or service: (g) any other benefit in money. Section CX 2 defines “fringe benefit” as: Meaning of fringe benefit Meaning (1) A fringe benefit is a benefit that— (a) is provided by an employer to an employee in connection with their employment; and (b) either— (i) arises in a way described in any of sections CX 6, CX 9, CX 10, or CX 12 to CX 16; or (ii) is an unclassified benefit; and (c) is not a benefit excluded from being a fringe benefit by any provision of this subpart. Arrangement to provide benefit 4 (2) A benefit that is provided to an employee through an arrangement made between their employer and another person for the benefit to be provided is treated as having been provided by the employer. Past, present, or future employment (3) It is not necessary to the existence of a fringe benefit that an employment relationship exists when the employee receives the benefit. Relationship with subpart RD (4) Sections RD 25 to RD 63 (which relate to fringe benefit tax) deal with the calculation of the taxable value of fringe benefits. Arrangements (5) A benefit may be treated as being provided by an employer to an employee under— (a) section GB 31 (FBT arrangements: general): (b) section GB 32 (Benefits provided to employee’s associates). Section GB 32 states: Benefits provided to employee’s associates When this section applies (1) This section applies when— (a) a benefit is provided to a person who is associated with an employee of an employer; and (b) the benefit would be a fringe benefit if provided to the employee; and (c) the benefit is provided either by the employer or by another person under an arrangement with the employer for providing the benefit; and (d) the exemption in subsection (2) does not apply. Exemption for shareholder-employees and corporate associates (2) Subsection (3) does not apply when— (a) the benefit is provided by an employer that is a company; and (b) the employee is a shareholder in the company; and (c) the person associated with the employee is a company; and (d) the benefit is not provided under an arrangement that has a purpose of providing the benefit either— (i) in place of employment income; or (ii) free from fringe benefit tax. Benefit treated as provided to employee (3) For the purposes of the FBT rules, the benefit is treated as provided by the employer to the employee. Application of section CX 18 (4) Section CX 18 (Benefits provided to associates of both employees and shareholders) applies to determine when a benefit provided to an associate of both an employee and a shareholder is treated as a fringe benefit and not a dividend. 5 The terms “employee”, “employer” and “employment” are defined for FBT purposes by reference to the PAYE system. The term “PAYE income payments” is defined in section RD 3 as: Meaning generally (1) The PAYE rules apply to a PAYE income payment which— (a) means— (i) a payment of salary or wages, see section RD 5; or (ii) extra pay, see section RD 7; or (iii) a schedular payment, see section RD 8: (b) does not include— (i) an amount attributed under section GB 29 (Attribution rule: calculation): (ii) an amount paid to a shareholder-employee in the circumstances set out in subsection (2) (iii) an amount paid or benefit provided, by a person (the claimant) who receives a personal service rehabilitation payment from which an amount of tax has been withheld at the rate specified in schedule 4, part I (Rates of tax for schedular payments) or under section RD 18 (Schedular payments without notification), to another person for providing a key aspect of social rehabilitation referred to in paragraph (c) of the definition of personal service rehabilitation payment in section YA 1 (Definitions). Section RD 27 states: RD 27 Determining fringe benefit values What sections RD 28 to RD 53 do (1) Sections RD 28 to RD 53 set out the rules for determining the value of a fringe benefit provided by an employer to an employee in connection with their employment. The taxable value of a fringe benefit when an employee pays an amount for receiving the benefit is dealt with in sections RD 54 to RD 57. When value cannot be ascertained (2) If, under sections RD 28, RD 29, and RD 33 to RD 41, the value of a fringe benefit cannot be ascertained, the value is the market value or otherwise as the Commissioner determines. Meaning of market value (3) In subsection (2), market value means the price, at the time at which the goods or services were provided to the employee, for which the goods or services would normally be sold in a sale— (a) in the open market in New Zealand; and (b) freely offered; and (c) made on ordinary trade terms; and (d) to a member of the public at arm’s length. When services are provided to an employee, and the services are provided as part of the employer’s business, the fringe benefit is valued in accordance with section RD 41: 6 Price, amount paid, or fee (1) The value of a fringe benefit that an employer provides to an employee in services is,— (a) when an employer normally provides the services as part of their business, the price charged by the employer— (i) at the time they provided the services; and (ii) for the same or similar services to the public in the open market in New Zealand; and (iii) on ordinary trade or professional terms between buyers and sellers independent of each other: (b) when an employer pays for the services to be provided, dealing at arm’s length with the supplier of the services, the amount paid or payable: (c) if neither paragraph (a) nor (b) applies, the price or fee that the employer or supplier providing the services would at that time have charged the public, had they provided the same or similar services to the public in the open market in New Zealand on ordinary trade or professional terms. Exclusions (2) This section does not apply to a service that consists of making available a motor vehicle for private use, providing an employment-related loan, or providing subsidised transport. Services provided to group of employees (3) For the purposes of this section, a person who provides services to an employee belonging to a group of employees is treated as providing the same or similar services to the public in the open market in New Zealand on ordinary trade or professional terms if the person provides the same or similar services to a group of persons that— (a) negotiates the transaction on an arm’s-length basis; and (b) is comparable in number to the group of employees. Some definitions (4) In this section,— amount, for a registered person who may claim input tax for that service, means the GST-inclusive amount fee and price, for a registered person who may claim input tax for that service, means the GST-inclusive fee or price. Section RD 54(1) provides: Value of benefit (1) The taxable value of a fringe benefit is the value of the benefit. Subsection (2) overrides this subsection. Reduction for payment by employee (2) If an employee pays an amount for receiving a fringe benefit, the value of the benefit is reduced by the amount paid. When associate pays amount (3) If section GB 32 (Benefits provided to employee’s associates) applies, the value of the benefit is reduced when a person associated with the employee pays an amount for the benefit. 7 Exclusions (4) This section does not apply to— (a) an employment-related loan: (b) a payment to acquire or improve an asset if receiving or using the asset does not constitute a fringe benefit. Section YA 1 defines “employer” and “employee” for the purposes of the FBT rules. “Employee”: (a) means a person who receives or is entitled to receive a PAYE income payment: (b) in sections CW 17 (Expenditure on account, and reimbursement, of employees) and CW 18 (Allowance for additional transport costs) includes a person to whom section RD 3(2) to (4) (PAYE income payments) applies: (c) in the FBT rules, and in the definition of shareholder employee (paragraph (b)), does not include a person if the only PAYE income payment received or receivable is— (i) a payment referred to in section RD 5(1)(b)(iii), (2), (6)(b) and (c) and (7) (Salary or wages): (ii) a schedular payment referred to in schedule 4, parts A and I (Rates of tax for schedular payments) for which the person is liable for income tax under section BB 1 (Imposition of income tax): (d) is defined in section DC 15 (Some definitions) for the purposes of sections DC 12 to DC 14 (which relate to share purchase schemes): (e) for an employer, means an employee of the employer. “Employer”: (a) means a person who pays or is liable to pay a PAYE income payment: (b) includes,— (i) for an unincorporated body of persons other than a partnership, the manager or other principal officer: (ii) for a partnership, each partner: (iii) for the estate of a deceased person, a trust, a company in liquidation, an assigned estate, or for any other property vested or controlled in a fiduciary capacity, each person in whom the property has become vested or to whom control of the property has passed: (iv) the Crown: (c) in the FBT rules, does not include a person if the only PAYE income payment that they pay or are liable to pay is— (i) a payment referred to in section RD 5(1)(b)(iii), (3), (6)(b) and (c), and (7) (Salary or wages): (ii) a schedular payment referred to in schedule 4, parts A and I (Rates of tax for schedular payments): (d) is defined in section RD 45(6) (Unclassified benefits) for the purposes of that section: (e) for an employee, means the employer of the employee. 8 Application of the legislation 1. Commissions received by life agents on their own policies or policies of associated persons Insurance agents may receive commissions when they sell life insurance policies. Usually an insurance agent’s entitlement to commissions is set out under a life agent’s terms of engagement or employment contract. “Income” is not a term of art and has to be examined in accordance with ordinary concepts and usages (Scott v C of T (1935) 35 SRNSW 215 at page 219). The courts have identified several criteria that are considered to be the hallmarks of receipts of an income nature. The High Court in Reid v CIR (1983) 6 NZTC 61,624 at page 61,629 described the criteria as follows:  income is something which comes in; and  income imports the notion of periodicity, re-occurrence and regularity; and  whether a particular receipt is income depends upon its quality in the hands of the recipient. An important feature of income is that it is something that comes in. This was emphasised in Lambe v IR Commrs (1933) 18 TC 212 where Finlay J said at page 217: Of course income may be of various sorts, ... but none the less the \[income\] tax is a tax on income. It is a tax on what in one form or another goes into a man’s pocket. That is the general principle. Commissions received by life agents on their own policies or the policies of associated persons come in, in the same way that commissions from the sale of policies to unrelated third parties come in. The major determinant in many cases is the periodic nature of the payment. Generally, commission income is periodic in nature. However, this in itself is not enough. It is necessary to consider the relationship between the life insurer and the life agent to determine the quality of the commission in the hands of the life agent. Alternative arguments One possible argument is that commissions received by life agents on their own policies are not income but are the proceeds from mutual transactions. Mutual transactions The general principle of income tax known as “mutuality” starts from the premise that a person cannot make a profit from trading with himself or herself, or with a body or association of persons of which the person is a member. In Sydney Water Board Employees’ Credit Union Ltd v FC of T (1973) ATC 4,129 Barwick J said (at page 4,131): The description “mutuality principle” is used, unfortunately as I think, to express the reason for the conclusion that the return to a taxpayer of a share of the surplus of a fund to which he has contributed in common with others after its use for a purpose agreed between them is not income ... What distinguishes the amount refunded in such circumstances from profit or income is that the payment is made out of moneys which are in substance the moneys of the contributors. \[Emphasis added\] 9 Prima facie the profits from mutual transactions are not income. There are numerous cases discussing the mutuality principle. Most discuss the situation where a person trades with a body or association of persons of which he or she is a member. There was some discussion of the principle that a person cannot trade with himself or herself in Dublin Corporation v M’Adam (1883-1890) 2 TC 387 at page 397. The court stated that: There must be, at least, two parties...If these two parties are identical, in my opinion there can be no trading. No man, in my opinion, can trade with himself; he cannot, in my opinion, make, in what is its true sense or meaning, taxable profit by dealing with himself; and in every case of this description it appears to be a question on the construction of the Act whether the two bodies – the body that supplies and the body or class that has to pay – were either identical, or, upon the true construction of the Act, must be admitted to have been held by the Legislature to be identical.... Does the mutuality principle apply? Although the life agent is the person who causes the commission to be paid by taking up the policy on that person’s life or the lives of the person’s family, the commission is not a return of the life agent’s own money. The commission comes from a source outside of the life agent, that is, from the funds of the life insurer. The life agent is paid the commission for introducing business to the life insurer, not for taking out the policy and paying the premiums. Case law indicates that the mutuality principle only applies when a person trades with himself or herself, that is, there is only one party to the transaction giving rise to the income. Here there are two parties to the transaction. The commission arises from the sale of a life insurance product by one party (the life insurer) to another party (the life agent). It does not matter that the life insurance product is sold by the life insurer through the life agent. There are still two parties to the transaction. Mutuality principle – conclusion The mutuality principle does not apply to commissions received by life agents on their own policies. Discount on premiums It may also be argued that commissions received by life agents on their own policies should be regarded as discounts from the premiums payable under the policy and not as income. For example, a life agent takes out a policy on his or her life. The premium is $1,000. The life agent receives a commission of $200. The $200 can be seen as a discount, that is, the “real” cost of the policy is $800. This was the view taken in “Commissions on Life Insurance Sold to Agent’s Family” in Tax Information Bulletin Volume Four, Number 10 (May 1993), which states: Commissions received by agents or employees of Life Insurance Offices who take out life insurance policies on their own lives or on the lives of their immediate family members should be regarded as reductions or discounts from the premiums payable under the policies, and not as assessable income. The Commissioner now considers that the treatment of commissions as reductions or discounts from the premiums payable under the policies is incorrect. This is because commissions received by life agents on their own policies or the policies of associated persons “come in” and are therefore income. The fact that a commission is set off against a life agent’s obligation to pay 10 premiums does not affect the derivation of the commission. Commissions received by life agents on their own policies are treated in the same way as commissions received from the sale of policies to unrelated third parties. The commission payment arises from an arrangement between the life agent and the life insurer. The life agent receives the commission for introducing business to the life insurer, not for taking out the policy and paying the premiums. Conclusion Commissions received by life agents on their own policies or those of associated persons are income under section CB 1 or CE 1. 2. Life agents’ commissions are set off Life agents may set off commissions received on their own policies or those of associated persons against the premiums payable on their own policies. Under section BD 3(4), an amount is deemed to have been derived by a person although it has not actually been paid to, or received by, the person, or already become due or receivable: Despite subsection (3), income that has not previously been derived by a person is treated as being derived when it is credited in their account or, in some other way, dealt with in their interest or on their behalf. Case law has established that income is derived under section BD 3(4) when the taxpayer does not receive a payment of that income, but receives some other monetary benefit. This has been found to occur when income that would otherwise have been paid to the taxpayer is diverted for uses that are of benefit to the taxpayer (Dunn v C of IR (1974) 1 NZTC 61,245). When life agents set off the commission, the amount of commission is income under section CB 1 or CE 1. The commission (which would otherwise have been paid to the agent) is diverted for uses that produce other financial benefits to the life agent, that is, payment of the premiums on their own policies. The practice of setting off commissions on policies may also occur in respect of policies sold to third parties. For example, a life agent sells a policy to an unrelated third party and becomes entitled to a commission. Instead of being paid the commission, the life agent sets the commission off against premiums payable on their own policies. Here, the commission, although not paid to the life agent, is derived by the life agent and is therefore income. 3. Charging of discounted life insurance premiums to life agents or associated persons It is common for life insurers to allow life agents to receive lower commissions in order to discount premiums to prospective clients. The Commissioner understands that if a life agent agrees that no commission entitlement will arise on the sale of a policy, there is a corresponding reduction in the premiums payable under that policy. The Commissioner also understands that when life agents agree that no commission entitlement will arise on their own policies or those of associated persons, the premiums payable under those policies are reduced. 11 Life agents who agree that no commission entitlement will arise on policies sold to third parties are not assessable on any notional commission; that is, the amount of commission that would have been received. As discussed, an important feature of income is that it is something that comes in. When a life agent agrees that no commission entitlement will arise, no income comes in. This must also be the case when life agents agree that no commission entitlement arises on their own policies or those of associated persons. Because the life agent receives no commission, no income arises. Alternative arguments An important feature of income is that it is something that comes in. When life agents agree that no commission entitlement will arise on their own policies no money comes in. They do not receive a commission. However, the issue of convertibility arises if a life agent either takes the commission, or agrees that no entitlement will arise and receives a discounted premium on a policy on the agent’s own life or that of an associated person. In particular, does the fact that the life agent can receive the commission in lieu of the discounted premium mean that the discounted premium is convertible into money, and therefore assessable? Case law The principle of convertibility was initially laid down in Tennant v Smith \[1892\] 3 TC 158. Tennant involved a bank employee who received a benefit in the form of rent-free accommodation. The issue was whether the accommodation was assessable under Schedule E of the United Kingdom legislation (by virtue of the words “salaries, fees, wages, perquisites or profits payable”). The court held that the taxpayer would only be taxable if what he received was convertible into money, that is, was money or money’s worth. Because the taxpayer could not sublet the accommodation or turn it to pecuniary account in any other way, he was not taxed. The principle of convertibility has been discussed and applied by the New Zealand courts on several occasions. See C of IR v Parson (No. 2) (1968) NZLR 574, Stagg v Inland Revenue Commissioner (1959) NZLR 1,252 and Dawson v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1978) 3 NZTC 61,252. The convertibility test is normally satisfied by demonstrating that the benefit may be sold or exchanged for money. In Stagg the value of holiday airfares given to an employee was held not to be assessable income of the employee. The employee could not sell the fares or require the company to give him the equivalent cash value. However, it is clear from the case law that there are other ways in which convertibility can be satisfied. See Abbott v Philbin \[1961\] 2 All ER 763 and Heaton (Inspector of Taxes) v Bell \[1969\] 2 All ER 70. The principle of convertibility was considered by the New Zealand Supreme Court in Dawson. The taxpayer subscribed for debenture stock under a debenture holders’ colour television plan. Under that plan a person could subscribe for debenture stock and would receive in return a television free of hire for five years. No interest was payable on the debentures. The Commissioner argued that the use of the television set was the substitution of one form of a benefit for another, that is, interest, and in taking the hire of the 12 set rather than the payment of interest, the taxpayer received a benefit that could be valued in terms of money. McMullin J said at page 61,258: In the view which I take of this matter, it is of some importance to note that \[the\] Objector did not apply for a television set as an alternative to an interest-bearing investment. It is true that it was open to him initially to choose to invest in interest-bearing stock as, I have no doubt, many other investors did, but he completed his application for a television set and a television set only. The court held that the benefit the taxpayer received was that he did not have to pay rental for the television. That benefit did not constitute income in the ordinary sense because the benefit received by the taxpayer was not in monetary form, nor was it capable of being sold, surrendered, assigned, or mortgaged for money or money’s worth. Arguably, Dawson provides some support for the view that the receipt of a discounted premium is convertible into money or money’s worth, the discounted premium being a substitution for the commission. It may be inferred from the court’s comments in Dawson that if the taxpayer had the option of investing and receiving either a television set or an interest-bearing investment, and in fact received a television set, the benefit would be convertible into money. However, it is considered the better view is that discounted premiums are not convertible into money or money’s worth. The fact that a life agent initially has the choice of receiving a commission, or not receiving a commission and enjoying a discounted premium, is not relevant. The issue of convertibility is considered at the time the taxpayer receives the benefit. If a life agent chooses to receive a commission, no question of convertibility arises because the commission is money. However, when a life agent chooses to receive a discounted premium, it is the discounted premium itself that must be convertible into money or money’s worth. At the time the discounted premium is received it cannot be converted into money because the life agent no longer has the option to receive any commission. Therefore, the convertibility principle does not apply. Conclusion When a life agent or persons associated with the life agent receive discounted policies, the amount of the discount is not income of the life agent. 4. FBT and discounted policies A life insurer who provides discounted premiums to life agents or persons associated with the life agent may be liable for FBT. For the purposes of FBT a life agent is an “employee”, regardless of whether the life agent is an employee or an independent contractor at common law. Employee versus independent contractor The terms “employee”, “employer” and “employment” are defined for FBT purposes by reference to the PAYE system. 13 Section YA 1 defines “employee” for the purposes of the FBT rules as meaning: ... a person who receives or is entitled to receive a PAYE income payment. There are certain exclusions in the definition of “employee” for the purposes of the FBT rules, but they are not applicable to the arrangements in these Rulings. Section RD 3 defines “PAYE income payment” as: (1) The PAYE rules apply to a PAYE income payment which— (a) means— (i) a payment of salary or wages, see section RD 5; or (ii) extra pay, see section RD 7; or (iii) a schedular payment, see section RD 8: (b) does not include— (i) an amount attributed under section GB 29 (Attribution rule: calculation): (ii) an amount paid to a shareholder-employee in the circumstances set out in subsection (2). Under section RD 8, all payments of the classes specified in Schedule 4 are schedular payments for the purposes of the PAYE rules. Included in Part G of Schedule 4 are commissions or other remuneration to insurance agents or sub- agents, or to salespeople. A life agent who is an employee at common law is an “employee” for the purposes of FBT because they receive a type of PAYE income payment, namely salary and wages. A life agent who is an independent contractor at common law is also an “employee” for the purposes of FBT because they receive a type of PAYE income payment, namely schedular payments. Discounts on family policies Under the arrangements covered by these Rulings, if an employer provides a benefit to an associated person of any of the employer’s employees (for example, a relative) and the benefit would have been a fringe benefit if provided to the employee, section GB 32 deems the benefit to be a benefit provided to the employee. From 1 April 2010, for the purposes of the arrangement, “associated person” is defined in section YB 1. An “associated person” includes two persons who are relatives as defined in section YB 4. A relative of a life agent is any person connected with the life agent: • by blood relationship if within the second degree of relationship (a child by adoption is treated as a natural child); or • by marriage, civil union or de facto relationship; or • by blood relationship to the spouse or partner of the life agent (if within the second degree of blood relationship to the spouse or partner). 14 For periods before 1 April 2010, the degree of blood relationship required to establish that a person is a relative of an employee is four degrees of blood relationship. Is there a fringe benefit? As discussed, when a life agent agrees that no commission entitlement will arise and receives a discounted premium, that discounted premium is not income of the life agent. A discounted premium that represents a reduction in charges other than commission is also not income. A discount is not regarded as income. Income is something that comes in, not something that is saved from going out (see Tennant per Lord Halsbury at page 165). The issue then is whether life insurance policies provided by life insurers to life agents or associated persons, where the premiums are discounted, constitute fringe benefits. Analysis Section CX 2 defines “fringe benefit” for the purposes of the FBT rules: Meaning (1) A fringe benefit is a benefit that— (a) is provided by an employer to an employee in connection with their employment; and (b) either— (i) arises in a way described in any of sections CX 6, CX 9, CX 10, or CX 12 to CX 16; or (ii) is an unclassified benefit; and (c) is not a benefit excluded from being a fringe benefit by any provision of this subpart. Arrangement to provide benefit (2) A benefit that is provided to an employee through an arrangement made between their employer and another person for the benefit to be provided is treated as having been provided by the employer. Past, present, or future employment (3) It is not necessary to the existence of a fringe benefit that an employment relationship exists when the employee receives the benefit. Relationship with subpart RD (4) Sections RD 25 to RD 63 (which relate to fringe benefit tax) deal with the calculation of the taxable value of fringe benefits. Arrangements (5) A benefit may be treated as being provided by an employer to an employee under— (a) section GB 31 (FBT arrangements: general): (b) section GB 32 (Benefits provided to employee’s associates). 15 It is clear from the opening words of CX 2(1) that in order for there to be a fringe benefit, there must be some benefit to the employee, provided by the employee’s employer. A fringe benefit is any benefit provided by the employer to the employee in connection with their employment, unless expressly excluded by subpart CX. That benefit is then valued under section RD 27, and its taxable value is calculated under section RD 54. The value of the benefit and its taxable value are discussed in more detail below. If a life agent or associated person purchases a life insurance policy from the life agent’s employer, there is a benefit provided to the life agent if the policy is provided in connection with the life agent’s employment. A life agent may have a discretion to reduce his or her commission in order to reduce premiums on policies sold to members of the public as well as to themselves or persons associated with them (for example, relatives). A life agent, or associated person, who enjoys a discounted premium on their own life insurance policy or family policies may receive a benefit, if that discount is provided by the life agent’s employer in connection with the life agent’s employment. However, if the same discount is available to members of the public, then the discount may not be provided in connection with the life agent’s employment and will not be a fringe benefit. Whether or not a benefit has been provided in connection with the life agent’s employment will depend on the facts of each case. The benefit in these situations is the receipt of services (the life insurance policy) from the employer by the employee in connection with their employment and is consequently a fringe benefit under section CX 2. This was discussed in a Question We’ve Been Asked entitled “The Meaning of ‘Benefit’ for FBT Purposes” in Tax Information Bulletin, Volume 18, Number 2 (March 2006). The amount of any discount and any consideration provided by the employee will be relevant to determining the taxable value of the benefit. Section CX 16 applies when an employer pays a specified insurance premium or makes a contribution to the insurance fund of a friendly society for the benefit of an employee. In the Arrangement covered by this Ruling, section CX 16 does not apply because the life insurer does not pay the life insurance premiums of the life agent or persons associated with the agent. Section CX 14 also does not apply to the Arrangement covered by the Ruling. Section CX 14 applies to “sickness, accident, or death benefit funds” as defined in section YA 1. Value of the benefit The Act provides methods for valuing a fringe benefit in section RD 27. Section RD 41 determines the value of services provided to an employee when they are provided as part of the employer’s business. In the Arrangement covered by these Rulings, the fringe benefit is the provision of a life insurance policy. The life insurer is in the business of selling such life insurance policies to members of the public. Therefore, section RD 41 applies to determine the value of the fringe benefit. Section RD 41 provides that the value of a benefit that is normally provided by an employer as part of its business, will be the price charged at the time they provide the same or similar services, on ordinary trade or professional terms between buyers and sellers independent of each other. It is a question of fact whether the price charged to the life agent or associated person for the policy is the same as is customarily charged to a member of the public in the open market 16 17 on ordinary trade terms between buyers and sellers independent of each other. Therefore, the extent to which the fringe benefit (the life insurance policy) is subject to FBT will depend on the extent to which any discounts provided to a life agent, or persons associated with the life agent, are greater than the discounts available to members of the public. The taxable value of the fringe benefit is calculated under section RD 54. Section RD 54 provides that the taxable value of a fringe benefit will be the value of the benefit reduced by any amount paid by the employee, or an associated person, for that benefit. There will be no taxable value if the amount paid for the policy is the same as, or exceeds, the price customarily paid by a member of the public in the open market on ordinary trade terms between buyers and sellers independent of each other. Expenditure on account of an employee The Ruling covers the situation when an employer (the life insurer) provides a benefit to the employee (the life agent) or person associated with the life agent (for example, a relative) by discounting the premiums payable by the life agent on the insurance policy. It does not seek to address the situation when the life insurer pays the life insurance premium of a life agent. When a life insurer pays a life agent’s insurance premiums, that expenditure will be expenditure on account of an employee if the employee is liable to pay the insurance premiums. Expenditure on account of an employee is employment income under section CE 1 and is assessable income to the employee, subject to the exclusions under section CE 5(3). When a life insurer pays a life agent’s insurance premiums, and the life insurer is liable for those premiums, that expenditure is a fringe benefit (unless expressly excluded from the definition of fringe benefit in section CX 2). Period of Rulings These Rulings commence on the first day of the 2008/09 income year. The previous Rulings expired on 31 December 2004. However, the Commissioner is of the view that the same principles and conclusions as set out in these Rulings would apply in respect of the period beginning on 1 January 2005 and ending on 31 March 2008.
1 LEGAL SERVICES PROVIDED TO NON-RESIDENTS RELATING TO TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING LAND IN NEW ZEALAND PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 10/09 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section 11A(1)(k). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the supply by a registered person of legal services to a non-resident (who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed) relating to: • transactions involving the sale or purchase of land in New Zealand or the lease, licence, or mortgage of land in New Zealand, or • easements, management agreements, construction agreements, trust deeds, guarantees and other agreements concerning land in New Zealand, or • disputes arising in relation to land in New Zealand. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: Under section 11A(1)(k) the supply of the following types of legal services to a non- resident who is not in New Zealand at the time the legal services are performed is zero- rated: • legal services relating to transactions involving the sale and purchase of land in New Zealand (including the drafting of agreements for the sale and purchase of land, the provision of legal advice in relation to the sale and purchase transaction and ancillary and related services leading up to the completion of the sale and purchase transaction); • legal services relating to transactions involving the lease, licence, or mortgage of land in New Zealand; • legal services relating to easements, management agreements, construction agreements, trust deeds, guarantees and other agreements relating to land in New Zealand; and • legal services relating to disputes arising in relation to land in New Zealand (including drafting court documents, court appearances, representation in negotiations and settlements and general advice in relation to such disputes). 2 The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 23 May 2010 and ending on 23 May 2015. This Ruling is signed by me on the 2 nd of September 2010. Susan Price Director, Public Rulings 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR PUB 10/09 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 10/09 (“the Ruling”). Background Under section 11A(1)(k), GST is chargeable at the rate of 0% on services supplied to a non-resident who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. However, section 11A(1)(k) does not apply to services that are supplied “directly in connection with” land situated in New Zealand: section 11A(1)(k)(i)(A). New Zealand legal firms may provide legal services to clients who are non-residents and who are outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. Such legal services could include: • legal services relating to transactions involving the sale and purchase of land in New Zealand (including the drafting of agreements for sale and purchase of land, the provision of general legal advice in relation to the sale and purchase transaction and ancillary or related services leading up to the completion of the sale and purchase transaction); • legal services relating to transactions involving the lease, licence, or mortgage of land in New Zealand; • legal services relating to easements, management agreements, construction agreements, trust deeds, guarantees and other agreements in relation to land in New Zealand (including the drafting of documents and the provision of legal advice in relation to such transactions); • legal services relating to disputes arising in relation to land in New Zealand (including drafting court documents, court appearances, representation in negotiations and settlements and the provision of general legal advice in relation to such disputes). This ruling concerns the meaning of the phrase “directly in connection with” in section 11A(1)(k)(i) and the degree of connection between legal services and land in New Zealand necessary before such services would be regarded as services that are supplied “directly in connection with” land in New Zealand. Legislation Section 11A(1)(k)(i) provides: A supply of services that is chargeable with tax under section 8 must be charged at the rate of 0% in the following situations: .... (k) Subject to subsection (2), the services are supplied to a person who is a non-resident and who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed, not being services which are— (i) Supplied directly in connection with— (A) Land situated in New Zealand or any improvement to the land; or (B) Moveable personal property, other than choses in action or goods to which paragraph (h) or (i) applies, situated in New Zealand at the time the services are performed;... 4 Subsections 11A(2) and (3) provide: (2) Subsection (1)(k) and (1)(l) do not apply to a supply of services under an agreement that is entered into, whether directly or indirectly, with a person (person A) who is a non-resident if - (a) the performance of the services is, or it is reasonably foreseeable at the time the agreement is entered into that the performance of the services will be, received in New Zealand by another person (person B), including - (i) an employee of person A; or (ii) if person A is a company, a director of the company; and (b) it is reasonably foreseeable, at the time the agreement is entered into, that person B will not receive the performance of the services in the course of making taxable or exempt supplies. (3) For the purpose of subsection (1)(k), (1)(l) and (1)(ma), and subsection (1)(n) as modified by subsection (4)(b), outside New Zealand, for a company or an unincorporated body that is not resident, includes a minor presence in New Zealand, or a presence that is not effectively connected with the supply. Application of the legislation Meaning of “directly in connection with” In Case E84 (1982) 5 NZTC 59,441, Judge Bathgate discussed the meaning of the phrase “in connection with” in the context of the Income Tax Act 1976 in the following terms: It is a matter of degree whether, on the interpretation of a particular statute, there is a sufficient relationship between subject and object to come within the words “in connection with” or not. It is clear that no hard and fast rule can be or should be applied to the interpretation of the words “in connection with”. Each case depends on its own facts and the particular statute under consideration. .... Its proper interpretation depends on the context in which the phrase is used. It may mean “substantial relation in a practical business sense”, or it may have \[a\] far more restricted meaning, depending on its context, ... (p 59,446) \[emphasis added\] Judge Bathgate considered that it is a question of fact and degree and impression whether there is a sufficient relationship between two things so as to be “in connection with” each other and that the evaluation of whether two things are “in connection with” each other requires a common sense assessment of the factual situation. However, in section 11A(1)(k)(i) the phrase “in connection with” is qualified by the word “directly”. The interpretation of the phrase “directly in connection with” in the GST context was considered in Auckland Regional Authority v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,080; Wilson & Horton Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,221 (HC); (1995) 17 NZTC 12,325 (CA); Case S88 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,551 (appealed as CIR v Suzuki New Zealand Ltd (2000) 19 NZTC 15,819 (HC); (2001) 20 NZTC 17,096 (CA)); Malololailai Interval Holidays New Zealand Ltd v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,137 and Case T54 (1998) 18 NZTC 8,410. These cases illustrate how the phrase is to be interpreted in the context of section 11A(1)(k)(i)(A). 5 The issue considered in the Auckland Regional Authority case was whether landing dues, terminal services charges and international garbage disposal charges levied by the ARA (the operator of Auckland International Airport) were paid for services that were supplied “directly in connection with” the service of international transportation. Barker J held that landing dues (which were paid for the use of runways, turnoffs, taxiways and holding bays) were supplied “directly in connection with” international transportation, since the service of international transportation could not be supplied without the provision of runways etc. However, he considered that the terminal services charge (which related to the use of terminals and equipment used for embarkation or disembarkation from international aircraft, maintenance and cleaning of luggage carousels, gate lounges, baggage makeup, distribution and storage areas) were “ancillary” (in the sense of being secondary or subservient) to the supply of international transportation. Barker J also considered that the garbage disposal service was a separate service from the supply of international transportation and that, although an essential service, it was ancillary to the service of transportation. The Auckland Regional Authority case is not directly on point as it addresses the issue of whether two services are supplied “directly in connection with” each other, rather than whether a service is supplied “directly in connection with” land or other goods in New Zealand. However, by analogy, the case suggests that a service would not necessarily be “in connection with” an item even if the service could not have been performed without the existence of the item. In Wilson & Horton, the issue was whether the supply of advertising space in a newspaper was “directly in connection with” the goods advertised. In the High Court, Hillyer J considered that the goods that were the subject of the advertising were “at least one step removed from the services supplied by the newspaper proprietor” and that, therefore, the advertising services were not supplied “directly in connection with” land or any moveable personal property situated in New Zealand (p. 11,224). Hillyer J saw a distinction between the painting of a vessel (which would be directly connected with the vessel) and services supplied to the passengers or crew of the vessel (which would not be directly connected with the vessel). On appeal, it was accepted by both parties that the High Court’s conclusion was correct. Therefore, this aspect of the High Court’s judgment was not addressed by the Court of Appeal. The legislation was amended to overturn the result in Wilson & Horton (based on the Court of Appeal’s interpretation of the phrase “for and to” which was previously contained in section 11(2)(e) (now section 11A(1)(k))). However, the phrase “directly in connection with” was retained in the provision. This suggests that the “one step removed” test applied by the High Court in Wilson & Horton reflects the intention of the legislation. In Case S88, Judge Barber considered the phrase “directly in connection with” in relation to an arrangement involving warranties in respect of imported vehicles. The non- resident manufacturer (MC), from whom the importer (SNZ) purchased vehicles, provided a service warranty to SNZ under which it agreed to reimburse SNZ for certain repairs. SNZ on-sold the vehicles to a dealer, who in turn sold the vehicles to the public. The warranty given by SNZ was wider than the warranty which SNZ received from MC. If SNZ was required to reimburse the dealer for the cost of repairs covered by SNZ’s warranty and if the particular repairs were also within MC’s warranty, SNZ would claim reimbursement from MC. The issue was whether the payment received from MC was for services supplied “directly in connection with ...moveable personal property” (the vehicles) in New Zealand. 6 Judge Barber considered that the service provided by SNZ was the repair of the vehicles (which was carried out by the dealer on behalf of SNZ) and that there was a direct relationship between the repair service and the vehicle. He noted that the repair service could not be performed but for the existence of the vehicle: In my view, the repair services effected by the dealer are directly in connection with the vehicles originally manufactured by MC but which, at the time of repair, are owned by the customer as purchaser from the dealer. The latter has, shortly before, purchased the vehicle from the objector. The moveable personal property in question is the repaired vehicle. There is a direct relationship or connection between the service of the repairs and the vehicle. Accordingly, the said “proviso” to s 11(2)(e) must apply to the facts of this case and prevent the objectors from relying on the zero-rating provisions of the s 11(2)(e). The repair service could not be performed but for the existence of the vehicle. The repairs were carried out for the objector (and others) which was carrying them out for MC (and others). The objector was not merely arranging for the repairs to be carried out, but was responsible under warranty to make the repairs—as was MC. That activity, or supply, meets the statutory nexus between goods and the service. The service is the actual repair of vehicles even though that work was performed by a contractor—usually the dealer. I agree ... that s 11(2)(e) requires the existence of a linkage between the non- resident for whom the services are supplied and the moveable personal property, situated in New Zealand, in relation to which the services are performed. However, there is no requirement in s 11(2)(e) or anywhere else, that at the time the services are performed, the moveable property must be owned by the non- resident person, or that the non-resident person must be entitled to use or possession of the property. (p 7,558) \[emphasis added\] The High Court upheld Judge Barber’s decision (Suzuki New Zealand v CIR). McGechan J considered that the repair services provided by the importer were analogous to the “painting the ship” example given in Wilson & Horton: I have no doubt that repair services were carried out directly in connection with moveable personal property situated in New Zealand at the time the services were performed. Quite simply, they were repairs carried out on cars within New Zealand. The situation equates \[to\] "painting the ship". The nexus could not be closer. ... The duality involved is not prohibitive. ... while there was one repair, it arose under and met two quite separate contracts with two different persons. So far as SMC is concerned, the repair was a service to SMC, quite irrespective of the other contract with an SNZ customer likewise discharged. I see no reason why a provision of services to SMC under one contract should be viewed differently because of provision of services to a customer under another. They are concurrent but different supplies. The facts that SMC is non-resident, and a non-owner, are of no present consequence given the way s 11(1)(e)(ii) is worded. (p 15,830)\[emphasis added\] The Court of Appeal agreed that the repair services were supplied “directly in connection with” moveable personal property in New Zealand. Blanchard J, giving the judgment of the Court, said: There is a nexus in both cases between the performance and the consideration given by the other party. In the present case there is a more than sufficient financial and legal connection, as demonstrated by the evidence, between SMC’s payments and the carrying out of the repairs on behalf of SNZ by 7 its dealers. The repairs may have been done for the customers, in practical terms, under SNZ’s standard warranty, but they were also done for SMC under its warranty. ... It follows from what we have said that we also reject the argument, made in relation to s 11(2)(e), that the services were not supplied directly in connection with movable personal property situated in New Zealand. The repair services were obviously supplied in relation to goods, namely motor vehicles, which were situated in New Zealand. The supply of repairs could hardly be more directly connected with the motor vehicles. The fact that they may have no longer been owned by SMC or SNZ is irrelevant. Section 11(2)(e) therefore has no application. (pp 17,102, 17,103) \[emphasis added\] In Malololailai Interval Holidays, a New Zealand company had supplied services relating to the marketing of timeshare interval holidays at a resort in Fiji to another New Zealand company. The issue was whether the marketing services were “supplied directly in connection with land, or any improvements thereto, situated outside New Zealand”. If so, the services would be zero-rated under section 11(2)(b) (now section 11A(1)(e)). (As the phrase “directly in connection with” has the same meaning throughout section 11A (Wilson & Horton Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,221, 11,224), the Malololailai case is relevant to the interpretation of the phrase in the context of section 11A(1)(k)(i).) In Malololailai Neazor J referred to Case E84 and said: A good deal of the debate in that case about whether a narrow or wide interpretation of the statutory phrase was appropriate might have been seen as unnecessary if the word “directly” had been used, as it is in s 11 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. (p. 13,144) These comments highlight the importance of the addition of the word “directly”. The use of the word “directly” narrows the scope of what might be considered to be “in connection with” the land and confirms that there must be a direct relationship between the relevant services and land. The Malololailai case also confirms that the recipient of a service need not acquire a legal interest in land before the service would be regarded as one that is “directly in connection with” the land. At page 13,143 Neazor J commented: It is not in my view necessary to consider the first point of Mr McLay’s argument further than that, because the issue is not whether the purchaser acquires land or an interest in land, but whether the services provided by the marketer on behalf of the objector are “directly in connection with land”, which may involve much less than acquiring an interest in the land. By way of example, the provision of gardening services would surely come within the statutory words. Neazor J considered that a transaction between the New Zealand vendor and the purchaser of an interval holiday would be “directly in connection with” land outside New Zealand, but that the marketing services supplied by the marketing company (although essential to bring together the vendor and purchaser and although closely related to the sale and purchase transaction) were not “directly in connection with” the land. The marketing services merely facilitated a transaction that was directly connected to the land (the transaction between vendor and purchaser). Neazor J considered that (as with the advertising services in Wilson & Horton ) the marketing services were one step removed from a transaction that directly related to the land: 8 I would regard the contractual transaction between \[the New Zealand selling company\] and the purchaser of an interval holiday as within the descriptive words “directly in connection with land or any improvement thereto”, although that determination is not essential to this decision, but when attention is paid to the services supplied by \[the marketing company\] to \[the NZ selling company\] consider that those services are not within the statutory description. What \[the marketing company\] does is to advertise and promote interval holidays for \[the NZ selling company\] and negotiate the contract for individual holidays (including the consideration for that contract between the purchaser and \[the NZ selling company\]) up to the point where the contract is effected between those two parties. The services provided by \[the marketing company\] are not directly in connection with the land or the improvements. The transaction of those considered which would be in that category is the transaction between \[the NZ selling company\] and the purchaser. The transaction between \[the marketing company\] and \[the NZ selling company\] is one which brings about the transaction which has direct effect, but in my view is of a kind to which Hillyer J’s words may properly be applied—it is one step removed from the direct transaction. If one of the analogies referred to needs to be chosen I would take that of the publication of advertisements in the Wilson & Horton case. The newspaper proprietor’s services facilitated or opened the way to the transactions between vendor and purchaser, and that in my view is what \[the marketing company\] did, although it was more closely involved in the transaction to which the statutory words apply than the publisher of an advertisement would be. Nevertheless the transaction having direct effect was not that of the publisher, or in this case of the sales agent. (p 13,146) \[emphasis added\] The Malololailai case was decided before the High Court and the Court of Appeal judgments in Suzuki. Although Malololailai was referred to in submissions to the High Court in the Suzuki case, it was not discussed in detail by the High Court and the case was not referred to by the Court of Appeal. The Commissioner considers that the approach in Malololailai is consistent with the approach taken in the Wilson & Horton case and is not inconsistent with the Suzuki decisions. These cases support a narrow interpretation of the phrase “directly in connection with”. Case T54 concerned the service of producing a video of Japanese honeymoon couples holidaying in New Zealand supplied by a Japanese company. Judge Barber considered that the services were not supplied “directly in connection with” the video camera or the blank tape used to create images (which were later edited to create the final video). Judge Barber considered that the video camera and blank tape were merely tools used to carry out the services and were not the object or objective of the services. He considered that the service provided was the creation of the final video. The judge concluded that the taxpayer had not provided services “directly in connection with” moveable personal property situated in New Zealand at the time services were performed. This was because the video did not come into existence until after the taxpayer’s services had been performed and at that time the video was outside New Zealand: The resultant video cassette did not come into existence until after the relevant services had been performed. It was not “situated inside New Zealand at the time the services are performed”. Until then it was only a blank tape. There is no other relevant moveable personal property to which the objector’s service could be regarded as supplied “directly in connection with”. Insofar as there is a connection between the said videoing services and the said blank tape (which fills up during the day) and camera and equipment, that connection is not a “direct” connection. That particular tape is only part of the 9 equipment involved in the process of creating another tape - the resultant videotape cassette. Tools and equipment are aids to the supply of such videoing services, and are not the objects of such services. Those services could be regarded as supplied directly in connection with the Japanese tourists who, of course, are not moveable personal property. (pp 8,414-8,415) Case T54 is distinguishable on its facts from the types of situations addressed in this item, because it is not possible to argue that land did not exist before legal services are provided (an argument that was accepted in Case T54). Test of whether services are “directly in connection with” land in New Zealand The following principles on the interpretation of the phrase “directly in connection with” can be drawn from the above cases: • Whether there is sufficient relationship between two things, so as to be “in connection with” each other, is a matter of fact and degree and impression and the evaluation of whether there is a sufficient relationship between two things requires a common sense assessment of the factual situation (Case E84). • The inclusion of the word “directly” in section 11A(1)(k)(i) indicates that a close connection would be required between a service and land for the service to be regarded as a service that is supplied “directly in connection with” the land (Malololailai). • Although there must be a direct relationship between the service and the property, for the service to be directly in connection with that property, the non-resident to whom the service is provided need not own or be entitled to the use or possession of the particular property (Suzuki). • The recipient of the service need not acquire a legal interest in land before the service would be regarded as a service that is “directly in connection with” the land. Services that are “directly in connection with” land include services that have a physical effect on the land, such as gardening or repairs to improvements to land (Malololailai). • Services that merely bring about or facilitate a transaction that has direct effect on land and which are one step removed from a transaction that has a direct effect on the land are not supplied “directly in connection with” the land (Wilson & Horton, Malololailai). • If the service could not have been performed but for the existence of the land, this may suggest that the service is supplied “directly in connection with” the land, but this factor is not conclusive (ARA; Suzuki). As a close relationship is required between the relevant services and land in New Zealand, the services must be supplied directly in connection with specific land in order to fall within section 11A(1)(k)(i)(A). Legal services Legal services that may be supplied to non-residents include: • Legal services relating to transactions involving the sale and purchase of land in New Zealand An analogy can be drawn between the marketing services considered in the Malololailai case and legal services in respect of the sale and purchase of land in New 10 Zealand. In Malololailai, it was held that the marketing services did not have a direct effect on the land and that they merely facilitated a transaction that had a direct effect on the land (that is, the sale and purchase between the vendor and purchaser). Legal services relating to the sale and purchase of land facilitate or give effect to a transaction between the vendor and purchaser which has a direct effect on the land but are one step removed from that transaction. Accordingly, legal services relating to the sale and purchase of land in New Zealand (including the drafting of an agreement for the sale and purchase of land in New Zealand, legal advice in relation to a sale and purchase transaction and ancillary or related services leading up to the completion of a sale and purchase transaction) are not services that are supplied “directly in connection with” the land that is the subject of the transaction. Therefore, such services are zero-rated under section 11A(1)(k). • Legal services relating to transactions involving the lease, licence or mortgage of land in New Zealand or legal services relating to easements, management agreements, construction agreements, trust deeds, guarantees and other agreements concerning land in New Zealand The same reasoning applies to legal services relating to transactions involving the lease, licence, or mortgage of land in New Zealand or legal services relating to easements, management agreements, construction agreements, trust deeds, guarantees and other agreements concerning land in New Zealand. These services are provided to a person who enters into a transaction that would have direct effect on the land. However, such legal services are at least one step removed from the land that is the subject matter of the transactions. These services merely assist in bringing about or facilitating a transaction that has direct effect on the land. Accordingly, legal services relating to transactions involving the lease, licence or mortgage of land in New Zealand or legal services relating to easements, management agreements, construction agreements, trust deeds, guarantees and other agreements concerning land in New Zealand (including the drafting of agreements relating to these transactions and the provision of legal advice in respect of such transactions) are not supplied “directly in connection with” the land that is the subject of these transactions. Such services are zero-rated under section 11A(1)(k). • Legal representation in disputes in relation to land in New Zealand Legal services involving representation in disputes relating to land in New Zealand (including drafting court documents, court appearances, representation in negotiations and settlements, and general advice) are also one step removed from the land to which the dispute relates. These services may be supplied as a consequence of a transaction that has direct effect on the land. However, consistent with the approach taken in Malololailai, the services are not supplied “directly in connection with” the land to which the dispute relates. Therefore, these services are also zero-rated under section 11A(1)(k). Subsections (2) and (3) The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies states that the non-resident recipient of the supply is outside of New Zealand at the time that the services are performed. Section 11A(2) and section 11A(3) are relevant when considering whether a person is outside New Zealand or whether the services are received in New Zealand. Section 11A(2) ensures that GST is charged on the supply of services that are consumed in New Zealand but are contracted for by a non-resident who is outside New Zealand. It provides that section 11A(1)(k) does not zero-rate services supplied to a non-resident if 11 another person (including an employee or company director of the non-resident) receives the performance of those services in New Zealand. Section 11A(3) defines the phrase “outside New Zealand” in relation to section 11A(1)(k). For the purpose of these provisions a non-resident company or unincorporated body that has a minor presence in New Zealand, or whose presence is not effectively connected with the supply of services, will remain “outside New Zealand”. What constitutes a minor presence will be very much determined by the facts of the particular case. “Minor” is a relative expression. What is minor is therefore a question of degree and should be regarded as relative to the size or volume of the supplies. A “minor presence” is a presence that is relatively small or unimportant or incidental to the services being supplied. In determining whether a presence is minor, it is necessary to consider the relative size or importance of the presence of the non-resident company when compared with the presence of the New Zealand supplier. This will involve a consideration of, inter alia, the relative numbers of people connected with the supply, the amount of time spent in connection with the supply by those people and the relative importance of the people to the services being supplied. The test of "effectively connected" is also a question of fact. The relationship of the supply with the presence in New Zealand must be more than remotely connected but can be more than one step removed from the presence. The phrase is therefore broader than the phrase “directly in connection with”. If the presence is attributable to the supply in question then it is very likely that the presence will be effectively connected with that supply. Discussion of these provisions and some relevant examples are set out in Taxation Information Bulletin volume 11, number 9 (October 1999), in the “New Legislation” section under the heading “GST – Treatment of Exported Services”. Example Steve, who is a US resident, comes to New Zealand with a view to purchasing land for investment purposes. He returns to the US and continues to carry on negotiations for the purchase of land from a distance. Tracey, a New Zealand solicitor, arranges for searches of the land in Land Information New Zealand’s records to be carried out and obtains a LIM report from the local authority. She provides advice in relation to tax issues relating to the purchase, advice on whether Overseas Investment Commission consent to the purchase is required and general legal advice in relation to the transaction. Tracey then drafts an agreement for sale and purchase which is signed by both parties. She also advises Steve regarding a mortgage to be secured over the land, drafts a transfer to be signed by the vendor and attends to settlement of the transaction. After settlement, Steve telephones a real estate agent and arranges for the property to be leased. Tracey drafts the lease and negotiates with the lessee’s solicitor regarding the form of the lease. The lease is signed and the lessee takes occupation of the property. During a brief visit to New Zealand, Steve discovers that the lessee is using the property for a purpose that is not authorised by the lease. Tracey drafts a notice to the lessee terminating the lease and arranges for the notice to be served. The lessee then applies to the court for an injunction preventing Steve from terminating the lease. Steve instructs Tracey to draft documents opposing the injunction. Tracey provides advice in relation to the management of the dispute and represents Steve in settlement negotiations with the lessee. Ultimately, the dispute is settled out of court. 12 The legal services provided by Tracey either facilitate transactions between Steve and the vendor, the mortgagee or the lessee which have a direct effect on the land (by creating or changing legal interests in respect of the land) or arise as a consequence of these transactions. However, Tracey’s legal services are one step removed from transactions which directly affect the land. The legal services are not supplied directly in connection with land in New Zealand. Therefore, provided Steve is outside New Zealand at all times when these services are performed, the services will be zero-rated under section 11A(1)(k).
1 LOCAL AUTHORITY RATES APPORTIONMENTS ON PROPERTY TRANSACTIONS WHERE THE RATES HAVE BEEN PAID BEYOND SETTLEMENT – GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPLICATIONS FOR VENDOR PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 10/10 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections 8 and 10 and the definition of “consideration” in section 2(1). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the sale and purchase of real estate between a GST- registered vendor and a GST-registered or unregistered purchaser. The vendor has prepaid local authority rates beyond the date of settlement of the transaction. The vendor is supplying the property in the course or furtherance of its taxable activity. Because the rates have been prepaid, the settlement statement apportions the rates between the vendor and the purchaser. On the settlement date the purchaser is required to pay its share of the rates paid by the vendor, in addition to the purchase price for the real estate. Section 14(1)(d) does not apply to the supply of the property. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • The payment by the purchaser for its apportioned share of the prepaid rates (covering the period from the time of settlement) will be part of the “consideration” (as defined in section 2(1)) for the supply of the property by the vendor. • Under section 8, GST is chargeable on the supply of the property by a registered vendor by reference to the value of the supply. The value of that supply under section 10(2) will include the purchase price and the amount of the prepaid rates apportionment paid by the purchaser to the vendor. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 23 September 2010 and ending on 23 September 2015. This Ruling is signed by me on the 23rd day of September 2010.

This Ruling applies in respect of sections 8 and 10 and the definition of “consideration” in section 2(1). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the sale and purchase of real estate between a GST- registered or unregistered vendor and a GST-registered purchaser. The vendor has prepaid local authority rates beyond the date of settlement of the transaction. The purchaser is acquiring the property for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Because the rates have been prepaid, the settlement statement apportions the rates between the vendor and the purchaser. On the settlement date the purchaser is required to pay its share of the rates paid by the vendor, in addition to the purchase price for the real estate. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • The payment by the purchaser for its apportioned share of the prepaid rates (covering the period from the time of settlement) will be part of the “consideration” (as defined in section 2(1)) for the supply of the property by the vendor. • If the purchaser is entitled to an input tax deduction for the supply of the property then the purchaser can claim an input tax deduction on the total amount of consideration for the supply.

Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections 8 and 10 and the definition of “consideration” in section 2(1). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the sale and purchase of real estate between a GST- registered vendor and a GST-registered or unregistered purchaser. The local authority rates for the property are in arrears on the settlement date and the parties have agreed that the purchaser will pay the outstanding amount. The vendor is supplying the property in the course or furtherance of its taxable activity. Because the rates are in arrears and the parties have agreed that the purchaser will pay the outstanding amount to the local authority, the settlement statement provides a credit to the purchaser for the vendor’s share of the outstanding amount. Section 14(1)(d) does not apply to the supply of the property. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • Where the vendor allows a credit against the purchase price for unpaid rates, the consideration (as defined in section 2(1)) for the vendor’s supply of the property to the purchaser is the amount received by the vendor from the purchaser (being the purchase price less the credit against the purchase price), together with the amount of the outstanding local authority rates that the purchaser has agreed to discharge. • Under section 8, GST is chargeable on the supply of the property by a registered vendor by reference to the value of the supply. The value of the supply under section 10(2) will include the amount received by the vendor from the purchaser as well as the amount of the outstanding local authority rates that the purchaser has agreed to discharge. 4 The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 23 September 2010 and ending on 23 September 2015.

Susan Price Director, Public Rulings 6 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULINGS BR Pub 10/10 to BR Pub 10/13 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Rulings BR Pub 10/10, BR Pub 10/11, BR Pub 10/12 and BR Pub 10/13 (“the Rulings”). All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. Summary 1. The Rulings address the question of how apportionments of local authority rates made in property transactions should be treated for GST. BR Pub 10/10 and BR Pub 10/11 apply to situations where the rates have been prepaid by the vendor beyond the settlement date. BR Pub 10/12 and BR Pub 10/13 apply to situations where the local authority rates for the property are in arrears on the settlement date and the parties have agreed that the purchaser will pay the outstanding rates, in exchange for a credit against the settlement amount for the vendor’s share of the outstanding rates. 2. This commentary explains the conclusions reached in the Rulings. After providing a brief introduction and setting out the relevant legislation, this commentary discusses: • Consideration for a supply: this part of the commentary discusses key principles regarding “consideration” – namely that “consideration” has a wide meaning and that a statutory obligation to a third party does not amount to “consideration”. • GST treatment of transactions where the rates are prepaid: this part of the commentary explains the GST treatment where the rates have been prepaid beyond settlement. It explains that the payment of the rates apportionment to the vendor by the purchaser forms part of the total consideration for the supply of the property. • GST treatment of transactions where the rates are in arrears: this part of the commentary explains the GST treatment where the rates are in arrears at settlement and the vendor allows a credit against the purchase price for unpaid rates. It explains that the consideration for the vendor’s supply of the property to the purchaser is the amount received by the vendor from the purchaser (being the purchase price less the credit against the purchase price), together with the amount of the outstanding local authority rates that the purchaser has agreed to discharge. 3. After the legal analysis, the commentary provides examples of a range of different property sale situations. The examples include discussion of how the Rulings apply to each situation as well as model settlement statements and tax invoices. Introduction 4. Section 5(7) requires local authorities to charge GST on rates. 7 5. Local authorities (that is, city and district councils and some regional councils) charge ratepayers rates in advance under the Local Government (Rating) Act 2002. On the sale and purchase of land, a vendor may pass on to a purchaser rates that relate to the period of the purchaser’s occupation of the land. Apportionment is usually provided for in the sale and purchase contract. 6. Confusion exists about whether the GST-inclusive or GST-exclusive rates amount should be apportioned and whether vendors should seek to recover a GST-inclusive rates amount from purchasers. The Rulings, and this commentary, seek to remove this confusion by explaining the effect of the rates apportionment on the amount of consideration the vendor receives. 7. Public Ruling BR Pub 99/8, “Local authority rates apportionments on property transactions – goods and services tax treatment”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 11, No 11 (December 1999), expired on 31 March 2003. BR Pub 99/8 applied to a sale and purchase of land where the parties to the transaction apportioned local authority rates between themselves. It did not differentiate in the ruling itself between situations where rates had been prepaid and situations where rates were in arrears, as occurs in these Rulings. Legislation Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 8. “Consideration” is defined in section 2(1) to mean: in relation to the supply of goods and services to any person, includes any payment made or any act or forbearance, whether or not voluntary, in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of, the supply of any goods and services, whether by that person or by any other person; but does not include any payment made by any person as an unconditional gift to any non-profit body. 9. “Dwelling” is defined in section 2(1) to mean: any building, premises, structure, or other place, or any part thereof, used predominantly as a place of residence or abode of any individual, together with any appurtenances belonging thereto and enjoyed with it; but does not include a commercial dwelling. 10. Section 5(7)(a) states: For the purposes of this Act— Every local authority is deemed to supply goods and services to any person where any amount of rates is payable by that person to that local authority. 11. Section 5(15) states: Where a dwelling is included in a supply, the supply of that dwelling is deemed to be a separate supply from the supply of any other real property included in the supply. 12. Section 8(1) states: 8 Subject to this Act, a tax, to be known as goods and services tax, shall be charged in accordance with the provisions of this Act at the rate of 12.5 percent 1 on the supply (but not including an exempt supply) in New Zealand of goods and services, on or after the 1st day of October 1986, by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person, by reference to the value of that supply. 13. Section 10(2) defines “value of supply” as follows: Subject to this section, the value of a supply of goods and services shall be such amount as, with the addition of the tax charged, is equal to the aggregate of,— (a) To the extent that the consideration for the supply is consideration in money, the amount of the money: (b) To the extent that the consideration for the supply is not consideration in money, the open market value of that consideration. How the legislation applies 14. This part of the commentary explains the reasoning behind the Rulings. It begins by outlining some general principles regarding “consideration”. Following this, it discusses in turn the two different situations to which the Rulings apply – where rates are prepaid and where rates are in arrears. Finally, this part of the commentary considers the effect of section 5(15) on the application of the Rulings. Consideration for a supply General principles 15. The legislation and case law have established some key principles regarding “consideration”. Three principles are that: • the statutory meaning of “consideration” is wider than the contract law meaning; • any consideration need not be voluntary; and • the supply need not be made by the person who receives the payment. 16. However, for a payment to be “consideration” there must be a sufficient relationship between the making of the payment and the supply of goods and services. Wide definition of “consideration” 17. “Consideration” is very widely defined in the Act. In section 2(1), the definition of “consideration”, in relation to the supply of goods and services to any person, includes any payment made whether by that person (the recipient of the supply) or by any other person. Therefore, consideration is not limited to payments made by the recipient of the supply. 1 This will change to 15 percent on 1 October 2010 with application to supplies made on or after 1 October 2010. 9 18. It is also not crucial that the payment be made to the supplier; it is sufficient that the payment (or any act of forbearance if that were relevant) be made in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of the supply. Accordingly, if A makes a supply of goods and services to B, and in response at the request of A, B pays an amount of money to C, then there is still an amount of consideration for the supply of goods and services. 19. Consideration may also be voluntary or involuntary. Statutory obligation to a third party does not amount to “consideration” 20. Where the recipient of a supply is required by law to undertake an obligation to a third party, then any discharge of that obligation by the recipient is not the provision of consideration for the supply: The Trustee, Executors and Agency Co NZ Ltd v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,076; Iona Farm Ltd v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC, 15,261. 21. In Trustee, Executors and Agency Co the High Court found that the payment of rates by a lessee constituted part of the consideration for the supply of land by way of lease. An important part of that conclusion was Chisholm J’s finding that the lessor trust was the occupier of the farm property. Therefore, the lessor trust was primarily liable for rates levied against the farm. The lessee had no statutory obligation to pay the rates. Therefore, the lessee’s payment of the rates to the local authority constituted a payment on behalf of the trust and was part of the consideration for the supply. 22. In the later decision Iona Farm Ltd Young J in the High Court found that the open market rental (the relevant concept for determining the consideration for the supply in that case) for a farm exceeded the GST-registration threshold. The threshold was exceeded without taking into account any rates that the lessee was paying. Even so, his Honour noted that the Commissioner had sought to suggest that the rates that the lease required the lessees to pay should be treated as part of the consideration for the lease, relying on the decision in Trustee, Executors and Agency Co. His Honour noted that the lease in Iona Farm was for a period longer than 12 months, so the primary rating liability lay on the lessee (and not the lessor). In that respect, the case was distinguishable from the Trustee, Executors and Agency Co case. Accordingly, because the lessee had a legal obligation under statute to pay the rates, agreeing to pay them in an agreement with the lessor could not be consideration for the supply, as the obligation already existed. Where the rates are prepaid 23. The Commissioner considers that apportionments of prepaid rates are a part of the consideration for the vendor’s supply of land. 24. A sale of land is a supply of goods for GST purposes. As a matter of contract, the vendor and purchaser can agree to any price for the land (including any apportionments). The Agreement for Sale and Purchase of Real Estate (8th edition, 2006) approved by the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand and Auckland District Law Society records the purchase price that the parties have agreed on for the property. The Agreement provides at clause 3.6 that the vendor shall prepare a “settlement statement” which is defined as follows: 10 a statement showing the purchase price plus any GST payable by the purchaser in addition to the purchase price, less any deposit or other payments or allowances to be credited to the purchaser, together with apportionments of all incomings and outgoings apportioned at the possession date. 25. The settlement statement usually records the apportionment of rates that the parties have agreed on. Such an apportionment is an amount to be paid in addition to the purchase price recorded in the Agreement and forms part of the consideration the purchaser provides to obtain the property from the vendor. 26. Clause 3.7 of the Agreement requires that the purchaser shall pay the balance of the purchase price, interest and “other moneys” on the settlement date. The Commissioner considers that any rates apportionments recorded on the settlement statement are “other moneys”. 27. The Commissioner considers that the payment of rates apportionments by the purchaser to the vendor forms part of the consideration for a single supply. Rates apportionments are paid in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of the supply of land. An agreement to apportion rates does not create a supply to the purchaser from the vendor separate from the supply of the real property. This is because no good or service, separate from the real property, is furnished or provided to the purchaser by the vendor for that payment. 28. Although the purchaser may experience a benefit due to the vendor paying the rates for a period in which the purchaser will own the property, that benefit is not a supply. For there to be a supply, there must be a supply of something. Here the purchaser has no liability to pay rates until they are personally sent a rates assessment and/or invoice for the property. The vendor has not supplied to the purchaser a forbearance from having to pay rates, since the purchaser never had an obligation to pay those rates. Therefore, the vendor cannot make such a supply to them. Furthermore, if the purchaser receives a benefit (of not having to pay rates) that benefit is gained only because the vendor complied with their statutory obligation and not because the purchaser paid a rates apportionment. The purchaser would have received the benefit even if the purchaser did not pay the rates apportionment. 29. As the payment from the purchaser to the vendor reflecting the apportionment of prepaid rates is a payment in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of the single supply of land, the payment increases the “consideration” and value of the supply for GST purposes. Accordingly, GST should be charged on the amount of that apportionment received by a GST-registered vendor. 30. The purchaser can claim an input tax deduction if they are entitled to an input tax deduction for the other consideration paid. Where the rates are in arrears The Local Government (Rating) Act 2002 31. A purchaser’s liability for rates that are in arrears is a contingent liability. That is, the vendor has primary responsibility for rates invoiced during the time the vendor owns the property. Only in the event of the vendor’s 11 default would the purchaser be pursued for those rates. This is important because the existence or non-existence of a statutory obligation on the purchaser to pay an amount can affect whether payment of that amount gives rise to consideration for a supply. The continued existence of a primary liability on a vendor means the purchaser can give value to the vendor by agreeing to discharge the vendor’s liability. If the liability is solely on the purchaser to meet an obligation, then no such consideration can be given to the vendor when the purchaser discharges that liability. 32. The Local Government (Rating) Act 2002 (“LGRA”) states that a local authority can charge rates (sections 13–20 of the LGRA) and where rates are charged, those rates are to be paid by the ratepayer (section 12 of the LGRA). The ratepayer is the person listed in the ratings database (section 10 of the LGRA); usually the owner or the lessee (section 11 of the LGRA). 33. When the rates are assessed, the ratepayer is given notice of their rates liability by a rates assessment: section 44 of the LGRA. If rates are due for a particular period, then the ratepayer is sent a rates invoice: section 46 of the LGRA. The rates invoice also includes a due date: section 46 of the LGRA. Both the rates assessment and the rates invoice name the ratepayer who is liable for the rates: sections 45 and 46 of the LGRA. 34. Therefore, if the vendor is the ratepayer, then the vendor will be sent the rates assessment and rates invoice and be liable for the rates. Because the vendor is named as the ratepayer and receives the rates assessment and rates invoice, the vendor remains liable for those rates until they are paid. If the vendor sells their property, they must notify the local authority of the sale within one month (section 31 of the LGRA) and the vendor will remain liable for the rates that are due while the vendor is listed as the ratepayer. Section 34 of the LGRA states: Notice given under sections 31 to 33 does not release any person from liability for any rates due before the notice is given. 35. However, while the vendor may be liable for rates that were charged before the sale of the property that remained unpaid when the property was sold, the new purchaser can also become responsible for the unpaid rates. A purchaser can become liable for the rates, because the rates are a charge on the land (section 59 of the LGRA) and the charge survives a sale of the property concerned. Analysis 36. There is only one supply by the vendor where rates are in arrears, the supply of the property. The question is whether the discharge of the rates by the purchaser can be consideration for the supply of the property by the vendor. 37. Case law establishes that a taxpayer’s fulfilment of a statutory obligation on them cannot amount to consideration for a supply from a supplier. However, in the context of the rating legislation the primary responsibility for discharging unpaid rates remains with the vendor, regardless of the sale of the property to the purchaser. The purchaser has only a contingent liability to pay the rates; contingent because as the rates are a charge on the land the local authority may, if unable to collect the rates from the vendor, seek payment by enforcing that charge on the land. In this sense 12 the purchaser is able to give consideration for the supply of the property by the vendor by offering to discharge the unpaid rates as part of the bargain for the property. In such a case the purchaser is not simply fulfilling its statutory obligation, as that obligation is only contingent. Such a discharge of rates, by virtue of a contract between vendor and purchaser, can be consideration for the supply of the property. 38. Where the vendor allows a deduction from the settlement amount in return for a promise by the purchaser to discharge the unpaid local authority rates, the overall consideration received by the vendor from the purchaser is made up of three elements: • the purchase price; • the credit of the vendor’s share of the unpaid rates against the purchase price; and • the total amount of the vendor’s liability to the local authority that the purchaser has agreed to discharge. 39. That is, the consideration for the vendor’s supply is made up of the actual monetary consideration received by the vendor from the purchaser and the discharge of the vendor’s liability to the local authority. 40. The amount of the vendor’s liability to the local authority that the purchaser has agreed to discharge, less the credit of the vendor’s share of the unpaid rates against the purchase price will generally equal the purchaser’s share of the unpaid rates. This means that the consideration remains the same as in a “prepaid rates” situation, being equal to the purchase price plus the purchaser’s share of the rates. The difference between the “prepaid rates” and “rates in arrears” situations is that where rates are prepaid, the consideration is the total amount paid by the purchaser to the vendor; whereas where rates are in arrears, the consideration is the total amount paid by the purchaser to the vendor and to the local authority. 41. This is consistent with the definition of “consideration” in section 2(1). That definition includes any payment made “in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of” the supply of any goods and services, but does not require the payment to be made to the supplier. Section 5(15) of the GST Act 42. If the property being transferred is to be used by the purchaser in a taxable activity and the property also includes a dwelling (for example, farm land that includes a house), section 5(15) deems the dwelling (not being a commercial dwelling) to be a separate supply from the supply of the land. The effect of this is that GST is charged only on the commercial supply (that is, the farm land) and not on the residential supply (that is, the house). The rates apportionment, since it forms part of the consideration for the property, will be divided between the dwelling and the land. One possible method for dividing the rates apportionment between the dwelling and the land is given in Example 7 in paragraphs 95 to 106. Examples 43. This part of the commentary discusses seven different land sale examples and sets out the GST consequences of each scenario. Examples 1–3 are 13 situations where the rates are prepaid, so they explain the application of BR Pub 10/10 and BR Pub 10/11. Examples 4-6 are situations where the rates are in arrears, so they explain the application of BR Pub 10/12 and BR Pub 10/13. Example 7 is a situation where section 5(15) applies. 44. Each example discusses the GST consequences of the transaction, shows a sample settlement statement, and, if applicable, shows a sample tax invoice. The sample settlement statements and tax invoices are not prescriptive; they are examples of how these documents might be drafted. 45. The situations in the examples involve property transactions where settlement takes place in April 2010. Because of this the GST rate used in the calculations is 12.5 percent. For transactions where the time of supply is on or after 1 October 2010 the applicable GST rate will be 15 percent. The same approach can be taken towards these transactions as is taken in the examples, with the only difference being the different GST rate. Situations where rates are prepaid Assumptions underpinning Examples 1–3 46. The GST position for rates paid in advance is illustrated in the property sale examples that follow. In Examples 1–3 assume the following: • The vendor is selling property to the purchaser. • The purchase price the parties have agreed is $400,000 (plus GST, if any). The purchaser has paid a deposit of $40,000. • The settlement date is 26 April 2010. • The vendor has paid the local authority rates in advance to 30 June 2010. • The annual rating liability to the local authority is $2,463.75 (inclusive of $273.75 of GST). • The amount of rates relating to the period of the purchaser’s occupation of the land is $438.75 (inclusive of $48.75 of GST). This amount is payable by the purchaser to the vendor under the agreement for sale and purchase of the land. Example 1: sale by an unregistered vendor 47. An unregistered vendor is not entitled to an input tax deduction for the rates it has paid in advance to the local authority. The supply of the property will not be a taxable supply for GST purposes. 48. In the absence of a provision in the Property Law Act 2007 or elsewhere, the amount of the apportionment is a matter for negotiation between the vendor and purchaser. Usually, however, the vendor would wish to recover the full GST inclusive amount of $438.75. 49. The total consideration paid by the purchaser and received by the vendor would be $400,438.75. 14 50. If the purchaser is unregistered, the Act does not allow an input tax deduction. 51. If the purchaser is registered and entitled to a secondhand goods deduction on the overall property purchase, then the purchaser is able to claim an input tax deduction for the rates apportionment under section 20(3). 52. The vendor’s settlement statement would be: Purchaser: Vendor: Settlement Date: 26 April 2010 ADDRESS OF PROPERTY TO: Purchase price in accordance with contract 400,000.00 BY: Deposit paid 40,000.00 TO: Purchaser’s proportion of rates from 27/4/10 to 30/6/10 (65 days at $2,463.75 p/a) 438.75 BY: Balance required to settle 360,438.75 $400,438.75 $400,438.75 Amount required to settle on 26 April 2010 $360,438.75 53. The vendor is unregistered, so a GST tax invoice is not required. Example 2: sale by a registered vendor – standard rate 54. If the vendor can satisfy the requirements of section 20(3) the vendor will be able to claim an input tax deduction for the GST on the amount of annual rates it has prepaid to the local authority. 55. In this example, the supply of the land is in the course or furtherance of the vendor’s taxable activity, so it is a taxable supply on which the vendor must charge and return GST output tax. The apportionment of the rates paid will be part of the consideration for that supply. This part of the consideration will be $390, plus $48.75 of output tax, which the vendor must return to Inland Revenue. The total consideration for the supply will be $450,438.75. 56. If the purchaser is unregistered, the Act does not allow an input tax deduction. 57. If the purchaser is registered and can satisfy the requirements of section 20(3), the purchaser can claim an input tax deduction for the GST element of the purchase price and the rates apportionment. 58. The vendor would return GST output tax on the value of the supply of land (including the apportionments) and would issue a tax invoice to the purchaser inclusive of the apportionments. 15 59. The vendor’s settlement statement would be: Purchaser: Vendor: Settlement Date: 26 April 2010 ADDRESS OF PROPERTY TO: Purchase price in accordance with contract 400,000.00 TO: GST as per tax invoice 50,048.75 BY: Deposit paid 40,000.00 TO: Purchaser’s proportion of rates from 27/4/10 to 30/6/10 (65 days at $2,190 p/a GST exclusive) 390.00 BY: Balance required to settle 410,438.75 $450,438.75 $450,438.75 Amount required to settle on 26 April 2010 $410,438.75 60. The vendor’s tax invoice would be: TAX INVOICE 23 April 2010 From: Vendor’s name GST number: XXX-XXX-XXX Vendor’s address To: Purchaser’s name Purchaser’s address ADDRESS OF PROPERTY TO: Purchase price as per agreement $400,000.00 TO: Purchaser’s share of rates apportioned as at settlement date $390.00 TO: GST on total value of supply $50,048.75 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ $450,438.75 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Total GST: $50,048.75 Settlement date – 26 April 2010 61. The Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Bill 2010 was tabled in Parliament on 5 August 2010. If enacted in its current form, this Bill would require supplies made on or after 1 April 2011 that are between registered persons and that wholly or partly consist of land to be zero-rated. 16 Example 3: sale by a registered vendor – zero rated 62. A zero-rated sale by a registered vendor arises when the supply is of land that was a taxable activity, or part of a taxable activity, as a going concern within section 11(1)(m). 63. The Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Bill 2010 was tabled in Parliament on 5 August 2010. If enacted in its current form, this Bill would require supplies made on or after 1 April 2011 that are between registered persons and that wholly or partly consist of land to be zero-rated. 64. If the vendor can satisfy the requirements of section 20(3) the vendor will be able to claim an input tax deduction for the GST on the amount of annual rates it has prepaid to the local authority. 65. In this situation the apportionments on sale should be GST exclusive ($390) rather than inclusive ($438.75), which is consistent with zero-rating the supply of the going concern. 66. The total consideration paid by the purchaser and received by the vendor would be $400,390. 67. As the sale is zero-rated, the purchaser cannot claim an input tax deduction for any element of the consideration for the property, including the rates apportionment. 68. The vendor’s settlement statement would be: Purchaser: Vendor: Settlement Date: 26 April 2010 ADDRESS OF PROPERTY TO: Purchase price in accordance with contract 400,000.00 TO: GST as per tax invoice nil BY: Deposit paid 40,000.00 TO: Purchaser’s proportion of rates from 27/4/10 to 30/6/10 (65 days at $2,190 p/a GST exclusive) 390.00 BY: Balance required to settle 360,390.00 $400,390.00 $400,390.00 Amount required to settle on 26 April 2010 $360,390.00 17 69. The vendor’s tax invoice would be: TAX INVOICE 23 April 2010 From: Vendor’s name GST number: XXX-XXX-XXX Vendor’s address To: Purchaser’s name Purchaser’s address ADDRESS OF PROPERTY TO: Purchase price as per agreement $400,000.00 TO: Purchaser’s share of rates apportioned as at settlement date $390.00 TO: GST – zero rated nil \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ $400,390.00 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Settlement date – 26 April 2010 Both the vendor and the purchaser agree that this is a sale of a going concern under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 and is therefore zero-rated Situations where the rates are in arrears Assumptions underpinning Examples 4–6 70. The GST position for rates in arrears is illustrated in the land sale examples that follow. In Examples 4–6 assume the following: • The vendor is selling property to the purchaser. • The purchase price the parties agreed is $400,000 (plus GST, if any). The purchaser has paid a deposit of $40,000. • The settlement date is 26 April 2010. • The vendor has not paid the local authority rates from 1 April 2010 (that is, the rates are in arrears for the current rating quarter). • The annual rating liability to the local authority is $2,463.75 (inclusive of $273.75 of GST). • The amount outstanding for the current quarter is $614.25 (inclusive of $68.25 of GST). Of this figure, the amount of rates relating to the period of the vendor’s occupation of the land is $175.50 (inclusive of $19.50 of GST). • The parties have agreed that the purchaser will discharge the unpaid rates, in exchange for a deduction from the settlement amount for the amount of rates relating to the period of the vendor’s occupation of the land. 18 Example 4: sale by an unregistered vendor 71. In a sale by an unregistered vendor, the supply of the property will not be a taxable supply for GST purposes. 72. The amount of the credit against the purchase price is a matter for negotiation between the vendor and purchaser. In this example the parties have agreed to a credit of the GST inclusive amount of the vendor’s share of the rates: $175.50. This is a figure that is likely to be agreed to by two parties to an arm’s length transaction because using this figure puts both parties in the same position they would have been in if the vendor had paid the rates up until settlement and the purchaser had paid the rates from settlement onwards. 73. As discussed at paragraph 38 above, the consideration is made up of three elements. These elements are: • the purchase price: $400,000; • the credit of the vendor’s share of the unpaid rates against the purchase price: $175.50; and • the total amount of vendor’s liability to the local authority that the purchaser has agreed to discharge: $614.25. 74. Therefore, the total consideration for the supply will be $400,438.75. 75. If the purchaser is unregistered, the Act does not allow an input tax deduction for any element of the transaction. 76. If the purchaser is registered and can satisfy the requirements of section 20(3), the purchaser is able to claim a secondhand goods deduction for the property purchase. The consideration will be $400,438.75, so this is the figure the purchaser should use for calculating the amount of input tax. 19 77. The vendor is unregistered, so a GST tax invoice is not required. The vendor’s settlement statement would be: Purchaser: Vendor: Settlement Date: 26 April 2010 ADDRESS OF PROPERTY TO: Purchase price in accordance with contract 400,000.00 TO: BY: Rates to be paid by purchaser as agreed by parties Deposit paid 614.25 40,000.00 BY: Credit for vendor’s proportion of unpaid rates from 1/4/10 to 26/4/10 (26 days at $2,463.75 p/a) 175.50 BY: BY: Amount to be paid by purchaser to local authority to discharge vendor’s liability for outstanding rates Balance required to settle 614.25 359,824.50 $400,614.25 $400,614.25 Amount required to settle on 26 April 2010 $359,824.50 Example 5: sale by a registered vendor – standard rate 78. In this example, the supply of the land is in the course or furtherance of the vendor’s taxable activity and is therefore a taxable supply on which the vendor must charge and return GST output tax. 79. The amount of the credit against the purchase price is a matter for negotiation between the vendor and purchaser. In this example the parties have agreed to a credit against the GST exclusive purchase price of the GST exclusive amount of the vendor’s share of the rates: $156. (This gives the same result as a credit of the GST inclusive amount of the vendor’s share of the rates ($175.50) against the GST inclusive purchase price.) This is a figure that is likely to be agreed to by two parties to an arm’s length transaction because using this figure puts both parties in the same position they would have been in if the vendor had paid the rates up until settlement and the purchaser had paid the rates from settlement onwards. 80. As discussed at paragraph 38 above, the consideration is made up of three elements. These elements are: • the purchase price: $400,000 plus GST, so $450,000; • the credit of the vendor’s share of the unpaid rates against the purchase price: $175.50; and • the total amount of vendor’s liability to the local authority that the purchaser has agreed to discharge: $614.25. 81. Therefore, the total consideration for the supply will be $450,438.75. As consideration is a GST-inclusive amount, the correct amount of GST on the 20 supply is the tax fraction of the consideration - $50,048.75. The vendor must charge and return this amount. 82. If the purchaser is unregistered, the Act does not allow an input tax deduction. 83. If the purchaser is registered and can satisfy the requirements of section 20(3), the purchaser is able to claim an input tax deduction for the purchase of the property. 84. The vendor’s settlement statement would be: Purchaser: Vendor: Settlement Date: 26 April 2010 ADDRESS OF PROPERTY TO: Purchase price in accordance with contract 400,000.00 TO: TO: Rates to be paid by purchaser as agreed by parties (GST exclusive) GST as per tax invoice 546.00 50,048.75 BY: Deposit paid 40,000.00 BY: Credit for vendor’s proportion of unpaid rates from 1/4/10 to 26/4/10 (26 days at $2,190 p/a GST exclusive) 156.00 BY: BY: Amount to be paid by purchaser to local authority to discharge vendor’s liability for outstanding rates Balance required to settle 614.25 409,824.50 $450,594.75 $450,594.75 Amount required to settle on 26 April 2010 $409,824.50 21 85. The vendor’s tax invoice would be: TAX INVOICE 25 April 2010 From: Vendor’s name GST number: XXX-XXX-XXX Vendor’s address To: Purchaser’s name Purchaser’s address ADDRESS OF PROPERTY TO: Purchase price as per agreement, less discount for unpaid rates $399,844.00 TO: Rates to be paid by purchaser to local authority $546.00 TO: GST on total value of supply $50,048.75 $450,438.75 Total GST: $50,048.75 Settlement date – 26 April 2010 86. The Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Bill 2010 was tabled in Parliament on 5 August 2010. If enacted in its current form, this Bill would require supplies made on or after 1 April 2011 that are between registered persons and that wholly or partly consist of land to be zero-rated. Example 6: sale by a registered vendor – zero rated 87. A zero-rated sale by a registered vendor arises when the supply is of land that was a taxable activity, or part of a taxable activity, as a going concern within section 11(1)(m). 88.

If enacted in its current form, this Bill would require supplies made on or after 1 April 2011 that are between registered persons and that wholly or partly consist of land to be zero-rated. 89. The amount of the credit against the purchase price is a matter for negotiation between the vendor and purchaser. In this example the parties have agreed to a credit of the GST inclusive amount of the vendor’s share of the rates ($175.50) plus the amount of GST input tax credit that the vendor has claimed on the purchaser’s share of the rates ($48.75): $224.25. This is a figure that is likely to be agreed to by two parties to an arm’s length transaction because using this figure puts both parties in the same position as they would have been in if the vendor had paid the rates up until settlement and the purchaser had paid the rates from settlement onwards. 90. As discussed at paragraph 38 above, the consideration is made up of three elements. These elements are: 22 • the purchase price: $400,000; • the credit of the vendor’s share of the unpaid rates and the GST on the purchaser’s share of the rates against the purchase price: $224.25; and • the total amount of vendor’s liability to the local authority that the purchaser has agreed to discharge: $614.25. 91. Therefore, the total consideration for the supply will be $400,390. 92. As the sale is zero-rated, the purchaser cannot claim an input tax deduction for any element of the consideration for the property, including the rates apportionment. 93. The vendor’s settlement statement would be: Purchaser: Vendor: Settlement Date: 26 April 2010 ADDRESS OF PROPERTY TO: Purchase price in accordance with contract 400,000.00 TO: TO: Rates to be paid by purchaser as agreed by parties GST as per tax invoice 614.25 nil BY: Deposit paid 40,000.00 BY: Credit for vendor’s proportion of unpaid rates from 1/4/10 to 26/4/10 (26 days at $2,463.75 p/a GST inclusive) 175.50 BY: BY: BY: Credit for GST claimed by vendor on purchaser’s share of rates Amount to be paid by purchaser to local authority to discharge vendor’s liability for outstanding rates Balance required to settle 48.75 614.25 359,775.75 $400,614.25 $400,614.25 Amount required to settle on 26 April 2010 $359,775.75 23 94. The vendor’s tax invoice would be: TAX INVOICE 25 April 2010 From: Vendor’s name GST number: XXX-XXX-XXX Vendor’s address To: Purchaser’s name Purchaser’s address ADDRESS OF PROPERTY TO: Purchase price as per agreement, less discount for unpaid rates $399,775.75 TO: Rates to be paid by purchaser to local authority $614.25 TO: GST on total value of supply nil $400,390.00 Settlement date – 26 April 2010 Both the vendor and the purchaser agree that this is a sale of a going concern under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 and is therefore zero-rated Situations where section 5(15) applies Example 7: sale by a registered vendor – sale of commercial land with a dwelling 95. For example 7, assume the following: • The vendor is selling property to the purchaser. • The land in question is farm land that includes a farm house. • The purchase price agreed on by the parties is $2,500,000 (plus GST). The purchaser has paid a deposit of $250,000. • The value of the farm house and curtilage is $500,000. • The settlement date is 26 April 2010. • The vendor has paid the local authority rates in advance to 30 June 2010. • The annual rating liability to the local authority is $7,300 (exclusive of $912.50 of GST). The amount of rates relating to the period of the purchaser’s occupation of the land is $1,300 (exclusive of $162.50 of GST). This amount is payable by the purchaser to the vendor under the agreement for sale and purchase of the land. 96. If the vendor can satisfy the requirements of section 20(3), the vendor can claim an input tax deduction for the GST component of the rates it has 24 prepaid to the local authority. This input tax deduction will be subject to an adjustment for private use. 97. In this example, the supply of the land is in the course or furtherance of the vendor’s taxable activity and is therefore a taxable supply on which the vendor must charge and return GST output tax. The vendor must charge and return GST on the value of the land (the taxable supply), but not on the value of the dwelling and curtilage (the non-taxable supply). 98. The rates apportionment will be part of the consideration for the supply. The amount of the apportionment is a matter for negotiation between the vendor and purchaser. In this example the parties have agreed that the apportionment will be $1,300, plus output tax that the vendor must return to Inland Revenue. The amount of the output tax will depend on the amount of the rates apportionment that is allocated to the land and the amount that is allocated to the dwelling and curtilage. This amount may be able to be calculated by reference to the local authority rates demand. 99. In this example the local authority rates demand shows that 24 percent of the rates amount is directly attributable to the taxable supply (that is, relates to services provided in relation to the farm land), 16 percent is directly attributable to the non-taxable supply (that is, relates to services provided in relation to the farm house and curtilage), and the remaining 60 percent is attributable to both the taxable and the non-taxable supply. 100. The sample tax invoice below shows how the rates apportionment may be divided based on these figures. In this example GST is charged on the entire amount directly attributable to the taxable supply ($312 equals 24 percent of $1,300) and on 80 percent of the amount attributable to both the taxable and the non-taxable supply ($780 equals 60 percent of $1,300, 80 percent of this amount is $624). The reason for charging GST on 80 percent of the rates attributable to both the taxable and non-taxable supply is that the taxable supply (the farm land) makes up 80 percent of the total supply. 101. The total consideration for the supply will be $2,751,417. 102. If the purchaser is unregistered, the Act does not allow an input tax deduction. 103. If the purchaser is registered and can satisfy the requirements of section 20(3), the purchaser is able to claim an input tax deduction for the GST element of the purchase price and the rates apportionment. 25 104. The vendor’s settlement statement would be: Purchaser: Vendor: Settlement Date: 26 April 2010 ADDRESS OF PROPERTY TO: Purchase price in accordance with contract 2,500,000.00 TO: GST as per tax invoice 250,117.00 BY: Deposit paid 250,000.00 TO: Purchaser’s proportion of rates from 27/4/10 to 30/6/10 (65 days at $7,300 p/a GST exclusive) 1,300.00 BY: Balance required to settle 2,501,417.00 $2,751,417.00 $2,751,417.00 Amount required to settle on 26 April 2010 $2,501,417.00 26 105. The vendor’s tax invoice would be: TAX INVOICE 23 April 2010 From: Vendor’s name GST number: XXX-XXX-XXX Vendor’s address To: Purchaser’s name Purchaser’s address ADDRESS OF PROPERTY TO: Purchase price as per agreement $2,500,000.00 Supply subject to GST Purchase price as per agreement $2,500,000.00 LESS non-taxable supplies $500,000.00 Taxable supply $2,000,000.00 TO: GST on taxable supply $250,000.00 TO: Purchaser’s share of rates apportioned as $1,300.00 at settlement date Rates attributable to the taxable supply: Rates attributable to both the taxable and $780.00 non-taxable supplies Taxable supply as a percentage of the total 80% supply (see “supply subject to GST” above) 80% of $780.00 $624.00 PLUS Rates directly attributable to the $312.00 taxable supply $936.00 TO: GST on rates apportionment attributable to $117.00 the taxable supply $2,751,417.00 Total GST: $250,117.00 Settlement date – 26 April 2010 106. The Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Bill 2010 was tabled in Parliament on 5 August 2010. If enacted in its current form, this Bill would require supplies made on or after 1 April 2011 that are between registered persons and that wholly or partly consist of land to be zero-rated.
INTEREST DEDUCTIBILITY—ROBERTS AND SMITH—BORROWING TO REPLACE AND REPAY AMOUNTS INVESTED IN AN INCOME EARNING ACTIVITY OR BUSINESS Note (not part of the Rulings): Rulings BR Pub 10/14 – 10/19 (“the Rulings”) are a reissue of public rulings BR Pub 07/04 – BR Pub 07/09. BR Pub 07/04 – BR Pub 07/09 were published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 19, No 6 (July 2007), and applied for the period beginning on 22 May 2007 and ending on 22 May 2010. The Rulings, and accompanying commentary, are essentially the same as BR Pub 07/04 – BR Pub 07/09 and commentary. However, BR Pub 07/04 – BR Pub 07/09 were issued when the Income Tax Act 2004 was in force. The Rulings and commentary have been updated to reflect the repeal of the Income Tax Act 2004 and the enactment of the Income Tax Act 2007. In addition: • the commentary has been updated to reflect subsequent case law; and • minor changes have been made to the Rulings and commentary to improve their precision and to assist readers’ understanding. These changes do not result in the Rulings differing to BR Pub 07/04 – BR Pub 07/09 as to the scope of the Arrangements to which they apply, or in their conclusions on the application of the taxation laws to those Arrangements. INTEREST DEDUCTIBILITY—FUNDS BORROWED BY A PARTNERSHIP TO RETURN CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS PUBLIC RULING – BR Pub 10/14 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section DB 6. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the borrowing of and the payment of interest on funds used by a partnership to return capital to partners who previously invested that capital. The Arrangement includes only: • a partnership carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable and excluded income both at the time the partnership borrows the funds and at the time the interest on those funds is payable; and • arrangements where the interest rate on the borrowed funds is an arm’s length rate. 1 The Arrangement does not include arrangements where interest is deductible under section DB 7 (section DB 7 applies to companies). For the avoidance of doubt, the Arrangement also does not include arrangements where subpart BG of the Act applies to void the arrangement (subpart BG relates to tax avoidance arrangements). This Ruling is subject to Part FE of the Act. (The purpose of Part FE is to ensure that worldwide interest expense is apportioned appropriately to a New Zealand taxpayer. The rules in Part FE are commonly referred to as the “thin capitalisation rules”.) How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: • Any partner’s share of the interest will be deductible by that partner to the extent that the partner’s capital contribution was used directly in the partnership’s business, or used to repay borrowed funds on which the interest was deductible. • Any partner’s share of the interest will not be deductible by that partner under the Roberts and Smith replacement and repayment principle to the extent that the borrowed funds are used by the partnership to pay current year income to the partner, or are purported to be used to make a payment out of unrealised asset revaluations or internally generated goodwill. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 23 May 2010 and ending on 23 May 2015. This Ruling is signed by me on the 27th day of October 2010.

Susan Price Director, Public Rulings 11 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULINGS BR PUB 10/14 – 10/19 1. This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Rulings BR Pub 10/14 – 10/19 (“the Rulings”). 2. The Rulings and commentary express the Commissioner’s view of the principles relating to interest deductibility in the Australian Full Federal Court decision in FC of T v Roberts; FC of T v Smith 92 ATC 4 (“Roberts and Smith”). 3. The commentary is organised under the following headings: • Summary • Legislation • How the sections of the Act, other than section DB 7, apply in relation to interest deductibility • Scope of the Rulings and commentary • Analysis of the Roberts and Smith case • Arrangements to which the replacement and repayment principle applies • When interest is not deductible under the replacement and repayment principle • Other matters. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. Summary 4. The interest deductibility test is satisfied if there is a sufficient connection between interest incurred and assessable income. The sufficient connection is established if the borrowed funds on which interest is incurred are used in deriving assessable income or in a business carried on for the purpose of deriving assessable income. 5. In Roberts and Smith the borrowed funds were not used directly in deriving income, but the Court held that the interest is deductible. 6. Roberts and Smith is authority that there is a sufficient connection between interest and income when the interest is incurred on borrowed funds used to replace an amount previously invested in an income earning activity or business and to return the amount to the person who invested it. The link with income is through the new borrowings taking the place of funds that have a sufficient connection with assessable income or in respect of which interest was deductible through the operation of section DB 7 or section DB 8. Capital contributions, past years’ profits and debt are all capable of being replaced. 12 7. The case applies only where the amount replaced and repaid is owed to a person separate to the income earning activity or business. It does not apply to sole traders. Legislation 8. The relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007 are sections DA 1, DA 2, DA 3, DB 1, DB 6, DB 7 and DB 8.

Link with subpart DA (8) This section supplements the general permission and overrides the capital limitation, the exempt income limitation, and the withholding tax limitation. The other general limitations still apply. 16 Roberts and Smith principle not relevant to section DB 7 deductions 9. The interest deductibility legislation distinguishes between companies and other taxpayers. Interest incurred by companies is automatically deductible— that is, there is no requirement to satisfy a nexus test— except for certain exceptions. The effect of this is that most companies seeking interest deductions will obtain them under section DB 7, rather than by applying Roberts and Smith. Roberts and Smith may apply to companies that do not come within section DB 7. 10. Under section DB 7, interest incurred by a company is automatically deductible, provided the statutory exceptions in sections DB 7(2) – (5) do not apply. The exceptions are: • qualifying companies; • companies deriving exempt income except if that exempt income is dividends, exempt income arising from a disposal of a company’s own shares or exempt income related to stake money and a breeding business; • non-resident companies to the extent to which interest is not incurred in the course of carrying on a business through a fixed establishment in New Zealand; and • interest on unpaid taxes payable to another country and substantially the same as civil or criminal penalties as defined under certain laws in New Zealand. 11. The effect of section DB 7 is discussed in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 13, No 11 (November 2001). How the sections of the Act, other than section DB 7, apply in relation to interest deductibility 12. The following paragraphs provide an overview of the relevant deductibility provisions, and their relationship with each other. 13. Section DB 6(1) provides that: A person is allowed a deduction for interest incurred. 14. Section DB 6(3) states that: This section overrides the capital limitation. The general permission must still be satisfied and the other general limitations still apply. 15. Therefore, a person seeking to deduct interest is subject to the general permission, which states: DA 1 General permission Nexus with income (1) A person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss, including an amount of depreciation loss, to the extent to which the expenditure or loss is— (a) incurred by them in deriving— 17 (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income; or (b) incurred by them in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving— (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income. General permission (2) Subsection (1) is called the general permission. 16. Consequently, in considering the application of the Act to interest expense, a person must satisfy the test under the general permission that the expenditure (interest in this case) is incurred in deriving assessable income (or excluded income) or incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable (or excluded income). This test is the same in all relevant respects to the tests under the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Income Tax Act 2004. 17. The concept of “excluded income” requires some comment in relation to how it is dealt with in this commentary. “Excluded income” is defined and specified to include, for example, GST, fringe benefits, certain life insurance premiums or claims derived by persons carrying on the business of life insurance, and other specific classes of income (see sections YA 1 and BD 1(3) and subparts CX and CZ). The addition of the reference to “excluded income” in the general permission does not alter the principles applying to the deductibility of interest. The same principles apply to excluded income. However, because the concept of “excluded income” is a statutory mechanism used to deal with certain types of income, and does not affect the principles of interest deductibility, for ease of reference “excluded income” is not referred to further in this commentary. 18. The general permission is subject to the general limitations, pursuant to section DA 2(7). The general limitations include the private limitation and the capital limitation: DA 2 General limitations Capital limitation (1) A person is denied a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a capital nature. This rule is called the capital limitation. Private limitation (2) A person is denied a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a private or domestic nature. This rule is called the private limitation. ... Relationship of general limitations to general permission (7) Each of the general limitations in this section overrides the general permission. 18 19. The private limitation applies to interest expense, pursuant to section DA 2(2). The capital limitation, on the other hand, does not apply to interest. This result is achieved in the Act by the capital limitation being expressly overridden. Section DA 3(4) and (5) states the general rule that a limitation (such as that applying to capital expenditure) does not apply if it is expressly overridden: DA 3 Effect of specific rules on general rules ... Relationship between other specific provisions and general permission or general limitations (4) A provision in any of subparts DB to DZ may override any 1 or more of the general permission and the general limitations. Express reference needed to override (5) A provision in any of subparts DB to DZ takes effect to override the general permission or a general limitation only if it expressly states that— (a) it overrides the general permission or the relevant limitation; or (b) the general permission or the relevant limitation does not apply. ... 20. The capital limitation is expressly overridden in relation to interest by section DB 6(4) (section DB 6(1) is reproduced to give context): DB 6 Interest: not capital expenditure Deduction (1) A person is allowed a deduction for interest incurred. ... Link with subpart DA (4) This section overrides the capital limitation. The general permission must still be satisfied and the other general limitations still apply. Summary of the legislation relating to interest deductions 21. In summary, the legislation provides the following general rules relating to interest deductibility: • Interest incurred by companies is usually automatically deductible. • For other taxpayers, interest is deductible if it is incurred in deriving assessable income or incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income. • Interest is not deductible if it is private or domestic in nature. • Being capital in nature will not, on its own, mean that interest is non-deductible. 19 Scope of the Rulings and commentary 22. Except for BR Pub 10/19, the Rulings and commentary only consider deductibility under the Roberts and Smith principle. The scope of BR Pub 10/19 (and related commentary) is wider: it states that interest on borrowed funds used to make subvention payments is not deductible under the general permission on any basis. Analysis of the Roberts and Smith case Introduction 23. Courts have established that the general test for interest deductibility requires a sufficient connection between the interest incurred on borrowed funds and the derivation of income. This sufficient connection depends on the use to which the assets provided with the borrowed funds are put (see Eggers v CIR (1988) 10 NZTC 5,153, per Richardson J, and Pacific Rendezvous Ltd v CIR (1986) 8 NZTC 5,146; per Cooke P at p 5,148, per Richardson J at pp 5,151-5,152 and per Somers J at p 5,155). In most cases, the test is satisfied when the borrowed funds are used directly in an income earning activity or business in that they are used to acquire income earning assets. 24. In a limited number of cases, notably Roberts and Smith and Public Trustee v CIR \[1938\] NZLR 436, the courts have held that the borrowed funds were used in relation to the income earning assets, and that the connection was sufficient for deductibility, even though the funds were deployed outside the income earning activity or business. The application of Roberts and Smith is discussed in this commentary, and the application of Public Trustee is discussed in Interpretation Statement IS0082—Interest Deductibility—Public Trustee v CIR 1 . The facts of Roberts and Smith 25. The Australian decision in Roberts and Smith concerned the deductibility of interest incurred by a partnership that borrowed in order to repay partners part of their capital contributions. Judgment was given on two appeals heard together. 26. The facts were that new partners were to join the partnership, but the cost of contributing an amount equal to the capital of the existing partners was too high. To make it easier for the new partners to join the partnership, the partners decided to decrease the amount of the existing partners’ capital by borrowing to repay partners their capital contributions. The Australian Full Federal Court held that the interest on this borrowing was deductible. 27. Hill J, who delivered the leading judgment, considered that the deduction was limited to the extent that the borrowed funds replaced the amount of partnership capital contributed by partners. His Honour explained (at p 4,390): The provision of funds to the partners in circumstances where that provision is not a replacement of funds invested in the business, lacks the essential connection with the income producing activities of the partnership business. \[emphasis added\] 1 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 18 No 6 (July 2006) 20 28. Hill J explained his reasoning in the following passage (at p 4,390): Let it be assumed that the original partnership capital in the Lord Lindley sense \[i.e. contributed capital\] was $10 and that the balance in the account designated as “the capital account” of the partnership was $125,000, which included goodwill. That would mean that the equity of each partner in the partnership, assuming five partners, was $25,000. But it could not be said that each partner had invested funds totalling $25,000 as capital in the partnership. A cheque for $25,000 drawn on the partnership bank account would not operate to repay the partner any funds invested. The partnership capital would remain as $10, and all that would happen is that there would be a borrowing which was used to pay the partner $25,000. That borrowing would reduce the partner’s equity in the partnership, but it could not represent a replacement of capital invested. The partnership assets would remain constant. The goodwill would still be worth $125,000; it would not have been distributed to the partners, nor could it be. On these facts, there could be no question of there being a refund of a pre-existing capital contribution. Rather, looking at the facts objectively, the only purpose of the borrowing would be the provision of funds to the partners to which they were not entitled during the currency of the partnership (save of course by agreement among themselves). The provision of funds to the partners in circumstances where that provision is not a replacement of funds invested in the business, lacks the essential connection with the income producing activities of the partnership, or, in other words, the partnership business. ... If at least $125,000 of the amount in that account represents partnership capital in the Lord Lindley sense, undrawn profit distributions, advances by partners or other funds which have actually been invested in the partnership and which the partners were entitled to withdraw in June 1984, then in my view the taxpayer is entitled to succeed. \[emphasis added\] 29. His Honour considered that interest is deductible in this type of situation only if the borrowed funds replace amounts that have actually been invested in the partnership. The reason for this is that the borrowed funds take on the character of the funds they are replacing only if in fact they have the effect of replacing funds used in the business. Capital contributions can be replaced by borrowings that are used to pay out these contributions to partners. Hill J explains that goodwill is not an amount invested in an income earning activity, and so it cannot be repaid to anyone, and therefore borrowed funds cannot take the place of that goodwill. Similarly, with asset revaluations, the revalued portion of the asset is not an amount that has been invested so it cannot be repaid to anyone. 30. Therefore, Roberts and Smith applies if an amount is able to be replaced by borrowed funds and if the amount replaced is then returned to the person who invested it. The link with income comes through the new borrowings taking the place of funds that have a sufficient connection with assessable income. Capital contributions, undrawn profits and advances are all capable of being replaced. 31. This principle from Roberts and Smith is referred to in this commentary as the “replacement and repayment principle”. Whether the borrowed funds are used in an income earning activity 32. In Hill J’s view, in the circumstances of Roberts and Smith the borrowings replaced the capital that had been paid in by the partners. A question might be raised as to how borrowings can be said to replace funds invested in an income earning activity or business, when the borrowings were actually paid direct to the partners and were never paid into the partnership. The “replacement” occurs in the books of the partnership in 21 that equity is reduced and debt increased. There might seem to be some difficulty in understanding how one debt, with its own parties, conditions, and direct use can inherit the deductibility status of a completely different debt. A basic principle of deductibility would seem to be that deductibility of any item should depend on the circumstances in which it is incurred. A further issue is that if the direct use of the borrowed funds is a private use, for example the private use of partners in a partnership, then it might be argued that the prohibition against deductions of a private nature in section DA 2(2) might apply. 33. Hill J supports his reasoning by saying that interest on a debt that replaces a debt is deductible. But that statement is not an explanation, and it is not clear that a debt replacing a debt inherits its deductibility status. A contrary approach was taken in the Canadian decision in Interior Breweries Ltd v Minister of National Revenue \[1955\] CTC 143; 55 DTC 1090. In that case Cameron J of the Exchequer Court held that interest was not deductible where the borrowed funds were used to pay a bank loan. Cameron J considered that the borrowed money was not used to earn income, but was “used entirely to pay off the bank loan...” (at p148). 34. However, Interior Breweries does not appear to have been applied in any later cases. In Canada, the reason is that legislation was introduced to reverse its effect. It seems likely that the decision may not be accepted in New Zealand or Australia if it were argued. Although New Zealand and Australian courts have been cautious about allowing deductions relating to indirect uses of borrowed funds (particularly in the lower courts in regard to cases where there has been private use of funds), they have not taken as strict an approach as the Canadian courts have taken. Roberts and Smith is an Australian example of acceptance by a court that interest may, in some situations, be deductible when the borrowed funds are not used directly to derive income. Approach to identifying the use of borrowed funds in New Zealand 35. In New Zealand, as in Australia and Canada, the interest deductibility test involves considering the use of the borrowed funds and the connection between the funds and the derivation of income. However, the New Zealand courts have held that the use of funds encompasses not only the direct use of the funds, but also the outcome of that use. In Public Trustee the borrowed funds were applied in payment of death duties. It was argued that the funds were used to retain assets. The dissenting judge in Public Trustee, Northcroft J, had the following view about how the borrowed funds were used (at p 459): ... if money be borrowed to discharge a debt of the owner of the business which debt is otherwise unconnected with the business and if the alternative be a sale of business assets with a consequent diminution of profits, then, in my opinion, this would be capital employed in the payment of the debt and not in the production of income. 36. Northcroft J’s view was not shared by the majority. The majority held that the capital was used in the payment of the debt and to retain assets. Callan J held that borrowed capital used in retaining assets is employed in the production of assessable income, just as capital used in acquiring assets is employed in the production of assessable income. Therefore, the case is authority that in identifying how borrowed funds are used as required by the statutory test, the use of funds will not only encompass the actual application of the funds, but will include the outcome of the 22 application. This interpretation is consistent with the meaning of “use” in the Concise Oxford Dictionary (Oxford University Press, 11 th ed, 2004): use take, hold, or deploy as a means of achieving something. 37. This definition involves two aspects: deployment (ie, application) and outcome. A similar conclusion was reached in Pacific Rendezvous. The use of the funds was held to be in acquiring assets for the motel business and in augmenting the company’s capital. Pacific Rendezvous therefore established that if borrowed funds are used in deriving assessable income, and the sufficient connection is established, it does not matter that the funds are also used to achieve a non-taxable outcome. In the Commissioner’s opinion, this same reasoning applies to the Roberts and Smith situation. If the sufficient connection is established through the use of the borrowed funds, that connection is not lost if there is a second, non- income-related outcome. In Roberts and Smith, the two outcomes were the replacement of funds that had a sufficient connection with the derivation of assessable income, and the use of the funds by partners for non-partnership and possibly private uses. 38. Following Hill J’s judgment, and applying the understanding of “use” that New Zealand courts have taken, the Commissioner’s opinion is that borrowings used to replace and repay amounts invested in an income earning activity or business will have a sufficient connection with income. In those circumstances, the new borrowings take on the character of the money they replace, and the interest will be deductible if the original funds were used directly in the income earning process. Deductibility will not be affected by a concurrent non-income earning use of the borrowed funds. Requirement of the replacement and repayment principle—the funds must return to their owners 39. An element of the Roberts and Smith replacement and repayment principle is that the repaid funds are returned to the person who originally paid them. The principle stated by Hill J in Roberts and Smith is as follows (at p 4,390): The provision of funds to the partners in circumstances where that provision is not a replacement of funds invested in the business, lacks the essential connection with the income producing activities of the partnership, or in other words, the partnership business. 40. When the borrowed funds are used to enable funds invested in income earning activities to be repaid to the person who invested them, the borrowed funds have the necessary connection with the income earning activity of the partnership or business. This connection arises because the borrowed funds, in effect, replace the repaid funds. As a result, the borrowed funds take the place of the repaid funds and so take on the deductibility nexus of the replaced funds. By contrast, Roberts and Smith does not apply when the borrowed funds are paid to a person who did not invest funds into the income earning activity. In this situation, even though the borrowed funds would be recorded as a liability against the assets, there is no necessary connection between the borrowed funds and the income earning activity. This is because the borrowed funds do not replace any funds invested in the income earning activity. 41. This distinction can be understood from a statutory interpretive point of view. If the Roberts and Smith principle extended to borrowings used to 23 replace any amounts in an income earning activity or business, then interest on those funds would in most cases be deductible. That result would be inconsistent with the presence of a statutory test for deductibility that requires a sufficient connection between interest and income. For example, a business might borrow and use the funds for a non-income use, such as to make a nil interest loan to a sister company, to invest in a company that was barred from making distributions, or to pay criminal fines. The argument might be made that as the borrowing would be reflected in the business’ liabilities, it was used in the income earning activity. However, borrowed funds used in that way are not connected with the income earning activity of the business. No amount is repaid, and therefore the borrowings cannot inherit any connection with income. 42. Professor Ross Parsons discussed this issue in his paper “Roberts and Smith: Principles of Interest Deductibility” 2 . He argued that the Roberts and Smith principle should not be simply that a borrowing inherits the deductibility status of the original borrowing. If that were the rule, then there “would be opened a means of obtaining deductions for interest in respect of money borrowed that is used for private non-income producing purposes”. In the Commissioner’s opinion, an interpretation of the deductibility provision that would lead to all interest being deductible, in the context of a provision that the Courts have said requires a sufficient connection and apportionment where that connection is not established, cannot be correct. 43. Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, the Roberts and Smith principle requires that funds repaid are returned to the person who invested or advanced them. New Zealand cases relevant to Roberts and Smith Case P56 44. The approach of the Taxation Review Authority in Case P56 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,386 is similar to the Commissioner’s interpretation of Roberts and Smith. In this decision, partners borrowed to draw out more than they had invested in the partnership. The interest was held to be non- deductible. Willy DJ said that if the partners had replaced capital investments, they would have been entitled to interest deductions (at p 4,396). Case M127 45. Roberts and Smith appears to be inconsistent with Case M127 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,817. Case M127 concerned a husband and wife operating a coffee lounge business. They had $76,000 of their own equity invested in the business. There was little available cash. They wished to buy a new dwelling house, and had some cash outside of the business, but were $70,000 short. The partnership paid $70,000 to the husband and wife as individuals. This put the partnership account into overdraft. The partnership then borrowed to repay the overdraft, leaving it with a credit balance of $2,304. In summary, the borrowed funds were used by the partnership to pay back a loan to the bank, which had been taken out to repay partners their capital so that they could buy a house. The effect on 2 Professor Ross Parsons “Roberts and Smith: Principles of Interest Deductibility” (1993) 1 Taxation in Australia (Red Edition) 261 at p.266 24 the partnership’s balance sheet was that the capital contributed by the partners was replaced by the loan. 46. The objectors argued that the borrowed money was used in the production of income. It does not appear from the judgment that they specifically argued that the loans replaced their equity. The case was heard before Roberts and Smith was decided, so the taxpayers did not have that case available as a precedent. 47. It is helpful to consider Case M127 in the context of the general principles of interest deductibility. The direct test for interest deductibility, followed in Pacific Rendezvous v CIR and CIR v Brierley (1990) 12 NZTC 7,184, requires borrowed funds to be traced to a use that derives income. Roberts and Smith is authority that a strict tracing is not required if the borrowing replaces funds and the replacement involves a replacement of money actually invested. The direct use of the borrowed funds in Roberts and Smith was to pay capital out to partners, who may have used the funds for private use. Hill J said (at p 4,388): A tracing approach, if carried beyond the payment to the partner, encourages the argument raised by the Commissioner in the present case that the funds were used for the private purpose of the partner who received them. But that fact will not preclude the deductibility of the outgoing. The funds to be withdrawn in such a case were employed in the partnership business; the borrowing replaces those funds and the interest incurred on the borrowing will meet the statutory description of interest incurred in the gaining or production of the partnership of assessable income. 48. In Case M127, if a strict tracing approach is applied, the loan was used to pay off a business overdraft. That overdraft loan can be traced to private use by the partners. If Roberts and Smith is applied to the facts, the second loan can be seen as replacing the overdraft, which in turn replaced the equity. The equity was used directly to fund the partnership’s business, and therefore, there is a sufficient connection with income such that the interest is deductible. This reasoning was not argued, or applied by Bathgate DJ. Bathgate DJ held that the interest was not deductible. The case is, therefore, incompatible with Roberts and Smith. The objectors might have still failed on the facts, had they argued Roberts and Smith, because a large proportion of the $76,000 appears to have been made up of goodwill. 49. In the absence of Roberts and Smith, Bathgate DJ held in Case M127 that the borrowed funds were used for private purposes. His Honour considered that the first loan by way of overdraft was used to buy the house, that the second loan paid back the overdraft, and that neither loan was used in producing partnership income. Instead, the loans were used to purchase the house for the objectors. The interest incurred by the partners was private in nature. 50. The decision in Case M127 is therefore inconsistent with the decision in Roberts and Smith. Although Case M127 is from the New Zealand jurisdiction, a decision of the Full Federal Court of Australia has precedent value. In the circumstances of this issue the Commissioner considers that a higher New Zealand court would follow Roberts and Smith rather than the Taxation Review Authority’s decision in Case M127. 25 Arrangements to which the replacement and repayment principle applies Introduction 51. Paragraphs 52 – 109 below explain the Commissioner’s position on when interest will be deductible under the Roberts and Smith replacement and repayment principle. These paragraphs are organised under the following headings: • Returns of capital to partners: BR Pub 10/14 • Payments of past years’ profits to partners: BR Pub 10/14 and BR Pub 10/15 • Share repurchases: BR Pub 10/16 • Payments of dividends: BR Pub 10/17 • Replacement of debt: BR Pub 10/18. Returns of capital to partners: BR Pub 10/14 52. BR Pub 10/14 applies to interest on borrowed funds used by a partnership to return capital to partners who invested that capital into the partnership. 53. The Roberts and Smith replacement and repayment principle applies to borrowed funds used to repay partners their capital contributions to the partnership. Interest is deductible on borrowings used to repay capital to partners, to the extent that the capital that was repaid was used in earning assessable income. 54. This view is based on the conclusion that a partnership can transfer property to a partner. However, a partnership is not a legal entity. A partnership consists of a collection of rights and obligations between the partners, and ownership of partnership assets is vested in the partners, not the partnership. It could be argued, therefore, that a partnership cannot repay partnership property to a partner, because the partner already owns that property. 55. A key concept of partnership law is that partners do not have individual rights to partnership property. This point was made in Hadlee & Sydney Bridge Nominees Ltd v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,106 (PC). Delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, Lord Jauncey stated (at para 5): First of all as a matter of general law, to quote the words of Richardson J \[in Hadlee and Sydney Bridge Nominees Ltd v CIR (1991) 13 NZTC 8, 116 (CA)\] he “does not have title to specific partnership property but has a beneficial interest in the entirety of the partnership assets and in each and every particular asset of the partnership. (Lindley on Partnership 15th Edition, page 516)”. He can enforce this interest against his co-partners to the extent of seeing that the partnership assets are used for the benefit of the partnership but he cannot assign it to a non-partner. This beneficial interest, expressed in terms of its realisability, is in the nature of a future interest taking effect in possession on (and not before) the determination of the partnership (Lindley and Banks on Partnership, 16th Edition, p 457). 56. Lord Jauncey referred to Richardson J’s judgment in Hadlee and Sydney Bridge Nominees Ltd v CIR (1991) 13 NZTC 8, 116 (CA). In his judgment, Richardson J stated: 26 A share in a partnership is a chose in action. It is a fractional interest in the future profits of the partnership business and in a surplus of assets over liabilities on a winding up. The partner does not have title to specific partnership property but has a beneficial interest in the entirety of the partnership assets and in each and every particular asset of the partnership (Lindley on Partnership 15th ed, 516; Maw v Maw \[1981\] 1 NZLR 25). 57. In CIR v Boanas (2008) 22 NZTC 22,046, the High Court referred (at para 64) to this passage from Richardson J’s judgment. In Boanas, Dobson J noted (at para 65) that Richardson J’s judgment was consistent with the Partnership Act 1908, in particular section 23(1): All property and rights and interests in property ... must be held and applied by the partners exclusively for the purposes of the partnership and in accordance with the partnership agreement. Dobson J held (at para 67) that the “application of substantive partnership law” meant that none of the partners could deal with any portion of the whole of the partnership property as if it were their own. 58. Molloy says in Principles of the Law of Partnership that a receipt received by a partnership remains a receipt of the partnership alone, which is to say by the partners jointly 3 . He says that if an amount is partnership property, it is not an individual entitlement of any particular partner. The individual partner does not derive several income (i.e. each partner’s individual allocation of income) until it has been ascertained whether the overall result for the relevant fiscal period has been that the firm has derived any net assessable income. 59. The point was made in Crowe v Commissioner of Taxation (1958) 100 CLR 532 that there is a distinction between partnership property and each partner’s individual property. The case was concerned with an expense, rather than income, but is relevant because it makes the point that partnership property is not the same as the individual entitlements of the partners. In Crowe a partnership took out a policy on each of the lives of its four partners. Each policy was for the benefit of all four partners. The premiums were paid by the firm and the policy was in the name of the firm. A provision of the Australian Commonwealth income tax legislation permitted the deduction of “amounts paid by the taxpayer as premiums or sums for insurance on the life of the taxpayer.” Fullagar J said that if any of the partners were to have: ... effected an insurance on her own life, and the partnership had paid a premium on the policy at her request and debited the amount to an advance account in its books, I should have said that she ought to be held to have “paid” the premium, although no money or money’s worth passed from her hand to the hand of the insurer. 60. The issue in Crowe was whether payment by the firm, of the premium on a policy that the firm itself had taken out, had been payment by the taxpayer. Fullagar J answered the question in the negative: \[T\]hat a partnership has, in English law, no legal personality distinct from those of the individual partners ... does not mean that there is not a very real difference between a right or obligation of a partnership (or partners as such) and a right or obligation of an individual member of a partnership. 3 Principles of the Law of Partnership, Webb and Molloy, (Butterworths, Wellington, 6th edition, 1996) para. 11.235 27 The insurance contracts were taken out in the name of the firm, and the firm (and not each individual partner) paid the premiums. The premiums were paid by the partners jointly. It was therefore not a payment made by any one of the individual partners. 61. Similarly, in the Commissioner’s view, income of a firm is derived by the partners jointly, and not individually by each partner. This is consistent with Richardson J’s judgment in Hadlee and Sydney Bridge Nominees Ltd v CIR (CA). In this decision, his Honour observed that the statutory regime for the taxation of partnership income, among other things, treated partnership income as derived by the partners jointly: New Zealand tax legislation does not isolate partnership income as a separate source of income. In New Zealand law a partnership is not a separate tax entity. It is not a “taxpayer” and partners make a return of partnership income only for the purpose of providing information on which their separate incomes are calculated. The gross income is derived by the partners jointly and the partners severally claim the deductions to which they are entitled as taxpayers in terms of the legislation. All that is reflected in sec 10 and various general provisions of the \[Income Tax Act\] 1976 ....\[Emphasis added\] 62. Richardson J referred to section 10(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976 as reflecting the principle that gross income is derived by partners jointly. Section 10(1) has since been replaced by section 42 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Section 42 largely resembles section 10(1) and also reflects the principle that gross income is derived by partners jointly: Returns by joint venturers, partners and partnerships (1) This section applies when 2 or more people derive income jointly or have deductions jointly. ... (3) In the case of partners,— (a) if the partnership of the partner is a limited partnership registered under the Limited Partnerships Act 2008 or is a partnership that would carry on a business in New Zealand ignoring section HG 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007, then the partners must make a joint return of income that includes— (i) the total amount of income derived by the partners as members of the partnership; and (ii) the partners’ partnership shares in the income; and (iii) a summary of the deductions of each partner: (b) there is no joint assessment, but each partner must make a separate return of income under section 33, including the income derived by the partner as a member of the partnership, and the partner’s deductions. Each partner is separately assessed. (4) In any other case, each person shall make a separate return taking into account that person’s share of the joint income and deductions. Each person is separately assessed. 63. In 2007, after the Rulings were originally issued, section HG 2(1) was enacted. When the original Rulings were issued there was no equivalent legislative provision. Section HG 2(1) provides that partnerships are transparent for income tax purposes unless the context otherwise requires. This means that, for the purposes of calculating their obligations and liabilities under the Act, the partners (and not the partnership) are generally treated as: 28 • carrying on activities and having the status, intention and purpose of the partnership; and • holding property that a partnership holds, being parties to an arrangement to which the partnership is party, and doing or being entitled to a thing that the partnership does or is entitled to, in proportion to their partnership share. 64. Section HG 2(1) does not alter the principle that partnership income is derived by the partners jointly, and that partnership property is owned jointly, and not individually by each partner. The words “\[f\]or the purposes of a partner’s liabilities and obligations under the Act” make clear that section HG 2(1) applies only in respect of the calculation of a partner’s tax obligations and liabilities. Accordingly section HG 2 does not affect the partners’ individual rights to partnership property under general law as developed in the case law discussed above. 65. In summary, partners own an undivided interest in partnership property, and do not have individual title to any particular items of partnership property. Consequently, there can be a valid legal transfer of property from a partnership to a partner, because the nature of the legal ownership changes from joint ownership to ownership by a single person. Therefore, the Roberts and Smith principle can apply to partnerships. The Roberts and Smith case of course involved a partnership, and so is authority for this point. 66. It should be noted that a return of capital, whether by a partnership or a company, is not connected with income simply because it is an ordinary part of running a business. A return of capital is not part of the income earning activity, it is a transaction relating to the structure of the business. However, there is a sufficient connection with income in this arrangement because, following Roberts and Smith, borrowing to return capital has the effect of replacing and repaying the funding of the income earning activity. In these circumstances, the borrowed funds continue the connection the repaid funds had with income. Payments of past years’ profits to partners: BR Pub 10/15 Introduction 67. BR Pub 10/15 states that: • interest is deductible to the extent that the borrowed funds are used to repay past years’ profits to the partners if those profits are used by the partnership in its income earning activities; and • interest is not deductible to the extent that the borrowed funds are used to pay current year income to partners, or are purported to be used to make a payment out of unrealised asset revaluations or internally generated goodwill. The following paragraphs explain the Commissioner’s reason for distinguishing between past years’ profits and current year income. BR Pub 10/14 also denies interest deductions where borrowed funds are used to pay current year income to partners. The Commissioner’s position on unrealised asset revaluations and internally generated goodwill is discussed later: see paragraphs 111—116. 29 68. Past years’ profits in a partnership, which Hill J in Roberts and Smith refers to as undrawn profit distributions, can be viewed as amounts contributed by partners. If a partner does not withdraw profits, they are allocated to partners equally, or in accordance with the divisions in the partnership agreement (Principles of the Law of Partnership). 4 The accounting treatment might be to carry profits to the credit of the partner’s respective current accounts by book entry calculated at the end of the accounting period. Although there may not be any active reinvestment by the partners themselves, this process can reasonably be seen as an investment of capital. 69. Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, past years’ profits can be seen as reinvestments by partners in the partnership and the replacement and repayment principle may apply. Interest is deductible on borrowings used to repay past years’ profits to partners, to the extent that those profits were used in earning assessable income or in the partnership business. Payments of current year income to partners: BR Pub 10/14 and BR Pub 10/15 70. The Commissioner’s opinion is that the principle from Roberts and Smith does not extend to borrowings purporting to return the current year income that has not yet been identified as profits. The reason is that current year income is not an amount that has been invested in the partnership by the partners, and so cannot be repaid to partners. 71. The principle from Roberts and Smith is that interest may be deductible if borrowed funds repay funds invested in an income-earning activity or business carried on to derive income. The issue with current year income is whether it is an amount that can be repaid. To be repayable, it must have been paid into the partnership by someone. The amount can only have been paid in if someone other than the partnership has had an entitlement to it at some time. Therefore, the issue is to decide whether partners can be said to have become individually entitled to current year income at some time before any purported replacement. 72. To consider this question, the legal nature of current year income is examined. If current year partnership income is owned by individual partners at any point during the year, it could in theory be invested by partners in the partnership business. Whether current year income is partnership property or property of individual partners 73. The conclusion has already been reached that there is a distinction between partnership property and property belonging to individual partners. In considering the application of Roberts and Smith to current year income, the next step is to ascertain whether it is partnership property, or property of individual partners. 4 ibid paragraphs 2.48 and 4.109 30 74. The Partnership Act 1908 is silent on the treatment of current year income. It provides for the division of profits in section 27: 27. Rules as to interests and duties of partners— The interests of partners in the partnership property, and their rights and duties in relation to the partnership, shall be determined, subject to any agreement (express or implied) between the partners, by the following rules: (a) All the partners are entitled to share equally in the capital and profits of the business, and must contribute equally towards the losses, whether of capital or otherwise, sustained by the firm: ... (d) A partner is not entitled, before the ascertainment of profits, to interest on the capital subscribed by him: 75. Under section 27, partners are entitled to share in any profits, subject to any agreement to the contrary. The concept of “profits” is not defined. There is no particular guidance in the Partnership Act as to when the division and allocation of profits occurs. 76. It has been held in Australia that, for tax purposes, the amount that forms part of each partner’s individual income is only ascertainable once partnership accounts have been prepared, and that this would normally be at year end. In FC of T v Galland 86 ATC 4885 the High Court of Australia held that in the absence of an agreement stating a different balance date, accounts of the partnership would be required to be taken each year as at 30 June and a partner’s share of the partnership income would be distributed to the partner as at that date. The High Court said: ...although a partner is not usually entitled to call for a distribution of profits or net income until accounts have been prepared, he has an individual interest in the net income of the partnership, notwithstanding that the precise amount of his interest cannot be determined until the accounts are prepared for the relevant period. 77. The High Court’s view is that partners are not (usually) entitled to current year income. The partners have an individual interest in the net income of the partnership, but not an immediate entitlement to the current year income. Galland was quoted by Hill J in Roberts and Smith as authority for the proposition that a partner’s share of the partnership income is derived by the partner only once annual accounts of the partnership have been prepared. Hill J said: In the absence of agreement, accounts for the partnership would be required to be taken each year as at 30 June and a partner’s share of the partnership income would be derived by him as at that date: FC of T v Galland . 78. Further, it is in the nature of profits that they have to be identified before anyone can become entitled to them. Fletcher Moulton LJ provided a definition of “profits” in Re Spanish Prospecting Co. Ltd \[1911\] 1 Ch 92 at 98-99 5 (cited in Galland): The word “profits” has, in my opinion, a well-defined legal meaning, and this meaning coincides with the fundamental conception of profits in general practice, although in mercantile phraseology the word may at times bear meanings indicated by the special context which deviate in some respect from this fundamental 5 This definition was adopted by Williams J in Dalgety v Commissioner of Taxes \[1912\] NZLR 260 at 261-262, and discussed in Higgins & Fletcher The Law of Partnership in Australia and New Zealand (LBC Information Services, Pyrmont, NSW, 8 th ed, 2001 31 signification. “Profits” implies a comparison between the state of a business at two specific dates usually separated by an interval of a year. The fundamental meaning is the amount of gain made by the business during the year. This can only be ascertained by a comparison of the assets of the business at two dates ... We start therefore with this fundamental definition of profits, namely, if the total assets of the business at the two dates be compared, the increase which they show at the later date as compared with the earlier date (due allowance of course being made for any capital introduced into or taken out of the business in the meanwhile) represents in strictness the profits of the business during the period in question. 79. As Fletcher Moulton LJ points out, as a matter of logic, profits can be known only once they are calculated. They can be calculated only when the amounts of income and expenses for the relevant fiscal period are known. Although amounts will come in that will in due course form profits, until the fiscal period has ended, the amount of profits cannot be known. It follows, in the Commissioner’s opinion, that an entitlement cannot arise until the amount can be known, and it can be known only at the end of the fiscal period. This period, as Fletcher Moulton LJ says, is generally annual. 80. Therefore, the Commissioner’s opinion is that a partner does not have an individual entitlement to current year income. Current year income is owned by all of the partners jointly. Individual partners have an ownership interest in it in common with the other partners, but not an entitlement to their potential individual share until profits have been calculated and allocated for a fiscal period. Discussion of current year income in Roberts and Smith 81. In applying the law to the case he was considering, Hill J in Roberts and Smith explained that it was necessary to identify whether the partners received a refund of capital, or whether they received amounts in excess of their capital. Hill J considered capital to be the aggregate amounts contributed by the partners for the purpose of commencing or carrying on the partnership business (at p 4,389). The partnership accounts he was considering did not separate out the contributed capital from other items. He thought that it was possible that the amount of capital represented in the partnership accounts included (at p 4,390): • contributed capital; • internally generated goodwill; • undrawn distributions; • profits of the year not yet distributed; and • asset revaluations. In Hill J’s view, the items that could be replaced with a deductible result were (at p 4,390): • contributed capital; • undrawn profit distributions; • advances made by partners; and • other funds that have actually been invested in the partnership and which the partners were entitled to withdraw. 32 82. Hill J did not include “internally generated goodwill”, “asset revaluations” and “profits of the year not yet distributed” (i.e. current year income) as amounts able to be replaced. Internally generated goodwill and asset revaluations are discussed later: see paragraphs 111—116 below. Hill J’s view was that the types of amounts that could be replaced with a deductible result were funds that had actually been invested in the partnership and which the partners were entitled to withdraw at the time of the borrowing. 83. In contrast, Hill J considered that undrawn distributions that have been allocated to partners, but not paid out (i.e. past years’ profits) can be replaced with borrowings and the interest would be deductible. Application of the Roberts and Smith principle and the law on partnerships to current year income 84. Partners do not have rights to current year income as it arises during the year, because it is partnership property. Profits are generally determined at the end of the year and, until this happens, the partners are not entitled to current year income. This means that any drawings taken from the partnership’s current year income can only be a partner’s anticipated share of the profits. Current year income cannot, therefore, be an amount invested in the partnership by the partners. As it is, in the Commissioner’s opinion, essential for the Roberts and Smith replacement and repayment principle that the funds must be repaid to someone, there must be someone who has had an entitlement to them. Therefore, to be repayable, someone must have invested the funds in the income earning activity or business. Current year income has not been invested so the Roberts and Smith principle does not apply to it. Difference between current year income and past years’ profits 85. Past years’ profits can be distinguished from current year income because partners have become entitled to them, either at a time specified under the partnership agreement or, in the absence of a partnership agreement, when the partnership accounts are required to be taken (FC of T v Galland) and they have been notionally allocated to partners. Their status is then as advances to the partnership or new investments of capital. Hill J considered that past years’ profits could be viewed as amounts invested, and that they could be repaid with a deductible result. Share repurchases: BR Pub 10/16 86. BR Pub 10/16 applies to interest on borrowed funds that are used by a company to repurchase shares from its shareholders (as authorised by the Companies Act 1993). 87. A repurchase of shares by a company involves a payment by a company to its shareholders of amounts previously contributed by shareholders. The repurchase of bonus share issues that were funded by past years’ profits can also be seen as involving a payment by a company to its shareholders of amounts previously contributed by shareholders. The effect of the payment by the company is a diminishment of the shareholder’s capital holding in the company. This arrangement is analogous to a return of capital or past years’ profits to partners in a partnership. 33 88. Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, the replacement and repayment principle may apply to share repurchases (including repurchases of bonus issue shares). Interest is deductible on borrowings used to repay share capital or past years’ profits to shareholders, to the extent that the capital or profits were used in deriving the company’s assessable income. 89. It should be noted that interest incurred by companies will generally be deductible under section DB 7, the provision that gives companies in most situations an automatic deduction for interest, and that Roberts and Smith would be an alternative basis for deductibility for interest incurred on borrowed funds used to repurchase shares. Payments of dividends: BR Pub 10/17 90. BR Pub 10/17 applies to interest on borrowed funds used by a company to pay dividends to its shareholders. 91. The Roberts and Smith replacement and repayment principle applies to borrowings used to pay dividends sourced from past year profits, usually described as retained earnings, to shareholders. There is, however, some conceptual difficulty in bringing a company’s retained earnings within this principle. The difficulty is in analysing retained earnings as amounts contributed by shareholders. Company profits are not allocated to shareholders at the end of each year. Retained earnings are added to the existing retained earnings. Directors may decide to distribute some of these as dividends or they may decide not to. Shareholders are not immediately entitled to retained earnings in the way that partners are entitled to partnership profits. 92. There are, however, similarities between a partnership’s past years’ profits and a company’s retained earnings. They share the characteristic that the amount has been finally settled for the year, and the theoretical amount each shareholder (or partner) is entitled to can be established. They can, in a sense, be seen as the amount a shareholder or partner has invested into the business. The features of partnership profits that do not suggest they have been invested by partners are also shared by retained earnings. Both retained earnings and partnership profits are at the disposal of the business until the decision is made to pay them out. Just as partners may not necessarily make any active decision to reinvest past profits, shareholders would not usually make any decision to reinvest profits in the business. For these reasons, the Commissioner’s opinion is that payment of dividends from retained earnings can be viewed as sufficiently analogous to payments to partners of partnership past years’ profits, such that both should be treated the same in determining interest deductibility. 93. Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, retained earnings can be treated as notional reinvestments by shareholders in the company and the replacement and repayment principle should apply. Interest is deductible on borrowings used to pay dividends to shareholders, to the extent that those profits were used in income earning. 94. The Commissioner considers that the Roberts and Smith principle does not apply where the borrowed funds are used to pay current year income to a shareholder. In paragraphs above 70—85 above, it was concluded that the Roberts and Smith principle cannot apply where a partnership uses borrowed funds to replace current year income. The basis for this conclusion was that individual partners do not have an immediate 34 entitlement to current year income, and therefore they cannot be considered to have invested the income into the partnership. Similarly, shareholders in a company do not have an immediate entitlement to the company’s current year income, and therefore they cannot be considered to have invested that income into the company. 95. If company profits are distributed as bonus issues, then similarly the amount represented by the shares can be seen as capital able to be replaced under the replacement and repayment principle. 96. As already mentioned, interest incurred by companies will generally be deductible under section DB 7, the provision that gives companies in most situations an automatic deduction for interest, and that Roberts and Smith would be an alternative basis for deductibility for interest incurred on borrowed funds used to pay dividends. Replacement of debt: BR Pub 10/18 97. BR Pub 10/18 applies where borrowed funds are used to replace and repay funds to the person who lent them to the taxpayer or partnership. 98. Borrowings used to repay borrowings used in an income earning activity or business are within the Roberts and Smith principle. Hill J in Roberts and Smith said that where a loan is taken out and used to repay a debt that was used directly in an income earning process or business, the character of the refinancing takes on the same character as the original borrowing and gives to the interest incurred the character of a working expense. In Hill J’s mind, there is no difference in terms of interest deductibility between repaying one debt with another and borrowing to return capital, and both situations should be similarly treated. 99. If the first refinancing takes on the character of the debt it replaces, then logically, subsequent refinancing should also inherit that character. Therefore, the Commissioner’s opinion is that interest is deductible on borrowings used to repay other borrowings, to the extent those other borrowings can be traced to a use that gave rise to deductible interest. 100. Three issues can arise where the borrowed funds are used to repay funds to the person who lent them to the taxpayer or partnership. These issues are whether the Roberts and Smith replacement and repayment principle applies: • where the original, replaced, funds were deductible under a statutory nexus other than the general permission (for example, section DB 7) • where the lender’s right is assigned to another person • only if there is direct tracing between the original, replaced, funds and the borrowed funds. These issues are considered in the following paragraphs. Continuation of a statutory nexus 101. The general rule from Roberts and Smith is that borrowings may inherit the deductibility status of funds they repay. In some situations, the repaid funds may be deductible by the operation of a specified statutory nexus, 35 rather than the general rule that requires as a question of fact a sufficient connection with income. One relevant nexus is in section DB 7, which provides for automatic deductions for most companies, and the other is in section DB 8, which provides for deductions for companies investing in shares in a group company. 102. The nexus in each of these two sections is different in nature from the nexus in Roberts and Smith, where the replaced funds achieved the nexus by being used to derive income. Nevertheless, the Commissioner considers that the deductibility status should also be inheritable when deductibility is established through a statutory nexus. If it were not, and refinancing meant interest that had been deductible as a matter of law rather than fact was no longer deductible, Parliament’s intention for sections DB 7 and DB 8 would be defeated. Therefore, the Commissioner’s opinion is that Roberts and Smith applies to replacement and repayment of borrowed funds in respect of which deductibility is established under sections DB 7 and DB 8. Application of Roberts and Smith where the lender’s right is assigned 103. The Commissioner’s view is that the principle from Roberts and Smith is that funds may be replaced with borrowed funds and the interest will be deductible, if the repaid funds are returned to their owners. The exception is the replacement and repayment of a debt, where the right to receive the amount advanced has been assigned to someone else. Interest would still be deductible under the principle, because in those circumstances there is still a repayment of funds invested, as the amount can be traced back to the original investor through the assignee. Whether direct tracing is required 104. The replacement and repayment principle requires identifying how the original funds were used, and identifying the use of the new debt to repay those original funds. Therefore, under the principle, the use of funds needs to be identified or “traced”. 105. Given the compliance costs that may arise in some circumstances, consideration has been given to whether tracing is essential to the replacement and repayment principle. It is recognised that for some taxpayers, who have daily changes to their borrowings, the requirement may be difficult to fulfil. 106. One approach would be to allow a deduction if the refinancing loan is taken out and the first loan paid back about the same time. However, it seems likely that this “around the same time” requirement would not in practice operate to limit deductibility to arrangements within the principle, and would result in interest on any borrowing qualifying for deductibility. 107. An alternative is that the Commissioner would accept that a loan is a replacement unless it is used solely for a private or exempt use. However, that approach would, in the Commissioner’s view, be too wide to be consistent with the statutory requirements, as any use of borrowings would satisfy the test (apart from sole private and exempt uses). The test would not be limited to replacement of funds that are returned to their owners. Without the element of replacement, there would not be a sufficient nexus with income. Uses of funds that would qualify would be those uses that would not seem to be within the intent of the interest 36 deductibility provision such as nil interest loans to sister companies, investments in companies prohibited from making distributions, and so on. 108. Therefore, the Commissioner takes the view that the replacement and repayment principle requires that borrowings should be traced to replacement of funds that satisfy the statutory nexus for deductibility. Taxpayers with few borrowings should usually be able to trace money. Taxpayers with more complicated borrowing practices will, in most case, be companies, for which interest will be deductible under section DB 7, without the need to satisfy the Roberts and Smith principle. 109. It should be remembered that all debt is subject to a tracing test. In several cases that considered the direct test of interest deductibility, the courts have held that the use of funds must be traced: for example, Pacific Rendezvous Ltd and Brierley. When interest is not deductible under the Roberts and Smith principle Introduction 110. Paragraphs 111 – 128 below discuss the situations where interest is not deductible under the Roberts and Smith replacement and repayment principle. These paragraphs are organised under the following headings: • Goodwill and asset revaluations: BR Pub 10/14; BR Pub 10/15; BR Pub 10/16; BR Pub 10/17; BR Pub 10/18 • Subvention payments: BR Pub 10/19 • Sole traders • Private use. Goodwill and asset revaluations: BR Pub 10/14; BR Pub 10/15; BR Pub 10/16; BR Pub 10/17; BR Pub 10/18 111. BR Pub 10/14 to BR Pub 10/18 state that interest on borrowed funds will not be deductible under the Roberts and Smith replacement and repayment principle to the extent that the borrowed funds are purported to be used to make a payment out of unrealised asset revaluations or internally generated goodwill. 112. As mentioned in paragraphs 81 and 82 above, in Roberts and Smith Hill J singled out internally generated goodwill as an amount in the partnership capital account that could not be replaced and repaid to partners, because it is not an amount that has been invested by someone in the business. Hill J explained that a payment of goodwill is not a “refund of a pre- existing capital contribution” (at p 4,390). 113. Glazebrook and James 6 have explained that goodwill cannot be distributed because after a purported distribution, it would still remain. Therefore, internally generated goodwill is not an amount that can be replaced and 6 “Taxation Implications of Company Law Reform” by Susan Glazebrook and Jan James, New Zealand (1995) 1 NZJTLP 132 at p 157. 37 repaid to partners or shareholders with borrowed funds with a deductible result. 114. However, the situation will be different if goodwill is purchased. In that situation, funds, either equity or debt, are used to purchase the goodwill. These funds can be replaced with borrowed funds and the interest would be deductible. 115. If purchased goodwill is revalued internally, the extent of the internal revaluation is not represented by an amount invested in the business that can be replaced and repaid. Therefore, interest on an amount borrowed purporting to replace goodwill to the extent that it is internally generated and to repay it to partners or shareholders, will not be deductible. 116. Similarly, amounts that are attributable to asset revaluations cannot be replaced and repaid and therefore are not within the Roberts and Smith principle. Subvention payments: BR Pub 10/19 117. BR Pub 10/19 applies to interest on borrowed funds used to make a payment under section IC 5 to another company. 118. A company may use borrowed funds to make a payment under section IC 5 to another company that has a net loss and is in the same group of companies. This payment is commonly referred to as a “subvention payment”. An issue arises as to whether the interest incurred on borrowed funds used to make subvention payments will be deductible in accordance with the replacement and repayment principle. 119. In many cases, this issue will not arise in practice. Interest incurred by companies is generally deductible under section DB 7. Therefore, interest incurred by a company on borrowed funds used to make a subvention payment will generally be deductible under that section. 120. However, if section DB 7 does not apply, then the application or not of Roberts and Smith becomes relevant. The replacement and repayment principle is that interest is deductible on borrowings repaying funds paid into the business or income earning process. A subvention payment is a payment between companies in a group to reduce the overall tax burden of the group. It is not a replacement of an amount previously advanced by the recipient company, or an amount repaid to shareholders for amounts they invested in the paying company. 121. Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, the use of borrowed funds to pay a subvention payment does not satisfy the replacement and repayment principle from Roberts and Smith, and interest incurred on borrowed funds used to pay a subvention payment is not deductible under that principle. 122. BR Pub 10/19 states that interest on borrowed funds used to make a subvention payment will not be deductible under the general permission on any basis. In the Commissioner’s view, a subvention payment does not have a sufficient connection with the income earning activities of the company making the payment. The payment is made after the derivation of income by the company and when its annual profits are determined. The subvention payment reduces the tax liability of the company, thereby minimising the overall tax liability of the group of companies. 38 Sole traders 123. The principle in Roberts and Smith is that interest is deductible on borrowed funds used to repay funds to investors in an income earning activity or business. This principle applies where an entity—whether a partnership or a company—borrows money and uses it to return amounts invested in the partnership or company. Individuals with an income earning activity or business but who do not operate through a company or any other structure (referred to as a “sole trader”), do not have a separate entity in which to invest their money. If an individual invests money used for private purposes into a business or activity they carry on as a sole trader, there has been no change in ownership of that money. It is artificial to describe a transaction with oneself as a replacement and repayment of funds. Therefore, in the Commissioner’s opinion, the replacement and repayment principle cannot apply to sole traders arguing that borrowing funds have the effect of returning their capital or past years’ profits. 124. Although a partnership is not a separate legal entity from its partners, as discussed above, there is a distinction between property owned by a partnership and property owned by individual partners. Therefore, in contrast to sole traders, there can be a valid legal transfer of property from a partnership to a partner, and the Roberts and Smith principle can apply to partnerships. 125. Professor Parsons raised some arguments that support applying the Roberts and Smith principle to individuals in “Roberts and Smith: Principles of Interest Deductibility”. 7 He said that separate accounting records may personify a separate entity. Secondly, he argued that the legislation recognises a sole trader in business as separate from the sole trader in a private capacity, because the deductibility provisions distinguish between individuals in business and individuals not in business. However, he considered that these arguments may be tenuous, and that it will be difficult for a sole trader to establish that interest on borrowings used to withdraw capital is not prohibited as private. Also, Professor Parsons considered these arguments in the context of an interpretation of Roberts and Smith that is much broader than the interpretation taken by the Commissioner. 126. Although an individual cannot replace capital, an individual can, however, deduct interest incurred in using borrowed funds to replace a debt owed to a third party, where the amount first borrowed was used directly in the individual’s income earning activity or business. As the borrowed funds replaced are repaid to a separate entity, the third party lender, the funds are able to be repaid, and so the Roberts and Smith principle can apply. Private use 127. The Commissioner’s view is that when borrowings are used to return partners’ capital, the interest may be deductible despite the fact that the direct use of the borrowed funds may be for the private use of the taxpayer. The reason is that the borrowed funds are also used for a concurrent income-related use—the replacement of funds used in deriving income. 7 See n 2 39 40 128. That situation compares with the one where the borrowed funds replace borrowed funds that are being used solely for private use. In that situation, the interest on the replacing funds will not be deductible. Other Matters Australian Tax Office’s view on Roberts and Smith 129. The Australian Tax Office has issued a ruling on its interpretation of Roberts and Smith. The Australian Tax Office’s view is similar to the Commissioner’s view; see TR 95/25 Income Tax: deductions for interest under subsection 51(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 following FC of T v Roberts; FC of T v Smith, issued 29 June 1995. Two addenda have been added to TR 95/25, primarily to update the references in the ruling to the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. A consistent interpretation of Roberts and Smith was applied in TR 2005/12 Income tax: deductibility of interest expenses incurred by trustees on funds borrowed in connection with payments of distributions to beneficiaries, issued 6 July 2005. TR 2005/12 relates to borrowings used to repay amounts to beneficiaries. Applicability of Roberts and Smith to the refinancing of investments in QCs, CFCs and FIFs 130. If interest on funds invested in qualifying companies, controlled foreign companies or foreign investment funds is deductible then, applying Roberts and Smith, interest on funds used to refinance that investment will be deductible. Roberts and Smith is concerned with refinancing of investments, and when it applies, the deductibility status of the initial investment is taken on by the replacing funds. It is not necessary to understand the reasons for the deductibility or otherwise of the initial investment to understand the Roberts and Smith principle. Because the deductibility of interest incurred in relation to qualifying companies, controlled foreign companies and foreign investment funds is not relevant to an understanding of how the Roberts and Smith case applies, the issue is not dealt with further in this commentary or in the Rulings.
