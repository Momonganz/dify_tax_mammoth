NEW LEGISLATION Tax Administration (Canterbury Flood Event) Order 2021 The flooding created by the heavy rain that fell in Canterbury region between 29 May and 1 June 2021 has been declared to be an emergency event for the purposes of section 183ABA of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This section allows the Commissioner to remit use-of-money interest payable on late tax payments following emergency events. The declaration applies to taxpayers who were physically prevented from paying their tax on time as a result of the floods. The declaration commenced 8 June 2021 and expires 31 August 2021. Taxpayers may apply for remission once their tax returns and payments are up to date. Different rules apply in cases of financial hardship. Find out more about Inland Revenue’s tax relief measures at www.ird.govt.nz Tax Administration (Canterbury Flood Event) Order 2021 Income Tax (Deemed Rate of Return on Attributing Interests in foreign Investment Funds, 2020–21 Income Year) Order 2021 The deemed rate of return for taxing interests in foreign investment funds is 4.43% for the 2020–21 income year, down from 5.05% for the previous income year. The deemed rate of return is set annually and is one of the methods that can be used to calculate income from foreign investment fund interests. The rate is based on taking an average of the five-year Government bond rate at the end of each quarter, plus a margin of four percentage points. The new rate was set by Order in Council on 14 June 2021 and came into force on 18 June 2021. COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payments Scheme (July 2021) Order 2021 The COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payments Scheme (July 2021) Order 2021 came into force on 1 July 2021. This Order activated the COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payments Scheme. Background Section 7AAB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the TAA) authorises the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) to make grants under the COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payments Scheme (the Scheme) if there is a period of raised COVID-19 alert levels anywhere in New Zealand. In general, the Scheme will be activated when there is a period of 7 days or more at the raised alert levels. The intention of the Scheme is to provide for grants to be made to support businesses with expenses such as wages and fixed costs when there is an escalation in COVID-19 alert levels and a resulting reduction in revenue. Section 7AAC of the TAA is an empowering provision for the making of an Order in Council activating the Scheme, and determining the class of persons who can apply for the Scheme and the payment amount. A person may be eligible for a one-off payment each time the Scheme is activated. On 23 June 2021, COVID-19 alert levels in the Greater Wellington region were raised to level 2. This escalation lasted 7 days, triggering the activation of the Scheme. The Greater Wellington region returned to alert level 1 at 11:59pm on 29 June 2021. The COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payments Scheme (July 2021) Order 2021 (the Order) came into force on 1 July 2021 activating the Scheme. The July Order continues the Scheme until 29 July 2021, which is the first working day that is at least one month after the Greater Wellington region returned to alert level 1. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 3 NEW LEGISLATION Class of persons covered The Order sets out the class of persons eligible for a grant. An eligible person must be one of: • • an individual who is self-employed • • a body corporate or an unincorporated body • • a registered charity • • an incorporated society • • a post-settlement governance entity • • a trust • • a partnership (as defined in sections 8 and 9 of the Partnership Law Act 2019) • • any department or organisation in the State services (as defined in section 5 of the Public Service Act 2020) that is approved by the Minister of Finance as a participant in the Scheme • • a non-government organisation • • a pre-revenue firm; or • • a joint venture. The person must be living in New Zealand, or if a non-natural person, registered or otherwise established in New Zealand. The person may be entitled to receive a grant of money under the Scheme if they experience a minimum 30% revenue decline when comparing a consecutive 7-day period that reflects the typical revenue for that business in the six weeks prior to the escalation in alert levels with a consecutive 7-day period that anywhere in New Zealand was at alert level 2 or above. The person must apply this revenue decline test in accordance with the eligibility criteria set by the Commissioner. If the person is part of a commonly owned group this 30% decrease also needs to be satisfied across the group as a whole. In previous activations of the Scheme, commonly owned groups made one group application. In respect of the July activation, the Order allows individual group members to apply provided the eligibility criteria are satisfied. The person and the commonly owned group must use the same date ranges for their affected revenue and comparator periods In this context, commonly owned group has the meaning described in eligibility criteria set by the Commissioner (https://www.ird.govt.nz/covid-19/business-and-organisations/resurgence-support-payment/eligibility). To qualify for a grant under the Order, the 7-day period used to demonstrate a decline in revenue must be between 23 June to 29 June 2021 (both dates inclusive). Further eligibility requirements have been set out by the Commissioner under section 7AAB(3) of the TAA and are published on the Inland Revenue website https://www.ird.govt.nz/covid-19/business-and-organisations/resurgence-support-payment/eligibility. Amount of the grant The Order sets out the amount of the payment that a person will be entitled to as the lesser of: • • $1,500 plus $400 for each full-time equivalent worker employed by the person (up to a maximum of 50 full-time equivalent workers); or • • 4 times the amount by which the eligible person’s revenue has declined. Applications Applications in response to the COVID-19 alert level escalation opened on 1 July 2021 and may be submitted via MyIR until 11:59pm on 29 July 2021. Further procedural requirements in relation to the making of an application have been set out by the Commissioner under section 7AAB(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and are published on the Inland Revenue website https://www.ird.govt.nz/covid-19/business-and-organisations/resurgence-support-payment/apply.

The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates their tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see Binding rulings: How to get certainty on the tax position of your transaction (IR715). You can download this publication free from our website at www.ird.govt.nz BINDING RULINGS BR Pub 21/03: Goods and services tax – debt factoring arrangements This is a public ruling made under s 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation laws This Ruling applies in respect of ss 20(3)(i) and 26. The arrangement to which this Ruling applies The arrangement is the sale, by a GST registered person (the Assignor), to a third party (the Factor), on a recourse or non- recourse basis, of an outstanding debt at a price less than the debt’s face value. How the taxation laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • • The difference between the face value of the debt and the price received from the Factor is not a bad debt for the purposes of s 26. Accordingly, s 26 has no application and the registered person cannot claim an input tax deduction under s 20(3)(i); and • • If a portion of a debt is written-off before it is sold to the Factor, then whether this write-off meets the requirements of s 26(1) depends on whether the amount written off was “bad” according to the conventional tests as outlined in Public Ruling “BR Pub 18/07: Income tax and goods and services tax – writing off debts as bad” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 30, No 9 (October 2018) (BR Pub 18/07). The period or tax year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for an indefinite period beginning on 10 August 2021. This Ruling is signed by me on 17 June 2021. Susan Price Group Leader, Public Advice and Guidance Tax Counsel Office Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 5 BINDING RULINGS Commentary on Public Ruling BR Pub 21/03 This commentary is not a legally binding statement. The commentary is intended to help readers understand and apply the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 21/03 (“the Ruling”). Summary 1. When a registered person factors a debt owing for less than its face value, the issue arises whether the difference between the face value of the debt and the amount received from the Factor can be an amount “written off as a bad debt” under s 26(1). 2. The Commissioner considers that the difference between the face value of the debt and the amount received from the Factor cannot be an amount written off as a bad debt under s 26(1) and consequently no deduction from output tax can be claimed under s 20(3)(i). Rather than being a bad debt, the discount from face value is simply a result of the process of agreeing the consideration for the debt that is acceptable to both the Assignor and the Factor. 3. Whether a debt is written off as “bad” under s 26(1) depends on the application of the tests outlined in BR Pub 18/07. Background 4. BR Pub 21/03 is a reissue of BR Pub 06/01. This Ruling is essentially the same as BR Pub 06/01, which applied indefinitely from 1 August 2005. BR Pub 06/01 is withdrawn and this Ruling is reissued with updated legislative references and a refreshed commentary. 5. Sections 26 and 20(3)(i) of the GSTA allow a registered person to make a deduction from output tax if the registered person has made a taxable supply, returned output tax in respect of that taxable supply, and subsequently written off as a bad debt, all or part of the debt. 6. If a registered person factors (i.e. sells) a debt owing for less than its face value to a third party (the Factor), the issue arises whether the difference between the face value of the debt and the amount received from the Factor can be an amount written off as a bad debt. 7. A debt can be factored either on a recourse basis or on a non-recourse basis. Debt factoring on a non-recourse basis means that the Factor has no claim back to the Assignor if the debts sold to them become doubtful or uncollectable (i.e. the Factor assumes all of the risk). In contrast, debt factoring on a recourse basis means that the Factor has some form of claim back to the Assignor if the debts sold to them prove to be doubtful or uncollectible. 8. Historically, debt factoring was dealt with in PIB No 164 (August 1987) “GST and debt collection agencies – debt factoring” and in Technical Rulings paragraph 104.9.4 under an identical heading. Those statements concluded that if a registered person accounting for GST on an invoice basis subsequently sold a debt for less than its face value, the Commissioner would allow the registered person a bad debt deduction under s 26 for the difference between the debt’s face value and the sale proceeds. The inference being that the difference between the two amounts was a bad debt. 9. At that time, a person accounting for GST on an invoice basis was required to return GST on the full amount from the sale of goods or services at the time of supply, whereas a person accounting for GST on a payments basis was only required to return GST on the discounted amount received on the sale of the debt. The policy set out in PIB No 164 and Technical Rulings paragraph 104.9.4 addressed the mismatch of GST treatments between the two accounting bases under the GSTA. 10. Barber DJ in Case T27 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,188, however, reached a different conclusion from that set out in PIB No 164 and Technical Rulings paragraph 104.9.4. In particular, the Taxation Review Authority concluded that if a registered person factors a debt owing for less than its face value, the difference between the face value of the debt and the amount received from the Factor is not a bad debt. 11. Consequently, Public Ruling “BR Pub 00/07: Debt factoring arrangements and GST” (BR Pub 00/07) was published in 2000, which confirmed that the Commissioner accepted the view of Barber DJ in Case T27. The Ruling changed and superseded the earlier policy set out in PIB No 164 and Technical Rulings paragraph 104.9.4. 12. Further, section 26A was enacted in 2000 to require a person accounting for GST on a payments basis to return GST on the remaining book value of a debt when it is factored. Section 26A, therefore, establishes parity between the two GST accounting bases. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 6 BINDING RULINGS 13. It is the Commissioner’s view that if a registered person factors a debt owing for less than its face value, the difference between the face value of the debt and the amount received from the Factor is not a bad debt. Accordingly, s 26 has no application, and a registered person cannot claim a deduction from output tax under s 20(3)(i). 14. BR Pub 00/07 was replaced by “BR Pub 06/01: Debt factoring arrangements” (BR Pub 06/01) and GST in 2006 after BR Pub 00/07 expired. Both Public Rulings are essentially the same. This Ruling replaces BR Pub 06/01. Application of the legislation 15. This part of the commentary will briefly discuss the GST consequences for an Assignor when a debt is factored. It will then set out the reasons why the price difference between the face value of the debt and the price received from the Factor is not a bad debt amount. GST consequences when a debt is factored 16. When a debt is factored for less than its face value, there are differences in the way the GSTA operates for an Assignor, depending on whether the Assignor accounts for GST on an invoice basis or a payments basis. Despite these differences, the outcome since the enactment of s 26A is the same for both accounting bases ie, the Assignor is required to pay output tax on the face value of the debt and cannot claim an input tax deduction for a bad debt write off simply by accepting a lesser value by factoring the debt. Invoice basis 17. A person registered to account for GST on an invoice basis is liable for output tax on the supply of goods or services at the time an invoice is issued. 18. The subsequent factoring of the debt from the Assignor to the Factor would be considered a financial service under s 3(1)(c), being a transfer of ownership of a debt security. It is, therefore, an exempt supply under s 14(1). 19. Consequently, for an Assignor accounting for GST on an invoice basis, no GST liability is incurred at the time the debt is factored. Payments basis 20. A registered person accounting for GST on a payments basis, who has not received a payment for the supply of goods or services, is not liable for GST output tax at the time the goods or services was originally supplied. 21. The subsequent factoring of the debt for less than its face value would not be considered a supply of “financial services” under s 3(1) because of s 3(4)(a). Section 3(4)(a) applies where, as a result of the transfer of a debt, no output tax for the supply would be attributable to a taxable period. This means an Assignor accounting for GST on a payments basis would be required to return GST on the amount received from the sale because s 3(4)(a) makes that transaction a taxable supply when it would otherwise have been a financial service. 22. Furthermore, s 26A specifically requires a person registered to account for GST on a payments basis to return GST on the remaining book value of the debt when the debt is factored. 23. Therefore, by virtue of ss 3(4)(a) and 26A, the full face value of the debt is considered a taxable supply and an Assignor accounting for GST on a payments basis is liable for GST on the full amount of the debt at the time the debt is factored. Bad debt deduction 24. Under s 26, a registered person can make a deduction under s 20(3)(i) if that person has: ••made a taxable supply for consideration; and ••furnished a return in relation to the taxable period during which the output tax on the supply was attributable and has properly accounted for the output tax on that supply as required under GSTA; and ••written off as a bad debt the whole or part of the consideration not paid to that person. 25. The amount that may be deducted is the same amount of GST charged as the amount written off bears to the total consideration for the supply. If the supply is the supply of goods under a hire purchase agreement, the proviso to s 26 limits the deduction to the portion of the amount written off as the cash price bears to the total amount payable under the hire purchase agreement. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 7 BINDING RULINGS 26. Section 26(1AB) specifies that a registered person accounting for GST on a payments basis can apply s 26 to the supplies to which s 9(2)(b) (door to door sales), s 9(3)(b) (hire purchase agreements), or s 26A (accounting for GST on the remaining book value of a factored debt) applies. 27. If a registered person factors a debt owing for less than its face value, the issue arises whether the difference between the face value of the debt and the amount received from the Factor can be an amount “written off as a bad debt”. 28. The term “bad debt” is not defined in the GSTA. Whether the debt is written off as “bad”, according to the requirements in s 26(1), depends on the application of the tests outlined in BR Pub 18/07: 29. BR Pub 18/07 confirms that a debt (or part of a debt) is a bad debt where: ••an existing debt is owing to the taxpayer; and ••the debt is adjudged as “bad” by a reasonably prudent commercial person who concluded that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid in whole or in part by the debtor or by anyone else; and ••the bad debt is “written off ” in accordance with the accounting and record keeping systems maintained by the taxpayer. The debt must exist 30. Cases indicate that before a debt can be written off, a debt must be in existence at the time the debt is written off (Budget Rent A Car Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,263 and GE Crane Sales Pty Ltd v FC of T 71 ATC 4268). Accordingly, for s 26 to apply, the registered person must be able to show that at the time of writing off the debt, a debt was then in existence. 31. In terms of non-recourse debt factoring, at the time the debt is sold, the debt between the registered person and debtor is extinguished and replaced with a separate and distinct debt between the Factor and debtor. In such situations no debt exists at the time the amount is written off, which will be after sale of the debt. Therefore, after the sale of the debt to the Factor, no further debt exists and according to both Budget Rent A Car Ltd and G E Crane Sales Pty Ltd no amount can be written off as a bad debt. 32. In terms of recourse debt factoring arrangements when a debt is sold by the Assignor on a recourse basis, the title to the debt passes to the Factor unless the Factor exercises a recourse option or right by which the debt can be transferred back to the Assignor. Therefore, until the recourse is exercised and the debt is transferred back, a bad debt deduction is not available under s 26(1), as after the sale there is no debt owed to the Assignor. 33. However, if the Factor exercises an option or right to transfer some portion of the debt back to the Assignor after the sale then, once this has occurred, a debt exists that is owed to the Assignor that may be able to be written off by the Assignor. Under s 26(1AA), s 26(1) applies if a registered person sells a debt and then reacquires it. Whether it can be written off depends on the application of the tests for determining whether a debt is bad in BR Pub 18/07. The debt must be “bad” 34. When assessing whether a bad debt exists, BR Pub 18/07 indicates that a debt is bad when a reasonably prudent commercial person would have concluded, based on the information available about the debtor’s ability to repay the debt, that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid. In the absence of such a circumstance, if a registered person chooses to sell a debt for below its face value, no bad debt exists and no deduction is available under s 20(3)(i). The debt must be “written off” 35. BR Pub 18/07 establishes that, to write-off a debt as bad under s 26(1), reasonable steps must be taken to determine whether that particular debt owed by that particular debtor is likely to be paid (Case P53 (1992) 14 NZTC 4370 and Budget Rent A Car v C of IR (1995) 17 NZTC 12263). 36. Writing-off a portion of debt on this basis involves seeking a deduction for the provision for doubtful debts. As noted in BR Pub 18/07, the GSTA does not allow a deduction for the provision for doubtful debts. Writing off the debt before sale to the Factor 37. In the past we have received submissions which noted that the issue of whether the discount to the Factor might be written off as a bad debt under s 26(1) would not arise if this amount were written off prior to the sale of the debt to the Factor. 38. The Commissioner agrees that this is the case. If a portion of a debt is written off before it is sold to the Factor, then whether the debt is written off as bad according to the requirements in s 26(1) depends on the application of the tests outlined in Public Ruling BR Pub 18/07. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 8 BINDING RULINGS 39. This could happen where the registered person sells its bad debts to a Factor whose core business is to purchase bad debts in bulk from various vendors for a small fraction of the bad debts’ face value. This is beneficial to both the Assignor, who is able to recover some money for the debt, and the Factor, who has the advantage of economies of scale to recover the debts that would otherwise be irrecoverable. 40. In these circumstances, the sale of the debt to the Factor will give rise to a full or partial recovery of the amount written off, and output tax will be payable by the Assignor on the portion of the debt recovered in the period when the amount is recovered under s 26(2). Conclusion 41. In conclusion, the Commissioner considers that the difference between the face value of the debt and the amount received from the Factor cannot be an amount written off as a bad debt under s 26. Rather than being a bad debt, the discount from face value is simply a result of the process of agreeing the consideration for the debt that is acceptable to both the Assignor and the Factor. The reasons for this view are: ••Cases considering the meaning of bad debt focus on whether the creditor can recover the outstanding amounts owing. That is, a bad debt arises when the creditor is unable or unlikely to recover the debt owing. If the creditor could recover the full amount owing but chooses not to (as in a debt factoring situation), any “loss” suffered by the creditor is not due to a bad debt. ••Cases also indicate that for an amount to be written off as a bad debt, a debt must exist at the time the debt is written off. If a registered person factors a debt, no further debt exists between the registered person and debtor, and no amount can be written off as a bad debt. However, if a debt has been sold and then reacquired, an input tax deduction may be available if the tests in BR Pub 18/07 are subsequently met. Examples 42. The following example illustrates the consequence of this ruling. Example 1 – Invoice basis VendorIn Co sells the debts relating to the sale of the widgets to Factor Co for $80. The sale of the debts to Factor Co is considered a “financial service” under s 3(1)(c) and it is, therefore, an exempt supply under s 14(1). At the time VendorIn Co sells the debts to Factor Co those debts were not “bad”. As such Vendor Co is not entitled to an input tax deduction under ss 26 and 20(3)(i). Example 2 – Payments basis VendorPay Co accounts for GST on a payments basis. It sells 100 widgets to its customers for $100 on a buy now, pay later basis. VendorPay Co has no output tax on the sale of the 100 widgets because it has not received a payment for the sale. VendorPay Co sells the debts relating to the sale of the widgets to Factor Co for $80. The sale of the debts to Factor Co is excluded from being a “financial service” under s 3(4)(a). Therefore, VendorPay Co is required to pay output tax on the $80 received from Factor Co. Further, s 26A requires VendorPay Co to account for output tax on the remaining book value of the debt of $20. Consequently, VendorPay Co is required to pay output tax on the full value of the debt of $100 at the time it sells its debts to Factor Co. At the time VendorPay Co sells the debts to Factor Co those debts were not “bad”. As such VendorPay Co is not entitled to an input tax deduction under ss 26 and 20(3)(i).

This is a notice of withdrawal of a public ruling made under section 91DE of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 2. Public Ruling BR Pub 06/01 – Debt factoring arrangements and GST applies from 1 August 2005 for an indefinite period. 3. Public Ruling BR Pub 06/01 is withdrawn on 9 August 2021. BR Pub 06/01 is being withdrawn because it contains an incorrect section reference. Further, BR Pub 06/01 only applies to persons who account for GST on an invoice basis, due to inconsistencies in the law between invoice and payments basis when the public ruling was originally issued. Changes in the law have meant that these inconsistencies no longer exist so it is possible to issue a ruling to cover both invoice and payments basis persons. BR Pub 06/01 applies up to, and including, 9 August 2021. A new replacement public ruling, BR Pub 21/03 – Debt factoring arrangements and GST is being published with effect from 10 August 2021. In addition to correcting the section reference, the ruling has been updated so that it applies to persons accounting for GST on both invoice and payments basis.

Susan Price Group Leader – Public Advice and Guidance Tax Counsel Office Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 12 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT Operational statements set out the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s view of the law in respect of the matter discussed and deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. OPERATIONAL STATEMENT OS 21/02: Administration of the imported mismatch rule – section FH 11 Introduction 1. The imported mismatch rule in s FH 11 is one of the hybrid mismatch rules introduced as subpart FH with effect for income years beginning on and after 1 July 2018. Section FH 11 is discussed in detail in Tax Information Bulletin Vol. 31, No. 3 (April 2019) from page 74. 2. The purpose of the imported mismatch rule is to deny a deduction for a payment by a New Zealand taxpayer to the extent that that payment funds, directly or indirectly, a hybrid mismatch occurring entirely outside New Zealand, if certain requirements are met. This Statement sets out the Commissioner’s approach to administering the imported mismatch rule. 3. This Statement is not intended to provide a safe harbour. Compliance with the Statement does not guarantee that there will be no deductions disallowed under s FH 11. However, compliance with the Statement will reduce the likelihood of lack of reasonable care penalties being imposed where an imported mismatch is later found to exist. Summary of approach 4. Where a taxpayer makes a deductible payment to a person who is resident in a country that does not have hybrid mismatch rules corresponding to those in subpart FH, they are expected to take certain steps in order to ensure compliance with the imported mismatch rule contained in the section. 5. This Statement deals with payments that are made to a person who is in the same group as the taxpayer. Where the steps required by the Commissioner, as explained in \[13\] are taken a taxpayer will have complied with their self-assessment obligations under s FH 11. 6. Where the appropriate steps are not taken the Commissioner may require evidence of the taxpayer’s compliance with s FH 11. Where evidence is not provided in a timely manner, this may result in a denial of the relevant deductions in New Zealand, and in the taxpayer being unable to present such evidence subsequently in a dispute. Application of the statement 7. This Operational Statement applies to all arrangements referred to in s FH 11 and applies from the 2021 income year. Discussion Criteria 8. The criteria for the application of s FH 11 are as follows: 1. A New Zealand resident taxpayer or a New Zealand deducting branch (funder) makes a payment in an income year, 2. To a person in a country outside New Zealand that is not subject to hybrid rules equivalent to those in New Zealand in relation to that payment, 3. The funder is allowed a deduction in New Zealand for the payment, 4. The payment provides funds, directly or indirectly, for a payment (funded payment) by a person outside New Zealand (payer) to another person (payee), and 5. The funded payment gives rise to a hybrid mismatch that is not counteracted by hybrid mismatch rules. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 13 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT 9. The imported mismatch rule applies to payments to third parties (but only if there is a structured arrangement) and payments to control group members (whether or not the arrangement is a structured arrangement). The rule applies to structured arrangements in income years commencing on or after 1 July 2018 and non-structured arrangements in income years commencing on or after 1 January 2020. 10. Compliance with the imported mismatch rule requires New Zealand resident taxpayers and New Zealand deducting branches to have knowledge of the tax treatment of payments that are made entirely outside of New Zealand. This requires them to obtain information from persons outside New Zealand. 11. The following is an outline of the approach that the Commissioner expects taxpayers to take to ensure they are complying with the imported mismatch rule in relation to payments to control group members. If this approach is not taken, taxpayers risk having deductions denied. Determining whether adjustments required 12. In accordance with s FH 11, if a New Zealand taxpayer funds a hybrid mismatch that occurs outside New Zealand an adjustment denying a deduction for some or all of the payments made by the New Zealand taxpayer is required to reflect the amount of the hybrid mismatch that has been funded by the payment from New Zealand. This will require the New Zealand taxpayer to have access to information relating to the offshore tax treatment of payments made outside New Zealand. Particularly in the case of a group whose headquarters are outside New Zealand, New Zealand’s tax reporting will be relying on people outside of New Zealand being able to provide information on whether or not hybrid mismatches exist. These hybrid mismatches can occur, directly or indirectly, as part of structured transactions or unstructured transactions within control groups. 13. To comply with their self-assessment obligations under s FH 11 in respect of payments to control group members, the Commissioner expects that New Zealand taxpayers will: 1. Identify payments made to non-resident control group members that are tax deductible before applying the imported mismatch rule, 2. Determine whether any such payments are to a person that is in a jurisdiction that has not implemented hybrid mismatch rules equivalent to New Zealand’s, and 3. If the answer to 2 is yes, before claiming a deduction ensure that the group head office tax function has undertaken appropriate work to: ••identify any hybrid mismatches within the group; and ••determine the extent to which these are funded by otherwise deductible payments from New Zealand payers. 14. If the taxpayer is part of a group headquartered in: ••New Zealand, the work referred to in step 3 will generally be taken by group employees in New Zealand, or at their direction ••another country, the work referred to in step 3 may well be undertaken by group employees outside New Zealand. In that case, the Commissioner expects that the taxpayer will obtain from the group’s head office tax function a written statement regarding that work. 15. For tax years beginning before 1 January 2020, in which only the structured imported mismatch applies, enquiries by the group head office tax function may be limited to those necessary to determine whether there is or are, in relation to all transactions that are part of a structured arrangement involving the otherwise deductible payment by the New Zealand taxpayer, pricing or other facts or circumstances which mean that a member of the control group could reasonably be aware of the existence of the hybrid mismatch. For later tax years, this limitation does not apply. 16. In the case of a group that is not headquartered in New Zealand, if the steps taken by the group’s head office tax function and communicated to the New Zealand taxpayer can reasonably be expected to accurately determine the extent, if any, of the application of the imported hybrid mismatch rule, and the taxpayer has no reason to believe that the determination is not correct, then the taxpayer has complied with its self-assessment obligations with respect to the rule. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 14 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT 17. There is no prescribed form for such a statement, but an example is provided below of the type of statement the Commissioner would expect to be provided, addressed from the Group Head of Tax to the relevant New Zealand personnel: “I have ensured that suitably qualified personnel within the group have reviewed the tax treatment of all deductible cross-border payments by members of the group to determine whether they give rise to a hybrid mismatch. As a result of this review I can advise that \[if no hybrid mismatches funded by New Zealand\] \[New Zealand subsidiary/deducting branch\] payments have not funded directly or indirectly any such mismatches; \[Or, if there are hybrid mismatches funded by New Zealand\] \[New Zealand subsidiary/deducting branch\] payments totalling $\[. \] have funded directly or indirectly such mismatches; In undertaking this review and making this determination, the principles set out in the OECD Final Report on hybrid mismatches and/or section FH 11 of the New Zealand Income Tax Act 2007 have been considered and complied with.”   No Evidence Obtained 18. Where a New Zealand taxpayer has: ••Claimed a deduction for payments to non-resident control group members in countries without hybrid rules corresponding to subpart FH, and ••In the case of a taxpayer that is a member of a foreign headquartered group, received no statement from its group head office tax function as set out above, ••In the case of a taxpayer that is a member of a New Zealand headquartered group, does not have evidence that the possible application of section FH 11 has been appropriately considered and analysed. then the Commissioner may request from the New Zealand taxpayer, under s 17B of the Tax Administration Act (TAA), such a statement, or other evidence that the imported hybrid mismatch rule has been considered. 19. If a satisfactory response is not provided within 3 months the Commissioner may apply s 17F of the TAA to deny relevant deductions claimed in New Zealand, and, if proper notice is given, apply the evidence exclusion rule in s 17F(3) of the TAA. This Statement was signed on 30 June 2021. Rob Falk National Advisor, Technical Standards, Legal Services Legislative references Income Tax Act 2007 Section FH 11 Section FH 15 Tax Administration Act 1994 Section 17B Section 17F Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 15 INTERPRETATION STATEMENT This section of the TIB contains interpretation statements issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. These statements set out the Commissioner's view on how the law applies to a particular set of circumstances when it is either not possible or not appropriate to issue a binding public ruling. In most cases Inland Revenue will assess taxpayers in line with the following interpretation statements. However, our statutory duty is to make correct assessments, so we may not necessarily assess taxpayers on the basis of earlier advice if at the time of the assessment we consider that the earlier advice is not consistent with the law. INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS IS 21/05: Non-cash dividends Introduction 1. This Interpretation Statement considers when a non-cash transfer of company value from a company to a shareholder is treated as a dividend for tax purposes (often referred to as a deemed dividend). It focuses on the types of transactions that are entered into between small and medium-sized companies and their shareholders. 2. The Interpretation Statement first discusses the general rules for determining when a non-cash dividend will arise and provides some simple examples to assist readers to understand the concepts. It then summarises the more complex rules for calculating the amount of a dividend in different situations, also with examples. 3. This Interpretation Statement is intended to raise awareness of when simple non-cash transactions will give rise to dividends. It does not consider the more complex rules relating to share repurchases, statutory producer boards, co- operative companies, foreign unit trusts, superannuation schemes, share-lending arrangements or emigrating companies. It also does not consider the rules relating to dividends arising within groups of companies. 4. In addition, the payment of a cash or non-cash dividend gives rise to a number of administrative obligations, including disclosures, requirements to provide dividend statements and withholding tax obligations. These obligations are not discussed in this Interpretation Statement. However, taxpayers should be aware that these obligations exist and seek further advice on how to comply with them. Interaction with other rules 5. Non-cash transfers of value from a company to a person can arise for a number of reasons. In particular, a company may transfer value to a person because: ••they are, or are associated with, an employee of the company, as compensation for the employee’s services; or ••they are, or are associated with, a shareholder of the company. In the case of small and medium sized enterprises it is often the case that people involved in the company are both employees and shareholders. 6. Because transfers of value can be caused for various reasons, the first question to ask in determining the tax treatment of the transfer is – what is the reason for the transfer? 7. Where the transfer of value is caused by an employment relationship, the transfer will usually be taxed either as employment income, or as a fringe benefit. Employment income is usually paid in cash but can also include some non-cash benefits, including the provision of accommodation. This is discussed in more detail from \[50\]. A fringe benefit is a non-cash benefit an employer provides to an employee in connection with their employment. This is discussed in more detail from \[54\]. 8. Where a transfer of value is caused by an employment relationship it will, usually, not be a dividend. However, in some cases where the non-cash benefit is provided to an employee who is also a shareholder, the fringe benefit rules either require that the benefit be treated as a dividend and not as a fringe benefit, or allow the company to choose whether to treat the benefit as a fringe benefit or a dividend. These situations are discussed at \[57\]. 9. Where the transfer of value is not caused by an employment relationship, or the fringe benefit rules allow the company to choose, or require the company to treat the transfer as a dividend, the dividend rules become relevant. These situations are the focus of this Interpretation Statement. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 16 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 10. This process of determining which tax rules apply to a transfer of value is illustrated by the following graphic: Amounts that are a dividend 11. Subpart CD describes what is and is not a dividend. Under s CD 4, a dividend is a transfer of company value from a company to a person, if: ••the cause of the transfer is a shareholding in the company; and ••none of the exclusions in subpart CD apply. 12. This statement focuses on the provision of non-cash dividends. 13. The following flow-chart illustrates how to determine whether a non-cash dividend has been paid: Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 17 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Transfers of company value 14. Section CD 5 defines a “transfer of company value” for the purpose of the dividend rules in subpart CD. Under s CD 5(1) a transfer of company value from a company to a person will occur when: ••the company provides money or money’s worth to the person; and ••if the person provides money or money’s worth to the company in exchange, the market value of what the company provides is more than the market value of what the person provides. 15. Case law indicates that the expression “money or money’s worth” requires that a benefit be in money or be convertible into money, either directly or indirectly (Tennant v Smith (1892) 3 TC 158 (HL), Stagg v CIR \[1959\] NZLR 1,252 (HC), Abbott v Philbin (Inspector of Taxes) \[1960\] 2 All ER 763 (HL), Heaton (Inspector of Taxes) v Bell \[1969\] 2 All ER 70 (HL) and Dawson v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,252 (SC)). A benefit will be directly convertible into money where the benefit can be exchanged for a monetary equivalent (Dawson at 61,257). For example, shares that are capable of being sold for money will be money’s worth. Non-cash dividends are transfers of money’s worth from a company to a shareholder. 16. The remainder of s CD 5 clarifies whether money’s worth arises in four situations. 17. First, money’s worth is provided by a company to a person where the person is released from repaying a debt to the company, either by agreement or by operation of law (unless the company and the person are part of the same wholly- owned group) (s CD 5(2)). This means a dividend may arise if a company releases a shareholder from repaying a debt. 18. Secondly, money’s worth is not provided by a person to a company on the cancellation of a share the person holds or the cancellation of the person’s rights as a shareholder (s CD 5(2B)). This section means that in cases where a transfer of money or money’s worth from the company to a shareholder occurs on the cancellation of a share, the shareholder is deemed to provide nothing in return. This may be a dividend. 19. Thirdly, money’s worth is not provided by a company to a person where the company provides services to the person (s CD 5(3)). This means a dividend will not arise simply because a company provides services that it ordinarily provides as part of its business to a shareholder for less than market consideration. “Services” are anything that is not goods, money or a chose in action (a chose in action includes the right to use property). 20. And fourthly, money’s worth is provided by a company to a person if the company is a close company and the company provides services consisting of the benefit of expenditure by the company to the person (s CD 5(4)). This means, where a company is a close company and the company incurs expenditure on behalf of a shareholder, a dividend may arise. A close company is generally a company with five or fewer natural persons or trustees whose total voting interest in the company is more than 50% (treating all natural persons associated at the time as one person). 21. Example 1 to Example 5 illustrate when a transfer of company value occurs under the provisions discussed above. The examples show when a transfer of company value occurs. How the transfer of company value is taxed (for example, whether as a dividend or under the fringe benefit tax (FBT) regime) is considered below. Example 1 – Simple transfer of company value Hannah is a shareholder in Hannah’s Bananas Ltd. In the 2020 income year, Hannah’s Bananas Ltd provides Hannah with a lot of fresh bananas. Hannah’s Bananas Ltd has provided money’s worth to Hannah. Hannah has not provided any money or money’s worth to Hannah’s Bananas Ltd. Therefore, there is a transfer of company value from Hannah’s Bananas Ltd to Hannah. Example 2 – Release from repayment of a debt Ike is a shareholder in Ike’s Bikes Ltd. Ike’s current account is overdrawn by $100. In the 2021 income year, Ike’s Bikes Ltd agrees to release Ike from having to repay the current account debt. By releasing Ike from the obligation to repay the current account debt, Ike’s Bikes Ltd has provided money’s worth to Ike under s CD 5(2). Ike has not provided any money or money’s worth to Ike’s Bikes Ltd. Therefore, there is a transfer of company value from Ike’s Bikes Ltd to Ike. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 18 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Example 3 – Cancellation of shares Fiona is a shareholder in Fiona’s Feijoas Ltd. Fiona’s Feijoas Ltd buys back Fiona’s shares for $100. In buying back Fiona’s shares, Fiona’s Feijoas Ltd has transferred value to Fiona. Under s CD 5(2B), Fiona has not transferred any value to Fiona’s Feijoas Ltd by giving up her interest in the shares. Therefore, Fiona’s Feijoas Ltd has transferred value to Fiona. Note: This example does not consider whether the share repurchase will give rise to a dividend. The rules for determining whether a share repurchase will result in a dividend are in ss CD 22 to CD 25. Generally, an amount will not be a dividend to the extent to which it is equal to or less than the available subscribed capital per share, provided various bright-line tests are met and the payment is not in lieu of a dividend. Example 4 – Provision of services Cam is a shareholder in Cam’s Coms Ltd, which is a widely held company. Cam’s Coms Ltd provides telecommunication services. Cam’s Coms Ltd provides Cam its telecommunication services for free. Under s CD 5(3), the provision of the telecommunication services by Cam’s Coms Ltd to Cam is not money’s worth. Therefore, the provision of these services at an undervalue will not give rise to a transfer of company value. Example 5 – Provision of services in a close company Mel is a shareholder in Mel’s Mowing Ltd. Mel’s Mowing Ltd is a close company. Mel’s Mowing Ltd pays for Mel’s personal car to be cleaned at a cost of $50. By incurring expenditure that gives rise to a benefit to Mel, Mel’s Mowing Ltd has provided money’s worth to Mel under s CD 5(4). Therefore, the expenditure on cleaning Mel’s personal car gives rise to a transfer of company value from Mel’s Mowing Ltd to Mel. Caused by a shareholding 22. Under s CD 6, a transfer of company value will be caused by a shareholding where: ••the recipient is a shareholder in the company or is associated with a shareholder in the company; and ••the company makes the transfer because of that shareholding. 23. One indication that a transfer is caused by a shareholding is if the terms of the arrangement that results in the transfer are different from the terms on which the company would enter into a similar arrangement if no shareholding were involved (s CD 6(2), Case V9 (2001) 20 NZTC, 10,101 (TRA) and Campbell v CIR \[1968\] NZLR 1 (HC)). 24. As discussed above, if the transfer of value is caused by an employment relationship and is not caused by the person’s shareholding in the company, then it will not be a dividend. Instead, the benefit will be subject to the employment income or fringe benefit rules. Where a person is both a shareholder and an employee, one indication that the transfer of value is not caused by the shareholding may be that the person is the only shareholder who received a transfer of value. 25. The following examples explain when a dividend will be caused by a shareholding. Example 6 – Dividend caused by a shareholding – distribution of goods Grant is a shareholder in Grant’s Plants Ltd. He is not an employee. During the 2020 income year, Grant acquires an inner-city apartment and as part of furnishing it, uses an extensive selection of plants from Grant’s Plants Ltd. The distribution of plants is a transfer of company value from Grant’s Plants Ltd to Grant. Grant’s Plants Ltd would not have given its plants to Grant if Grant was not a shareholder in the company. Therefore, the transfer of company value is caused by the shareholding. Example 7 – Dividend caused by a shareholding – private use of assets Pat is a shareholder in Pat’s Pears Ltd. Pat’s Pears Ltd allows Pat to use one of its vehicles for his private purposes (Pat is not an employee of Pat’s Pears Limited). Pat does not make any payment to Pat’s Pears Ltd in exchange for the use of the vehicle. Pat’s Pears Ltd has transferred value to Pat by allowing him to use one of its vehicles without requiring any payment in exchange. Pat’s Pears Ltd would not allow a person unconnected with the company to use its vehicles. Pat’s only connection with the company is his shareholding. Therefore, the transfer of company value is caused by the shareholding. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 19 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Example 8 – Dividend not caused by a shareholding Linda is a shareholder in Linda’s Lamingtons Ltd. She is not an employee. Linda’s Lamingtons Ltd has a sale and sells its products at a discounted price. Linda purchases some discounted products in the sale. Linda’s Lamingtons Ltd has provided money’s worth to Linda because it has sold Linda goods at an undervalue. However, the transfer of value is not caused by the shareholding. This is because the same discounts are offered to all of Linda’s Lamingtons Ltd’s customers. Example 9 – Dividend paid to an associate Angel’s Family Trust owns all the shares in Angel’s Antiques Ltd. Angel is a settlor, trustee and beneficiary of Angel’s Family Trust. Angel is not an employee of Angel’s Antiques Ltd. Angel’s Antiques Ltd gives Angel a valuable antique from its store. The gift of the valuable antique is a transfer of company value from Angel’s Antiques Ltd to Angel. While Angel is not a shareholder of Angel’s Antiques Ltd, she is associated with the sole shareholder, Angel’s Family Trust. Angel’s Antiques Ltd would not have given Angel the antique if she was not associated with a shareholder. Therefore, the transfer of company value is caused by a shareholding. Specific transactions that are treated as dividends 26. As well as defining a dividend in general terms, subpart CD also specifies types of transactions that will give rise to dividends: ••Making a bonus issue in lieu (s CD 7) – being an arrangement where shareholders of a company are given an election as to whether to receive a bonus issue of shares for no consideration, or money or other money’s worth. ••Issuing a share under a profit distribution plan (s CD 7B) – being a scheme where a company notifies shareholders that shares are to be issued and gives the shareholders an option to have some or all of the shares repurchased by the company (other than the issue of shares under an employee share scheme or a share repurchase scheme). ••Making a taxable bonus issue (s CD 8) – being a bonus issue fully paid from reserves that the company chooses to treat as a dividend. ••Dividends arising under specific avoidance provisions (s CD 11) – being: –Where shares are disposed of in substitution for a dividend (that is, dividend stripping arrangements) (s GB 1); –Where the company employs a relative of a director or shareholder to provide services, and the Commissioner considers the income payable to the relative is excessive (s GB 23); or –Where a close company provides remuneration for services to a shareholder, director, or relative of a shareholder or director who is not an adult employed substantially full-time in the business who participates in the management or administration of the company, and the Commissioner considers the remuneration is excessive (s GB 25). Sections GB 23 and GB 25 concerning excessive payments are considered in “QB 14/09: Income tax – meaning of ‘excessive remuneration’ and ‘excessive profits or losses’ paid or allocated to relatives, partners, shareholders or directors”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 26, No 9 (1 October 2014): 22. ••Providing non-cash benefits to shareholders (s CD 20) – being: –unclassified benefits provided to employee shareholders that the company chooses to treat as a dividend; and –non-cash benefits provided to a non–executive director who is a shareholder of the company. The treatment of non-cash benefits that are fringe benefits is discussed from \[54\]. Specific transactions that are not treated as dividends 27. The final requirement in determining whether an amount is a dividend is to determine whether the amount is specifically excluded from being a dividend under ss CD 22 to CD 37. 28. This Interpretation Statement does not consider all of the situations in which an amount will not be a dividend. However, in the context of the scenarios covered by this item, the most common exclusion that will apply is the exclusion for a transfer of value that is treated as a fringe benefit (s CD 32), which is discussed further from \[54\]. 29. Subpart CD also confirms that transactions that will not give rise to dividends include: ••non-taxable bonus issues (s CD 29); and ••a flat-owning company making residential property available to a person (s CD 31). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 20 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 30. For completeness, other transactions that also do not give rise to dividends are: ••share repurchases (ss CD 22 to CD 25). ••capital distributions on liquidation or emigration (ss CD 26); and ••transactions within a group of companies (ss CD 27 and CD 28). 31. Further consideration of these provisions is outside the scope of this Interpretation Statement. Calculating the amount of a dividend General rule 32. Under s CD 38, the amount of a dividend is calculated using the formula: value from company – value from person 33. The “value from the company” is the market value of the money or money’s worth that the company provides to the person. The “value from the person” is the market value of the money or money’s worth, if any, that the person provides to the company in exchange. This excludes any amount attributable to holding or giving up rights as a shareholder in the company. This is shown in Example 10. Example 10 – Value of the dividend Jon is a shareholder in Jon’s Scones Ltd. Jon’s Scones Ltd has recently replaced one of its ovens. Jon thinks the old oven would be useful in his refurbished farmhouse. Jon takes the oven for his own personal purposes. Jon gives Jon’s Scones Ltd $50 for the second-hand oven when its market value is $500. Jon’s Scones Ltd has provided value of $500. Jon has provided value of $50. Therefore, the value of the dividend is $450 (being $500 less $50). 34. Generally, a dividend will be treated as having been paid on the date the transfer of value arises. Making property available 35. Specific rules also apply to calculate the amount of a dividend where a company makes property available to a person (s CD 39). A company makes property available to a shareholder when the company allows the shareholder to use property that the company owns for the shareholder’s private purposes. As noted at \[19\], the right to use property is a chose in action and, therefore, is not a “service” as defined. It could be argued that a company provides a “service” to a shareholder by allowing them to use its property, which is excluded from being a transfer of value under s CD 5(3). However, the Commissioner considers the better view is that, by allowing a shareholder to use property that the company owns, the company is providing the shareholder with a right to use property, which is a chose and action, and not a service. This view is more consistent with the fact that the Act includes rules for calculating the amount of a dividend where a shareholder uses a company’s property. 36. Under these rules, the amount of the dividend is calculated for each quarter during which the property is made available. The dividend is treated as being paid six months after the end of the company’s income year, unless the company gives the shareholder earlier notice of the amount of the dividend. 37. Where the property is not a loan, the amount of the dividend for each quarter is the value of the fringe benefit that would arise under the fringe benefit rules if the benefit was provided to an employee. Example 11 illustrates this. Example 11 – Making property available Cath is a shareholder in Cath’s Cabin Ltd. Cath is not an employee of Cath’s Cabins Ltd. Cath’s Cabin Ltd owns a holiday home that it rents out on Airbnb for $400 per night. Cath uses the holiday home for her own personal benefit for three nights. Cath pays $50 per night. The amount of the dividend is the value of the fringe benefit that would arise under the fringe benefit rules if the benefit was provided to an employee. Under s RD 41, the value of the fringe benefit is the price ordinarily charged by Cath’s Cabin Ltd as part of its business. Under s RD 54, the value of the benefit is reduced by the amount Cath paid. Therefore, the amount of the dividend in this example is $1,050 (being $400 less $50 ($350) per night for three nights). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 21 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 38. Where the property is a loan, the amount of the dividend for each quarter can be calculated in two ways. The amount is either the difference between: ••the benchmark rate and the actual amount of interest accruing on the loan; or ••the benchmark rate and the amount of income accruing to the company in the quarter calculated under the yield to maturity method. 39. The “benchmark rate” is the interest calculated for the quarter on the daily balance of the loan calculated as: ••where all amounts are expressed in New Zealand dollars, and the company notifies the Commissioner when it files its tax return, the prescribed rate of interest declared by regulations; or ••where all amounts are expressed in a single currency other than New Zealand dollars, and the company notifies the Commissioner when it files its tax return, the benchmark rate the Commissioner set for that currency (if any); or ••in all other cases, a market rate determined at the end of the quarter for a loan made on the same terms between persons at arm’s length. 40. Example 12 shows how a simple dividend is calculated under an interest-free loan. Example 12 – Interest-free loan Kiri is a shareholder in Kiri’s Construction Ltd. She is not an employee. Kiri borrows NZ$1,000, interest free, from Kiri’s Construction Ltd. Kiri is deemed to have received a dividend equal to the difference between the benchmark rate and the actual amount of interest accruing on the loan. Kiri decides to rely on the prescribed rate of interest declared by regulation rather than determining what a market value for a loan of this type would be. From 1 July 2020, the prescribed interest rate is 4.5%. For the quarter 1 July 2020 to 30 September 2020, the amount of the non-cash dividend is: Non-cash dividend = Outstanding loan x interest rate x days in quarter 365 Non-cash dividend = $1,000 x 4.5% x 92 365 Non-cash dividend = $11.34 41. In calculating the daily balance of the loan, an amount repaid during the tax year is treated as having been applied in repayment of the loan on the later of the start of the company’s tax year or the day the loan was made, if: ••the amount is repaid by applying salary, wages, extra pay, dividends or interest payable by the company to the borrower; ••the amount payable by the company is income of the borrower in the tax year or an earlier tax year; and ••the amount payable by the company is payable without any amount of tax being withheld under the PAYE, resident withholding tax or non-resident withholding tax rules, or is a fully imputed dividend. 42. Example 13 shows how the timing rule works for dividends applied in repaying loans. Example 13 – Repayment of a loan Michelle is a shareholder in Michelle’s Marvellous Muffins Ltd. During the 2020 income year, Michelle borrows NZ$1,000, interest free, from Michelle’s Marvellous Muffins Ltd. In the same year, Michelle’s Marvellous Muffins Ltd pays Michelle a fully imputed dividend of $200 (gross dividend of $277.78 including imputation credits of $77.78) that is applied to repay part of the loan. Because the repayment is made in the same year that the loan was provided, Michelle is treated as having made the repayment on the day the loan was originally made, and any dividend arising from the fact the loan was interest-free will reduce accordingly. Michelle’s Marvellous Muffins Ltd pays Michelle another fully imputed dividend of $200 in the 2022 income year that is also applied to repay part of the loan. Because the repayment is made in the income year after the loan was provided, the repayment is treated as being paid at the start of Michelle’s Marvellous Muffin’s 2022 tax year. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 22 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Imputation credits 43. A company may attach imputation credits to a dividend when it is paid (s OB 60). This is the case whether the dividend consists of money or money’s worth. However, the requirement that imputation credits be attached when the dividend is paid means an ordinary company cannot attach imputation credits retrospectively if it discovers that a non-cash dividend has arisen unintentionally. In determining when a non-cash dividend is paid it may be necessary to have regard to the calculation rules, which specify when a dividend is treated as having been paid in some situations (discussed above from \[32\]). 44. The benchmark dividend rules will apply where a company pays more than one dividend during any tax year (including a non-cash dividend). Under those rules the first dividend of the year is the benchmark dividend and the imputation ratio of all dividends paid during the year must match the benchmark dividend (s OB 61). This means that if an unimputed non- cash dividend is the first dividend paid in a tax year, no other dividends paid in that year can be imputed. 45. The benchmark dividend rule also requires that any dividend paid after the benchmark dividend that is not imputed at the same rate as the benchmark dividend (including a non-cash dividend), will result in a debit to the imputation credit account (s OB 61(5)). This will occur despite no imputation credits having been attached to the dividend. The debit is calculated based on the highest amount of imputation credits attached to any distribution during the year, such that it will arise whether the unimputed dividend is paid first, or subsequent to a fully imputed dividend. 46. The benchmark dividend rules can, however, be overridden if the company notifies the Commissioner by providing a ratio change declaration (IR 407) before paying any subsequent dividends, stating that the dividend is not part of an arrangement to obtain a tax advantage under ss GB 35 and GB 36 (s OB 61(6)). This declaration must be witnessed by a Justice of the Peace, solicitor, or other person authorised to take a statutory declaration. Recovered amounts 47. Calculation rules ensure the treatment of some dividends is reversed if the transaction is reversed. These rules apply where: ••a company recovers a dividend from a shareholder (s CD 40); ••a dividend arises because a person was released from an obligation to repay debt, and the debt is later repaid (s CD 41(1)); ••a dividend arises because a close company provided services consisting of the benefit of expenditure by the company to the person and the shareholders believe on reasonable grounds that the expenditure was only for the benefit of the company and the expenditure is later repaid (s CD 41(2)); ••a dividend arises because of a difference between the market value of the property provided by or to the company and the consideration paid for it (s CD 42), and: –the consideration paid was an amount the company considered was market value having taken reasonable steps to ascertain the market value; and –the recipient of the dividend later paid the company: ••additional consideration to reflect market value; or ••a refund of any excess consideration paid by the company. 48. In all cases, the Act ensures the recovered dividend and any imputation credits are disregarded for tax purposes, and a refund of any tax paid occurs. This is shown in Example 14. Example 14 – Recovered amounts Taniela is a shareholder in Taniela’s Tables Ltd. Taniela is not an employee of Taniela’s Tables Ltd. Taniela’s Tables pays a dividend to Taniela. However, after the dividend is paid the directors realise that the solvency test has been breached, and they claw back the dividend. Due to the clawing back of the dividend, the dividend is reversed under s CD 41. Dividends are not deductible 49. No specific provision in part D denies a deduction for a payment that is deemed a dividend to the recipient. However, the payment of a dividend to a shareholder is generally denied deductibility because it does not have any nexus with the derivation of income or carrying on a business as required by s DA 1. Case law confirms that a distinction exists between the expenses incurred in earning profits, which are deductible, and any post-profit distribution, which is non-deductible (Mersey Docks and Harbour Board v Lucas (1883) 8 AC 891, (1883) 2 TC 25 (HL)). Example 15 shows this. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 23 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Example 15 – Deductibility Dinesh is a shareholder in Dinesh’s Dinners Ltd. Dinesh is not an employee of Dinesh’s Dinners Ltd. Dinesh’s Dinners Ltd incurs $200 paying Dinesh’s private power and phone bills. This payment is discovered in a compliance review of Dinesh’s Dinners Ltd a couple of years later. The $200 of private expenditure that Dinesh’s Dinners Ltd paid is treated as a dividend for Dinesh, so the expenditure is not deductible for Dinesh’s Dinners Ltd. If a deduction had previously been taken for that expenditure it will be reversed as part of the review. Amounts that are not a dividend Employment income 50. As discussed above, where a shareholder or an associate of a shareholder is also an employee of the company and receives an amount as payment for services provided, that will not give rise to a dividend. This is because the money or money’s worth provided by the company to the person (the payment) is equal to the money or money’s worth provided by the person to the company (the services). In addition, even if there is a transfer of value, it will be caused by the employment relationship, and not by the shareholding. This is subject to the avoidance rules for excessive payments made to relatives, shareholders or directors (under s CD 11), discussed at \[26\] and in QB 14/09. 51. However, while amounts received by an employee are not treated as dividends, they do give rise to income for the employee under s CE 1. Employment income is usually in the form of cash payments. However, it can include some non- cash items. Under s CE 1, an amount derived in connection with employment or service is income if it is: ••salary, wages or an allowance, bonus, extra pay or gratuity; ••the value of accommodation (including accommodation allowances, payments or reimbursements) provided to a person when it is provided in relation to employment or service (ss CE 1B to CE 1E); ••expenditure on account of an employee, being a payment made by an employer relating to expenditure incurred by an employee or to be incurred by an employee (s CE 5); ••a benefit received under an employee share scheme (as described in s CE 2); ••director’s fees; ••compensation for loss of employment or services; or ••any other benefit in money. 52. Section CD 32 also confirms that the value of accommodation provided to a person in relation to employment or service which is employment income is not a dividend. 53. The amount a company incurs paying employment income will usually be a cost incurred in deriving assessable income or in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income, such that the payments will be deductible under s DA 1. However, where amounts are paid to employees who are working on a capital project, the payments may not be deductible (Christchurch Press Co Ltd v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,206). Section DB 1 confirms that the company is also allowed a deduction for PAYE paid in relation to employment income. Example 16 shows how employment income is treated differently from dividends. Example 16 – Employment income Dani is a shareholder and an employee of Dani’s Doughnuts Ltd. Dani receives $2,000 per month from Dani’s Doughnuts Ltd. This payment is compensation for Dani’s services to Dani Doughnuts Ltd. The money transferred by Dani’s Doughnuts Ltd to Dani is equal to the money’s worth provided by Dani to Dani’s Doughnuts Ltd. Therefore, the payment is not a dividend. However, it will be taxable employment income for Dani and will be deductible for Dani’s Doughnuts Ltd. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 24 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Fringe benefits 54. Under s CD 32, a benefit provided to an employee is not a dividend if it is a fringe benefit subject to FBT. 55. A “fringe benefit” is a benefit an employer provides to an employee in connection with their employment that is (s CX 2): ••the private use of a motor vehicle (s CX 6); ••subsidised transport (s CX 9); ••an employment-related loan (s CX 10); ••a service provided to members of Parliament (s CX 12); ••a contribution to a superannuation scheme (s CX 13), sickness, accident or death benefit fund (s CX 14), funeral trust (s CX 15), or life or health insurance (s CX 16); or ••an unclassified benefit, being a benefit subject to FBT other than those listed above. 56. A fringe benefit is excluded income of the employee (s CX 3) and is, instead, subject to FBT under s RD 26. 57. However, if a company provides a non-cash benefit to an employee who holds shares in the company, other than a non– executive director, the company may choose to treat the benefit as a fringe benefit or a dividend (s CX 17). Section CX 17 will apply only if the benefit: ••would have given rise to a dividend (that is, the benefit related to the shareholding); and ••is an unclassified benefit. 58. Section CX 17 will not apply if the fringe benefit arises from the private use of asset which is subject to the mixed-use asset rules in subpart DG. If that is the case, the company must choose to treat the benefit as a dividend and not as a fringe benefit. 59. In addition, if a company provides a benefit to a person who is associated with an employee and with a shareholder in the company, and that benefit would have been a dividend if provided to the shareholder, the benefit is subject to FBT and is not treated as being a dividend (s CX 18). 60. As for other employment income, the amount a company incurs in providing benefits to employees will usually be a cost incurred in deriving assessable income or in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income such that the payments will be deductible under s DA 1. Section DB 1 confirms that the company is also allowed a deduction for FBT paid on fringe benefits. 61. Example 17 and Example 18 illustrate when fringe benefits will arise. Example 17 – Fringe benefit Noah is a shareholder and an employee of Noah’s Needles Ltd. Noah uses a car owned by Noah’s Needles Ltd for his private purposes. Because Noah is an employee of Noah’s Needles Ltd, the private use of a company vehicle will give rise to a fringe benefit rather than a dividend. Because the provision of a motor vehicle is not an unclassified benefit, Noah’s Needles Ltd cannot choose to elect that the amount be treated as a non-cash dividend under s CX 17. Therefore, Noah’s Needles Ltd must pay FBT on the private use of the vehicle. Noah’s Needles Ltd will be entitled to deduct the FBT paid. Example 18 – Unclassified benefits Jaya is a shareholder and an employee of Jaya’s Jet Skis Ltd. Jaya regularly uses Jaya’s Jet Skis Ltd’s jet skis for her own private use. Because Jaya is an employee of Jaya’s Jet Skis Ltd, the private use of the company’s property will give rise to a fringe benefit. The use of the jet skis is an unclassified benefit. Therefore, Jaya’s Jet Skis Ltd can choose to treat the private use as a dividend or a fringe benefit by either including it in their FBT return for the relevant period, or complying with the withholding and other obligations that arise from paying a dividend. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 25 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Look-through companies 62. Shareholders (or persons with an “effective look-through interest” (see s HB 1(5) and YA 1)) in a look-through company (LTC) are treated as: ••carrying on the activity carried on by the LTC; ••holding the property that the LTC holds; ••being party to any arrangements to which the LTC is a party; and ••doing and being entitled to do all the things the LTC does or is entitled to do (s HB 1). 63. To that end, the shareholders in an LTC are treated as receiving all income and incurring all deductions personally. Given all income of an LTC is treated as being derived personally by its shareholders, distributions from the LTC to its shareholders are ignored for tax purposes. LTCs are also excluded from the definition of “company” in s YA 1, excluding them from the application of the dividend rules. 64. Shareholders are, however, entitled to a deduction for their share (based on their effective look-through interest) of any payments made to a working owner of the LTC (s DC 3B(1)). A “working owner” is a person who is an owner of the LTC who personally and actively performs duties that are required to be performed in carrying on the business of the LTC and are performed by the person under a contract of employment (s YA 1). The contract of employment must be in writing and must specify the terms and conditions of the services to be performed by the working owner and the amount payable for the performance of those services (s DC 3B(3)). An LTC cannot have a working owner, if the LTC is wholly or mainly engaged in investing money or in holding, or dealing in, shares, securities, investments or estates and interests in land. 65. Example 19 and Example 20 show how distributions are taxed under the LTC rules. Example 19 – Distribution from an LTC Chen is a shareholder in Chen’s Hens Ltd, which is an LTC. Chen receives a distribution of $100 from Chen’s Hens Ltd. The distribution is ignored for tax purposes. Instead, Chen is taxed on his share of Chen’s Hens Ltd’s income as if he derived it directly. Example 20 – Working owner Kyle is a shareholder in Kyle’s Smiles Ltd, which is an LTC. Kyle performs services for Kyle’s Smiles under a contract of employment, which specifies the duties he is required to undertake and his salary. Kyle’s salary is a deductible expense for Kyle and the other shareholders in Kyle’s Smiles Ltd. Qualifying companies 66. While it is not possible for a company to elect to become a qualifying company anymore, qualifying companies still exist. Any dividend paid by a qualifying company to a person resident in New Zealand is exempt income of the person to the extent to which it is more than the fully imputed distribution (ss HA 14 and CW 15). Imputation credits are automatically treated as being attached to any dividend that is not a non-cash dividend (other than taxable bonus issues) to the extent that imputation credits are available (calculated at the end of the tax year) (s HA 15). Example 21 illustrates this. Example 21 – Dividend from a qualifying company Angelina is a shareholder in Angelina’s Ballerinas Ltd, which is a qualifying company. Angelina’s Ballerinas Ltd makes a distribution to Angelina of $100 during the 2021 tax year. Angelina’s Ballerinas Ltd has $28 of available imputation credits at the end of the 2021 tax year. The distribution is treated as an imputed dividend to the extent of the available imputation credits (that is, $72). The remaining distribution is exempt income for Angelina. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 26 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS More examples Example 22 - Overdrawn shareholder loan account Alex is a shareholder in Alex’s Axolotls Ltd. Alex is not an employee. On 14 June 2020, Alex borrows NZ$1,000, interest free, from Alex’s Axolotls Ltd. On 31 December 2020, Alex’s Axolotls Ltd pays Alex a fully imputed dividend of $200 (gross dividend of $277.78 including imputation credits of $77.78) that is applied to repay part of the loan. Because the repayment is made in the same year that the loan was provided, Alex is treated as having made the repayment on the day the loan was originally made, and any dividend arising from the fact the loan was interest free will reduce accordingly. When preparing the monthly management accounts for Alex’s Axolotls Ltd in March 2021, its accountant notes that Alex’s loan account is still outstanding and that there is the potential for a non-cash dividend to arise: Shareholder loan account – Alex DateDebitCreditBalance 1/4/20Opening balance0.00 14/6/20Loan to Alex1,000.001,000.00 31/12/20Dividend200.00800.00 The accountant advises the directors that they have some options in terms of dealing with the tax consequences of Alex as receiving a non-cash dividend. The first option is that Alex is treated as deriving a non-cash dividend. The amount of the non- cash dividend is calculated on the outstanding balance of the loan, allowing the fully imputed dividend to be credited against the loan on 14 June 2020, the date the loan was drawn down. Deemed dividend = Outstanding loan x interest rate x days in quarter 365 Non-cash dividend Q1 = $800 x 5.26% x 16 365 Non-cash dividend Q1 = $1.84 Non-cash dividend Q2 –Q4 = $800 x 4.5% x 274 365 Non-cash dividend Q2 –Q4 = $27.02 Total non-cash dividend = $28.87 Under option 1, Alex would be treated as deriving a dividend of $28.87 on the earlier of 30 September 2021 or when notified by Alex’s Axolotls Ltd of the payment of the dividend. Because the accountant is preparing the accounts soon after balance date, this dividend could have imputation credits attached to it like the earlier dividend did (attaching imputation credits is discussed from \[43\]). The accountant advises that option 2 is to charge Alex interest on the loan in the amount of $28.87 to 31 March 2021. This would increase the balance of the loan to $828.87 as at that date. In Alex assuming liability for this further amount, the value of the non-cash dividend would be reduced to nil. Alternatively, the accountant advises Alex’s Axolotls Ltd that as it has had a very successful year, it could just pay Alex a further dividend of $800. This dividend could be declared and paid by 31 March 2021. It could be imputed and credited back to the date the loan was drawn down. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 27 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Example 23 – FBT rules apply Jon is a shareholder and employee of Jon’s Jeeps Ltd. Jon’s Jeeps Ltd allows Jon to use one of its vehicles for his private purposes. Jon does not make any payment to Jon’s Jeeps Ltd in exchange for the use of the vehicle. Is there a transfer of value? Yes - Jon’s Jeep Ltd has transferred value to Jon by allowing him to use one of its vehicles without requiring any payment in exchange. Was the transfer caused by a shareholding? Potentially – Jon’s Jeeps Ltd would not allow a person unconnected with the company to use its vehicles. Given Jon is a shareholder in Jon’s Jeeps Ltd the transfer of value could be caused by the shareholding. Do any of the exclusions apply? Yes – Given Jon is also an employee of the company, the private use of the vehicle would also be subject to the FBT rules. Private use of a vehicle is not an unclassified benefit. Therefore, the benefit would be subject to FBT and not be taxed as a non-cash dividend under s CD 32. Example 24 – FBT rules apply Angie is a shareholder and employee of Angie’s Apricots Ltd. Angie’s Apricots allows Angie to take an amount of apricots home with her each night as a supplement to her salary. Is there a transfer of value? Yes – Angie’s Apricots Ltd has transferred value to Angie by providing her with apricots free of charge. Was the transfer caused by a shareholding? No – Angie has been provided with the apricots as a supplement to her salary. The apricots have been provided as payment for her services and not because she is a shareholder in the company. Therefore, no non-cash dividend will arise. FBT consequences However, the provision of apricots to Angie in connection with her employment will give rise to an unclassified fringe benefit, such that FBT will be payable by Angie’s Apricots Ltd based on the market value of the apricots provided.

The main focus of this interpretation statement is the deductibility of meal expenses by self-employed persons. But in considering that issue the statement also considers the treatment of employees. In general, self-employed taxpayers cannot deduct meal expenses for income tax purposes. This is because: ••In a broad sense expenditure on the necessities of life (meals, clothing, shelter etc) could be described as incurred by a person in deriving their assessable income for the purposes of the general permission in s DA 1 (Hunter v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,242 at 6,258); ••However, the Act denies a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a private or domestic nature (the “private limitation”, s DA 2(2)); ••An outgoing is of a private or domestic nature if it is “exclusively referable to living as an individual member of society and domestic expenses are those relating to the household or family unit” (CIR v Haenga (1985) 7 NZTC 5,198 at 5,207); ••Food is in the private or domestic category (Hunter at page 6,257, Case E80 (1982) 5 NZTC 59,421); and ••There are limited circumstances where amounts expended on food may be deductible, such as where the requirements of a taxpayer’s business imposed extra meal costs because of a remote working location or unusual working hours (Case F117 (1984) 6 NZTC 60,125, discussed below from \[28\]). 2. This conclusion means there is a difference between self-employed taxpayers’ meal expenses compared to: ••Employees receiving meal allowances or reimbursements while performing their duties (deductible expenditure to the employer, exempt income of the employee, not subject to FBT); or ••“Self-employed” persons incorporating a closely-held company and becoming an employee to receive the same treatment as any other employee. 3. These differences reflect the different legal arrangements in existence in these fact situations, and these different arrangements do give rise to significant legal effects. For example, there are differences in terms of personal liability, application of tax regimes (such as dividends, FBT), and so on. There is also a difference with the treatment of entertainment expenditure. 4. In the GST context, where meal expenses are of a private or domestic nature for income tax purposes, and non-deductible, input tax on the expenses cannot be deducted for GST purposes. The main reason for this is that goods and services used for private and domestic purposes are not used for making taxable supplies. Introduction 5. The principal legislative provisions involved with the income tax issue are the general permission (s DA 1) and the private limitation (s DA 2(2)). For GST, the relevant sections of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (“the GST Act”) are ss 20(3) and 20(3C) dealing with the claiming of input tax. 6. For income tax the principal issue is whether a self-employed person’s meal expenses are deductible, and if so in what circumstances. This statement will also compare the tax treatment of a self-employed person with the treatment of an employee receiving a meal allowance and consider the effect of the entertainment expenditure regime on the deductibility of meals. 7. For GST, the principal issue is whether input tax incurred on meals by a self-employed person is deductible, in whole or in part. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 30 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Income tax deductibility 8. The deductibility of expenditure on meals is governed by the general permission and the private limitation. DA 1 General permission Nexus with income (1) A person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss, including an amount of depreciation loss, to the extent to which the expenditure or loss is— (a) incurred by them in deriving— (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income; or (b) incurred by them in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving— (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income. DA 2 General limitations ... Private limitation (2) A person is denied a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a private or domestic nature. This rule is called the private limitation. Cases on the general principles 9. New Zealand courts have provided general principles for applying both the general permission and the private limitation (or their predecessor sections before they were known by such terms). 10. A good starting point for considering the general permission is the approach taken in the Court of Appeal decisions of CIR v Banks (1978) 3 NZTC 61,236 and Buckley and Young Limited v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271. In both cases the decisions of the Court were delivered by Richardson J. In Banks at page 61,240 his Honour said a deduction is available only where expenditure has the necessary relationship both with the taxpayer concerned and with the gaining or producing of assessable income. Relationship with the taxpayer is not sufficient as the prohibitions for deductions for capital expenditure and private and domestic expenditure make clear. The Court found there must be the statutory nexus between the expenditure and the assessable income of the taxpayer claiming the deduction. 11. Banks touched on the question of the character of the expenditure, which was also addressed in Buckley and Young at page 61,274 by Richardson J: ...The heart of the inquiry is the identification of the relationship between the advantage gained or sought to be gained by the expenditure and the income earning process. That in turn requires determining the true character of the payment. It then becomes a matter of degree and so a question of fact to determine whether there is a sufficient relationship between the expenditure and what it provided or sought to provide on the one hand, and the income earning process on the other, to fall within the words of the section (C. of I.R. v Banks (1978) 3 NZTC 61,236, 61,242). 12. The private limitation has been the subject of several court decisions including the Court of Appeal decision in CIR v Haenga (1985) 7 NZTC 5,198 and the High Court decision of Hunter v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,242. 13. In Haenga the taxpayer, an employee of New Zealand Railways, was obliged (by statute) to make contributions to the Government Railways Welfare Society. The taxpayer claimed a deduction for the expenditure, which the Commissioner denied. The Court of Appeal upheld the decisions of the TRA and the High Court that the expenditure was deductible. Richardson J, at page 5,206, considered that in some circumstances it may be helpful to focus on the essential character of expenditure, but not always: ...In some circumstances it is helpful to focus on the essential character of an outgoing in the sense of its being incidental and relevant to the gaining or producing of the assessable income. But not always, for some expenses such as rates, repairs and travel costs are not inherently or even prima facie of either an income related or non-income related character. In other cases to label the character of the activity as private may be misleading, for example, where accommodation and meals are obtained away from home. Further analysis is required. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 31 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 14. After observing that it is a matter of degree and so a question of fact to determine whether there is a sufficient nexus between the expenditure and the income earning process his Honour said (at page 5,206): The legal answer is complicated where, as here, the asset or advantage in respect of which expenses are incurred may serve private and income earning purposes. Thus expenses of travelling between home and work and expenses of child care have conventionally been regarded by the Courts as a private matter, a form of consumption. Inasmuch as they are a prerequisite to the earning of income it is arguable that they are incurred in the gaining of the assessable income. But depending on one’s perspective a similar argument could even be advanced to justify deduction of outlays on such basic items as essential food, clothing and shelter which may be said to maintain and enhance the physical and psychological wellbeing of the individual, and in turn his or her ability to perform his employment. In one sense then any such expenditure has a relation to the purpose of earning income, even if it is described as an ordinary living expense. But it is not to be expected that the Legislature ever contemplated such an erosion of the income tax base in respect of employment income; and with careful emphasis on the character of the expenditure incurred the Courts have denied the notion that an expense properly characterised as consumption is incidental and relevant to the derivation of income merely because it is necessary in that sense (Lodge v FC of T 72 ATC 4174 at p 4176 (1972) 128 CLR 171 at p 175; Lunney v FC of T (1957-8) 100 CLR 478). On this approach deduction may be refused in this class of case where the expenditure is of a private nature and sec 105(2)(b) and sec 106(1)(j) raise essentially the same considerations. In such a case the exclusion of expenditure made on private matters comes from the requirement of the first limb of sec 104 (and sec 105(2)(b)) which limits deductions to expenditure incurred in gaining assessable income, and the express exclusion in sec 106(1)(j) may be regarded as having been inserted by way of precaution or emphasis (Handley v FC of T 81 ATC 4165 at p 4174 (1981) 148 CLR 182 at p 200). (Emphasis added.) 15. At page 5,207 his Honour said that the private limitation (then s 106(1)(j) of the Income Tax Act 1976) could be regarded as having been inserted in the Act by way of precaution or emphasis. In other words, the exclusion of expenditure made on private matters comes first from the requirement that deductions be limited to expenditure incurred in gaining assessable income. Further on page 5,207 his Honour went on to discuss what is meant by an outgoing of a private nature: An outgoing is of a private nature if it is exclusively referable to living as an individual member of society and domestic expenses are those relating to the household or family unit. 16. McGechan J in Hunter returned to the question of the denial of deductions for expenditure of a “private or domestic” nature. This arose in the context of unreimbursed relocation expenses incurred by the taxpayer during a promotion and transfer as a police officer. The deduction claimed was denied and McGechan J upheld this decision of the Commissioner. 1 17. At pages 6,256 to 6,262 of the judgment, his Honour considered the question of whether expenditure was private or domestic. At page 6,256 his Honour referred to Richardson J’s observations in Haenga in looking at the policy behind the denial of private or domestic expenditure: I look first for statutory intention. The policy underlying prohibition of deduction of expenditure of a private or domestic nature is obvious enough. It is to overcome openings otherwise available, as a matter of logic, and to protect an important tax base from undue erosion. I refer generally to the observations of Richardson J in C of IR v Haenga (1985) 7 NZTC 5,198 at pp 5,205 to 5,207; \[1986\] 1 NZLR 119 at pp 127-128. If sec 105(2) and cl 8 stood unqualified, they could permit deduction of expenditure on matters such as food, clothing, medical expenses, travel, and shelter. All, in a broad sense, would be incurred in gaining assessable income, or for the purposes of employment. One does not gain assessable income, or hold employment if starving to death, or dying from disease or exposure. On a sine qua non approach, the logic would be unanswerable. ... The policy solution is prohibition of so-called personal or domestic expenditure. To say food, clothing, or shelter or the like is an essential requirement for the purposes of gaining an income might remain logical, but it is not generally to be legal. A line is to be drawn, placing beyond the pale that which “properly” is expenditure of a personal or domestic nature. No statutory definition is given. Obviously, there will be borderline cases involving line drawing. The Courts are expected to do so in a manner which promotes this statutory object. (Emphasis added.) 1 McGechan J’s decision in Hunter relating to relocation expenses was overturned by the Court of Appeal in Hunter v CIR (1990) 12 NZTC 7,169 on the basis that the expenditure was incurred solely for the purpose of, and as a condition of, employment and there was no private or domestic element. However, the Court of Appeal did not dispute the law applied by McGechan J and did not discuss meal expenses (as McGechan J had in the High Court). As such, the discussion from the High Court judgment is still usefully retained for his Honour’s comments on meal expenses. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 32 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 18. Having considered the underlying statutory policy for the prohibition, McGechan J went on to consider authority, and specific examples of expenditure which courts have considered to be private and domestic including food (at pages 6,256-7): I turn to authority. Traditionally, at least until recently, a conservative approach has been taken. A few examples in cognate areas will illustrate. Child minding expenses may well be a pre-requisite to the earning of income, but generally have been rejected for reasons including labelling as “private or domestic” eg Lodge v FCT (1972) 128 CLR 171 at p 176. Food, whether ordinary or exceptional to meet taxpayer needs, may be essential for a taxpayer to earn, but is regarded as in the personal or domestic category; eg Case K82 (1988) 10 NZTC 648 \[also known as TRA Case 35 (1988) 12 TRNZ 444\] (distinguishing at NZTC p 650; NZLR p 446 business entertainment).... TRA cases on meal expenses 19. Meal expenses have specifically been dealt with by the TRA in a number of cases. A good starting point is the decision of Judge Barber in Case E80 (1982) 5 NZTC 59,421. This decision undertook a comprehensive summary of the law relating to the deductibility of meal expenses. The taxpayer in question was an owner-driver of a furniture removal van who worked for a cartage contracting company. In undertaking his services, the taxpayer would at times have to stay overnight away from his home and take a number of meals “on the road”. The taxpayer claimed that the meals were necessary items of expenditure incurred in producing his income. 20. From page 59,424 onwards Judge Barber discussed a number of authorities from Australia, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand on the deductibility of meal expenses. The predominant theme from these cases was that meal expenses are non- deductible as a private expense. One exception (referred to in cases discussed at page 59,245) was the meal expenditure incurred in business entertaining. (This is discussed from \[71\] in the context of New Zealand’s statutory regime for entertainment expenditure in subpart DD.) 21. At pages 59,428 to 59,429 his Honour concluded: In my view there is no necessary relationship between the expenditure by O on meals and the earning of O’s income. The meals were purchased by O in order to live and not to perform O’s job. The expenditure was not incidental and relevant to the earning of income but was incidental and relevant to O’s physical sustenance. Although the expenditure was made in the course of O’s cartage jobs the expenditure was not in my view, made in the course of earning income. The expenditure was necessary for living rather than for earning income. Hence as a matter of degree I find that there is no sufficient relationship between the expenditure and what it provided and the income earning process. ... I find no grounds for distinguishing between meals eaten at home and meals eaten “out of town” except perhaps where extra cost is incurred due to the taxpayer being required by his employment to eat “out of town”. Although O stated in evidence that he was involved in extra cost when purchasing meals on his cartage trips, no evidence was given as to the amount or quantum of this extra cost. Nor was there any evidence that extra cost was incurred for the purpose of employment. I can understand and accept that there may well have been extra cost. It seems to me that, despite some dicta to the contrary in the meal cases, there may well be a sufficient statutory nexus between the extra cost of such meals and the income earning process if the quantum of the extra cost could be proved. ... 22. Judge Barber referred to a possible sufficient nexus between the “extra cost” of some meals (due to their being eaten “out of town”) and the income earning process. This will be discussed later in relation to another TRA case (Case F117). Judge Barber’s comprehensive review of case law in Case E80 included discussion of a couple of earlier TRA cases where deductibility was also denied on the “private or domestic nature” ground – Case A12 (1974) 1 NZTC 60,088 and Case B14 (1975) 1 NZTC 60,108. In Case A12 a polytechnic tutor who was required to work late twice a week was refused deductibility of meal expenses for those nights he had to work late. Similarly, in Case B14 a lecturer (at both a polytechnic and a university) was required to work late a couple of nights per week (until 7.30pm). He was unable to claim meal expenses for those evenings. 23. Judge Barber again denied meal expenses to a taxpayer in Case P1 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,001. The taxpayer in this case was a member of an “informal partnership” of scriptwriters. The three members of the group would meet up, at the home of any one of them, to write a comedy script for a television programme. At around lunchtime they would travel to a restaurant where they would have (to quote Judge Barber) “a moderate amount of good food and wine”. The bill for the lunch was divided equally between them and the taxpayer was seeking to deduct his share of the bill for a number of these lunches. Part of the taxpayer’s argument was that if he had been at home working on his other writing commitments, he would have had a very modest lunch of negligible cost. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 33 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 24. Judge Barber drew a careful distinction between the cost of meals to a person in their own capacity and the cost of meals incurred as entertainment expenditure. Where lunch costs were a cost of entertaining others (such as clients, customers, or employees) they might have been deductible entertainment expenditure 2 . In such a case the private benefit to the payer of the meals is regarded as incidental to the business purpose of the meal expenditure. But this was not an example of that. 25. At page 4,004 Judge Barber began his reasoning with a very strong statement of principle: Expenditure on food (or liquor) is not intrinsically non-deductible. However, expenditure on food for oneself, merely as sustenance, will always be private expenditure and non-deductible. Nevertheless, in the course of business or the seeking of income, there are many variations on the theme that expenditure on food (and wine or liquor) may assist business. This type of expenditure can usually be termed “entertainment expenditure”. It would be a misnomer to refer to the objector’s expenditure as “entertainment expenditure”, because it was not spent to entertain anybody; but it seems to have been put to the respondent’s Department under that concept. Entertainment expenditure, normally, is the cost to a taxpayer of entertaining others in the course of an income earning process for the genuine purpose of that process. 26. At pages 4,008 to 4,009 his Honour weighed up the conflicting arguments in favour and against deductibility and concluded that the lunches were not deductible: ...However, on reconsidering the evidence of the objector overall, I must find as a fact that, while the lunches did create an inspirational environment which greatly assisted the script writing activity and assisted the journalists to meet deadlines and time was not lost during lunch breaks, the actual expenditure on food and liquor was made by the objector journalist to nourish and relax himself as a human being. The fact that in the course of partaking that nourishment, and enjoying that relaxing period, he and his associates continued working does not convert private expenditure on food to business expenditure.... I appreciate the objector’s evidence that the prime purpose of the meals was not to eat with business being incidental, but to continue business with the eating being incidental. In my view, the problem is still that the expenditure on food was not to facilitate business, but to refuel and relax as a human being. I accept that the lunches were a continuation of the working process but this does not convert private expenditure into business expenditure in this case. 27. In short, the expenditure was primarily for the sustenance of the taxpayer which is generally a matter of a private nature. There was an insufficient link to the taxpayer’s income earning process for deductibility. This is the general approach or position that Judge Barber took to meal expenses. However, there are a number of cases where he or other TRA judges found in favour of taxpayers being able to deduct meal expenses. Some of these are now discussed. 2 This case predated the 1993 introduction of the limitation on entertainment expenditure which is discussed from \[71\]. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 34 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 28. Case F117 (1984) 6 NZTC 60,125 concerned an actress who claimed, among other things, meal expenses. These meal expenses were described as “extra” expenses because of the hours of work or the requirements of her work. The actress’s film set was often in the countryside so that there was often only one available eating place with food at a higher price than normal. Judge Barber summarised the situation at page 60,129 saying that “often she must stay at hotels in other cities or in another country but due to irregular filming or rehearsal hours cannot be expected to find food away from the hotel”. Further: ...Her meal allowance is modest and she now seeks some of the excess cost over that allowance. Her point is that generally when seeking a meal late at night only the more expensive meals are available when she is working away from her home. Sometimes when working in home territory her preferred home meal is spoiled by unexpected and irregular work commitments. Accordingly late at night or during a short and irregular meal break, the only practical meal to obtain is one which costs more than the normal cost of living. 29. This context of meals being consumed “away from home” calls to mind Richardson J’s caveat in Haenga (at page 5,206). That was where His Honour said that to label the character of the activity as necessarily private may be misleading, for example meals obtained away from home. And Case F117 (a case involving meals obtained away from home), in allowing deductions for meals demonstrates that point. 30. At page 60,129 Judge Barber explained why he considered the claim was deductible; and in this context it was important that the claim was only for extra costs: ...I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the claim has been properly quantified by O’s oral evidence that it relates only to extra food costs required by unusual working conditions. The claim for meals has been brought about by the circumstances under which O works as an actress. In my view there is a sufficient nexus in this case between excess expenditure on meals and O’s income earning process. The only contrary approach could be that sustenance is caused by O being human, but this case involves the extra cost of sustenance caused by the nature of O’s job... 31. His Honour considered that the case was consistent with his decision in Case E80. 32. The decision in Case F117 can therefore be explained on the basis that the expenditure in question (the “extra” expenditure) was only incurred as a result of the taxpayer’s income earning process and the peculiarities of her occupation. But for the demands or requirements of her occupation the taxpayer would not have been put to that extra cost for her meals. 33. A case where meal deductions were allowed, but which seems inconsistent with the cases previously discussed, is Case H82 (1986) 8 NZTC 567. This case involved a university lecturer who attended a conference in Brisbane in his capacity as an employee of the university and attended another conference in Sydney in a separate capacity as a self-employed consultant. For the Brisbane conference his employer paid most of his expenses. However, for the Sydney conference he was obliged to pay his own expenses. These included an amount of $160 that he incurred in treating his friends (with whom he was staying) to dinner in appreciation of hospitality they had given him. 34. The TRA (Judge Moore) quickly found that the portion of the $160 that related to his friends’ meals was private expenditure and not deductible. But the taxpayer’s own meal expenses were in a different category. The taxpayer had argued that while he was away in Sydney at the conference his household expenses (including the cost of providing family meals) continued. At page 572 of the decision Judge Moore set out his understanding of the reason for the expenditure: The objector’s expenditure on meals in the course of the Sydney conference was incurred not because the objector needed to eat but because he had good professional reasons for attending the conference and did so. Some of his work (from which he had derived income that year) was in a competition conducted in conjunction with the conference. Attendance at Sydney was not only normal participation in a professional conference but created an opportunity for the objector to exploit the business advantages inherent in having an entry in such a competition. Had the objector not attended the conference he would still have eaten but would not have had to incur the cost of meals in Sydney. 35. He drew a distinction between meal costs incurred in a taxpayer’s own home compared to meal costs incurred while living away from home for income earning purposes (at pages 572-3): Although it is not determinative it seems to me that there is a significant difference between a claim for the cost of meals consumed at a time when the taxpayer is living in his own home (albeit not eating there on the particular occasion) and the cost of meals incurred whilst temporarily living away from home for income earning purposes. Such a distinction would not necessarily assist a taxpayer who has jobs in two different places because in effect he may have taken on a commitment to have two sets of domestic expenditure. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 35 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 36. His Honour also contrasted the treatment of a self-employed taxpayer with the position of an employee receiving an allowance, and also the anomalous or unreal consequences of denying the deduction to the taxpayer: \[page 573\] Meal allowances, that is payments to employees of fixed sums of money when more than certain hours are worked, such payments being for the purpose of enabling the employee to purchase a meal, have long been accepted by the respondent as non-taxable allowances. If expenditure on meals were always of a private or domestic nature the non-taxable nature of such allowances would be difficult to justify. It is not a situation in which an employer pays for something (eg, the costs of shifting house) that would be private expenditure if the employee paid. Meal allowances are provided for in many industrial awards and are a cash payment. There is no requirement that the employee actually use such an allowance to purchase a meal. \[page 574\] It does not necessarily follow that the rules for self-employed taxpayers are or should be the same as those for employees. There are many distinctions, some of which might be seen to favour one group, some the other. In the context of the general proposition that the cost of meals must always be an expense of a private or domestic nature, the treatment within the scope of the taxation system of payments to employees for meals is relevant. Recently fringe benefit tax has been introduced to cope with what were seen as some undesirable aspects of the provision of tax-free benefits for employees but that is not a matter which need concern me here, apart from noting that the legislation has not prohibited the provision of various tax-free benefits to employees but has imposed a particular form of tax on the employer. I am satisfied that the objector is correct when he refers to the treatment of his claim as being anomalous in the context of the conferences he attended. A self-employed person is in one sense an employee and an employer in the same person. The proposition that such a person can go to a conference with a member of his staff, they have a meal together, the employer pays for both, the employee’s meal is tax deductible but the employer’s meal is not, seems to me to have a degree of commercial unreality which is approaching the comic. Many persons who are in reality self-employed operate through the medium of small private companies and so avoid this particular type of problem. 37. His Honour concluded that the taxpayer’s share of meal costs in relation to the Sydney conference were deductible. The costs were a part of the expenditure incurred in gaining or producing the taxpayer’s taxable income. The difficulty with this case is that it is contrary to the earlier TRA decision of Case E80. It is also a challenging case as, unlike the taxpayer in Case F117, the extra expense of meals (at the restaurant) was not imposed on the taxpayer by the circumstance of his work but by his own decision to treat his friends to dinner as a sign of appreciation for their hospitality. 38. Another decision that allowed deductibility but, with respect, seems out of step with most of the case law, is Judge Barber’s decision in Case T16 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,095. In this case, a couple shifted to a new city where they bought a new home. They retained their former home which they rented out. In carrying out their rental activity, they travelled back to their former city of residence to find a suitable tenant. The visits included cleaning and maintaining the property, selecting tenants, and acquiring furniture for them. They claimed various expenses in doing so, including meals and accommodation. The Commissioner did not dispute the deduction of accommodation costs but did deny the meal expenses. 39. The Commissioner’s counsel referred to earlier decisions of Judge Barber in Case E80 and Case P1 as support for denying the deduction of meal expenses. However, his Honour allowed the expenditure and put forward the treatment of the accommodation expenses as one of the reasons for this result. At page 8,099 he said: I note that the respondent did not dispute deductibility for the associated cost of accommodation for the objector and members of his family. Those accommodation expenses related to the said trips to the first city in connection with the letting activity and were incurred on the same dates as the respective meal expenses. Presumably, the respondent’s rationale is that the accommodation expenditure would not have been incurred unless overnight travel had been undertaken in the course of the letting activity. It seems to me that such a rationale must also apply to the meal expenditure. Also, it seems rather pinpricking to, somehow, calculate what the cost of the relevant meals for the objector (and, where appropriate, his wife and/or daughter) might have been at their home in the second city and then deduct that from the sum to be deducted for meal expenditure. I think that aspect is de minimis but may have some significance regarding the partaking of alcohol — although there is a large mark-up in the cost of alcohol in a restaurant or hotel compared with cost for home consumption. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 36 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 40. On the same page he further explained why he considered the meal expenses had a sufficient link to the income earning process to be deductible: It seems to me that had it not been necessary for the objector (with family members) to travel to the first property to deal with its maintenance and letting, then the meal expenditure would not have been incurred. To put the matter another way, it seems to me that the meal expenditure is sufficiently linked with the letting business, or the income earning process of letting, to be a part of the overall letting activity and therefore deductible as a revenue expense of the gaining of rent. 41. This reasoning is, with respect, not convincing. To say the meal expenditure would not have been incurred in the absence of the need to travel to the rental property is out of step with the case law that has found meal expenses to be an outgoing exclusively referable to living as an individual member of society. It appears that Judge Barber has focused solely on whether the general permission was satisfied without considering whether the private limitation applied. 42. There is arguably a distinction between accommodation expenditure and meal expenditure in the circumstances of this case. Accommodation, in the sense of the person’s home, is essentially a fixed cost that is incurred irrespective of the use of the home. Costs such as mortgage repayments and interest, local authority rates, insurance premiums, fixed daily costs for energy connections (etc) mean that a person has a daily cost in owning a home (a similar analysis applies for persons who rent a home). Therefore, where a person has to travel for an income earning process and incurs accommodation expenditure (such as hotel or motel accommodation) then that cost is in addition to the existing cost of accommodation the person is incurring for their home. In the absence of the travel for the income earning process the extra accommodation costs would not have been incurred. 43. Meals are different. A meal consumed in a location different to the person’s usual place of residence is consumed in substitution for the meal they would have consumed in their usual location. For example, if a family is on holiday staying in a motel and prepares and consumes their evening meal at that place, it is not necessarily an additional cost incurred over and above the cost of the meal being prepared in their usual location. This is because a meal in their usual location is not being prepared and consumed at all. Another way of describing it (contrary to the view of Judge Barber in Case T16) is that the meal expenditure would have been incurred even if overnight travel had not been required for the income earning activities. In the example here, the family would have had to eat wherever they were based. The nature of meals being inherently private does not seem to have been considered. 44. Even in the case of accommodation there is analogous TRA case authority to the effect that accommodation would not be deductible, contrary to the decision in Case T16. See, for example, Case G57 (1987) 7 NZTC 1,251 where short-term accommodation expenditure incurred to allow a taxpayer to attend to his mussel farm was not deductible. Also in Case M128 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,825 longer-term accommodation expenditure incurred by a taxpayer working away from his family home in a different location was not deductible. In both cases meals consumed while away from home were also non-deductible. 45. However, case law provides for the possibility of deductions where the circumstances of the income earning process mean the taxpayer incurs extra costs over and above normal. Case F117 is an example of this. Another possible example could be where a taxpayer has limited accommodation options. Perhaps the only reasonable accommodation in the vicinity of the location of the income-earning process is not self-catering or is not near a supermarket such that it is not realistic to expect a person to be able to prepare their own meals. In such a case the costs of purchasing meals may be greater than normal and therefore the extra cost deductible. 46. The sorts of factors which would lead to the deductibility (in whole or in part) of meal expenses requires some sort of objective justification. The taxpayer’s personal preference will not be enough. For example, choosing to stay in a hotel without self-catering facilities (and thus having to pay for purchased meals) when other accommodation options are available will not be enough. So too, choosing not to prepare a person’s own meal just because they are away from their home is not sufficient reason of itself to make a meal deductible. There must be something external to the taxpayer imposing these extra costs of the sorts discussed in the previous paragraph. In this context it is considered that the decision in Case T16, to the extent it suggests anything to the contrary, is out of step with the earlier court and TRA decisions. 47. The deductibility of meal expenses by self-employed persons, as can be seen from the above discussion, is not affected by whether the travel is “travel on business”. Perhaps obviously if the travel was not related to the business there would be no deductibility – it would just be private travel. But even “travel on business” is not enough to give rise to deductibility of meals by the self-employed except in the limited circumstances discussed above. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 37 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Summary of the law on deductibility of meal expenses 48. In general, meal expenses incurred by a self-employed person are non-deductible because they are of a private or domestic nature. The only exception for which there is convincing authority (Haenga in conjunction with Case F117) is where the income earning process of the taxpayer requires extra meal expenses in which case that extra element will be deductible. It is considered that case law suggesting any wider deductibility, particularly TRA cases Case H82 and Case T16, are inconsistent with the higher authority. Allowances and other employee-type considerations 49. As discussed above (at paragraph 36), the TRA in Case H82 seemed strongly influenced to allow deductibility for meals of a self-employed person by looking at the tax treatment of the meal expenses incurred by persons other than self-employed persons. In that case Judge Moore looked at the treatment of employees receiving allowances or having a meal purchased for them by their employer. He also considered a person operating through a “small private” company who is “in reality self- employed”. Given these factors influenced the TRA in Case H82 they are worth considering here. Allowances 50. In Case H82 meal allowances (paid in circumstances where more than certain hours were worked) were said to have been long accepted by the Commissioner as non-taxable allowances. The Act now exempts a number of types of meal allowances. Section CW 17C(1) provides that an amount an employer pays to or on behalf of an employee for a meal when the employee is working overtime is exempt income. CW 17C Payments for overtime meals and certain other allowances Exempt income: overtime meals (1) An amount that an employer pays to or on behalf of an employee for a meal for the employee when the employee is working overtime is exempt income of the employee. 51. Section CW 17C(2) exempts certain sustenance allowances but this subsection is relatively narrow and can be left out of the discussion here. 52. Section CW 17CB(1) provides that when the employment duties of an employee require them to work away from their employer’s workplace, expenditure that the employer incurs for or on behalf of the employee for a meal for the employee is exempt income. “Expenditure” includes a reimbursement payment or a meal allowance. CW 17CB Payments for certain work-related meals Exempt income (1) When the employment duties of an employee require them to work away from their employer’s workplace, expenditure that the employer incurs for or on behalf of the employee for a meal for the employee is exempt income of the employee. For these purposes, expenditure includes a reimbursement payment or a meal allowance. Inclusions: work-related events (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), a meal includes— (a) food and drink that the employee consumes as part of a working meal arranged as part of or as an alternative to a formal meeting for business discussions: (b) food and drink that the employee consumes at a conference or training course: (c) light refreshments in the form of snack foods such as biscuits and fruit, or liquid refreshments such as tea, coffee, water, or similar refreshments, provided for the employee, but only if— (i) their employment duties require them to be away from their employment base for most of the day; and (ii) the employer would normally provide the refreshments to the employee on the day; and (iii) it is not practicable for the employer to provide the refreshments on the day. Inclusions: meals when travelling on business (3) For the purposes of subsection (1), a meal also includes food and drink that the employee consumes when their employment duties require them to travel in the performance of those duties. 53. The remainder of s CW 17CB provides the detailed rules around this, including what is meant by a “meal” (s CW 17CB(2)) and meals when travelling on business (s CW 17CB(3)). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 38 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 54. “Meals” includes, by virtue of s CW 17CB(2)(c), light refreshments in the form of snack foods such as biscuits and fruit, or liquid refreshments such as tea, coffee, water, or similar refreshments, provided for the employee, but only if: ••their employment duties require them to be away from their employment base for most of the day; and ••the employer would normally provide the refreshments to the employee on the day; and ••it is not practicable for the employer to provide the refreshments on the day. 55. Section CW 17CB(3) provides that, for the purposes of subsection (1), a meal also includes food and drink that the employee consumes when their employment duties require them to travel in the performance of those duties. 56. Section CW 17CB(5) provides that the time limit for such meal expenses is a maximum of three months, except for expenditure under subsection (2) (light and liquid refreshments) where there is no such limit. The implication is that a wide range of expenditure on meals can be paid or reimbursed by an employer tax-free to their employee when the employee is required to work away from their employer’s workplace. The only limit is the three-month maximum for an employee working away from their employer’s workplace. 57. The expenses incurred by the employer in such circumstances would be deductible expenditure to the employer under s DA 1. Furthermore, s CX 5(1) provides that to the extent to which a benefit that an employer provides to an employee in connection with their employment is exempt income, the benefit is not a fringe benefit. CX 5 Relationship with exempt income Exempt income not fringe benefit (1) To the extent to which a benefit that an employer provides to an employee in connection with their employment is exempt income, the benefit is not a fringe benefit. 58. As a result of these provisions it is important in the employer/employee context to know what it means to be working away from an employer’s workplace, and what it is to travel in the performance of an employee’s duties. 59. Inland Revenue has two published items of particular relevance to the question of travel “on work”. The first is IS3448 Tra v e l by motor vehicle between home and work – deductibility of expenditure and FBT implications (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 16, No 10 (November 2004)). The second is Operational Statement OS19/05 Employer-provided travel from home to a distant workplace – income tax (PAYE) and fringe benefit tax (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32, No 1 (February 2020)). Neither of these statements concerns the treatment of meal expenses but they do address whether travel between home and work is private travel/expenditure or business/work-related travel/ expenditure. These concepts are relevant for the purposes of the exemptions in s CW 17CB. The law is well summarised at paragraphs 19 to 24 of the 2019 Operational Statement: 19. The general rule is that home-to-work travel is private expenditure as it is expenditure to get to work and reflects the employee’s personal choice as to their home location. The two main reasons for this rule are that the: ••cost of home-to-work travel is predominantly determined by the private choices of the employee (where to live, how to get to work); ••expense of commencing work is distinguished from expenses while “on work”, and employees are expected to bear the cost of commencing work. 20. This means the starting point is that employer-provided travel from home to work is private expenditure and would not be deductible to the employee (if employees could claim deductions). This is the case even if the employee’s travel is funded by the employer or the employee’s attendance at the workplace is required by the employer. 21. The courts have recognised exceptions to this general rule. The cases relating to deductibility of travel expenditure between home and work have identified four broad factual situations where travel between home and work is regarded as business or work-related travel. These situations are where: ••a vehicle is essential for transporting goods or equipment necessary for the performance of employment duties at the home and elsewhere; ••the taxpayer carries on an “itinerant occupation” (that is, the taxpayer does not work from a fixed work place, and the home is the taxpayer’s base of operations; ••the taxpayer is required to be accessible at their home for employment duties and is required to undertake travel in response to emergency calls; ••the travel is “on work” travel between two workplaces, one of which is also the taxpayer’s home. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 39 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 22. It can be seen from the cases that for home-to-work travel to be deductible, the employee must actually undertake work at home. 23. It is not sufficient to establish that the home is or can be a workplace. For expenditure to be deductible, the need for the work to be performed at the home, and, therefore, the need for the travel, must arise from the nature of the work and not from the personal choice or personal circumstances of the taxpayer. 24. In addition, the actual travel must be travel undertaken in the course of performing work (that is, the travel is “on work”). If that is the case, then the cost of that travel is not private expenditure of the employee; rather, it is expenditure that would be deductible if employees were not otherwise prevented from claiming deductions. This means the employer does not have to deduct PAYE in respect of the reimbursement or allowance, and the employee is not liable for income tax on the payments. (Emphasis added.) 60. Much of this material is not of direct relevance because the deductibility of meals is not concerned with home to work travel. But the associated notion of travelling “on work” is definitely relevant. What is meant by travel “on work” was discussed at pages 35 to 36 of IS3448 in the November 2004 TIB. The interpretation statement says that the four exceptions to the non-deductibility of travel between home and work relate to situations where travel can be regarded, in some sense, as travel in the course of performing work rather than travel in order to commence work or travel from work. 61. The interpretation statement summarises the general position around travel “on work” at page 36: Therefore, generally travel from a taxpayer’s home to the taxpayer’s place of work (or to make the first business call of the day) and travel between the last business call of the day and the home would be private use, being travel to enable the taxpayer to commence work or after work has finished. Travel between the place where the first business call is made and the taxpayer’s work base, or to make subsequent business calls, would be business use, being travel in the course of performing work. 62. Operational Statement OS19/05 also specifically covers one-off or very occasional travel: One-off or very occasional travel 43. Inland Revenue considers that one-off or very occasional travel from home to a distant location for work (when required by the employer) can be treated as not taxable on an incidental or de minimis basis. For example, attendance at a two-day conference at a distant location. 25. This approach will apply to employees who work at an office of their employer located in their hometown as well as employees who work all the time from their home. 63. Accordingly, an employee travelling on his or her employer’s business who receives a meal allowance or reimbursement is treated as receiving exempt income, and such an amount is not a fringe benefit. The employer can still deduct the cost of the allowance or reimbursement as a business expense. 64. This is in contrast to the treatment of the same type of expense incurred by a self-employed person (except in the limited circumstances discussed above for the previous issue). 65. The other two circumstances considered by Judge Moore in Case H82 are discussed next (as mentioned above at paragraph 49). Employer paying for meals for themselves and an employee 66. The first of these was the case of an employer paying for a meal for himself or herself and for an employee, when working away from their home base, and only being able to take a deduction for the meal expense of the employee and not their own meal. Judge Moore described this as having “a degree of commercial unreality which is approaching the comic”. 67. As a matter of legal principle these different treatments are not anomalous. One is an expense incurred on an employee, and like wages or salary and other employee expenses, has a nexus with their business; s DA 1(1)(b)(i). The other expense is the employer’s own personal meal expense which has regularly been found to be of a private or domestic nature. Closely-held companies 68. The second circumstance considered by Judge Moore in Case H82 was a case of a “self-employed” person operating through a “private company”. His Honour thought that “many persons who are in reality self-employed operate through the medium of small private companies and so avoid this particular type of problem”. By this it is assumed that Judge Moore meant that the company was able to deduct the cost of meals it reimburses for an “employee” (the person who is “in reality” self-employed). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 40 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 69. Again, as with the first circumstance, as a matter of legal principle the difference between a self-employed person and an incorporated closely-held company is not anomalous. The company is a separate entity and expenditure it incurs in paying employee expenses has a nexus with their business; s DA 1(1)(b)(i). The fact that the company is in effect the alter ego of a self-employed person who has incorporated their activity is not relevant as a matter of legal principle. 70. It is noted that although the company can take a deduction for the cost of allowances or the provision of meals, the payment of an allowance to an employee or the provision of a meal may be taxable income to the employee or subject to FBT (as the case may be). Even where expenditure is deductible to the company, the requirements discussed above for exempting income or being outside of the scope of FBT still must be satisfied. This does not extend to private meal expenditure unconnected to work. 71. If the company is a look-through company under subpart HB of the Act then the income and expenses of the company are treated as the income and expenses of the owners of the look-through company (ss CB 32B and DV 22 of the Act). This means that a deduction for meal expenditure allowed to a “normal” company would most likely not be allowed as a deduction for the owner of a look-through interest in a look-through company as it would be private in nature. Entertainment Expenditure 72. The other issue referred to in the TRA cases is the question of entertainment expenditure. The treatment of entertainment expenditure is covered by subpart DD of the Act. The regime was originally enacted as s 106G of the Income Tax Act 1976 with general application from 1 April 1993. DD 1 Entertainment expenditure generally When this subpart applies (1) This subpart applies when, in deriving income, a person incurs expenditure on entertainment that provides both a private and a business benefit. No deduction (with exception) (2) The person is denied a deduction for expenditure that they incur on the forms of entertainment set out in section DD 2, except for 50% of the amount that they would have been allowed in the absence of this subsection. Meaning of limitation rule (3) Limitation rule means the rule described in subsection (2). Link with subpart DA (4) This section overrides the general permission. 73. Section DD 1(1) sets out the basic principle of the regime which relates to when, in deriving income, a person incurs expenditure on entertainment that provides both a private and a business benefit. The “limitation rule” is described in s DD 1(2). A person is denied a deduction for expenditure they incurred on entertainment set out in s DD 2 except for 50 percent of the amount they would have been allowed in the absence of the subsection. This requires that the expenditure would meet the general permission in section DA 1 by having a sufficient nexus to deriving income or carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving income. 74. In Case P1 (which was decided before the entertainment expenditure regime was enacted), Judge Barber discussed the deductibility of entertainment expenditure as a general proposition. This is relevant because the limitation rule applies to the expenditure that the taxpayer would have been able to deduct in the absence of s DD 1(2). At pages 4,008-9 his Honour said: Obviously, it would only require fairly minor adjustments to the facts to create deductibility. For instance, if it had been necessary or appropriate for the journalists to entertain others as they partook these luncheons, that cost would have been deductible entertainment expenditure. Then, they would probably have been unable to progress their script writing work because they would have been devoted to the entertainment and promotion of other business aspects. Strictly speaking, even in that entertainment situation, the normal cost of the taxpayer’s own meal, whatever “normal cost” might be, is an ingredient of the expenditure which is non-deductible. In practice, that element is not normally isolated, presumably, because even the respondent regards it as de minimis. Also, it would hardly be worthwhile for the respondent to deny deductibility to the payer of the expenditure in that respect, because the respondent would need to isolate that taxpayer’s own meal expenditure and then apportion it between his (or her) normal luncheon expenditure and the excess on each occasion for which deductibility is sought. As I said in the above extracts from Case K82, any private benefit to the payer is regarded as incidental to the business purposes of the meal expenditure. (Emphasis added.) Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 41 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 75. This suggests that a strict legal approach would be to remove a self-employed person’s meal expenditure before applying the 50% limitation on expenditure. However, Judge Barber commented that the practice was not to isolate this element of the expenditure because it is de minimis. It also might be considered a double exclusion of the private element of expenditure. That is, if the TRA were to exclude the taxpayer’s own meal expenditure in such a situation on the basis of the private limitation, and then apply the limitation rule to the remaining expenditure (and the limitation rule is designed to exclude the private benefit of entertainment expenditure) then they would have, in a sense, excluded the private benefit of meals twice. However, it must be acknowledged that there is a level of uncertainty about this in the legislation. 76. Section DD 1(4) provides that s DD 1 overrides the general permission. That is, even if the general permission had been satisfied by the entertainment expenditure it will be denied (to the extent of 50%) based on the limitation rule in subpart DD. 77. Section DD 2 describes the expenditure to which the limitation rule applies. It includes corporate boxes, holiday accommodation, pleasure craft, food and drink expenditure off premises, and food and drink expenditure on premises in certain circumstances (which are more limited compared to food and drink expenditure off premises). DD 2 Limitation rule ... Entertainment off premises (1) limitation rule applies to deductions for expenditure on food and drink that a person provides off their business premises. Entertainment on premises (2) The limitation rule applies to deductions for expenditure on food and drink that a person provides, other than light refreshments such as a morning tea and whether or not guests are present,— (a) on their business premises at a celebration meal, party, reception, or other similar social function: (b) in an area of the premises that at the time is reserved for senior employees to use and is not open to all the person’s employees working in the premises. 78. Section DD 4(1) provides that the limitation rule does not apply to a deduction for expenditure on food and drink consumed by a person while travelling on business or for their employment duties. However, there are limits to this exclusion. DD 4 Employment-related activities Business travel expenditure (1) The limitation rule does not apply to a deduction for expenditure on food or drink consumed by a person while travelling in the course of business or for their employment duties. However, the limitation rule applies if— (a) the travel is mainly for the purpose of enjoying entertainment; or (b) the food or drink is consumed at a meal or function involving an existing or potential business contact as a guest; or (c) the food or drink is consumed at a celebration meal, party, reception, or other similar social function. 79. Section DD 4(3) provides that the limitation rule does not apply to a deduction for expenditure of an amount that is exempt income under ss CW 17B, CW 17C, and CW 17CB (the latter two of which have been dealt with above). 80. Section DD 4(1) refers to the limitation rule not applying to a deduction for expenditure on food or drink consumed by a person while travelling on business (subject to the condition set out in paragraphs (a) to (c) of s DD 4(1)). It is arguable this may extend to a self-employed person, as they can be travelling in the course of business. However, even if s DD 4 did apply such that the limitation rule did not apply to the self-employed person, they still face the difficulty of having to overcome the private limitation. 81. It is difficult to draw much guidance from the treatment of entertainment expenditure. It might be said that it would be anomalous to allow a 50 percent deduction of entertainment expense where a person (other than a self-employed person) incurs entertainment expenditure, but only allow 50 percent of the net entertainment expenditure (that is, entertainment expenses less private or domestic expenditure) when a self-employed person incurs the expenditure. This might be seen as denying private expenditure twice. However, s DA 2(2) denies private expenditure and s DA 2(7) provides that each of the general limitations in s DA 2 override the general permission. Therefore, any potential deduction in s DA 1 is overridden either by the private limitation or by the limitation rule in subpart DD (and see s DD 1(4) too). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 42 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Goods and Services Tax 82. The GST input tax treatment of the meal expenses of the self-employed person follows the income tax deductibility of such expenses. That is, where it was concluded that the meal expenses were of a private or domestic nature for income tax purposes, and non-deductible, input tax on the expenses would also not be deductible for GST purposes. 83. The deductibility of input tax for GST purposes is dependent on at least three things 3 : ••There is an amount of “input tax” as defined in s 3A of the GST Act; ••The person is a registered person for GST purposes, which requires they have a taxable activity; and ••Being able to satisfy the test in s 20(3C) of the GST Act. 3A Meaning of input tax (1) Input tax, in relation to a registered person, means— (a) tax charged under section 8(1) on a supply of goods or services acquired by the person: (b) tax levied under section 12(1) on goods entered for home consumption under the Customs and Excise Act 2018 by the person: (c) an amount determined under subsection (3) after applying subsection (2). 84. For there to be “input tax” for a registered person in the usual case of s 3A(1)(a), means there must be “tax charged under s 8(1) on a supply of goods and services acquired by the person”. This would very often be the case for meal expenses as most suppliers of meals would be registered persons who will be charging GST. 85. The self-employed person must be a registered person in order to deduct input tax. 20 Calculation of tax payable ... (3) Subject to this section, in calculating the amount of tax payable in respect of each taxable period, there shall be deducted from the amount of output tax of a registered person attributable to the taxable period— (a) in the case of a registered person who is required to account for tax payable on an invoice basis pursuant to section 19, the amount of the following: (i) input tax in relation to the supply of goods and services (not being a supply of secondhand goods to which section 3A(1)(c) of the input tax definition applies), made to that registered person during that taxable period: (ia) input tax in relation to the supply of secondhand goods to which section 3A(1)(c) of the input tax definition applies, to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during that taxable period: (ii) input tax invoiced or paid, whichever is the earlier, pursuant to section 12 during that taxable period: (iii) any amount calculated in accordance with any one of sections 25(2)(b), 25(5), 25AA(2)(b) or 25AA(3)(b); and ... (3C) For the purposes of subsection (3), and if subsections (3D) or (3L) do not apply,— (a) input tax as defined in section 3A(1)(a) or (c) may be deducted to the extent to which the goods or services are used for, or are available for use in, making taxable supplies: (b) input tax as defined in section 3A(1)(b) may be deducted to the extent to which the goods are used for, or are available for use in, making taxable supplies other than— (i) the delivery of the goods to a person in New Zealand: (ii) arranging or making easier the delivery of the goods to a person in New Zealand. 86. The test in s 20(3C) is that, for the purposes of s 20(3) of the GST Act, input tax may be deducted to the extent to which the goods or services are used for, or are available for use in, making taxable supplies. Consuming meals in one’s private capacity is not using goods or services in making taxable supplies. 87. The TRA case of Case P5 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,034 supports the view that input tax cannot be claimed for goods to the extent that they have been acquired for private or domestic use. Case P5 concerned the old “principal purpose” test for deducting input tax4. However, the TRA’s analysis at page 4,037 can also be applied to the new test for deducting input tax: 3 There are also administration requirements like holding a valid tax invoice (see s 20 of the GST Act). 4 “Input tax” meant the tax charged on the supply of goods and services made to a person where those goods and services were acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 43 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS The essential problem faced by the objector, in my view, is that his main use of the vehicle was to travel from his home on the farm to his chartered accountancy practice. There can be no doubt that such type of travel is not in the course of any business or taxable activity, but is for the purpose of getting the objector from his home to his office as a chartered accountant. The law is clear that the nature of such travel is private rather than business. This is because the travel is not in the course of any business but is aimed at conveying a person to the site where his business activity will commence that day. (Emphasis added.) 88. At page 4,038 the TRA concluded as follows: I find that the vehicle was not used for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies, and, therefore, in this case, was not acquired for that purpose. Accordingly, the input claimed is not allowable. 89. Although the case relates to the previous test for “input tax” (an all or nothing test for the initial deduction of “input tax”) the conclusion would also support the view that private use of goods or services would not be used for making taxable supplies. 90. In the limited circumstances where meal expenses are deductible, on the basis the expenses are not of a private or domestic nature, then similar reasoning would allow for GST input tax deductions. That is, if the meal expenses satisfy the general permission as being incurred in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income, then the goods or services are used for making taxable supplies. Such circumstances are relatively rare. 91. If the meal expenditure is subject to the entertainment expenditure regime, then the person is deemed to have supplied entertainment with a value equal to the amount of the deduction prevented under ss DD 1 and DD 2: ss 21I(4), (4B) and (5) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. This effectively means that input tax is only allowed to the extent that the entertainment expenditure regime does not apply. Examples 84. The following examples are intended to show how the law applies. Example 1 – Meal expenses of self-employed persons Rob is a self-employed engineer who specialises in repairing and maintaining complex machinery and manufacturing premises. He is based in Auckland, where most of his work takes place, but he also regularly travels up to Northland and down to the Waikato and Bay of Plenty to undertake specialist repairs. On occasions he has travelled further afield when required. Rob has a small office/workshop where he stores spare parts and consumables, and where his wife works doing the admin work for the business. The office has enough space for tea and coffee facilities and a microwave. Variation 1 – Travel around town Rob has a busy day travelling between three client sites in South Auckland, which is a fair distance from his office on the North Shore. As a result, he does not return to his office/workshop from the beginning of the day until the end of the day as it is not practical to do so. During the day, he buys takeaway coffee on a couple of occasions and also picks up lunch from a bakery near to where he is working. Rob asks if he can claim his coffee and lunch expenses as they were incurred in undertaking his income-earning process. Rob is unable to deduct his expenses as they are expenses of a private and domestic nature. Consistent with Case E80 and Case P1 these expenses were incurred to enable Rob to live rather than to earn income in the required statutory sense for s DA 1(1). The requirements of the job did not impose expenditure on Rob that would not have existed but for the job. Variation 2 – Travel on business The next day Rob has two jobs lined up in Rotorua. Due to the distance it takes to get to Rotorua and back, and the length of time taken to undertake the work, Rob does not make it back to Auckland until 9pm. As well as picking up a couple of cups of coffee and lunch (as in Variation 1) Rob eats his evening meal in Rotorua rather than waiting to get home. He asks whether any of his meal and drinks expenses are deductible. Again, Rob is unable to deduct these expenses as they are expenses of a private and domestic nature. They relate to living as an individual member of society (Haenga), and both Case A12 and Case B14 support non-deductibility. However, as Judge Barber recognized in Case E80, extra costs may be incurred when a taxpayer is required by their work to eat “out of town”. Evidence will need to be provided to indicate that such extra costs had been incurred and the quantum of such costs. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 44 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Variation 3 – Overnight travel on business The next week Rob has two days’ work in Hawkes Bay requiring him to stay a couple of nights away from home. He pays for breakfast at his motel, incurs expenditure on drinks and lunch during his working day, and eats out at a restaurant both nights he is away from his home. Is any of Rob’s expenditure deductible? On the face of it none of the meal and drinks expenditure is deductible because it is of a private and domestic nature. Rob may argue that being away from home has imposed an extra cost on him. However, his choosing to have his evening meal at a restaurant does not make Rob’s working conditions sufficiently unusual as described by Judge Barber in Case F117 when he said the taxpayer could claim extra food costs. The result is also consistent with the TRA decision in Case G57. Variation 4 – Remote travel on business A month later Rob is required to work for a couple of days on some machinery in a very remote part of New Zealand, where the only accommodation is not self-catering, and there are no supermarkets within reasonable travelling distance in any case. Rob is required to take his meals at the hotel he is staying at. Is any of Rob’s expenditure deductible? While the starting point is that meal expenditure is of a private and domestic nature, these circumstances are like those Judge Barber described in Case F117. Rob can argue that the cost of meals here reflects the extra food costs required by the unusual working conditions he finds himself in. The extra meal costs have a sufficient nexus with the earning of Rob’s income from fixing the machinery in the remote location, and there are no practical and realistic alternatives for accommodation and meals. Accordingly, the extra cost of the meals over and above Rob’s normal expenditure would be deductible. Rob calculates he would normally spend $15 on his evening meal, so any cost above this is deductible. Variation 5 – Employee expenses Rob employs Esther to help with the workload in his business. Esther has two days’ work in Hawkes Bay requiring her to stay a couple of nights away from home. Pursuant to the terms of her employment contract, Rob reimburses Esther for her meal expenses and also pays her a daily amount for light and liquid refreshments. How should Rob treat the payments to Esther for meals? As an employee expense Rob, will be able to deduct the amounts he is obliged to pay Esther under the employment contract. The private limitation will not apply to this expenditure. Rob should also treat the payments to Esther as exempt income either under section CW 17CB(2) (for the light and liquid refreshments) or section CW 17CB(3) (for reimbursements for meals). Example 2 – Meal expenses of employees Darlene is also an engineer who specialises in repairing and maintaining complex industrial machinery. She is employed by Fix It Quik Limited. Her place of work is Fix It Quik Limited’s work premises in Upper Hutt, but most of her work is undertaken at the premises of the customers of Fix It Quik Limited. As such she only spends time at her work premises at the beginning and end of the day, and if she needs to pick up spare parts or consumables during the day. Variation 1 – employee allowances Darlene has a full day travelling between five client sites in Wellington, a good distance from Fix It Quik Limited’s office in Upper Hutt. She does not check back into the office until the end of her working day. During the day she has bought a couple of takeaway coffees, and also buys lunch at a lunch bar near where she is working. Fix It Quik Limited pays Darlene a daily allowance of $15.00 to cover the costs of “light refreshments” and “liquid refreshments” which she would be able to enjoy if she was working at Fix It Quik Limited’s premises. The payment is for those days when she is working off premises. How should Fix It Quik Limited and Darlene treat this payment? Section CW 17CB allows payments for certain work-related meals to be exempt income. The payment can include a reimbursement payment or a meal allowance. Under s CW 17CB(2)(c) a “meal” includes light refreshments in the form of snack foods such as biscuits and fruit, or liquid refreshments such as tea, coffee, water, or similar refreshments. Under s CW 17CB(5) there is no time limit on expenditure incurred for meals covered by s CW 17CB(2) (for other meals there is a three month time limit). Accordingly, for Darlene the daily payments received are exempt income. For Fix It Quik Limited the expenditure is deductible as an expense incurred in the course of carrying on a business of deriving their assessable income (s DA 1(1)(b)). The private limitation does not apply to a company, so even though the expenditure relates to an employee’s “meals” the expenditure is not denied under the private limitation. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 45 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Variation 2 – employee reimbursements The next day Darlene has two jobs in Taihape. Due to the distance to get to Taihape and back and the length of time taken to undertake the work, Darlene does not get back home until 9pm. As well as buying a couple of cups of coffee and lunch (as in Example 1, Variation 2) Darlene eats her evening meal in Palmerston North rather than waiting to get home. Fix It Quik Limited’s work policy is to cover all meal costs when employees are sent on such “out of town” jobs. How should Darlene and Fix It Quik Limited treat the reimbursement payments for meals, light refreshments, and liquid refreshments? For Darlene, as in Variation 1, any payments for coffee and light refreshments will be exempt income under s CW 17CB(2). The payment for lunch will be exempt income under s CW 17CB(3) (“meals when travelling on business”), and the payment for dinner is exempt income under either s CW 17C(1) (payment for overtime meals) or under s CW 17CB(3) for the same reason as the payment for lunch. For Fix It Quik Limited the expenditure is deductible for the same reasons as in Variation 1, and similarly the private limitation does not apply to deny the deduction. Variation 3 – employee travelling out of town on business The next week Darlene is sent to Timaru for two days (and two nights) to service and repair some machinery. While she is in Timaru she stays at a motel with full kitchen facilities. Fix It Quik Limited reimburses Darlene for her meals while she is in Timaru according to company policy, and also pays a daily amount for light refreshments and liquid refreshments. Darlene claims reimbursement for lunch and dinner, and she eats out rather than preparing her own meals at the motel. How should Darlene and Fix it Quik Limited treat the payments for meals, light refreshments, and liquid refreshments? For Darlene, as in Variations 1 and 2, any allowance she receives for coffee and light refreshments will be exempt income under s CW 17CB(2). The reimbursements for lunch and dinner will be exempt income under s CW 17CB(3). If Darlene is just working normal hours while in Timaru the payments she receives will not come within the rules for overtime meals under s CW 17C(1). For Fix It Quik Limited the expenditure is deductible for the same reasons as in Variations 1 and 2, and similarly the private limitation does not apply to deny the deduction. Variation 4 – employee’s remote travel on business A month later Darlene is required to spend a couple of nights on a remote offshore island to repair and maintain machinery. The only accommodation at the island is a luxury resort. There is no self-catering accommodation and no supermarkets on the island. Darlene is paid an allowance for light refreshments and liquid refreshments and is reimbursed for the cost of all meals. How should Darlene and Fix It Quik Limited treat the payments for meals, light refreshments, and liquid refreshments? There is no difference in this example from Variation 3. The reimbursing payments and allowances are exempt for Darlene and the payments are deductible to Fix It Quik Limited. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 46 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Example 3 – Entertainment expenditure for self-employed Variation 1 – providing hospitality for clients Rob is finding that his market for machinery repair and maintenance in Auckland is under threat from a newcomer in the form of Fix It Quik Limited. Rob decides he needs to work harder on maintaining customer loyalty and begins taking the key people at his most important clients out to dinner. Every Wednesday night he takes one group out for dinner and drinks. Rob asks if he can claim a deduction for the expense of providing this hospitality to his clients. Rob’s deduction of expenses will be subject to the entertainment expenditure regime in subpart DD of the Act. The expenditure is covered by the regime by virtue of s DD 2(5) (deductions for expenditure on food and drink that a person provides off their business premises). The operative rule for entertainment expenditure is in s DD 1(2). This provides that the person is denied a deduction for expenditure that they incur on entertainment except for 50% of the amount that they would have been allowed in the absence of s DD 1(2). But for the entertainment expenditure rules Rob would have been allowed a deduction for the hospitality expenditure he has incurred (treating the private benefit of a meal to Rob as incidental to the business purpose, Case P1). Therefore, section DD 1(2) allows Rob to claim 50% of the full meal expenditure incurred in taking his clients out for dinner. If Rob had just been eating out by himself, he would not have been able to deduct any amount of the meal expenditure. It may seem anomalous that by eating out with business contacts he is, in effect, able to deduct 50% of his meal. However, the limitation rule means that Rob is unlikely to be in a better overall position under the entertainment expenditure regime as he will be denied 50% of the deduction he would have otherwise been allowed for the expenditure incurred for his customers. Variation 2 – providing hospitality to friends On a Friday night Rob often gets together with a group of other self-employed persons from the business park where his office/workshop is located. They go to a local bar and have a few drinks and often a meal too. Rob’s friends Brent and Richard have been struggling financially recently as a result of a downturn in business so Rob shouts them a meal at the bar, and also pays for a round of drinks for them and the rest of the group. Rob asks if he can claim a deduction for the expense of providing these meals and drinks. He also asks if the entertainment expenditure regime applies. Rob cannot deduct the cost of providing meals to his two friends (and himself) and for shouting a round of drinks to the group. Such expenditure has no nexus to either deriving his income or to carrying on his business for the purpose of deriving income. It is a private expense and does not satisfy the general permission. As for the entertainment expenditure regime, because the expenditure would not have been allowed in the absence of section DD 1(2) there is no ability to claim 50% of the expenditure under that regime. Example 4 – Entertainment expenditure for employers Fix It Quik Limited realises that to break into the lucrative Auckland machinery repair market it needs to “wine and dine” the key people at certain industrial plants. Darlene is sent to Auckland to introduce herself to some of these key people and to take them out for dinner and drinks. Can Fix It Quik Limited deduct all the costs of the hospitality provided? The limitation rule in s DD 1(2) of the entertainment expenditure regime applies in the same way for Darlene and Fix It Quik Limited as it did for Rob in Example 3. The expenditure on the meals and drinks is entertainment expenditure under s DD 2(5) and only 50% of the expenditure is allowed by s DD 1(2). Section DD 4(1) provides that the limitation rule does not apply for expenditure on food or drink consumed by a person while travelling in the course of business or for their employment duty. However, the limitation rule continues to apply if, among other things, the food or drink is consumed at a meal or function involving an existing or potential business contact as a guest (s DD 4(1)(b)) as is the case here. This same principle applies for Rob in Example 3. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 47 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Example 5 – Meal expenses of a shareholder-employee Meg and John are the only shareholders of Brooke’s Books Limited, a provider of bookkeeping services. Meg is employed by the company and often travels to conferences and seminars to promote the business. Pursuant to her employment agreement with the company, she is entitled to reimbursement for her meal expenses while away from home on company business and is also entitled to a daily allowance for light refreshments and liquid refreshments. On Meg’s most recent business trip to a conference, John also attends to get a better idea of what occurs at these type of events and the company pays for all his meal expenses as well. John is not an employee of the company and is not related to Meg. How should Brooke’s Books Limited treat the payments it makes to Meg and John for their meals? As Meg is genuinely undertaking her employment duties for Brooke’s Books Limited, the treatment of her expenditure would be the same as the treatment of Darlene in Variation 3 of Example 2. That is, the allowance for light and liquid refreshments can be treated as exempt income of Meg under section CW 17CB(2), and the reimbursements for meals will be exempt income under section CW 17CB(3). The amounts paid will be deductible to Brooke’s Books Limited and the private limitation will not apply. In John’s case none of the exempt allowance provisions can apply as John is not an employee of the company. Instead, the payment of John’s meal expenses by the company is likely to give rise to a deemed dividend (see interpretation statement IS 21/05 “Non-cash dividends”, paragraph 20 and example 5, for more discussion of this issue).

They are published here as they may be of general interest to readers. QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED QB 21/05: The application date for the depreciation of commercial buildings Question When do the new rules providing for the depreciation for commercial buildings apply from: 1 April 2020 or from the beginning of the 2020 – 2021 income year? Answer The new rules for depreciation for commercial buildings apply from the beginning of the 2020-21 income year for all taxpayers. Explanation 1. Prior to the passing of the COVID-19 Response (Taxation and Social Assistance Urgent Measures) Act 2020 (the Amendment Act), taxpayers were not able to claim a depreciation loss in respect of any building. By amending the existing legislation and making this limitation specific to residential buildings, the amendment now allows owners of commercial buildings to claim depreciation 5 . 2. Unless it is anticipated that an Act will commence on the day after it is given Royal Assent, all Acts must be given a commencement date. 6 The commencement date is the day that the Act comes into force. 3. In the case of the Amendment Act, the commencement date is stated as being the date on which it was given Royal Assent, EXCEPT in relation to some specific sections 7 . These excepted sections include the sections that allows depreciation to now be claimed on commercial buildings. The commencement date for these sections is stated to be 1 April 2020 8 . 4. Having a commencement date of 1 April can be problematic for a taxpayer with a balance date prior to 1 April as it would mean that the legislation would only apply for part of their 2020 – 2021 income year. To overcome this, it is quite usual to supplement the commencement date to ensure that the relevant provisions apply from the beginning of a particular income year (no matter what balance date a taxpayer has). In this instance, having the provision apply from the beginning of an income year means that taxpayers with early balance dates are not disadvantaged or inconvenienced by, for instance, having to undertake apportionment of the depreciation loss. 5. In the case of the Amendment Act, the amendments specific to commercial building depreciation are stated as applying “for the 2020-21 and later income years” 9 . 6. This is consistent with statements made in the commentary to the Amendment Act, which stated that the proposed amendment would apply for the 2020–21 income year. 7. This result is also consistent with statements made in the commentary to the Amendment Act regarding the repeal of s DB 65. This section previously allowed a deduction for commercial fit-out not previously separately depreciated. With the reintroduction of depreciation on commercial buildings s DB 65 is no longer required. As with the statement made in the commentary discussed at \[6\], the commentary to the Amendment Act that discusses the repeal of s DB 65 states that the section is repealed with effect from the 2020 – 21 income year. 5 Sections EE 31, EE 31(2)(d) and EE 31(3)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007. 6 Section 8 of the Interpretation Act 1999. 7 Section 2(1) of the Amendment Act. 8 Section 2(5) of the Amendment Act. 9 Section 5(4) of the Amendment Act. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 49 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED Examples 8. The following examples illustrate when the new rules reintroducing depreciation for commercial buildings will apply from. Early balance date Early Worm Limited has a 30 November balance date. The new rules reintroducing depreciation for commercial buildings will apply from 1 December 2019, which is the first day of the company’s 2020-21 income year. Standard balance date Ordinary Limited has a 31 March balance date. The new rules reintroducing depreciation for commercial buildings will apply from 1 April 2020, which is the first day of the company’s 2020-21 income year. Late balance date Night Owl Limited has a 30 June balance date. The new rules reintroducing depreciation for commercial buildings will apply from 1 July 2020, which is the first day of the company’s 2020-21 income year.

Answer The receipt of airdropped cryptoassets is taxable where a person: • • has a cryptoasset business; • • acquired the cryptoassets as part of a profit-making undertaking or scheme; • • provided services to receive the airdrop (and the cryptoassets are payment for the services provided); or • • receives airdrops on a regular basis, and the receipt has hallmarks of income. In other cases, the receipt is not taxable. The disposal of airdropped cryptoassets is taxable where a person: • • has a cryptoasset business; • • disposed of the cryptoassets as part of a profit-making undertaking or scheme; • • provided services to receive the airdrop; or • • acquired the cryptoassets for the purpose of disposing of them. In many cases, the disposal will be taxable. However, in some cases outlined in this item, airdropped cryptoassets may be passively acquired and will not be acquired for the purpose of disposal. Key terms Airdrop is described at \[1\] below. Cryptoassets are cryptographically secured digital representations of value that can be transferred, stored or traded electronically. They use some form of distributed ledger technology such as blockchain. Cryptoassets may also commonly be referred to as cryptocurrencies, digital tokens or virtual currencies. Cryptoasset business is a business that uses cryptoassets as part of its day-to-day activities, such as an exchange, a cryptoasset dealing business or a mining business. Disposal includes selling cryptoassets for money, exchanging them for other cryptoassets or using them to acquire goods or services. Explanation What is an airdrop? 1. Airdrops are “the distribution of tokens without compensation (i.e. for free), generally undertaken with a view to increasing awareness of a new token, particularly amongst ‘influencers’, and to increase liquidity in the early stages of a new token p r o j e c t ”. 10 For example, the purpose of an airdrop may be to: ••increase the supply of a cryptoasset in the market; ••reward early investors or users; or ••raise awareness of a new cryptoasset by distributing that cryptoasset to holders of other cryptoassets. 10 OECD Taxing Virtual Currencies, an Overview of Tax Treatments and Emerging Tax Policy Issues (OECD, Paris, 2020) at 1.2.2. For the avoidance of doubt, this item does not apply to the receipt of new cryptoassets from a hard fork which is addressed in a related item, QB 21/07. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 51 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED The ways a person may be entitled to receive an airdrop 2. The ways people become entitled to receive airdrops of cryptoassets differ. For example: ••Early users of a platform may be rewarded for previous use (for example, in the Uniswap airdrop, users of a decentralised exchange received airdrops of UNI tokens if they had provided liquidity or traded on the exchange before a specified date). ••People who hold one type of cryptoasset may receive airdrops of another type of cryptoasset (for example, in the Ontology airdrop, people who held NEO tokens at a specified date were airdropped ONT tokens). ••Airdrops of cryptoassets may also be received by people who undertake minor tasks such as following the cryptoasset on social media, making referrals or signing up to an airdrop or newsletter (for example, Stellar Lumens (XLM) were airdropped to blockchain.com wallet holders who signed up to the airdrop and verified their identity, and ONT tokens were airdropped to people who signed up to a newsletter). The ways a person may claim airdropped cryptoassets 3. The steps required to claim an airdrop once a person is entitled to it depend on the circumstances. For instance, a person may need to: ••click to claim the airdropped cryptoassets and pay a transaction fee (for example, UNI); ••download a new wallet and pay a transaction fee (for example, ONT); or ••do nothing further (for example, blockchain.com wallet holders who received XLM). Is the receipt of airdropped cryptoassets taxable? 4. When a person receives airdropped cryptoassets, the first question is whether that receipt is taxable. As explained below, in most cases the receipt of airdropped cryptoassets is unlikely to be taxable. Business income 5. An amount a person derives from a business is their income unless the amount is of a capital nature (s CB 1). An “amount” includes money’s worth. Cryptoassets, while not money, are money’s worth, so the receipt of cryptoassets could be an amount derived from a business. The question is whether the amount is derived from the current operations of the business, in the ordinary course of the business, or as an ordinary incident of the business. 11 The answer to this question depends on the nature of the business and its relationship with the cryptoassets. 6. The receipt of airdropped cryptoassets is likely to be in the ordinary course, or an ordinary incident, of cryptoasset businesses (such as mining or dealing businesses) but would not generally be an ordinary incident of other types of businesses. Whether receipt occurs in the ordinary course, or as an ordinary incident, of a business will depend on the type of business and the way in which it earns income. The receipt of airdropped cryptoassets would be taxable if the receipt could be said to be part of the way in which the business earns its income. 7. Airdropped cryptoassets may form part of the trading stock of a cryptoasset business if they are held for sale or exchange in the ordinary course of the business. Profit-making undertaking or scheme 8. An amount a person derives from a profit-making undertaking or scheme is income of the person (s CB 3). An undertaking or scheme is a series of steps directed to an end result. There needs to be a plan or purpose that is coherent and has some unity of conception. The undertaking or scheme must be carried out for the dominant purpose of making a profit. 12 9. The receipt of airdropped cryptoassets could be income from a profit-making undertaking or scheme if the person has a plan directed at acquiring airdropped cryptoassets with the dominant purpose of making a profit. Income under ordinary concepts 10. An amount may also be taxable if it is income under ordinary concepts (s CA 1(2)). Income is commonly described as something that “comes in” to a person. Factors relevant for deciding whether something is income include whether payments are regular or recurrent, the relationship between the payer and payee, and the purpose of the payment. 13 11 CIR v City Motor Service Ltd; CIR v Napier Motors Ltd \[1969\] NZLR 1,010 (CA) and AA Finance Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,383 (CA). 12 Investment & Merchant Finance v FCT (1970) CLR 177 (HCA); Vuleta v CIR \[1962\] NZLR 325 (SC); Duff v CIR (1982) 5 NZTC 61,131 (CA) and Case S86 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,538 (TRA). 13 See Tennant v Smith (1892) 3 TC 158 (HL); CIR v Grover (1988) 10 NZTC 5,012 (CA) and Reid v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,176 (CA). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 52 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED 11. Where airdrops are not regular and where no relationship exists between the payer and recipient (for example, the recipient has not performed services to receive the airdropped cryptoassets), the receipts would not generally be ordinary income. Summary 12. The receipt of airdropped cryptoassets will be taxable where the cryptoassets are received: ••by a cryptoasset business (if received as an ordinary incident of the way in which the business earns its income); ••as part of a profit making undertaking or scheme; or ••by a person who has provided services or receives airdrops on a regular basis such that the airdrops have the hallmarks of income. 13. In other cases, the receipt is not taxable. Is the disposal of airdropped cryptoassets taxable? 14. The second question is whether a disposal of airdropped cryptoassets is taxable. As discussed below, whether a disposal is taxable will depend on the person’s circumstances. Business income 15. Amounts received from disposing of airdropped cryptoassets will be taxable income of cryptoasset businesses (such as mining and dealing businesses) as the disposal will likely be the sale of their trading stock or otherwise income from a business. 16. The disposal of airdropped cryptoassets by other types of businesses is unlikely to be taxable under s CB 1, unless disposing of cryptoassets is something that occurs in the ordinary course of the business. However, the disposal may still be taxable under other provisions such as s CB 4. Profit-making undertaking or scheme 17. There may be instances where the disposal of airdropped cryptoassets is part of a profit-making undertaking or scheme, in which case the amount derived from the disposal will be income under s CB 3. This will be fact specific. Acquired for the purpose of disposal 18. An amount derived from disposing of personal property is income if the person acquired the property for the purpose of disposing of it (s CB 4). The decision in Ruscoe clarified that cryptoassets can be property. 14 19. For s CB 4 to apply, disposal must be the person’s dominant purpose for acquiring the property. 15 The Commissioner’s general position is that, in most cases, cryptoassets will be acquired for the purpose of disposal and a person will need to provide clear and compelling evidence to show otherwise. 16 20. Where a person passively acquires property, for example, by inheritance or gift, they generally do not have a purpose when acquiring that property. However, a person will not be regarded as a passive recipient where they have turned their mind to the acquisition or provided consideration. 17 21. A person acquires cryptoassets from an airdrop when the person has possession and control of the cryptoassets and can deal with them. This is when the person holds the private key (or otherwise holds the cryptoassets on an exchange). Accordingly, all steps and actions of the person up until that time are relevant for determining what the person’s purpose was when that cryptoasset was acquired. At that time, the person generally has had to turn their mind to completing an action to become entitled to receive an airdrop. Situations where a person turns their mind to acquiring airdropped cryptoassets 22. As previously stated, a person may receive an entitlement to an airdrop for performing various small tasks such as signing up to airdrops, opting in, making referrals and mentioning the cryptoasset on social media. They may also need to acquire particular types of cryptoassets or download wallets in order to be eligible for an airdrop. 14 Ruscoe v Cryptopia Ltd (in liq) \[2020\] NZHC 728 (HC). 15 CIR v National Distributors Ltd (1989) 11 NZTC 6,346 (CA). 16 See Inland Revenue, Cryptoassets (https://www.ird.govt.nz/cryptoassets). 17 Case F41 74 ATC 227 (Board of Review); FCT v Miranda 76 ATC 4180 (NSWSC); Tikva Investments Pty Ltd v FCT 72 ATC 4,231 (HCA). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 53 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED 23. When a person has had to take these types of steps, whether by acquiring cryptoassets or wallets to be eligible for an airdrop, or performing small tasks or signing up to something, they have turned their mind to the acquisition of the cryptoassets and will have a purpose in acquiring the cryptoassets. Section CB 4 will apply if the person acquired the airdropped cryptoassets for the purpose of disposal. 24. As noted at \[21\], because a cryptoasset is acquired for tax purposes when a person has control over it, all the steps taken up to that time are relevant for determining whether they have a purpose at the time of acquisition. A purpose can be determined where the person has had to turn their mind to acquiring the cryptoassets in some way. This includes situations where the person: ••acquires cryptoassets in advance of an airdrop, in order to be entitled to the airdrop; ••uses a platform with the expectation or knowledge that they might receive an airdrop; ••transfers their cryptoassets to a supporting wallet to ensure they are eligible for an airdrop; ••signs up, opts in, joins a newsletter, mentions the cryptoasset on social media or does other minor tasks in order to be eligible to receive the airdrop. In these cases, s CB 4 will apply where the person’s purpose in acquiring the airdropped cryptoassets is to dispose of them. Situations where a person has not had to turn their mind to claim the cryptoassets 25. It is possible that a purpose may not be able to be determined in some limited cases. This includes where a person: ••receives airdropped cryptoassets to their existing wallet simply because they already held that type of wallet, or a type of cryptoasset, and did not have to do anything to be entitled to them or claim them; or ••had previously used a platform without any knowledge of an airdrop occurring, received an airdrop because of those previous actions, and only had minimal steps to claim the cryptoassets (such as clicking to claim the cryptoassets). 26. In these types of events, whether a purpose can be established depends on the extent to which the person knew of an airdrop, and also whether they needed to do anything further to claim the cryptoassets (such as signing up or opting in, downloading new wallets or other tasks). If the person simply needs to click to claim the cryptoassets, this is not likely, in and of itself, to be enough for the person to have turned their mind to the acquisition. 18 For completeness, if a person starts actively undertaking tasks (such as using platforms) hopeful for an airdrop, they have likely done enough for their acquisition to be considered active. Summary 27. Whether the disposal of airdropped cryptoassets is taxable depends on the circumstances. The disposal will be taxable where the person: ••has a cryptoasset business; ••disposed of the cryptoassets as part of a profit-making undertaking or scheme; ••provided services to receive the airdrop; or ••acquired the cryptoassets for the purpose of disposing of them. Are any deductions available? 28. The third question is whether deductions are available if any amounts are taxable. As discussed below, generally no deductions are available as no expenditure is usually incurred in acquiring airdropped cryptoassets. However, deductions will be available where cryptoassets are taxed on receipt and also on disposal. The cost of the cryptoassets 29. Where the receipt or disposal of cryptoassets is taxable, deductions for expenditure incurred may be available (s DA 1 or s DB 23). However, other than transaction fees, no other expenditure is incurred when a person receives cryptoassets from an airdrop. Therefore, no deduction (other than for transaction fees) will generally be available. 30. However, when a person is taxed on both the receipt and disposal of a cryptoasset then a deduction for the cost of the cryptoasset is available at the time of disposal (ss DB 23 and EA 2). Where a person is taxed on receipt and disposal, the cost of acquiring that cryptoasset can take into account the value of the cryptoasset at the time of receipt (which the person paid tax on). Allowing a cost for this amount ensures the person is not effectively taxed twice on the initial value of the cryptoasset. 19 18 See for example Case F41 74 ATC 227 (Board of Review) where the taxpayer did not “exercise his mind in any way to acquire rights”. 19 This is considered consistent with comments made in Tasman Forestry Ltd v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,147 (CA), Sharkey v Wernher \[1956\] AC 58 (HL); Halliwell v CIR (1991) 13 NZTC 8,197; and Rangatira Ltd v CIR (1996) 17 NZTC 12,727. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 54 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED Trading stock rules 31. Airdropped cryptoassets that form trading stock of a business may also be taxable on receipt and on disposal. For the same reasons as above, a person who holds trading stock that is taxable both on receipt and on disposal may claim a deduction for the cost of those cryptoassets, relating to the value on receipt (which the person paid tax on). This deduction may be claimed in the year the receipt is returned as income. The person must then value the trading stock at the end of each income year under the trading stock rules (in Part E of the Act). 32. Standard valuation methods apply to the valuation of trading stock. There are no special rules for cryptoassets, so a person may use whatever method is available to them. However, the value of any trading stock that is an excepted financial arrangement must be valued at cost. 20 If a person uses a different method, they must satisfy all the requirements of the method. There may be difficulties in satisfying methods that refer to a normal value of property (or an amount that would be expected to be received) due to the volatility of cryptoasset prices. Examples Example 1: Beth signs up for airdrops Beth had been following some recent airdrops. She started signing up to upcoming airdrops that she read about online, hoping she could make some money from them. Beth received small airdrops from signing up online to projects, but the transaction fees were too expensive, so she never took any steps to acquire them. The cryptoassets from those airdrops have not been acquired and there are no tax consequences. Beth read about an upcoming airdrop where holders of ABC tokens would receive airdrops of DEF tokens. Beth thought the DEF airdrop sounded like it could be a good deal, and so she acquired the ABC tokens and signed up to the airdrop which included filling in some personal information for Know Your Customer purposes. Beth received an airdrop of 350 DEF tokens and claimed them. This receipt is not taxable. Several months later, the DEF tokens had increased in value, so Beth exchanged all her DEF tokens for ETH and immediately cashed out. This disposal of the DEF tokens is taxable under s CB 4. Beth had turned her mind to acquiring the DEF tokens and did so for the purpose of disposing of them. Example 2: Beth receives airdrops unexpectedly A year later, a further airdrop of ABC-Z tokens was announced to all holders of ABC tokens. Beth still held her ABC tokens. She had given up on airdrops as they were not as lucrative as she had hoped. Beth did not need to do anything to receive the ABC-Z airdrop as she already held the ABC tokens, and the ABC-Z airdrop did not require a person sign up or opt in. She only had to click a button to claim them. Beth did not acquire the ABC-Z tokens for the dominant purpose of disposal in this instance as she did not have to turn her mind in any way to receiving the ABC-Z tokens. Accordingly, any subsequent disposal of the ABC-Z tokens would not be taxable under s CB 4. 20 Cryptoassets are currently proposed to be included as excepted financial arrangements (with retrospective effect), so cost appears the most appropriate valuation method. Cost will be the only appropriate method once any legislative change is enacted.

Answer The receipt of cryptoassets from a hard fork is taxable where a person: • • has a cryptoasset business; or • • acquired the cryptoassets as part of a profit-making undertaking or scheme. • • In other cases, the receipt is not taxable. The disposal of cryptoassets that were received from a hard fork is taxable where a person: • • has a cryptoasset business; • • disposed of the cryptoassets as part of a profit-making undertaking or scheme; • • acquired the cryptoassets for the purpose of disposing of them; or • • acquired the original cryptoassets for the purpose of disposing of them (where the person receives the new cryptoassets through an exchange). In most cases, the disposal will be taxable. Key terms Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology, providing a digital record of transactions that is shared and maintained by users across a network. Cryptoassets are cryptographically secured digital representations of value that can be transferred, stored or traded electronically. They use some form of distributed ledger technology such as blockchain. Cryptoassets may also commonly be referred to as cryptocurrencies, digital tokens or virtual currencies. Cryptoasset business is a business that uses cryptoassets as part of its day-to-day activities, such as an exchange, a cryptoasset dealing business or a mining business. Disposal includes selling cryptoassets for money, exchanging them for other cryptoassets or using them to acquire goods or services. Hard fork is described at \[1\] below. Explanation What is a hard fork? 1. A hard fork has been described as follows: 21 As the rules relating to the functioning of each type of virtual currency are established by the underlying protocol that is shared by all of the users of that token, most changes to how the token functions requires a change to that protocol. These might be for example changes that would improve the speed at which transactions can be processed by changing how much information can be included in each block on the chain. 21 OECD Taxing Virtual Currencies, an Overview of Tax Treatments and Emerging Tax Policy Issues (OECD, Paris, 2020) at 1.2.2. This item deals with the income tax consequences of receiving new cryptoassets from a hard fork. Forks that do not result in a new cryptoasset being received (for example, a soft fork) are not relevant for the purposes of this item. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 57 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED These changes are known as forks in the chain and require users to update the protocol software they are running. In order to implement a fork, a majority of users running the protocol must agree to the change. There are two main types of fork: • • A hard fork (sometimes also referred to as a “chain split”) changes the protocol code to create a new version of the blockchain alongside the old version, thus creating a new token which operates under the rules of the amended protocol while the original token continues to operate under the existing protocol. One example of this was the July 2017 hard fork of Bitcoin that saw the creation of the Bitcoin Cash token alongside Bitcoin... • • A soft fork also updates the protocol, however, it is intended to be adopted by all users on the network and thus no new coin is expected to be created (e.g. the August 2017 Segwit fork to the Bitcoin protocol). 2. A person who holds the original cryptoassets in a wallet or on an exchange that supports the hard fork at the time the fork occurs will generally have the right to an equivalent value of new cryptoassets on the new blockchain. Holding cryptoassets on an exchange that supports the hard fork 3. Generally, a person who holds their cryptoassets on an exchange will receive the new cryptoassets only if the exchange supports the hard fork. In that case, the person may receive the new cryptoassets by way of a credit to their account without doing anything. Holding cryptoassets on an exchange or in a wallet that does not support the hard fork 4. Where a person holds their cryptoassets on an exchange, in a wallet that does not support the fork or in a cold wallet (that is, offline), they may not receive an entitlement to the new cryptoassets from the hard fork. 5. To be entitled to the new cryptoassets from the hard fork, the person will need to move their original cryptoassets onto an exchange or wallet that supports the hard fork before the ‘snapshot date’. This may incur transaction fees or exchange fees. 6. When the original cryptoassets are held on an exchange or in a wallet that supports the hard fork prior to the snapshot, the person will generally become entitled to the cryptoassets after the snapshot has occurred. 7. Unless the person holds their cryptoassets on an exchange which supported the fork and has received a credit to their account, the person will then need to decide whether they undertake the necessary steps to get possession and control of the new cryptoassets. These steps may include the following: ••downloading the new cryptoasset’s wallet and syncing the new blockchain; ••importing private keys; and ••transferring cryptoassets between wallets at various stages (eg, for security reasons). Transaction fees are usually payable for such transfers. Is the receipt of the new cryptoassets taxable? 8. When a person receives cryptoassets from a hard fork, the first question is whether that receipt is taxable. As explained below, in most cases the receipt of new cryptoassets from a hard fork is unlikely to be taxable. Business income 9. An amount a person derives from a business is their income unless the amount is of a capital nature (s CB 1). An “amount” includes money’s worth. Cryptoassets, while not money, are money’s worth, so the receipt of cryptoassets could be an amount derived from a business. The question is whether the amount is derived from the current operations of the business, in the ordinary course of the business, or as an ordinary incident of the business. 22 The answer to this question depends on the nature of the business and its relationship with the cryptoassets. 10. The receipt of cryptoassets from a hard fork is likely to be in the ordinary course, or an ordinary incident, of cryptoasset businesses (such as mining or dealing businesses) but would not generally be an ordinary incident of other types of businesses. Whether receipt occurs in the ordinary course, or as an ordinary incident, of a business will depend on the type of business and the way in which it earns income. The receipt of new cryptoassets from a hard fork would be taxable if the receipt could be said to be part of the way in which the business earns its income. 11. A business that is not actively involved in cryptoassets as part of its day to day business may hold cryptoassets for various reasons. For example, it may receive cryptoassets as a payment provided for goods (a barter transaction). Where such a business receives new cryptoassets from a hard fork, the new cryptoassets are unlikely to be connected to the current 22 CIR v City Motor Service Ltd; CIR v Napier Motors Ltd \[1969\] NZLR 1,010 (CA) and AA Finance Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,383 (CA). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 58 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED operations or be an ordinary incident of many non-cryptoasset businesses. However, this may depend on the nature of the business and the extent to which the operations of the business involve receiving payments in cryptoassets. 12. Cryptoassets received from a hard fork may form part of the trading stock of a cryptoasset business if they are held for trade or exchange in the ordinary course of the business. Profit-making undertaking or scheme 13. An amount a person derives from a profit-making undertaking or scheme is income of the person (s CB 3). An undertaking or scheme is a series of steps directed to an end result. There needs to be a plan or purpose that is coherent and has some unity of conception. The undertaking or scheme must be carried out for the dominant purpose of making a profit. 23 14. The receipt of cryptoassets from a hard fork could be income from a profit-making undertaking or scheme if the person has a plan directed at acquiring cryptoassets that are undergoing a hard fork, with the dominant purpose of making a profit. Income under ordinary concepts 15. An amount will also be taxable where it is income under ordinary concepts (s CA 1(2)). Income is commonly described as something that “comes in” to a person. Factors that are relevant for deciding whether something is income include whether payments are regular or recurrent, the relationship between the payer and payee, and the purpose of the payment. 24 16. It is unlikely that the receipt of new cryptoassets from a hard fork would occur often enough to be considered regular or recurrent. In addition, there is generally no relationship between the “payer” (the blockchain) and recipients who may do nothing other than hold the original cryptoasset at the time of the fork; nor could there be said to be a particular purpose for making a payment of the new cryptoassets to the particular recipients. Summary 17. The receipt of new cryptoassets from a hard fork is taxable where they are received: ••by a cryptoasset business (if received as an ordinary incident of the way in which the business earns its income); or ••as part of a profit-making undertaking or scheme. 18. In other cases, the receipt is not taxable. Is the disposal of the new cryptoassets taxable? 19. The second question is whether the disposal of cryptoassets received from a hard fork is taxable. As discussed below, whether a disposal is taxable will depend on the person’s circumstances. In most cases, disposals will be taxable. Business income 20. Amounts received from disposing of cryptoassets that were received from a hard fork will be taxable income of cryptoasset businesses (such as mining and dealing businesses) as the disposal will likely be the sale of their trading stock or otherwise income from a business. 21. The disposal of cryptoassets received from a hard fork by other types of businesses is unlikely to be taxable under s CB 1 unless disposing of cryptoassets is something that occurs in the ordinary course of the business. However, the disposal may still be taxable under other provisions such as s CB 4. Profit-making undertaking or scheme 22. There may be instances where a disposal of cryptoassets received from a hard fork are part of a profit-making undertaking or scheme, in which case the amount derived from the disposal will be income under s CB 3. This will be fact specific. Acquired for the purpose of disposal 23. An amount derived from disposing of personal property is income if the person acquired the property for the purpose of disposing of it (s CB 4). The decision in Ruscoe clarified that cryptoassets can be property. 25 23 Investment & Merchant Finance v FCT (1970) CLR 177 (HCA); Vuleta v CIR \[1962\] NZLR 325 (SC); Duff v CIR (1982) 5 NZTC 61,131 (CA); and Case S86 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,538 (TRA). 24 See Tennant v Smith (1892) 3 TC 158 (HL); CIR v Grover (1988) 10 NZTC 5,012 (CA) and Reid v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,176 (CA). 25 Ruscoe v Cryptopia Ltd (in liq) \[2020\] NZHC 728; (2020) 5 NZTR 30-001. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 59 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED 24. For s CB 4 to apply, disposal must be the person’s dominant purpose for acquiring the property. 26 The Commissioner’s general position is that in most cases cryptoassets will be acquired for the dominant purpose of disposal, unless a person can provide clear and compelling evidence to show otherwise. 27 25. Where a person passively acquires property, for example, by inheritance or gift, they generally do not have a purpose when acquiring that property. However, a person will not be regarded as a passive recipient where they have turned their mind to acquisition or provided consideration. 28 26. A person acquires cryptoassets from a hard fork when the person has possession and control of the cryptoassets and can deal with them. This is when the person holds the private key (or otherwise has the cryptoassets credited to their account on an exchange). Accordingly, all steps and actions of the person up until that time are relevant for determining what the person’s purpose was when that cryptoasset was acquired. At that time, the person generally has had to turn their mind to whether they take possession of the cryptoassets. Situations where a person turns their mind to acquiring the cryptoassets 27. As previously stated, a person receives an entitlement to the new cryptoassets where they held the original cryptoassets on a relevant exchange or wallet that supported the hard fork at the snapshot. 28. In some cases, people will need to acquire eligible cryptoassets or transfer their cryptoassets on to a relevant wallet or exchange in order to be eligible for the hard fork. When a person has had to do this, they have turned their mind to the acquisition of the cryptoassets and will have a purpose in acquiring the cryptoassets. Section CB 4 will apply if they acquired those cryptoassets for the purpose of disposal. 29. Even where a person does not have to buy or transfer original cryptoassets (because they are already held in a supporting wallet), claiming the cryptoassets still requires a decision to be made, and several steps undertaken. Usually, a decision is involved as to whether or not to claim the cryptoassets from the hard fork. There may be issues with security, the hard fork may fail and/or the cryptoassets may have limited value. 30. Once a person has made the decision to claim the new cryptoassets, they generally: ••download a new wallet and sync the blockchain; ••transfer their original cryptoassets out of the original wallet to avoid any security issues (although this is not mandatory) and pay transaction fees; and ••import their private keys into the new wallet. 31. A person turns their mind in some way to acquiring cryptoassets when they make the decision to claim the cryptoassets and undertake the above steps. As noted at \[26\], because a cryptoasset is acquired for tax purposes when a person has control over it, all the steps taken up to that time are relevant for determining whether they have a purpose at the time of acquisition. A purpose may be determined where the person has had to turn their mind to acquiring the cryptoassets in some way. Section CB 4 will apply to tax the disposal of the cryptoassets if they were acquired for the purpose of disposal. 32. In summary, a purpose on acquisition can be determined where a person has had to turn their mind to claim their cryptoassets. This includes situations where the person: ••acquires original cryptoassets in order to be entitled to the new cryptoassets from the hard fork; ••transfers their cryptoassets to a supporting exchange or wallet to ensure they are eligible (prior to the snapshot); or ••makes a decision to claim the cryptoassets, downloads the new wallet and undertakes steps to claim the new cryptoassets. In these cases, s CB 4 will apply where the person’s purpose in acquiring cryptoassets is to dispose of them. As stated above, all steps and actions of the person up until they have possession and control of the cryptoasset are relevant for determining the person’s purpose on acquisition. Situations where a person has not had to turn their mind to claim the cryptoassets 33. There are situations where a person may not have to specifically turn their mind to claiming the cryptoassets from a hard fork. This is where they hold the cryptoassets on an exchange that supports the fork, and the cryptoassets are credited 26 CIR v National Distributors Ltd (1989) 11 NZTC 6,346 (CA). 27 See https://www.ird.govt.nz/cryptoassets. 28 Case F41 74 ATC 227 (Board of Review); FCT v Miranda 76 ATC 4180 (NSWSC); Tikva Investments Pty Ltd v FCT 72 ATC 4231 (HCA). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 60 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED to their account. In this event, it is still possible to attribute a purpose on acquisition of the new cryptoassets, being the purpose for which the original cryptoassets were acquired. 34. The same purpose can be attributed in this situation due to the relationship between the two blockchains - both carrying the same transactional history up to a point in time. The new blockchain and its cryptoassets are derived from the same property as the original blockchain and its cryptoassets, generally with only a change to the existing protocol (such as different block sizes) being the event triggering the hard fork. A hard fork could objectively be said to be an anticipated consequence and a normal feature of decentralised blockchains (such as Bitcoin), where users can propose protocol changes (for example, proposing a different consensus protocol, or different block sizes). 29 It is also likely that the value of the new blockchain and its cryptoassets is derived to an extent from the existing blockchain (at least at the time of the fork). 35. Accordingly, treatment under s CB 4 is similar to that for share subdivisions and demergers. That is, if the original cryptoassets were acquired for the purpose of disposal, the new cryptoassets will also be acquired for the same purpose. In that event, disposals will be taxable under s CB 4. Summary 36. The disposal of cryptoassets that were received from a hard fork is likely to be taxable in most cases, although this will depend on the circumstances. The disposal will be taxable where the person: ••has a cryptoasset business; ••disposes of the cryptoassets as part of a profit making undertaking or scheme; or ••acquired the cryptoassets (including in some cases the original cryptoassets) for the purpose of disposing of them. Are any deductions available? 37. The third question is whether any deductions are available if any amounts are taxable. As discussed below, generally no deductions are available as no expenditure is usually incurred in acquiring cryptoassets from a hard fork. However, deductions will be available where cryptoassets are taxed on receipt and also on disposal. The cost of the cryptoassets 38. Where the receipt or disposal of cryptoassets is taxable, deductions for expenditure incurred may be available (s DA 1 or s DB 23). However, other than transaction fees, there is generally no expenditure incurred when a person receives cryptoassets from a hard fork. Therefore, no deduction (other than for transaction fees) will generally be available. 39. However, where a person is taxed on both the receipt and disposal of a cryptoasset then a deduction for the cost of the cryptoasset is available at the time of disposal (ss DB 23 and EA 2). Where a person is taxed on receipt and disposal, the cost of acquiring that cryptoasset can take into account the value of the cryptoasset at the time of receipt (which the person paid tax on). Allowing a cost for this amount ensures the person is not effectively taxed twice on the initial value of the cryptoasset. 30 Trading stock rules 40. Cryptoassets received from a hard fork that form trading stock of a business may also be taxable on receipt and on disposal. For the same reasons as above, a person who holds trading stock that is taxable both on receipt and on disposal may claim a deduction for cost relating to the value on receipt (which the person paid tax on). This deduction may be claimed in the year the receipt is returned as income. The person must then value the trading stock at the end of each income year under the trading stock rules (in Part E of the Act). 41. Standard valuation methods apply to the valuation of trading stock. There are no special rules for cryptoassets, so a person may use whatever method is available to them. However, the value of any trading stock that is an excepted financial arrangement must be valued at cost. 31 If a person uses a different method, they must satisfy all the requirements of the method. There may be difficulties in satisfying methods that refer to a value (or an amount that would be expected to be received) due to the volatility of cryptoasset prices. 29 This is shown by the number of Bitcoin hard forks that have occurred to date, for example, Bitcoin XT in 2014, Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited in 2016, and Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin Diamond in 2017, amongst others. 30 This is considered to be consistent with comments made in Tasman Forestry Ltd v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,147 (CA), Sharkey v Wernher \[1956\] AC 58 (HL); Halliwell v CIR (1991) 13 NZTC 8,197 (HC); and Rangatira Ltd v CIR (1996) 17 NZTC 12,727 (PC). 31 Cryptoassets are proposed to be included as excepted financial arrangements (with retrospective effect), and so cost appears the most appropriate valuation method. Cost will be the only appropriate method once this legislative change is enacted. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 61 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED Examples Example 1: Ethel received Bitcoin Cash Ethel acquired USD1,000 of Bitcoin in June 2017 so she could use it to pay for things over the internet. She found out that Bitcoin would undergo a hard fork in August 2017 and “Bitcoin Cash” (a new cryptoasset) would be created. Ethel decided she wanted to claim Bitcoin Cash as it could be a faster way to pay for internet transactions. Ethel transferred her Bitcoin into a wallet that supported the hard fork. The hard fork occurred in August 2017 and Ethel downloaded the new wallet and undertook the necessary steps to acquire the Bitcoin Cash. In 2019, Ethel cashed up half of her Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash as she was not using it for as many internet transactions as she hoped. These disposals are taxable under s CB 4 as Ethel acquired both her Bitcoin and her Bitcoin Cash for the dominant purpose of disposing of it. Ethel’s remaining Bitcoin Cash hard forked again a year later, and Bitcoin SV was created. However, Ethel decided not to claim Bitcoin SV as she didn’t think it was worth it. As she did not acquire it, there are no tax consequences. Example 2: Beth holds Bitcoin on an exchange Beth acquired NZD500 of Bitcoin in April 2017 and kept it on an exchange along with various other cryptoassets she was using for small trades. The exchange announced it was supporting the Bitcoin Cash hard fork and Beth did not have to do anything in order to receive the equivalent amount of Bitcoin Cash credited to her account. Beth started trading the Bitcoin Cash along with her other cryptoassets. Beth acquired the Bitcoin Cash for the same purpose as she acquired the Bitcoin – to dispose of it. Every time Beth makes a trade of Bitcoin Cash, she must pay tax on that trade under s CB 4.

Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 63 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED QB 21/08: GST – How do the compulsory zero-rating of land rules apply to transactions involving commercial leases? Question How do the compulsory zero-rating of land rules (CZR rules) apply to transactions involving commercial leases? Answer Generally, the CZR rules will not apply to supplies made under commercial leases. However, some supplies made under or in relation to commercial leases are subject to the CZR rules. These supplies are: (a) a supply made under a commercial lease where the consideration includes a non-regular payment (lump-sum payment) of more than 25% of the term consideration, and certain other supplies made under the same lease; (b) the assignment or surrender of a commercial lease; (c) the reverse surrender of a commercial lease (where a lessee pays a lessor to take back a lease); and (d) a supply of lease procurement services; that is, a supply made under an arrangement that involves the lessee’s surrender of a commercial lease and the grant of a new commercial lease by the lessor to another person. Explanation 1. All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. 2. This Question We’ve Been Asked (QWBA) deals with the application of the CZR rules to commercial lease transactions between GST-registered persons where the leased premises are used in a taxable activity. 3. A commercial lease is a lease that is not a lease of a dwelling (s 2(1), definition of “land”, para (b)(ii)). Overview of the CZR rules 4. Usually, a registered person making a supply in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity charges GST at the prevailing standard rate on the supply (s 8(1)). In some situations, zero-rating rules apply. These rules require the supplier to charge GST at the rate of 0% on the supply (s 11). Consequently, the recipient cannot claim an input tax deduction for that supply. 5. The core provision of the CZR rules is s 11(1)(mb). Under ss 8 and 11(1)(mb), a vendor must zero-rate a supply if: ••the supply is a supply of goods that wholly or partly consists of land; ••the vendor is GST registered (or will be GST registered or will be treated as GST registered) at the time of settlement; ••the supply is being made by the vendor in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity; ••the purchaser is a GST-registered purchaser (or will be GST registered or treated as GST registered) at the time of settlement; ••the purchaser acquires the goods (including the land) with the intention of using them (in whole or part) for making taxable supplies; and ••none of the land included in the supply is intended to be used as the purchaser’s principal place of residence or the principal place of residence of a relative of the purchaser. 6. If a supply is not made in the course or furtherance of a GST-registered vendor’s taxable activity (for example, when a GST- registered vendor sells their private home), the supply is generally outside the GST rules. 7. If a leasehold interest in land is supplied as part of a larger supply (and the requirements of s 11(1)(mb) are met) the whole supply is zero-rated. The supply may also be zero-rated under s 11(1)(m) (transfer of a going concern), if the requirements of that section are met. 8. For a more detailed overview of the CZR rules, see ”IS 17/08: Goods and Services Tax – compulsory zero-rating of land rules (general application)”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 29, No 10 (November 2017): 17. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 64 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED Section 11(8D) 9. Most supplies made under commercial leases are excluded from the CZR rules by s 11(8D)(b). However, commercial leases with characteristics making them substitutable for land sales and transactions involving the assignment, surrender or procurement of commercial leases may be subject to the CZR rules if certain conditions, including the conditions in s 11(1) (mb), are met (s 11(8D)(a), (ab) and (c)). 10. Section 11(8D) applies to “interests in land” and agreements for the supply of “interests in land”. A lease is an interest in land. 11. The following elements of s 11(8D) are considered in more detail below: ••regular lease payments and non-regular lease payments that are 25% or less of the term consideration are generally excluded from the CZR rules under s 11(8D)(b) (see \[12\]); ••assignments and surrenders of leases are subject to the CZR rules under s 11(8D)(a)) (see \[24\]); ••reverse surrenders (where a landlord receives a payment for the surrender of a right to receive lease payments) are subject to the CZR rules under s 11(8D)(ab) (see \[27\]); and ••lease procurement services are subject to the CZR rules under s 11(8D)(c) (see \[29\]). Non-regular payments of more than 25% of the term consideration 12. The CZR rules treat certain supplies of land as zero-rated rather than taxable. The rules were introduced to help combat phoenix fraud where a supplier of land absconds or is wound up without returning GST, but the purchaser (generally a related party) is still entitled to an input tax deduction. Most transactions that are, economically, a supply of commercial land are captured by the rules. An exception is a commercial lease, which, to reduce compliance costs, is excluded unless it possesses the less usual feature of irregular large lump-sum payments, which could suggest it could be substitutable for a transfer of land. See “Taxation (Annual Rates for 2016-17, Closely Held Companies, and Remedial Matters) Bill (Commentary on the Bill, May 2016)”: 75. 13. The effect of s 11(8D)(b) is that the CZR rules generally will not apply to: ••regular payments made under a lease; and ••lump-sum payments that are 25% or less of the term consideration (see \[17\] for the meaning of “term consideration”). 14. Specifically, a supply made under a lease agreement that meets the requirements of s 11(1)(mb) is not subject to the CZR rules, if all of the following three elements are met (see Example 1): ••When the lease agreement is entered into, each lump-sum payment is expected to be 25% or less of the term consideration. ••The payment to which the supply relates, if it is a lump-sum payment, is in fact 25% or less of the term consideration. ••Each lump-sum payment that is paid or payable before the payment to which the supply relates is 25% or less of the term consideration. 15. In the nine examples below, it is assumed that the lessee or purchaser (as the case may be) meets the requirements of s 11(1)(mb)(i) (ie, they are a registered person who acquires the goods with the intention of using them for making taxable supplies) and that the supply meets the requirements of s 11(1)(mb)(ii) (ie, it is not a supply of land intended to be used as a principal place of residence of the recipient of the supply or a person associated with them under s 2A(1)(c)). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 65 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED Example 1: Lease payments excluded from the CZR rules Alex owns a property on a busy street in a large city. She is registered for GST. On 1 September 2019, she enters into an agreement to lease the property to a retail company for a period of five years, with a right of renewal for a further five years. Under the terms of the lease, the company is required to pay monthly rent of $6,250 ($75,000 per year), plus additional non- regular payments on 30 April 2020 and 30 April 2021 of $50,000 each. The term consideration under the agreement is $475,000 (regular lease payments of $75,000 × 5 years, plus the non-regular payments of $100,000). The payment of $50,000 on 30 April 2020 is less than 25% of the term consideration, so s 11(8D)(b) excludes the 30 April 2020 supply under the lease agreement from zero-rating under s 11(1)(mb). The further payment of $50,000 on 30 April 2021 is less than 25% of the term consideration, and the previous $50,000 payment was also less than 25% of the term consideration. Therefore, s 11(8D)(b) excludes the 30 April 2021 supply under the lease agreement from zero-rating under s 11(1)(mb). 16. The following elements of s 11(8D)(b) are considered in more detail below: ••term consideration (see \[17\]); ••regular, periodic lease payments not subject to the CZR rules (from \[18\]); and ••lump-sum payments subject to the CZR rules (from \[21\]). Term consideration 17. For commercial leases, the term consideration is the total amount of consideration calculated under the lease agreement during a period that is the longer of one year and the shortest possible fixed term under the lease agreement; that is not including any renewal period (s 11(8D)(b)(iv)). See Example 2. Example 2: Term consideration As Alex (from Example 1) entered into a five-year lease, with an option to extend for a further five years, the term consideration is the sum of the monthly rental payments received during the first five-year period plus any lump-sum payments Alex received during that time. If the parties had entered into a monthly lease with no fixed term, then the term consideration would be the total payments Alex received in the first year. Regular, periodic lease payments not generally subject to the CZR rules 18. Section 11(8D)(b) applies where payments that are not “regular payments” are made under a lease. 19. The term regular payment is not defined in the Act. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12th ed, Oxford University Press, New York, 2011) contains the following definition: Regular adj ... 2. Recurring at short uniform intervals... done or happening frequently. 20. In the context of leases, a regular payment is generally a payment of rent. Therefore, where an ordinary payment of rent that is more than 25% of the term consideration is made, the CZR rules will not apply, provided that no lump-sum payments are anticipated, when the lease is entered into, to be more than 25% of the term consideration, and provided each lump-sum payment paid or payable before the regular payment has actually been 25% or less of the term consideration. See Example 3. Example 3: Regular, periodic lease payments Instead of a five-year lease, Alex (from Example 1) enters into a one-year lease with quarterly payments but without any lump-sum payments. The quarterly payments vary slightly as they are based on the annual rent of $75,000 pro-rated for the number of days in the quarter. The payments are not zero-rated, even though some represent more than 25% of the term consideration. Lump-sum payments (and certain regular payments) subject to the CZR rules 21. If a lump-sum payment is payable under a lease agreement and is anticipated, when the lease agreement is entered into, to be more than 25% of the term consideration, the CZR rules apply to all payments made under the lease including regular payments. Section 11(8D)(b) prevents taxpayers circumventing the CZR rules by making large lump-sum payments under lease agreements. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 66 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED 22. Further, if a lump-sum payment of more than 25% of the term consideration is in fact made but was not anticipated when the lease agreement was entered into, all lease payments including regular payments will be subject to the CZR rules from that payment onwards. There is no requirement to retrospectively zero-rate payments made earlier. See Example 4. Example 4: Lump-sum payments Following from Example 1, Alex’s property is on the main street of a smaller city. The terms of the lease remain the same as Example 1 except the monthly rent is $2,250 and only one lump-sum payment, anticipated, when the agreement is entered into, to be $30,000, but in fact, $50,000, is made on 30 April 2020. The term consideration as anticipated when the agreement is entered into would be $165,000 (regular lease payments of $27,000 x 5 years, plus the non-regular payment of $30,000). The anticipated payment of $30,000 would be less than 25% of the anticipated term consideration. The actual term consideration under the agreement would be $185,000 (regular lease payments of $27,000 × 5 years, plus the non-regular payment of $50,000). The non-regular payment of $50,000 is more than 25% of the term consideration, so s 11(8D)(b) does not exclude the supply under the lease agreement from zero-rating under s 11(1)(mb). If the requirements of s 11(1)(mb) are met, the lump-sum payment of $50,000 and all subsequent payments must be zero-rated. Lease granted on business asset sale 23. A vendor may choose to grant a lease or sub-lease of the business premises to a purchaser of the business instead of selling the business premises or assigning their lease. This type of transaction is not zero-rated under s 11(8D)(b), even if the lease payments are zero-rated under s 11(8D)(b). This is because the business assets are not transferred “under an agreement providing for periodic payments for supplies of the interest in land” as required by s 11(8D)(b). The transaction may be zero-rated as a transfer of a going concern under s 11(1)(m) if the requirements of that section are met on the facts. Assignments and surrenders 24. An assignment or surrender of a lease is subject to the CZR rules if it meets the requirements of s 11(1)(mb) (s 11(8D)(a)). See Example 5. Example 5: Lease assignment JM Ltd is carrying on a taxable activity and is registered for GST. JM Ltd’s business premises are leased. JM Ltd is moving to larger business premises and enters into an agreement to assign its interest as lessee under the existing lease to a third party. The lease assignment is zero-rated in accordance with s 11(1)(mb) and (8D)(a). JM Ltd has an interest in land, and it is assigning that interest in land to the third party. 25. Where a lease is assigned together with other business assets both the lease assignment and other business assets will be zero-rated, assuming the assignment of the lease and the sale of the other business assets are part of a single composite supply. This will be the case even if no consideration is allocated to the lease assignment. See Example 6. 26. For a detailed discussion of whether goods and services are supplied as elements of a single composite supply or as multiple supplies, see “IS 18/04: Goods and services tax – single supply or multiple supplies”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 30, No 10 (November 2018): 5. Example 6: Lease assignment on business asset sale JM Ltd (from Example 5) enters into an agreement to sell its business (including the lease of the new business premises) to a third party. The agreement for sale and purchase of the business provides that the lease will be assigned but no consideration is allocated to the lease assignment in the agreement. The sale of business assets (including the lease assignment) is zero-rated in accordance with s 11(1)(mb) and (8D)(a) (assuming the lease and other business assets are supplied as a single composite supply). JM Ltd has an interest in land, and it is assigning that interest in land to the third party. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 67 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED Reverse surrenders 27. A supply that is a surrender of a right to a payment under an agreement for the supply of an interest in land is subject to the CZR rules if it meets the requirements of s 11(1)(mb) (s 11(8D)(ab)). 28. Section 11(8D)(ab) is intended to catch “reverse surrender” payments a tenant makes to a landlord (where the landlord surrenders their contractual right to receive payment under the lease). Arrangements for the surrender of a lease and grant of a new lease to another person 29. Section 11(8D)(c) deals with situations that arise when a supply is made by a person who is a lessee under a lease agreement. If all the following three elements are satisfied then, despite s 11(8D)(b), s 11(1)(mb) will apply to zero-rate the supply: ••The supply is made to a person who is not the lessor. The lessor in this context is the person who is supplying an interest in land under the lease agreement to the lessee. ••The supply is made under an arrangement that involves the: –lessee’s surrender of the interest in land to the lessor; and –supply by the lessor of the interest in land under another lease agreement to a person other than the lessee. ••The supplies of the interests in land under the lease agreements meet the requirements set out in s 11(1)(mb). 30. Section 11(8D)(c) is likely to be relevant in the context of a business sale, where a lease is novated or a new lease is otherwise procured for the purchaser. See Example 7. Example 7: Lease procurement Following from Example 6, JM Ltd is carrying on a new taxable activity and is registered for GST. JM’s business premises are leased but JM’s lease cannot be assigned. JM Ltd enters into an agreement to sell its business assets to a purchaser. During negotiation of the sale agreement for the business, it is agreed that JM Ltd will use all reasonable endeavours to procure that the landlord will enter into a new lease agreement over the premises with the purchaser. The surrender of the existing lease and the grant of the new lease are closing actions in the agreement for sale and purchase. It is considered that the business asset sale agreement, the surrender, and the grant of the new lease will together constitute an arrangement for these purposes (CIR v Europa Oil (NZ) Ltd \[1971\] NZLR 641 (PC)). The sale of the business is zero-rated in accordance with s 11(1)(mb) and (8D)(c) (assuming the lease procurement services and business assets are supplied as a single composite supply). JM Ltd has an interest in land, and it is surrendering that interest in land so the landlord can enter into a new lease with the purchaser. 31. Section 11(8D)(c) may also apply to lease procurement services in the context of a business asset sale where a lease that has expired continues on an implied term under s 210 of the Property Law Act 2007 (PLA) and is surrendered (with a new lease being granted by the vendor’s lessor to the purchaser) on a business sale. See Example 8. 32. Note s 11(8D)(c) applies if the supplies under the lease agreements are supplies of “interests in land” (s 11(8D)(c)(i)-(iii)). 33. A lease continuing on an implied term under s 210(1)(b) of the PLA is a “statutory tenancy” and a “short-term lease” (s 207 PLA). A lessee who occupies land under a “short-term lease” has a legal interest in the land (s 209(1) PLA). However this is subject to the Land Transfer Act 2017 (s 209(2) PLA). The lessee’s legal interest in the short-term lease can be defeated in the same way as an equitable interest by the registration without fraud of an adverse interest (see Hinde, McMorland & Sim, Land Law in New Zealand (LexisNexis NZ Limited, online version, accessed 14 June 2021) at \[11.021\]). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 7 August 2021Inland Revenue Department 68 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED Example 8: Lease continuing on implied term Following from Example 7, JM Ltd is carrying on the new taxable activity but instead of its lease being unable to be assigned, the term of its lease of the premises has expired. The lease continues on an implied term under s 210 of the Property Law Act 2007. JM Ltd enters into an agreement to sell its business assets to a purchaser. During negotiation of the sale agreement for the business, it is agreed that JM Ltd will surrender its lease and the landlord will enter into a new lease agreement over the premises with the purchaser. The surrender of the existing lease and the grant of the new lease are closing actions in the agreement for sale and purchase. The lessee’s legal interest in land has not been defeated by the registration without fraud of an adverse interest. The sale of the business is zero-rated in accordance with s 11(1)(mb) and (8D)(c) (assuming the lease procurement services and business assets are supplied as a single composite supply). JM Ltd has an interest in land, and it is surrendering that interest in land so the landlord can enter into a new lease with the purchaser. 34. Section 11(8D)(c) may also apply to lease procurement services and business assets a vendor supplies as a single composite supply on the sale of a business where a lease is cancelled under s 245 of the Property Law Act 2007 because the tenant has fallen into arrears and the vendor’s landlord grants a new lease to the purchaser of the business assets. See Example 9. Example 9: Lease cancellation Following from Examples 7 and 8, JM Ltd is carrying on the new taxable activity but has instead been experiencing financial difficulties. It enters into an agreement to sell its business assets to MC Ltd. The premises are an important element of the business. However, due to JM Ltd’s financial difficulties, it has fallen into arrears in payment of rent to its landlord. The landlord has served a notice to cancel the lease of the premises in accordance with s 245 of the Property Law Act 2007. As the lease is being cancelled in accordance with s 245 of the Property Law Act 2007, it cannot be assigned to MC Ltd. During negotiations of the sale agreement for the business, it is agreed that MC Ltd will pay an amount to the landlord and the landlord will enter into a new lease agreement with MC Ltd. The grant of the new lease is a closing action in the sale agreement. The supply will be zero-rated in accordance with s 11(1)(mb) and (8D)(c) (assuming the lease procurement services and business assets are supplied as a single composite supply). 35. This clarification in respect of lease cancellations was made by s 184 of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020-21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2021, and applies to supplies made by a person on or after 30 June 2014. Savings provisions apply to supplies for which a contrary tax position was taken before 30 March 2021 (the date of Royal Assent of the above act).

LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS DEP107: General Tax Depreciation Rates for brake test rollers Note to Determination DEP107: The Commissioner has been asked to consider what depreciation rate should apply for brake test rollers that, as the name implies, are used for testing the brakes of motor vehicles. Brake test rollers are typically used by vehicle testing stations that perform testing for the Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency (NZTA) Warrant of Fitness (which applies to cars and light vehicles) and Certificate of Fitness (which applies to trucks, taxis and heavy vehicles/trailers etc.). Large service workshops may also have them to ensure that their clients vehicle brakes will meet these NZTA standards, even if they don’t certify them. Both car and truck brake test rollers are similar in nature, so are grouped as a single asset class of “Brake test rollers” for the purpose of this general depreciation rate determination. Brake test rollers are used in the following way. The vehicle to be tested is driven on to brake test rollers which are set in the garage floor. The brake test rollers are rotated slowly, turned by an electric motor. The brakes resistance is measured by load sensors attached to the motor. This information is then sent through analogue or digital gauges to be recorded using software/ digital controls. Other types of brake test equipment Other types of brake testing equipment, such as “plate” brake testers and decelerometers, are not covered by this general depreciation determination, as they are either portable or hand-held (not permanently fixed into the floor like brake test rollers). Determination DEP107: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 107 This determination may be cited as “Determination DEP107 Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number DEP107: Brake test rollers available for use in the ordinary course of business. 1 Application This determination applies to taxpayers who own items of depreciable property of the kind listed in the tables below: This determination applies for the 2020/21 and subsequent income years. 2 Determination Pursuant to section 91AAF of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the general determination applies to the kind of items of depreciable property listed in the table below by: • • Adding into the “Engineering (including automotive)” industry category, the new asset class, estimated useful life, and general diminishing value and straight-line depreciation rates listed below: Asset classEstimated useful life (years)DV rate (%)SL rate (%) Brake test rollers12.51610.5 3 Interpretation In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires, words and terms have the same meaning as in the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994.

The Supreme Court applied an orthodox approach to this leave application. There is no further impact beyond the immediate case. The decision puts an end to a longstanding tax challenge that has progressed from the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and finally to the Supreme Court. 8 CSUM 21/08 - Supreme Court dismisses Ms Sisson’s applications for leave to appeal. This was an unsuccessful attempt by Ms Sisson for leave to appeal three Court of Appeal decisions which collectively dismissed 11 appeals against judgments of the High Court. The three Court of Appeal judgments relate to the following: (1) the liquidation of Chesterfields Preschools Ltd (“CPL”); (2) the vesting of property in CPL; and (3) Ms Sisson’s personal bankruptcy. The primary focus of the applications concerns the liquidation of CPL. The Supreme Court held an oral hearing directed at Ms Sisson’s case that if the tax debt is correctly calculated, CPL is not insolvent. 10 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 8 September 2021Inland Revenue Department 1 N E W L E G I S L AT I O N This section of the TIB covers new legislation, changes to legislation including general and remedial amendments, and Orders in Council. NEW LEGISLATION Order in council Tax Administration (Canterbury Flood Event) Order 2021 The flooding created by the heavy rain that fell in the West Coast, Nelson, Tasman and Marlborough regions between 15 and 18 July 2021 has been declared to be an emergency event for the purposes of section 183ABA of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This section allows the Commissioner to remit use-of-money interest payable on late tax payments following emergency events. The declaration applies to taxpayers who were physically prevented from paying their tax on time as a result of the floods. The declaration commenced 22 July 2021 and expires 30 September 2021. Taxpayers may apply for remission once their tax returns and payments are up to date. Different rules apply in cases of financial hardship.

The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates their tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see Binding rulings: How to get certainty on the tax position of your transaction (IR715). You can download this publication free from our website at www.ird.govt.nz BINDING RULINGS BR Prd 21/04: StockCo Limited and StockCo Capital Limited This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by StockCo Limited and StockCo Capital Limited. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of ss BG 1, DA 1(1), DA 2, EA 3, EJ 10, FA 6 to FA 11, FA 12 and GA 1 and subpart EW. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the leasing of livestock by either StockCo Limited or StockCo Capital Limited (both referred to as StockCo in this Ruling) to their customers to use solely in a farming business. Each customer will be a “New Zealand resident” (as defined in s YA 1). StockCo will purchase the livestock either from the customer and then lease them back to the customer or from a third party and then lease them to the customer. The customer will lease the livestock over a period of usually four years. The livestock will be progressively culled (or may go missing or die) over the period of the lease, with cull payments being returned to StockCo. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. Purchase of livestock 1. The StockCo Group considered it commercially prudent to separate its livestock-leasing business from its usual banking arrangements and relationships, so incorporated StockCo Capital Limited (as a sister company to StockCo Limited) for this purpose. 2. StockCo will purchase an agreed number of “specified livestock” (as defined in s YA 1) – in this case cows – from the customer or a third party, for the purchase price as provided for in cls 4 to 6 of the Dairy Herd Lease Master Terms: WE WILL PURCHASE THE HERD 4. We will purchase the Cows specified in each Lease Agreement for the Purchase Price detailed in the Lease Agreement on the Commencement Date. 5. When we purchase Cows from you we will create a buyer generated invoice. 6. We are purchasing the Cows at your request. You are responsible for inspecting and approving all Cows prior to us purchasing them. 3. The purchase price is the equivalent of the market value of the purchased cows at the time of acquisition. 4. Where the livestock are purchased from a third party, StockCo will pay the purchase price to the third-party vendor. 5. The customer will apply the purchase price to debt or other farming costs (such as expanding their farming operations or covering other business-related costs). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 8 September 2021Inland Revenue Department 3 BINDING RULINGS The Lease 6. The agreement entered into between StockCo and its customers is made up of two documents: the Dairy Lease Master Terms and the Lease Agreement (together, “the Lease”). The Lease sets out the terms of the sale (where StockCo purchases livestock from the customer) and the lease of the livestock. 7. The terms of the Lease will not be materially different from those in the version provided to Inland Revenue on 19 April 2021. 8. As provided for in cls 7 and 8 of the Master Terms, StockCo owns the cows and leases the purchased cows to the customer for the lease period, and the customer owns all milk and progeny the leased cows produce: 7. We will own the Cows. You will own all progeny and milk produced by the Cows during the Lease period. WE WILL LEASE YOU THE HERD 8. We lease to you, and you take on lease, the Herd for the term specified in the Lease Agreement from the time we purchase the Herd. 9. The progeny will be valued in accordance with the livestock valuation rules set out in subpart EC of the Act. 10. Clauses 11 to 14 of the Master Terms set out the customer’s payment obligations: YOUR PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS 11. You will pay us for each Herd: 11.1 Lease Payments: the Lease Payments as set out in the Lease Payment and Cull Payment Schedule in the relevant Lease Agreement. The Lease Payments are the rent payable for the lease of the Herd. 11.2 Cull Payments: the Cull Payments as set out in the Lease Payment and Cull Payment Schedule in the relevant Lease Agreement. (a) The Cull Payments are the amounts we expect to realise from Cull Cows when they are culled. You agree to realise this amount for us by selling the Cull Cows on our behalf. (b) You will pay us the Cull Payments regardless of the amount you realise from selling the Cull Cows on our behalf. If you realise more than the Cull Payments you may keep the additional amount, and any amount payable on a day that is not a working day, must be paid on the first working day after that date. 12. On the Commencement Date (or as otherwise specified) you will also pay us any establishment fee or other fee specified in a Lease Agreement. 13. You will provide us on or before the Commencement Date with: 13.1 a signed Dairy Order so that the Lease Payments may be paid directly to us by the Dairy Company; and 13.2 a signed direct debit authority so that the Lease Payments may be deducted directly from your Bank Account 14. We will decide (at our discretion) whether Lease Payments are paid directly to us by the Dairy Company or direct debited from your Bank Account, and will confirm this with you in writing. We will also confirm to you in writing if we change how the Lease Payments will be paid. 11. The customer will use the livestock valuation regime in subpart EC to determine the value of the leased livestock. Early termination of the Lease and events of default 12. Clause 22 of the Master Terms provides for the early termination of the Lease by the customer in certain situations: EARLY TERMINATION 22 Where there is a material change in your circumstances, you may terminate the Lease early by: 22.1 purchasing the remainder of the Herd for the Net Present Value of the unpaid Lease Payments and Cull Payments; and 22.2 paying us any other amount owing to us under this agreement in relation to the relevant Lease. 13. It is expected that cl 22 of the Master Terms would be applied only in rare cases, as a cost–benefit analysis would usually favour the customer remaining in the Lease and continuing to meet the Lease obligations. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 8 September 2021Inland Revenue Department 4 BINDING RULINGS 14. Clause 23 of the Master Terms provides for early termination by StockCo: 23 We can end the Lease under clause 26 because of your default. 15. Clause 26.2 of the Master Terms states: 26 If an Event of Default has occurred, we may: ... 26.2 end the Lease with effect from any date specified by us and require you to, at our option: (a) return the Herd to us at the location and by the date nominated by us. If we end the Lease under this clause 26(a) you will pay us liquidated damages equal to the amount (if any) by which the market value of the Herd (as determined by us, acting reasonably) is less than the Net Present Value of the unpaid Lease Payments and Cull Payments; or (b) purchase the Herd for the sum of the Net Present Value of the unpaid Lease Payments and Cull Payments. 16. Clause 26.1 of the Master Terms allows for StockCo to repossess the herd or any cows following an event of default: 26.1 enter the Land (or any land where we consider the Herd or any Cows may be) without notice and repossess any or all of the Cows; ... 17. This Ruling does not consider or rule on early termination or events of default that occur as part of the Arrangement. Return of the leased cows 18. The leased cows are returned to StockCo by way of an agreed culling process over the term of the Lease. In this respect, cls 9 and 10 of the Master Terms state: YOU WILL CULL THE COWS ON OUR BEHALF 9 We recognise that the Herd will progressively reach the end of its useful milking life over the Lease period. 10 You agree to reduce the Herd to zero over the Lease period at the approximate Annual Cull Rate specified in the relevant Lease Agreement. The Annual Cull Amount Due has been determined on the basis of the Annual Cull Rate and Cull Value specified in the relevant Lease Agreement. 19. Despite cl 10 of the Master Terms, it is acknowledged in the Lease that cows may die or go missing. Clauses 16 and 17 of the Master Terms set out terms relating to missing and dead cows: MISSING AND DEAD COWS 16 We understand that deaths occur and that Cows may go missing. The Lease Payment calculation includes an annual death and missing cow allowance at the assumed death rate specified in the Lease Agreement 17 You agree that the Cows are at your sole risk. You must pay the Lease Payments and Cull Payments regardless of anything else, including the reason for, or the number of, deaths or missing cows. 20. A dairy herd generally loses about 25% of its mature cows annually through culling of older cows and natural attrition. Therefore, it is expected that none of the leased livestock will remain at the end of the lease period. Deferred cull payment 21. The amount and timing of the cull payments are agreed at the time of entering into the Lease and are reflected in the payment schedule. As the amounts payable are fixed, the customer takes on the risk of under-recovery from the meat works on the culled cows but gets the benefit of any over-recovery. 22. The customer and StockCo negotiate the frequency and timing of cull payments, but payment will generally be at the time the livestock are culled or deferred until the end of the lease term and paid as a lump sum. 23. As StockCo retains legal ownership of cull payments, it will return them as income in the year in which those payments are derived How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: (a) The lease payments are deductible under s DA 1(1) and none of the general limitations in s DA 2 applies to prevent deductibility, provided that no provision in subparts DB to DZ applies to prevent a deduction under s DA 1(1). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 8 September 2021Inland Revenue Department 5 BINDING RULINGS (b) At the end of an income year, unless the customer is excused from this requirement pursuant to a determination issued by the Commissioner, s EA 3 applies to require the unexpired portion of any lease payments to be included in the customer’s income in the current income year and to be an amount for which the customer is allowed a deduction in the following income year, provided the Lease is not the customer’s “revenue account property” or “trading stock” (within the meaning of s YA 1). (c) The financial arrangements rules in subpart EW do not apply to the Arrangement, because the lease is an excepted financial arrangement. (d) Section EJ 10 does not apply to the Arrangement. (e) Sections FA 6 to FA 11 do not apply to the Arrangement. (f) Section FA 12 does not apply to the Arrangement. (g) Sections BG 1 and GA 1 do not apply to negate or vary the above conclusions. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 21 July 2021 and ending on 21 July 2025. This Ruling is signed by me on the 22 nd day of July 2021.

We've given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. Case summary Supreme Court Dismisses Mr Dowden’s Application for Leave to Appeal the Court of Appeal’s Refusal to Extend Time to Appeal Decision date: 15 July 2021 CSUM 21/07 Case Dowden v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2021\] NZSC 86 Legislative References Senior Courts Act 2016, s 74; and Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005, r 43 Legal terms Leave to Appeal, Extension of Time, General or Public Importance, Miscarriage of Justice Impact The Supreme Court applied an orthodox approach to this leave application. There is no further impact beyond the immediate case. The decision puts an end to a longstanding tax challenge that has progressed from the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and finally to the Supreme Court. Facts The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) assessed Mr John Alfred Dowden (“Mr Dowden”) for tax liabilities in relation to his business, Safeguard Security, for the periods between 2004 and 2012. Mr Dowden challenged these assessments in the Taxation Review Authority (“the TRA”). Mr Dowden’s position was that he transferred his interest in Safeguard Security to his former partner, Ms Maureen Jackson (“Ms Jackson”) in December 2003 and so she was liable for the tax liabilities assessed by the Commissioner. The Commissioner’s position was that Mr Dowden owned and operated Safeguard Security at all relevant times. In 2018, the TRA dismissed Mr Dowden’s challenge. Mr Dowden appealed to the High Court. In October 2019, the High Court dismissed Mr Dowden’s appeal and upheld the findings of the TRA. In November 2019, Mr Dowden appealed to the Court of Appeal. On 14 July 2020, Mr Dowden’s appeal was deemed abandoned after an unsuccessful application to dispense with security for costs, an unsuccessful review of that refusal and after being granted multiple extensions to apply for a hearing date. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 8 September 2021Inland Revenue Department 8 LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE SUMMARIES Mr Dowden then applied to the Court of Appeal for a further extension of time (pursuant to r 43 of the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005) to file the case on appeal and pay the scheduling fee. The Court of Appeal declined to grant the extension. Mr Dowden applied to the Supreme Court for leave to appeal the Court of Appeal decision declining to grant the extension. Issues Is it necessary in the interests of justice for the Supreme Court to give leave to appeal? Namely, has Mr Dowden satisfied the criteria set down in s 74 of the Senior Courts Act 2016: • • Does the appeal involve a matter of general or public importance? • • Will a substantial miscarriage of justice occur unless the appeal is heard? Decision The Supreme Court declined to give Mr Dowden leave to appeal. The Supreme Court did not consider Mr Dowden’s application raised any issues of general or public importance. The Court of Appeal applied settled law to the application before it. Mr Dowden did not challenge the Court of Appeal’s application of the settled law or its application in this leave application. The Supreme Court was not satisfied there would be a miscarriage of justice if Mr Dowden was not permitted to continue his appeal in the Court of Appeal and submit evidence from Ms Jackson that he alleged would prove he should not be liable for the tax which he was assessed. The Supreme Court considered Mr Dowden’s case was fully ventilated before the TRA (in which Mr Dowden gave evidence and was cross examined at length). Ms Jackson’s statements were fully dealt with in the TRA. The TRA considered all the evidence and made credibility findings against Mr Dowden.

Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 8 September 2021Inland Revenue Department 9 LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE SUMMARIES Case summary Supreme Court dismisses Ms Sisson’s applications for leave to appeal. Decision date: 12-July-2021 CSUM 21/08 Case Chesterfields Preschools Ltd (in liq) v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2021\] NZSC 83 Legislative References Senior Courts Act 2016, s 74(2)(a), (b) and (c) Supreme Court Act 2003, s 13(2)(a) and (b) Legal terms Application for leave to appeal, general or public importance, miscarriage in relation to civil appeals Summary This was an unsuccessful attempt by Ms Sisson for leave to appeal three Court of Appeal decisions which collectively dismissed 11 appeals against judgments of the High Court. Chesterfields Preschools Ltd (in liq) v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2020\] NZCA 686 (Miller, Venning and Katz JJ) \[Second liquidation appeal judgment\]; Sisson v Chesterfields Preschools Ltd (in liq) \[2020\] NZCA 687 (Miller, Venning and Katz JJ) \[Vesting orders judgment\]; and Sisson v Chesterfields Preschools Ltd (in liq) \[2020\] NZCA 689 (Miller, Venning and Katz JJ) \[Bankruptcy judgment\]. The three Court of Appeal judgments relate to the following: (1) the liquidation of Chesterfields Preschools Ltd (“C PL”); (2) the vesting of property in CPL; and (3) Ms Sisson’s personal bankruptcy. The primary focus of the applications concerns the liquidation of CPL. The Supreme Court held an oral hearing directed at Ms Sisson’s case that if the tax debt is correctly calculated, CPL is not insolvent. Impact No impact. The issues arising are unique. They reflect both the particular litigation history and the particular facts of this case. No question of general or public importance or of commercial significance accordingly arises. Facts CPL operated a preschool business. It was one of a number of business entities associated with Ms Sisson and Mr Hampton. In April 2004, the Commissioner served a statutory demand on CPL for a debt of $620,545.94 comprising unpaid tax, late payment penalties and interest. CPL applied to set aside the demand, disputing the amount demanded. A range of related litigation followed, before CPL was eventually put into liquidation on 6 October 2015 (the first liquidation order). The related litigation in the initial period included two judicial review proceedings. Further, in May 2008, CPL and associated entities filed a statement of claim alleging misfeasance in public office by the Attorney-General, the Commissioner and various other officers. The claim was stayed until repleaded by a lawyer holding a current practising certificate and leave was granted by the High Court (the misfeasance claim). Ms Sisson, a director of CPL, was joined as a party to the liquidation proceedings to enable her to pursue an appeal. After a partially successful appeal to the Court of Appeal from the first liquidation order, the Supreme Court ultimately set the first liquidation order aside by consent on 23 November 2017 and the matter was remitted to the High Court for rehearing. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 8 September 2021Inland Revenue Department 10 LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE SUMMARIES On 15 December 2017, CPL was put into interim liquidation. Then, on 26 February 2019, CPL was once more put into liquidation by Osborne J in the High Court (the second liquidation order). Ms Sisson unsuccessfully appealed against that second liquidation order to the Court of Appeal (the second liquidation appeal judgment). Issues Whether the approach taken by the Court of Appeal to the calculation of the tax debt gives rise to the appearance of a miscarriage of justice in the civil sense such that it is in the interests of justice for the Court to hear the proposed appeal Decision The Liquidation of CPL: SC 12/2021 The Supreme Court saw no appearance of a miscarriage of justice in the Court of Appeal’s approach and accordingly dismissed the application for leave to appeal in relation to the liquidation order. The Court summarised Ms Sisson’s case as being if the debt was properly calculated there would be a “modest balance” left to pay in the situation where CPL has “a substantial unencumbered property asset” to draw on. She developed this by arguing: • • the calculation does not comply with the requirements of the earlier judgments in the context of the taxpayers’ largely successful judicial review litigation; • • the Commissioner misapplied the ordering rules; and • • the Commissioner’s approach breached an arrangement agreed between Mr Hampton and the IRD (the Aronsen arrangement). The Court stated that whether there is an appearance of a miscarriage of justice really turns on whether anything raised by Ms Sisson suggests that the Court of Appeal was wrong in its interpretation of the requirements for the tax calculation set out in that Court’s earlier 2010 judgment. The Supreme Court found that to the extent Ms Sisson challenges the appropriateness of the 15 per cent reduction, that argument has no prospect of success. The Supreme Court also dismissed Ms Sisson’s argument that the liquidation order should have awaited the outcome of misfeasance proceedings as it was satisfied the misfeasance proceedings has insufficient prosects to warrant leave. Vesting orders: SC 17/2021 The Supreme Court dismissed Ms Sisson’s application for leave to appeal the vesting orders as it saw no apparent error in the Court of Appeal’s assessment of these matters. The Supreme Court also noted that to the extent Ms Sisson’s arguments reflect a concern about the costs orders, there are insufficient prospects of success to warrant a grant of leave on this basis. Bankruptcy: SC 18/2021 This application was also dismissed. The Supreme Court noted that Ms Sisson accepts, as the Court of Appeal held, that her application regarding the bankruptcy “rests entirely on the fate of the ... application for leave to appeal the liquidation judgment”. As leave to appeal has not been granted in relation to the liquidation judgment, the Supreme Court found it need not consider this application further. The criteria for leave to appeal are not met.

NEW LEGISLATION COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payments Scheme (August 2021) Order 2021 The COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payments Scheme (August 2021) Order 2021 came into force on 24 August 2021. This Order activated the COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payments Scheme. Background Section 7AAB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the TAA) authorises the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) to make grants under the COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payments Scheme if there is a period of raised COVID-19 alert levels anywhere in New Zealand. In general, the Scheme will be activated when there is a period of seven-days or more at the raised alert levels. The intention of the Scheme is to provide for grants to be made to support businesses with fixed costs when there is an escalation in COVID-19 alert levels and a resulting reduction in revenue. Section 7AAC of the TAA is an empowering provision for the making of an Order in Council activating the Scheme, and determining the class of persons who can apply for the Scheme and the payment amount. A person may be eligible for a one-off payment each time the Scheme is activated. At 11.59pm on 17 August 2021, COVID-19 alert levels for New Zealand were raised to level 4. This escalation lasted seven-days, triggering the activation of the Scheme. The COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payments Scheme (August 2021) Order 2021 (the Order) came into force on 24 August 2021 activating the Scheme. The Scheme will remain in activation until at least the first working day one month after all areas of New Zealand return to COVID-19 alert level 1. Class of persons covered The Order sets out the class of persons eligible for an RSP grant. An eligible person must be one of the following: • • a self-employed individual • • a body corporate or unincorporated body • • a registered charity • • an incorporated society • • a post-settlement governance entity • • a trust • • a partnership (as defined in sections 8 and 9 of the Partnership Law Act 2019) • • any department or organisation in the State services (as defined in section 5 of the Public Service Act 2020) that is approved by the Minister of Finance as a participant in the Scheme • • a non-government organisation • • a pre-revenue firm, or • • a joint venture. The person must be living in New Zealand, or if a non-natural person, registered or otherwise established in New Zealand. Eligibility The RSP is designed to support businesses which have experienced a 30% drop in revenue compared with typical revenue in an earlier period. The Order contains a provision that for this purpose, a business may use a consecutive seven-day period that reflects the typical revenue for that business in the six weeks prior to the escalation in alert levels with a consecutive seven-day Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 2 NEW LEGISLATION period at alert level 2 or above. The person must apply this revenue decline test in accordance with the eligibility criteria set by the Commissioner. If the person is part of a commonly owned group, this 30% decrease needs to be satisfied across the group as a whole. The person and the commonly owned group must use the same date ranges for their affected revenue and comparator periods. In this context, commonly owned group has the meaning described in eligibility criteria set by the Commissioner (ird.govt.nz/covid-19/business-and-organisations/resurgence-support-payment/eligibility). To qualify for a grant under the Order, the seven-day period used to demonstrate a decline in revenue must be a seven consecutive day period between 17 August 2021 to the day before the date all areas of New Zealand return to COVID-19 alert level 1 (both dates inclusive). Further eligibility requirements have been set out by the Commissioner under section 7AAB(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and are published on the Inland Revenue website ird.govt.nz/covid-19/business-and-organisations/resurgence-support-payment/eligibility. Amount of the grant The Order sets out the amount of the payment that a person will be entitled to as the lesser of: • • $1,500 plus $400 for each full-time equivalent worker employed by the person (up to a maximum of 50 full-time equivalent workers), or • • four times the amount by which the eligible person’s revenue has declined. Applications RSP applications in response to the COVID-19 alert level escalation opened on 24 August 2021 and may be submitted via myIR until the first working day that is at least one month after all areas of New Zealand return to COVID-19 alert level 1. Further procedural requirements in relation to the making of an application have been set out by the Commissioner under section 7AAB(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and are published on the Inland Revenue website ird.govt.nz/covid-19/business-and-organisations/resurgence-support-payment/apply COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payments Scheme (August 2021) Amendment Order 2021 The COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payments Scheme (August 2021) Amendment Order 2021 came into force on 9 September 2021. This Order amends the eligibility criteria of the COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payments Scheme (August 2021) Order 2021. The above TIB item on the COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payments Scheme (August 2021) Order 2021. Background The COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payments Scheme (August 2021) Order 2021 (the principal order) determines the class of persons who can apply for COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payments Scheme (the Scheme), the eligibility criteria and the payment amount. The eligibility criteria includes a requirement for applicants to have been in business or operation for at least six months before the 17 August 2021 COVID-19 alert level escalation. Amendment to eligibility criteria The amending Order (COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payments Scheme (August 2021) Amendment Order 2021) reduces the time required for a business to have been in operation before they are eligible for the Scheme, from at least six months to at least one month. This change ensures that the Scheme better supports newly established businesses. Applicants are still required to meet the other eligibility requirements under the Scheme, such as demonstrating a 30% revenue loss. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 3 NEW LEGISLATION Applications Applications under the new requirements opened on 9 September 2021 and may be submitted via myIR. The full eligibility requirements have been set out by the Commissioner under section 7AAB(3) of the TAA and are published on the Inland Revenue website ird.govt.nz/covid-19/business-and-organisations/resurgence-support-payment/eligibility. Inland Revenue is contacting any businesses who were declined for not meeting the six-month test to advise them of the new criteria and invite them to reapply under the new settings. Tax Administration (COVID-19 Response Variations) Order 2021 The Tax Administration (COVID-19 Response Variations) Order 2021 came into force on 30 September 2021. The Order extends the application of section 6I of the Tax Administration Act 1994 from 1 October 2021 until 30 September 2022. Background In 2020, greater administrative flexibility was granted to the Commissioner in section 6I of the Tax Administration Act 1994 as part of the response to COVID-19 (see TIB vol 32 No 7 August 2020). The discretion allows the Commissioner to vary time-related requirements (such as timelines, due dates, deadlines, and time periods), procedural or administrative requirements when taxpayers are likely to be impacted by COVID-19, and compliance with current requirements is impossible, unreasonable, or impractical. The discretionary power allows the Commissioner to issue variations to provide flexibility for taxpayers to comply with their tax obligations under the Inland Revenue Acts where they have been affected by the impacts of COVID-19. Where taxpayers comply with a variation, they are treated as if they complied with the requirement set out in legislation. The measure was originally limited in application to an 18-month period ending 30 September 2021. However, section 6H of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that the measure may be extended upon the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue if it is reasonably necessary in the circumstances because of the continuing impact of COVID-19 related measures or circumstances. This Order in Council extends the Commissioner’s COVID-19 administrative flexibility measure to 30 September 2022 which will enable the Commissioner to act quickly in the event taxpayers are further impacted by COVID-19. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 4 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT Operational statements set out the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s view of the law in respect of the matter discussed and deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. OPERATIONAL STATEMENT OS 21/03: Excusing estates from filing income tax returns Introduction Section 43B allows trustees of non-active trusts to be excused from the obligation to file income tax returns if the trusts meet certain requirements. With some exceptions, the Commissioner’s general approach has been that s 43B only applies to non-active trusts. It does not apply to deceased estates that similarly derive no income. This is on the basis that “estates” are something different to “trusts”. The Commissioner has now modified her position to accept that there can be occasions during the administration of an estate where the estate property is held on trust and the s 43B exemption can apply. This Statement sets out the broad approach that the Commissioner is taking to determining whether an estate’s administration has got to that point. The requirement to file income tax returns 1. For income derived by a deceased person until the date of death, executors and administrators must meet whatever filing and income tax obligations the deceased would have had if they had remained alive (s 43). If the deceased only had “reportable income” (types of income where tax has been withheld at source by the payer, such as employment and investment income), these obligations can be met through the pre-populated account process in subpart 3B (“auto-calc”). 2. Executors and administrators must also obtain a separate IRD number for the estate and make returns for income derived in the years following death. 3. The prescribed return form to be used for income derived after death is the same income tax return as prescribed for trustees (the IR 6 return). However, this is for administrative convenience rather than because an estate is a trust. Being excused from filing a return under s 43B 4. Under s 43B, a “trustee of a trust” can apply to be excused from the obligation to file income tax returns if they meet the specified requirements. These requirements concern being a “complying trust” as described in s HC 10 of the Income Tax Act 2007, making a declaration to the Commissioner as to various matters (the IR 633 form has been prescribed for this - more information can be obtained at ird.govt.nz/roles/trusts-and-estates/trusts-and-tax-residency) and also not having any income or deductible expenditure for the year, ie they are “non-active”. 5. The reference to “trustee of a trust” means that any exemption from filing is limited to situations where there is a “trust”. 6. While “trustee” is a defined term and can include an executor or administrator, “trust” is not a defined term in tax legislation and has the meaning it has in general law. That meaning is broad. However, a trust does not automatically arise in the administration of every estate. In general law, the position is that executors hold the property in the estate “in right of the deceased” and not in trust. A trust can, and often does, arise before an estate is fully administered but administration of the estate needs to have reached the stage of the property being held by someone with the special duties of a trustee. 7. Therefore, at some point in the administration of an estate a trust can arise, and that trust may qualify under s 43B. However, this does raise the question of how to determine when administration of an estate has got to the point that property that until then was part of the estate is now held on a trust. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 5 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT When will a trust arise in the administration of a deceased estate? 8. Executors and administrators of estates have duties to collect the deceased’s property and to use it to meet any expenses, debts and legacies and to distribute what is left according to the directions in a will or the law of intestacy. A trust will only arise when executors and administrators have completed their duties to the point that they stand ready to “distribute” the remaining property (in technical terms, this is referred to as “assent”). The fact the estate administration has reached this point can be evidenced in various ways, depending on the particular circumstances. For example, it might be explicit in or able to be inferred from a letter to a trust beneficiary from an executor. Or it might be clear from their actions. 9. Interpretation Statement IS 18/01 Taxation of trusts has further discussion (from \[9.25\]) on taxation in the context of deceased estates. 10. At the time of assent, the distribution may be to separate trustees specified in a will (so it will usually be straightforward to identify that a trust has arisen). However, it is common for a will to specify that the executors are also to be the trustees so there is a distribution only in the sense that the executors cease to hold the property in their capacity as executors and begin holding the property in a separate capacity as trustees. 11. A trust provided for in a will is known as a testamentary trust. Testamentary trusts are general law trusts. It follows that a testamentary trust, once it arises, is a “trust” for the purposes of s 43B. 12. Once administration of an estate by executors gets to the point that the assets in the estate are ready for distribution and are held by trustees of a testamentary trust for beneficiaries and the assets do not generate any income, s 43B may apply. The testamentary trust may be expressly provided for in the will or it may be implied. 13. A common situation is where the only significant property in the estate is a house, and a family member is granted a life interest or is otherwise allowed to live in the house until their death. 14. Where the family member is granted a life interest, and the executors have completed their administration duties to the point of being ready to distribute, the house may be held on trust for the life tenant (and for the remainder beneficiaries - ie those who stand to inherit on the death of the life tenant). In that case, because a trust has arisen for the life tenant, from the date of distribution of the property to the trustees the trustees can apply to be excused from filing under s 43B. 15. The situation differs where the family member is granted only a licence to reside in the property. In that case another person will take the property subject to the licence under the will or intestacy. In some cases, the property subject to the licence may be distributed to a trustee to be held on trust for that other person (for example, where the other person is a minor). In that case s 43B may apply to the trust for the minor beneficiary if the licence allows the licensee to reside in the property for no consideration. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 6 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT The Commissioner’s approach 16. The Commissioner considers that executors and administrators are able to apply under s 43B to be excused from filing income tax returns where they have reached the point in administration of an estate that they are ready to distribute, or have distributed, the property in the estate to be held on trust for beneficiaries. 17. Executors and administrators who apply on this basis, or do so through their tax agent, will be excused if the trust in question meets the requirements of s 43B. They do not need to obtain a new IRD number for the trust, the number obtained earlier for the estate can be used. This Operational Statement is based on the Commissioner’s view of the law at the date of issue and applies until the statement is withdrawn, amended or any law change occurs. A legislative change to s 43B that may alter some or all the matters covered in this statement is currently being considered by the Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Unit of Inland Revenue. This Statement was signed on 24 August 2021. Rob Falk National Advisor, Legal Services Technical Standards Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 7 INTERPRETATION STATEMENT This section of the TIB contains interpretation statements issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. These statements set out the Commissioner's view on how the law applies to a particular set of circumstances when it is either not possible or not appropriate to issue a binding public ruling. In most cases Inland Revenue will assess taxpayers in line with the following interpretation statements. However, our statutory duty is to make correct assessments, so we may not necessarily assess taxpayers on the basis of earlier advice if at the time of the assessment we consider that the earlier advice is not consistent with the law. INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS IS 21/04: Income tax and GST – deductions for businesses disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic Summary 1. Many businesses have faced significant disruption because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some businesses have had to downscale or temporarily suspend their operations. Others have had to close completely. However, expenses and losses may still be incurred while the business is not operating. Whether a business has ceased operating temporarily or permanently has implications for whether it can claim income tax deductions for any expenditure or loss incurred. 2. An income tax deduction will usually be allowed where a business has downscaled or ceased operating temporarily, provided the general permission is satisfied (s DA 1) and the deduction is not disallowed by one of the general limitations such as the capital or private limitation (s DA 2). A deduction will usually be disallowed where a business has completely ceased, even if it is possible that the business may restart later. 3. Whether a business has ceased operating temporarily or permanently is a question of fact in each case. The nature of the activities carried on and the business’s intention in engaging in those activities are relevant considerations. 4. Similar questions may arise for businesses in a GST context. If a registered person ceases to carry on a taxable activity they may be required to deregister from GST. If a person is deregistered for GST, because they have ceased to carry on a taxable activity or because they have chosen to deregister (perhaps because they do not expect to make taxable supplies exceeding $60,000 in the next 12 months), then they must make a deregistration adjustment and will be unable to claim any further input tax deductions. 5. For most taxpayers, determining whether their business activities have ceased temporarily or permanently will be straightforward. It will usually be obvious by the time a tax return is filed whether a business exists or not. However, if a business has ceased, it will be important to identify when this occurred because any expenditure or loss incurred after this point is unlikely to be deductible. 6. Examples are included from \[63\] to explain how the law applies. Introduction 7. Many businesses have faced significant disruption because of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, the tourism sector has faced disruption because border restrictions have prevented international tourists from entering New Zealand. Disruption has occurred in many other sectors as well. 8. Businesses have responded in different ways to this disruption. Some businesses have temporarily ceased or suspended their operations. Many businesses, such as restaurants and cafes, were unable to trade during Alert Level 4, 1 so had no option but to temporarily cease or suspend their operations. Other businesses permanently ceased operating; perhaps because they relied on international tourists. The Commissioner understands that some tourism businesses have ceased operating but hope to restart once the New Zealand borders open again. 9. In both scenarios, businesses may continue to incur expenses. The issue addressed in this Interpretation Statement is whether those expenses or losses are deductible when the business derives little or no income. 1 For more information on New Zealand’s alert levels, see COVID-19 Alert System (website, New Zealand Government, 2020). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 8 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Analysis Deductibility 10. Section DA 1 contains the general rule allowing deductions. This is known as the general permission: DA 1 General permission Nexus with income (1) A person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss, including an amount of depreciation loss, to the extent to which the expenditure or loss is— (a) incurred by them in deriving— (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income; or (b) incurred by them in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving— (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income. General permission (2) Subsection (1) is called the general permission. 11 A person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent that it is incurred 2 by them in deriving their assessable income, or in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving their income. These are sometimes referred to as the first and second limbs of s DA 1. 12. Businesses usually claim deductions under the second limb of s DA 1. The second limb allows deductions for business expenditure or loss and is considered broader than the first limb (Europa Oil (NZ) Ltd v CIR (No 2) (1974) 1 NZTC 61,169 (CA)). 13. Under the second limb, the expenditure or loss must be incurred “in the course of carrying on a business”. Therefore, a sufficient relationship (or nexus) must exist between the expenditure and the business that is being carried on for the expenditure or loss to be deductible (CIR v Banks (1978) 3 NZTC 61,236 (CA) and Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271 (CA)). 14. Whether a business is being “carried on” is the main inquiry in this Interpretation Statement. 15. For completeness, note that even if a deduction is allowed under s DA 1, it may still be disallowed under s DA 2 if one of the general limitations applies, such as the capital or private limitation. In addition, the expenditure or loss may need to be apportioned between deductible and non-deductible amounts. 16. The principles of deductibility under s DA 1 are discussed in Interpretation Statement “IS 14/04: Income tax — Deductibility of company administration costs”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 26, No 7 (August 2014): 5, at \[26\]–\[28\]. Carrying on a business 17. In the context of this Interpretation Statement, it is assumed that before 21 March 2020 (before the lockdown period), 3 a business was being carried on for the purpose of deriving income and deductions were available for any expenditure or loss incurred. The issue is whether, from 21 March 2020, a business was still being carried on, so that any expenditure or loss incurred continues to be deductible. 18. “Business” is defined broadly in s YA 1 as including “any profession, trade, or undertaking carried on for profit”. 2 In the context of s DA 1, the word “incurred” has been held to mean that the taxpayer must have paid or become “definitively committed” to the expenditure or loss (FCT v James Flood (1953) 88 CLR 492 (HCA) and CIR v Mitsubishi Motors NZ Ltd (1995) 17 NZTC 12,351 (PC)). 3 On 21 March 2020, the alert level system was introduced in New Zealand. The whole of New Zealand was initially placed at Alert Level 2. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 9 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 19. The leading case on what constitutes a business is Grieve v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,682 (CA). Grieve concerned a farming activity that, ultimately, did not generate any profits. The issue was whether the taxpayers were carrying on a farming business so they could claim deductions for losses incurred. The Court of Appeal held that whether a taxpayer is in business involves a two-fold inquiry as to the: ••nature of the activities carried on; and ••intention of the taxpayer in engaging in those activities. 20. In the leading judgment, Richardson J identified several factors relevant to determining whether a taxpayer is carrying on a business. These factors are the: ••nature of the activity; ••period over which the activity is engaged in; ••scale of operations and the volume of transactions; ••commitment of time, money and effort; ••pattern of activity; and ••financial results. 21. Richardson J also stated that it might be helpful to consider whether the operations involved are characteristic of that kind of business. However, ultimately, it is the character and circumstances of the particular venture that are crucial, at 61,691: It may be helpful to consider whether the operations involved are of the same kind and are carried on in the same way as those which are characteristic of ordinary trade in the line of business in which the venture was conducted. However, in the end it is the character and circumstances of the particular venture which are crucial. Businesses do not cease to be businesses because they are carried on idiosyncratically or inefficiently or unprofitably, or because the taxpayer derives personal satisfaction from the venture. 22. Therefore, whether a business exists is a question of fact in each case. The Grieve test is discussed in more detail below. Intention to make a profit 23. It is the taxpayer’s subjective intention to make a profit that is relevant, although this must be objectively assessed. 24. A reasonable prospect of profit is not necessary. An actual intention, once established, is sufficient. However, if, realistically, there seems no real prospect of profit, then the taxpayer’s claim that they genuinely intended to carry on a business for profit may be viewed circumspectly. Richardson J, in Grieve, stated (at 61,691) that while a taxpayer’s statements as to their intentions are relevant, “actions will often speak louder than words”. 25. A taxpayer will cease to be in business when it no longer has the intention to make a profit from the activities carried on (AAA Developments (Ormiston) Ltd v CIR (2015) 27 NZTC 22,026 (HC), Case F31 (1983) 6 NZTC 59,712 (TRA), Case G8 (1985) 7 NZTC 1,021 (TRA) and Case J2 (1987) 9 NZTC 1,004 (TRA)). 26. Gendall J in AAA Developments (Ormiston) stated, at \[48\]: At the outset I need to say that, as I see the position, the TRA \[Taxation Review Authority\] was correct in finding that the business of AAA ceased from 24 July 2008. AAA was incorporated for one reason, and one reason alone. That was to develop the Land. From the moment AAA attempted to accept Ormiston’s otherwise invalid cancellation of the purchase agreement, it is difficult to accept AAA’s argument that it still maintained some profit making intention from this point in time forward. Of course, in assessing this criterion it is necessary to have regard to statements made by a taxpayer. However, the ultimate analysis requires an assessment of a taxpayer’s intention gleaned from all relevant circumstances. \[Footnote omitted\] 27. However, an intention to make a profit is not enough to establish that a business is being carried on. A business cannot exist simply in the mind of a taxpayer (Calkin v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,781 (CA)). The nature of the activities carried on also need to be considered. Nature of the activities carried on 28. The nature of the activities carried on must be sufficient to support the concept of a business (Case L19 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,125 (TRA) and Case H63 (1986) 8 NZTC 460 (TRA)). The factors Richardson J identified in Grieve (at \[20\]) may assist with this inquiry. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 10 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 29. In Slater v CIR (1996) 17 NZTC 12,453 (HC), Fisher J explained that the taxpayer must engage in an operational activity that is relevant for the type of business that is being undertaken, at 12,460: The taxpayer must embark on the actual course of conduct which it is hoped would ultimately yield profit if persisted in. I do not think that merely setting up a business structure and purchasing plant or organising the decision-making structures, management and equity structures will suffice. That is not “carrying on a business” but “setting up a business”. Nor do I think that activities which are confined to the organisation of relationships between proprietors, or the making of decisions over their future ownership of the business, would normally qualify because they are nonproductive of income. As I understand it there must be an operational activity. Other matters may well be pre- conditions to operational activity but will not suffice in themselves. 30. However, it is not necessary for a taxpayer to be actually trading or earning assessable income for deductions to be available. This is because the nature of a taxpayer’s business may necessarily require expenditure and negotiations leading to contracts and to earning income (Case M68 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,384 (TRA)). 31. Generally, a business will cease when it ceases trading. However, in Case U29 (2000) 19 NZTC 9,273 (TRA), Judge Barber held that the particular facts of the case need to be examined to ascertain whether a business terminated when trading ceased. Judge Barber stated at \[51\]: It now seems to me that the tidying-up of the affairs of a business could often mean the continuance of the business for income tax purposes for a reasonable period beyond cessation of trading, but one needs to examine the particular facts of the case to ascertain whether or not the business terminated when trading ceased. 32. However, in Case L89 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,508 (TRA), Judge Barber considered that this would not usually be the case and it would always be a question of fact. Determining whether a business has ceased 33. If a business has completely ceased, it is generally unable to claim income tax deductions for any expenditure or loss incurred after cessation. 4 Therefore, it is important to determine whether, in fact, a business has completely ceased. 34. When applying the tests in Grieve, the courts have drawn a distinction between a “temporary cessation of business” (where the business activities have temporarily ceased or been suspended but will recommence) and “cessation with the possibility of recommencement” (where business activities have ceased and it is not certain that the business activities will recommence). Deductions are usually allowed for “temporary cessation” but not for “cessation with the possibility of recommencement”. 35. This distinction was explained in Case F73 (1983) 6 NZTC 59,931 (TRA). The taxpayer company was a partner in a fishing venture. In 1979, the skipper resigned and the boat stopped being used for fishing, although the partners continued to look for a new skipper. In 1980, the boat was removed from the water to reduce overheads and sale became a possibility. The boat was sold a year later. The taxpayer claimed a deduction for expenses incurred in the 1981 income year, arguing that at this stage, there was merely a temporary cessation of the fishing venture. They relied on attempts (that came to nothing) to set up share fishing or leasing arrangements with the boat. 36. Judge Barber held that by 1981 the business had ceased to operate and the partners were biding their time over the best course of action to take. This was not a temporary cessation, but a cessation with the possibility of recommencement: The source of income from fishing no longer existed well before 1 April 1980. I consider that there was not merely a temporary cessation of income earning operations in the partnership. There was a cessation with the possibility of recommencement if a suitable operating structure could be worked out with a third party. \[Emphasis added\] 37. Case F73 predates Grieve, but Judge Barber still considered the nature of the operation and the intention of the taxpayer when deciding the issue. Although the taxpayer retained the main asset (the fishing boat) it was difficult to argue that a business was still operating when the boat was out of the water and had not been used for a long period. In addition, there was no skipper and no licence and the insurance policy for the boat had been changed from offshore to onshore. Judge Barber considered that, while the taxpayer (and the other partners) had explored various options to make a profit, ultimately their intention appeared to have been to sell the boat. 4 However, there are some specific types of employment-related expenditure that may still be deductible following the cessation of a business – see ss DC 1, DC 2 and DC 10 of the Act. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 11 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 38. Case F73 referred to a similar decision by the Australian Supreme Court in Queensland Meat Export Co Ltd v FCT (1939) 4 ATD 176 (QSC). In this case, a meat works company temporarily closed for three years because of competition from a new abattoir in the area. After three years, the directors, who had intended to resume operations when conditions improved, decided to advertise the works for sale as a going concern. No offer was received, so the company sold the buildings, machinery and plant, but not the freehold land or wharf. The company claimed deductions during this period for expenditure incurred in guarding, insuring, maintaining and otherwise protecting the works. The company had continued its meat works business elsewhere in Queensland. The court held that the cessation of business was merely temporary. 39. In Case F73, Judge Barber considered whether the principles in Queensland Meat would apply, at 59,936: ...The Queensland company’s cessation of its Brisbane works was temporary until 5 July 1934; O’s cessation of fishing was permanent from at least June 1980. After 5 July 1934 the Queensland company’s plant was held mainly for sale but also for use if conditions improved; there was no reasonable prospect of recommencement of fishing by the partnership as at 1 April 1980 and sale was contemplated at least by June 1980. The Queensland company still operated a similar business at other works and at all times carried on its overall business as one business which “was so treated in its balance sheet”; O’s other business activities were not related to fishing and were accounted for separately. Both counsel dwelt on various passages in Douglas J’s decision. I do not disagree with the principle of the following extracts from the judgment but they do not assist O in the circumstances of this case (p 493): I think it is one of the incidents of a business of this kind that competition or other adverse condition may compel the owner to close down portion of its plant for an indefinite period. It is an ordinary business precaution that during such period the works and plant should be maintained so far as possible in good working order, whether the ultimate result be that they should again be opened or that they should be sold or eventually dismantled. ... The question whether the cessation of operations is merely of a temporary nature, or is one which has reached the final stage, is difficult to answer. ... Maintenance for a reasonable time of a plant which is about to be sold appears to me to be an incident of the business and to be an outgoing or loss in the gaining or producing of assessable income ... If money is so laid out in the hope that income may accrue from this works or plant in future, or to maintain it in proper order for a reasonable time awaiting sale, it is a proper deduction against profits, even though the profits come from another plant. 40. The court in Queensland Meat accepted that it may be an ordinary incidence of business to shut down for an indefinite period. However, drawing the line between a temporary cessation and cessation with the possibility of recommencement can be difficult. In Queensland Meat, although the company was contemplating a sale, it was still deriving income from other related activities that were part of the wider business. Queensland Meat can be contrasted with Case F73 where the taxpayer had other business activities but they were unconnected to fishing. 41. In Inglis v FCT (1980) 80 ATC 4,001 (FCA), the Full Federal Court of Australia took the opposite view. The taxpayers owned a farming business but stopped actively farming after becoming involved in a legal dispute. They restricted their operations on the property and moved away for employment. The movable farm plant and machinery was disposed of and there was no stock on the property nor any income derived from the property for the relevant years. The taxpayers argued that while they had to restrict their expenditure on the business, they intended to resume it in the future. They claimed deductions for expenses relating to those years. 42. The court held that the business was no longer being carried on and disallowed the taxpayers’ claim. Brennan J observed that the carrying on of a business was not just a matter of intention, but it was also a matter of activity, at 4,004: ...The carrying on of a business is not a matter merely of intention. It is a matter of activity. Yet the degree of activity which is requisite to the carrying on of a business varies according to the circumstances in which the supposed business is being conducted. Little activity may suffice for carrying on a business which does not call for much activity, as in Thomas v. F.C. of T. 72 ATC 4094; 46 A.L.J.R. 397 and in Ferguson v. F.C. of T. 79 ATC 4261. It must be remembered that “(b)usiness is not confined to being busy; in many businesses long intervals of inactivity occur” as Lord Sumner observed in South Behar Ry. Co. Ltd. v. I.R. Commrs. (1925) A.C. 476 at p. 488. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 12 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 43. Brennan J stated that even if the intention of the owner was relevant in determining whether a business is merely going through a quiet period or has ceased, an intention to revive a business in the future does not prevent a finding that it has ceased to be carried on. Further, whether a business was being carried on could largely be determined by the extent of activity. Since all farming activities had stopped, it was held that no business was, in fact, being carried out on the taxpayer’s property. 5 44. Ultimately, whether a business has ceased is a question of fact in each case. However, it will be easier to argue a business is being carried on where it is well-established and it has kept its business structure and assets in place. Properly maintaining assets and expending time and effort on a relaunch will also support the argument that a business was continuing despite a hiatus. Business disruption and the COVID-19 pandemic 45. Many businesses have faced significant disruption because of the COVID-19 pandemic. They have responded in different ways such as downscaling, temporary suspension or cessation of activities, permanent cessation, or cessation with the possibility of restarting. These responses are discussed next. Downscaling a business 46. Some businesses have had to downscale their operations until conditions improve by reducing staff numbers or hours of operation. As long as there is still an intention to make a profit and sufficient operational activity (relevant to that type of business and current market conditions), then it is likely that a business is still being carried on and any expenditure or loss incurred can be deducted. 47. The courts have recognised that an enterprise can downscale without ceasing to be a business. In Case F131 (1984) 6 NZTC 60,200 (TRA), Judge Barber held that, although the greater part of an enterprise may be sold and the balance continued for a time, it does not mean the owners are no longer in business. (In this case, Judge Barber found, as a matter of fact, that there was no business.) 48. However, there will come a point where the downscaling is to such a degree that it indicates the business has ceased. In Case J78 (1987) 9 NZTC 1,459 (TRA), an elderly couple decided to reduce the area of their farm from 50 acres to four acres to cut costs and alleviate the physical burden of farming. They also decided to diversify their farming from annual crops to longer-term crops that required less effort. The longer-term crops were not readily available, so the couple continued to farm as usual, but only on the four acres. They farmed this way, knowing there would be little chance of a profit, and worked part-time jobs to supplement their income. The couple claimed deductions for business losses over the period. The Commissioner disallowed the claim on the basis that they had not been carrying on a business. Judge Barber agreed with the Commissioner. By farming on a reduced scale and with the knowledge that they would not make a profit, the taxpayers could not be regarded as carrying on a business. They continued to farm the land because their culture frowned upon land lying unused. The small amount of development activity was not enough to change this conclusion. Temporary cessation of business activities 49. Some businesses have had to stop operating temporarily because of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, during Alert Level 4, many businesses were required by law to cease trading. For many businesses, this would have been a temporary cessation of business. The business would have had the intention to make a profit, but, due to the lockdown, all business activity had to temporarily cease. The Commissioner considers that any expenditure or loss incurred during Alert Level 4 is likely to be deductible, provided there was still an intention to make a profit. 50. This temporary cessation of activities may have extended beyond Alert Level 4. Many businesses remained closed during Alert Levels 3 and 2. Depending on the business, and provided there was still an intention to make a profit, the Commissioner considers that any expenditure or loss incurred during these alert levels is also likely to be deductible. Permanent cessation of business activities or cessation with the possibility of restarting 51. Not all businesses that stopped operating during the lockdown period would have done so on a temporary basis. If a business completely ceased trading during this period (for example, it laid-off staff, abandoned a lease, and returned stock), then there is no longer an intention to make a profit, so a business is not being carried on. It is irrelevant that the taxpayer might intend to start up the business later if conditions improve. A future intention to start up the business and to make a profit will not satisfy this test. Expenditure or loss incurred after a business has ceased is generally not deductible (Case U29). 5 Note that the Australian income tax legislation definition of “business” does not require a profitmaking intention, but New Zealand income tax legislation does. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 13 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 52. In some cases, taxpayers may have decided to put their businesses up for sale during the lockdown period or even after it. Whether a business has ceased completely is a matter of fact. If the business intends to make a profit during this period and there is sufficient operational activity, then it is likely that the business is still being carried on. However, in Case F31, Judge Barber held that the taxpayer’s intention to make a profit ceased on the date they decided to sell the property on which they carried on business, on the basis that they were no longer trading and had decided to sell. GST and business cessation 53. Similar questions may arise for businesses in a GST context where the business has been disrupted because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 54. A person must be registered for GST to claim input tax deductions. The Commissioner can cancel a person’s registration if they cease to carry on a taxable activity. In addition, a registered person can ask the Commissioner to cancel their registration if they have ceased to be liable to register (because the expected value of their taxable supplies in the next 12 months is not expected to exceed $60,000) (s 52 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act)). 55. “Carrying on a taxable activity” is a different test to “carrying on a business” in s DA 1. “Taxable activity” is defined in s 6(1) of the GST Act to mean: Section 6 Meaning of term taxable activity (1) For the purposes of this Act, the term taxable activity means— (a) any activity which is carried on continuously or regularly by any person, whether or not for a pecuniary profit, and involves or is intended to involve, in whole or in part, the supply of goods and services to any other person for a consideration; and includes any such activity carried on in the form of a business, trade, manufacture, profession, vocation, association, or club: (b) limiting the generality of paragraph (a), the activities of any public authority or any local authority or public purpose Crown-controlled company. (2) Anything done in connection with the beginning or ending, including a premature ending, of a taxable activity is treated as being carried out in the course or furtherance of the taxable activity. 56. A taxable activity must be carried on “continuously or regularly”. To be carried on “continuously”, the activity cannot have ceased or been interrupted for any material period (Wakelin v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,182 (HC)). 57. Section 6(2) extends the scope of s 6(1), by providing that anything done in connection with the ending of a taxable activity (including the premature ending of a taxable activity) is treated as being carried out in the course or furtherance of the taxable activity. This is the case, even if the taxable activity has ceased. Section 6(2) deems the taxable activity to have continued for anything done in connection with the ending of the taxable activity. Example 5 illustrates how this provision applies. 58. The COVID-19 pandemic may have resulted in some GST-registered businesses having to downscale or cease their taxable activities. The consequences for this are set out in s 52(1)–(5), (5A) and (7) of the GST Act: Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 14 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Section 52 Cancellation of registration (1) Subject to this Act, every registered person who carries on any taxable activity shall cease to be liable to be registered where at any time the Commissioner is satisfied that the value of that person’s taxable supplies in the period of 12 months then beginning will be not more than the amount specified for the purposes of section 51(1). (2) Every person who, by virtue of subsection (1), ceases to be liable to be registered may request the Commissioner to cancel that person’s registration, and if the Commissioner is at any time satisfied, as mentioned in subsection (1), the Commissioner shall cancel that person’s registration with effect from the last day of the taxable period during which the Commissioner was so satisfied, or from such other date as may be determined by the Commissioner, and shall notify that person of the date on which the cancellation of the registration takes effect. (3) Every registered person who ceases to carry on all taxable activities shall inform the Commissioner of that fact within 21 days of the date of cessation and the Commissioner shall cancel the registration of any such person with effect from the last day of the taxable period during which all such taxable activities ceased, or from such other date as may be determined by the Commissioner: provided that the Commissioner shall not at any time cancel the registration of any such registered person if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the registered person will carry on any taxable activity at any time within 12 months from that date of cessation. (4) Any information provided by a registered person to the Commissioner under subsection (3) must include the date on which the person ceased to carry on all taxable activities and whether or not the person intends to carry on any taxable activity within 12 months from that date. (5) Where the Commissioner is satisfied that a registered person is not carrying on a taxable activity the Commissioner may cancel that person’s registration with effect from the last day of the taxable period during which the Commissioner was so satisfied, or from such other date as may be determined by the Commissioner, and shall notify that person of the date on which the cancellation of the registration takes effect. (5A) Any date determined by the Commissioner for the cancellation of registration under subsection (5) may be retrospective to a date not earlier than— (a) the last day of the taxable period during which taxable activity by the person ceased; or (b) the date on which the person was registered under this Act, if the Commissioner is satisfied that the person did not, from that date, carry on any taxable activity. (6) \[Repealed\] (7) In subsections (5) and (5A), for a non-resident person who is not registered under section 54B, a taxable activity means a taxable activity carried on in New Zealand. 59. If the taxable activity has been downscaled to such an extent that it is not expected to make taxable supplies exceeding $60,000 in the next 12 months, the registered person can choose to deregister from GST (s 52(1) and (2) of the GST Act). 60. If a registered person is no longer carrying on a taxable activity because of the COVID19 pandemic, they need to inform the Commissioner within 21 days of cessation. The Commissioner may then cancel that person’s GST registration. The Commissioner cannot cancel the person’s GST registration if there are reasonable grounds for believing the person will carry on any taxable activity at any time within 12 months from the date of cessation (s 52(3) of the GST Act). 61. On ceasing to be registered for GST, the person must make a deregistration adjustment on the deemed supply of the assets used in their taxable activity (s 5(3) of the GST Act). 62. The Commissioner has issued a statutory variation 6 to provide limited relief for registered persons with a taxable activity of supplying accommodation: “COV 20/09: Variation to sections 52(3) and 52(4) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985”, Ta x Information Bulletin Vol 32, No 8 (September 2020): 22. The variation only applies to short-stay accommodation suppliers that, between 14 February 2020 and 31 October 2020, switched to making exempt supplies of longer-term residential accommodation, leaving them with no taxable activity. The cessation of the person’s taxable activity during this period must have been because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In these circumstances, the Commissioner will not cancel the person’s registration if there are reasonable grounds for believing they will carry on any taxable activity at any time within 18 months from the date their taxable activity ceased. 6 Under s 6I of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 15 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Examples 63. The following examples explain the application of the law. They concern the deductibility of expenditure or loss for the 2021 tax year and beyond. The examples assume: ••the taxpayer was carrying on a business before the lockdown period; ••none of the general limitations in s DA 2 apply; ••the taxpayer was carrying on a taxable activity before the lockdown period; and ••the taxpayer was registered for GST. 64. Some of the difficulty in determining what expenditure and losses are deductible in periods when a business has ceased operating is because of the uncertainty created by COVID-19. It is difficult to know when market conditions will improve and when the borders will reopen. However, in most cases, by the time the taxpayer files a tax return they will know whether their business activities have ceased temporarily or permanently. If business activities have ceased permanently, it will be important to identify when this occurred because any expenditure or loss incurred after this date is unlikely to be deductible. Example 1 – English language school Facts English Language School Ltd operated a busy language school until the COVID-19 pandemic struck. All enrolled students were from overseas. When New Zealand entered Alert Level 4 (on 25 March 2020), the school had to close, and it remained closed until New Zealand returned to Alert Level 2 (on 13 May 2020). Alert Levels 3 and 4 During the lockdown periods at Alert Levels 3 and 4, the school accessed the wage subsidy and continued to pay its staff. It also continued to pay rent, rates, power, water and insurance relating to the school building. During this time, no teaching took place, but the school’s two shareholders continued to undertake marketing work and provide pastoral care to students that remained in New Zealand. They also used this time to investigate ways to provide online English language tuition. At this time, the business has been downscaled. There is an intention to operate once the lockdown period is over. All activities undertaken during this period support this finding. Income tax deductions for expenditure incurred during this period are allowed. The school’s GST-registration status does not change. Alert Level 2 At Alert Level 2, the school opens its doors again but about 90% of its students have left New Zealand. Most students stay in New Zealand for about 11 weeks, so by now most have left and no new students will arrive due to border restrictions. When the wage subsidy ends, all staff are made redundant. The two shareholders continue to teach the 10% of students who remain. They also continue to work on marketing and developing online English language tuition technology. The business continues to operate and income tax deductions for costs incurred during this period are allowed. While the business has been significantly reduced in size, this does not mean it has ceased. An intention to make a profit still exists (and the exploration of online learning possibilities supports this) and there is enough operational activity to support the finding that a business is being carried on. The school’s GST-registration status does not change. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 16 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Alert Level 1 By 1 September 2020, all students have returned home and it is clear that online learning is not going to be a viable alternative to classroom learning. The school shuts down. The shareholders are hopeful that once the borders reopen, they will be able to start up again, but there is uncertainty about when this might occur. Costs are still being incurred. The shareholders terminate the lease on the school building and must make a lease termination payment as a consequence. The school’s assets (furniture, computers, books, stationery and so on) are put into storage and the school is charged a monthly fee. Some legal fees are incurred for advice on the redundancies and lease termination. The Commissioner considers that from 1 September 2020, the business has ceased to operate. There is no longer an intention to make a profit because the school has shut down and is no longer operational. Expenditure incurred beyond this point is not deductible. For GST purposes, the shareholders have been advised to remain GST registered for a few months to ensure that input tax can be claimed on any costs incurred in winding-up the business (included as part of the taxable activity (s 6(2)). By the end of October, all activities relating to the wind-up have ceased and the shareholders notify the Commissioner under s 52(3) that from 31 October they have ceased to carry on a taxable activity. The Commissioner then cancels the GST registration from 31 October (s 52(5A)(a)) and the shareholders make a deregistration adjustment under s 5(3). Establishment of a new business After closing the school, the two shareholders decide to give online learning another try. They set up a new business, Online Home School Ltd. This time they are successful in attracting a small group of international students who are eager to learn English online. They run this business from their home. Expenditure incurred on this new business is deductible. There is an intention to make a profit and the operational activity is sufficient to support the finding that a business is being carried on. However, because this is a new business, the shareholders are unable to deduct any of the costs that relate to the English language school business such as the monthly storage fees. Online Home School Ltd may need to register for GST if the shareholders expect its turnover will exceed $60,000 in the next 12 months. Example 2 – Souvenir wholesaler Facts Magnets & More Ltd is a souvenir wholesale business, supplying New Zealand–themed souvenirs to retailers. Since New Zealand entered Alert Level 4 on 25 March 2020, the company has not made a single sale. Many of the company’s retailer customers have closed and none are selling New Zealand–themed souvenirs. Homer is the director and sole shareholder of Magnets & More. He is close to retirement age and is the company’s only employee. The company owns the warehouse where the business is run from, and overheads are low. The company has about $100,000 of stock on hand and will not order any more for now. Initially, Homer goes to the warehouse every day. He checks his emails for orders and makes calls to his customers. He keeps the warehouse clean and continues to pay a security guard service to monitor and patrol the building. However, by August 2020, it becomes clear to Homer that the New Zealand borders are likely to be closed for the foreseeable future. With no other options available and no chance of leasing the warehouse in the current market, Homer decides to change focus. He shuts down his website and moves cities to help look after his grandchildren. He is hopeful that one day he may be able to start up the business again, but for now he will focus on his family. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 17 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Income Tax During the 2021 tax year, the company continues to incur costs, including rates, power, water, security and insurance. Homer wants to know whether any of these costs are deductible. The Commissioner considers that from August 2020 that Magnets & More has ceased to operate, so any expenditure incurred after this date will not be deductible. The complete lack of any operational activity during this time supports this conclusion. The nature of the company’s activities during this period, the volume of transactions, the pattern of activity, the financial results and the commitment of time, money and effort, do not suggest an intention to make a profit. The fact that Homer has retained the business assets for now (the remaining souvenirs and the building) does not mean that he continues to carry on a business. GST For GST purposes, Homer remains GST-registered for a few months to ensure that input tax can be claimed on any costs incurred in winding-up the business (included as part of the taxable activity (s 6(2)). By the end of March 2021, all activities relating to the wind-up have ceased and Homer notifies the Commissioner under s 52(3) that from 31 March he has ceased to carry on a taxable activity. The Commissioner then cancels his GST registration from 31 March (s 52(5A)(a)) and Homer must make a deregistration adjustment under s 5(3). Example 3 – Fashion boutique Facts Angela is a sole trader who owns a fashion boutique in a tourist destination. She designs and hand-makes elaborate, embroidered jackets. The jackets are mainly sold to international tourists who visit the town. When New Zealand entered Alert Level 4, Angela closed her boutique and put the unsold jackets into a special, climate- controlled storage facility to help preserve them. This facility costs Angela $50 a month. She gave notice on her lease but still had two months of payments to make. She continued to pay rates, insurance, power and water during this time. During Alert Level 4 and later at Alert Level 3, Angela continued to work on her business from home. She set up an online boutique. However, over the next few months she failed to sell any of her jackets online, so she decided to diversify her business. She starts making cheaper, less elaborate clothing for the domestic market. She also picks up a contract to make uniforms for a local school. She decides to stop making embroidered jackets. Income Tax The Commissioner considers that while Angela’s business operations temporarily ceased during Alert Levels 4 and 3, she continued to carry on a business, so any expenditure or loss incurred during this time will be deductible. Angela’s intention was always to make a profit, and her decision to diversify her business and shift to an online store to generate income supports this intention. Looking at the nature of the business’s activities during Alert Levels 4 and 3, there was a temporary reduction in the volume of transactions and financial results, but these rebounded quickly as the business diversified. Angela continued to commit time, money and effort to the business. GST For GST purposes, Angela continues to be GST-registered. She is still carrying on a taxable activity, her turnover exceeded $60,000 in the last 12 months, and she expects turnover will exceed $60,000 in the next 12 months. Even if her turnover is less than $60,000 in the next 12 months, Angela can choose to remain registered. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 18 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Example 4 – Boat cruise operator Facts Wiremu operates a harbour boat cruise business through his company. His customers are almost 100% international tourists. When New Zealand moved to Alert Level 4, Wiremu had no option but to close. Wiremu plans to reopen during the school holidays and then, hopefully, to reopen fully in 18 months when the borders re- open. Wiremu gets other flexible employment Monday–Friday to pay the bills. During weekends, he spends a few hours maintaining and running the boat and cleaning and repairing his premises. He occasionally orders fuel and parts from suppliers. He has also renewed his skipper license. After work, he regularly spends time updating his website and Facebook page, answering booking queries and dealing with refund requests. He researches market conditions and continues to advertise the business. He gets good bookings for the school holidays, so takes a break from his job and has a couple of successful weeks in September and October taking harbour cruises. Wiremu also operates for several days over the Christmas break, despite not being as busy as he used to be with international tourists. From time to time, Wiremu speaks with the company he leases the boat from and the bank about his loans. The business still owns a ute that he makes payments on. Income Tax The Commissioner considers that the business continues to operate, just on a much reduced scale. Expenditure incurred during this period is deductible. Wiremu still clearly has an intention to make a profit. He continues to keep the business assets clean and in working order and has reopened for periods, including the school holidays. He has renewed his skipper’s licence and is taking bookings. Looking at the nature of the activities carried on, time, money and effort continue to be committed to the business. The underlying business structure and assets are still available for use, and the business continued to earn income at times throughout the year. While the volume of transactions and pattern of activity have diminished considerably, this is consistent with the nature of the business as it has adapted to the new conditions New Zealand must operate under. GST For GST purposes, Wiremu’s business continues to be GST-registered. He is still carrying on a taxable activity, his turnover exceeded $60,000 in the last 12 months and he expects it will exceed $60,000 in the next 12 months. Even if his turnover is less than $60,000 in the next 12 months, Wiremu can choose to remain registered. Example 5 – Commercial property Facts Debbie owns a commercial property on the outskirts of a large city, carrying on the business of commercial leasing. Her tenant moved out shortly before New Zealand entered Alert Level 4. Since then, the property has remained vacant, despite this being an area with a shortage of commercial property spaces. Debbie continues to incur expenditure relating to the property such as council rates, water, power and insurance. She has made no efforts to advertise the property for lease and has engaged a valuer to value the property with a view to selling it. Income Tax The Commissioner considers that the business has ceased. Debbie no longer has an intention to make a profit. This is demonstrated by the fact she has not advertised the property for lease and obtained a valuation for the purposes of selling the property. In terms of the nature of the activity, no real operational activity (leasing or attempts at leasing) is taking place. GST Debbie may still claim back the GST on the valuation and will have to account for GST on the sale of the property because anything done in connection with the beginning or ending of a taxable activity is treated as being carried out in the course or furtherance of the taxable activity (s 6(2) of the GST Act). When her taxable activity has finally ceased, Debbie will need to notify the Commissioner under s 52(3). She will also need to make a GST deregistration adjustment under s 5(3). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 19 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Example 6 – Backpacker hostel Facts Malu owns and operates a backpacker hostel. His customers are mainly overseas students and travellers. The business had been struggling for a while with low occupancy rates. On 25 March 2020, things got considerably worse for Malu when New Zealand entered Alert Level 4. Customers stop arriving in New Zealand, and the hostel remains empty. This is the final straw for Malu and on 1 April 2020 he decides to close the doors on the hostel for good. He keeps busy teaching yoga and helping in a local cafe. In December 2020, Malu is approached by a local orchard owner. The orchard owner would like to use Malu’s hostel to house seasonal workers on favourable terms. Malu agrees and re-opens the hostel. Income tax The Commissioner considers that from 1 April 2020, there has been a permanent cessation of business, so expenditure incurred after this date is not deductible. Malu does not have an intention to make a profit, and there is insufficient operational activity to satisfy the business test. However, the costs Malu incurs in operating the hostel from December 2020 for the seasonal workers will be deductible against that income. GST For GST purposes, Malu remains GST-registered for a few months to ensure that input tax can be claimed on any costs incurred in winding-up the business (including as part of the taxable activity (s 6(2)). By the end of July, all activities relating to the wind-up have ceased and Malu notifies the Commissioner under s 52(3) that from 31 July he has ceased to carry on a taxable activity. The Commissioner then cancels the GST registration from 31 July (s 52(5A)(a)). Malu makes a deregistration adjustment under s 5(3). In December 2020, Malu restarts his activity. While he is arguably carrying on a taxable activity again, he does not believe that housing seasonal workers will generate taxable supplies over $60,000 in the next 12 months. He therefore decides not to register for GST. Example 7 – Café Facts Ari operates a busy café in the Auckland CBD through his company Café Ltd. His customers mainly come from the surrounding businesses. When Ari set up the cafe, he purchased a new cooker and display cabinet. These acquisitions were funded by a bank loan. He has also outfitted a private function room at the back of the café with new tables and chairs. He intended to use this room for hosting catered functions. On 21 March 2020, New Zealand entered Alert Level 2. Ari purchased hand sanitiser and masks for his staff and pens and clipboards for recording customer contact details. During this time, the number of customers dropped significantly. Many CBD workers chose to work from home. Those that came into the café were understandably concerned about the spread of COVID-19 and ordered their food to take away. On 23 March 2020, New Zealand entered Alert Level 3. Given the restrictions placed on cafes and the fact that many of his customers were now working from home, Ari temporarily closed the café. Assisted by the wage subsidy, Ari was able to continue to employ his head chef Nina and three other staff members throughout Alert Levels 3 and 4. On 13 May 2020, New Zealand was back at Alert Level 2 and Ari opened the café again. Customer numbers were down and very few customers were dining-in. By 8 June 2020, New Zealand was at Alert Level 1 and many workers were back in the CBD. Business picked up again. On 12 August 2020, Auckland was put into Alert Level 3. Ari tried to trade from a table at the front of the store. Again, with most of the CBD workers at home, he struggled to make any money. This pattern was repeated in the February 2021 lockdowns. Towards the end of February 2021, Ari made two staff redundant. He also sold the function room table and chairs, at a loss, as there had been no interest in using the dining room for private catered functions. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 20 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Income Tax Throughout this period, Ari continues to carry on a business. The business had to temporarily stop trading during Alert Level 4 (and the first Alert Level 3), but there was still an intention to make a profit. While the business has downscaled, all expenditure or losses incurred will still be deductible. This includes expenditure on hand sanitiser, masks and clipboards. It also includes rent, power, water, insurance, salary payments and KiwiSaver contributions. Redundancy payments are deductible under s DC 1 and the interest on the bank loan (used to acquire the cooker and display cabinet) is deductible under s DB 7. Ari can also continue to claim depreciation deductions for his fixed assets – such as the cooker and display cabinet under s EE 6. It is not relevant that the cooker and display cabinet were not used during Alert Levels 3 and 4. They were available for use, which is sufficient for the purposes of s EE 1(2)(c). Ari can also claim a deduction for the loss made on the sale of the private function room table and chairs. GST Ari continues to carry on a taxable activity. While his turnover has now slipped below $60,000, he expects to have a turnover in excess of $60,000 in the next 12 months so must stay GST-registered. Ari must charge output tax on the sale of the function room table and chairs. Example 8 – Guiding business to seed business Facts Martha ran a guiding business called “Lost in Nature” in one of New Zealand’s national parks. Her customers were mainly foreign tourists. The business operated from a small office near the entrance to the national park and it employed Martha and three guides. It owned two large 4-wheel drive vehicles for transporting customers and some specialist camping equipment. From 19 March 2020, (when New Zealand closed its borders to international tourists), Martha suddenly had no customers. She struggled to attract New Zealand-based customers, despite a concerted marketing push. The business limped on through 2020 running weekly guided tours. However, the tours were often half-empty, and it was clear this would not be sustainable, especially when the wage subsidy ended. Martha spent her spare time investigating the possibility of using some land she owned to plant native seedlings for sale. She has a background in horticulture and used her industry contacts to commission a short report. Based on this research, she was confident the business would be profitable. To get things started, Martha had her three employee-guides help her put up some fencing on the land and prepare the soil for planting. In September 2020, with no likelihood of the border re-opening, Martha stopped advertising “Lost in Nature” and switched to growing and selling native seedlings. Her three employee-guides were employed in the new venture and the 4-wheel drive vehicles were adapted for carrying seedlings and supplies. Martha sold the specialist camping equipment at a loss. Income Tax During this time, “Lost in Nature” downscaled but continued to operate as a business until September 2020. All expenditure or losses incurred up to that point are deductible. There was an intention to make a profit and enough operational activity to satisfy the Commissioner that a business was being carried on. The loss on the sale of specialist camping equipment is deductible as the sale occurred before the guiding business ceased operating. The sale did not give rise to depreciation recovery income. Costs incurred in researching the feasibility of undertaking the plant business (including the report) are not deductible as they are feasibility expenditure incurred preliminary to or preparatory to the start of a business. Similarly, costs incurred in fencing and preparing the land for planting are capital costs. Fencing costs may be depreciable as land improvements under sch 13 of the Act. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 21 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS GST Initial orders in the seedling business suggest that Martha is likely to have a turnover exceeding $60,000 in the next 12 months. Therefore, she must keep her GST registration and cannot deregister. Because the vehicles and building will be used in the new taxable activity, she does not need to make a deregistration adjustment under s 5(3). The sale of the specialist camping equipment must be charged with GST output tax.

This item provides guidance on the meaning of the term “resident” for GST purposes. The GST definition of resident differs from the income tax definition: ••By extending it to include a person who is carrying on a taxable activity or other activity in New Zealand, if that person has a “fixed or permanent” place in New Zealand and that place relates to the activity in New Zealand. In this case the residency is “to the extent” of the New Zealand activity (discussed from \[14\]). ••For unincorporated bodies, it provides for a residence test based on its centre of administrative management (discussed from \[39\]). ••For individuals, the definition differs for the commencement and end dates of residency when applying the day-count test (discussed from \[42\]). 2. The importance of determining whether a person is a New Zealand resident for GST purposes is that it may affect whether GST needs to be charged on any supplies made to that person. It is also relevant to whether the person is required to charge and account for GST on supplies they make in New Zealand and whether a person can or is required to register for GST in New Zealand. 3. While many people are familiar with the income tax rules for determining residency and know whether they are resident under the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA 2007), they may be unsure whether the connection or presence they have in New Zealand is sufficient for them to be treated as a resident for GST purposes. 4. The Commissioner discussed the law relating to determining whether a person is nonresident for GST purposes in “IS 21/03: GST – Registration of non-residents under section 54B” and in “IS 18/07: Goods and services tax – zero-rating of services related to land”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31, No 1 (February 2019): 17. This statement is consistent with the analysis in IS 21/03 and IS 18/07. 5. This statement updates and replaces “GST: Scope of the term ‘resident’”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 1, No 9 (March 1990) and “GST: The definition of resident”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 5, No 12 (May 1994). 6. For further information on residence for income tax purposes, see “IS 16/03: Tax residence”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 10 (October 2016): 2. Introduction 7. Whether a person is resident for GST purposes is an important consideration for several matters relating to GST. For example, it is: ••relevant to where supplies are treated as being made under s 8; 1 ••a factor in determining the applicable rate of GST that may be chargeable on certain supplies under s 11; and ••a requirement for non-resident registration under s 54B (see in “IS 21/03: GST – Registration of non-residents under section 54B”, Inland Revenue 2021). 8. Most people are familiar with the income tax test for residency and know whether they are non-resident for income tax purposes. However, the GST definition of resident is wider, so some non-residents may be treated as a resident for GST purposes and may be unaware of the difference in the two definitions. 1 Flowcharts providing an overview of the place of supply rules are in “IS 21/03: GST – Registration of non-residents under section 54B” (Inland Revenue, 2021). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 24 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Who is a resident for GST purposes? Definition of resident – GST 9. The definition of “resident” in s 2 for GST purposes is: resident means resident as determined in accordance with sections YD 1 and YD 2 (excluding section YD 2(2)) of the Income Tax Act 2007: provided that, notwithstanding anything in those section, - (a) a person shall be deemed to be resident in New Zealand to the extent that that person carries on, in New Zealand, any taxable activity or any other activity, while having any fixed or permanent place in New Zealand relating to that taxable activity or other activity: (b) a person who is an unincorporated body is deemed to be resident in New Zealand if the body has its centre of administrative management in New Zealand: (c) the effect of the rules in section YD 1(4) and (6) of that Act are ignored in determining the residence or non-residence of a natural person, and residence is treated as— (i) starting on the day immediately following the relevant day that triggers residence under section YD 1(3) of that Act; or (ii) ending on the day immediately following the relevant day that triggers nonresidence under section YD 1(5) of that Act 10. First, the definition of “resident” refers to resident as determined under ss YD 1 and YD 2 (but not YD 2(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007). Section YD 1 sets out the rules for the residence of a natural person and section YD 2 sets out the rules for the residence of companies. For GST purposes, s 2 defines a “company” to include any limited partnership registered under the Limited Partnerships Act 2008. 11. Secondly, the definition of “resident” in s 2 modifies the income tax definition of resident by providing for three exceptions in paras (a) to (c): ••Paragraph (a) refers to whether a person has an activity in New Zealand and a “fixed or permanent place” in New Zealand relating to that activity (see from \[14\]). ••Paragraph (b) relates to unincorporated bodies (see from \[39\]). ••Paragraph (c) relates to the effect of the day-count tests in the income tax residency tests (see from \[42\]). 12. If a person is a resident under s YD 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, they will be resident for GST purposes, even if under a relevant Double Taxation Agreement the person’s tax residence for income tax purposes is found to be in another jurisdiction. This might arise, for example, where a person retains a dwelling in New Zealand which is the person’s permanent place of abode. 13. A non-resident is defined in s 2 to mean a person “to the extent that the person is not resident in New Zealand”. Resident “to the extent of” activity in New Zealand - para (a) of the definition of resident 14. Paragraph (a) of the definition of resident deems a person to be resident to the extent that the person carries on their taxable or other activity in New Zealand from a fixed or permanent place in New Zealand that is related to that activity. 15. Therefore, the main considerations to determine whether a person is deemed to be a resident for GST purposes relate to the meaning of: ••“taxable activity or other activity”; ••“fixed or permanent place”; ••“relating to that activity or other activity”; and ••“to the extent that” and whether a person can be both resident and non-resident for GST purposes. Taxable activity or other activity 16. For the purposes of the resident definition, the focus of para (a) is on the activity being carried on by the person in New Zealand. The activity may be a taxable activity or any other activity, but in either case, the person will only be resident to the extent of the activity in New Zealand. In addition, while carrying on the activity the person must have a fixed or permanent place in New Zealand relating to that activity. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 25 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Taxable activity 17. A broad definition for this term is given in s 6(1)(a) with certain activities being specifically excluded in s 6(3): 6 Meaning of term taxable activity (1) For the purposes of this Act, the term taxable activity means— (a) any activity which is carried on continuously or regularly by any person, whether or not for a pecuniary profit, and involves or is intended to involve, in whole or in part, the supply of goods and services to any other person for a consideration; and includes any such activity carried on in the form of a business, trade, manufacture, profession, vocation, association, or club: ... (3) Notwithstanding anything in subsections (1) and (2), for the purposes of this Act the term taxable activity shall not include, in relation to any person,— (a) being a natural person, any activity carried on essentially as a private recreational pursuit or hobby; or (aa) not being a natural person, any activity which, if it were carried on by a natural person, would be carried on essentially as a private recreational pursuit or hobby; or (b) any engagement, occupation, or employment under any contract of service or as a director of a company, subject to subsection (4); or: (c) (i) any engagement, occupation, or employment— pursuant to the Members of Parliament (Remuneration and Services) Act 2013 or the Governor-General Act 2010: (ii) as a Judge, Solicitor-General, Controller and Auditor-General, or Ombudsman: (iia) pursuant to an appointment made by the Governor-General or the Governor-General in Council and evidenced by a warrant or by an Order in Council or by a notice published in the Gazette in accordance with section 2(2) of the Official Appointments and Documents Act 1919: (iii) as a Chairman or member of any local authority or any statutory board, council, committee, or other body, subject to subsection (4); or (d) any activity to the extent to which the activity involves the making of exempt supplies. 18. The main requirements of a taxable activity are: ••there must be an activity; ••that activity must be carried on continuously or regularly by a person; and ••that activity must involve the making of taxable supplies. 19. Notably, however, s 6(3) excludes certain activities from being taxable activities. Examples of excluded activities are: ••the making of exempt supplies (such as the supply of financial services and the supply of accommodation in a dwelling); and ••private recreational pursuits or hobbies. 20. Determining whether a taxable activity is being carried on is always a question of fact. It involves examining all the circumstances of the particular case. The concept of a taxable activity is not considered further in this statement as it is covered in publications such as “IS 20/04: Goods and services tax – GST treatment of short-stay accommodation”, Ta x Information Bulletin Vol 32, No 6 (July 2020): 69. Other activity 21. Paragraph (a) in the definition of “resident” also includes “other” activities in its scope. The terms “activity” and “other activity” are not defined in the Act. 22. The word “activity” has a broad meaning. It may refer to “a course of conduct or series of acts which a person has chosen to undertake or become engaged in”: Newman v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,229 (HC). Similarly, the Court of Appeal in CIR v Bayly (1998) 18 NZTC 14,073 said, at 14,078: Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 26 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS In its standard dictionary usage, “activity” is “the state of being active; the exertion of energy, action” (Oxford English Dictionary). In the context of ss 6 and 8 \[of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985\] it points to the combination of tasks undertaken, or course of conduct pursued by the registered person and whether or not it amounted to a business, trade or profession in the ordinary sense. 23. Both Newman and Bayly discuss the meaning of an “activity” in their discussion of a “taxable activity”. The Commissioner’s view is that “activity” in “other activity” bears the same meaning. 24. The reference to “other activities” expands the range of activities, so that not only “taxable activities” can result in residency under the Act. The word “other” implies that Parliament intended a wide variety of activities to be covered by para (a), which will include the activity of making exempt supplies. Fixed or permanent place 25. For para (a) to apply, a person must also have a “fixed or permanent place” in New Zealand relating to the taxable or other activity in New Zealand. The term “fixed or permanent place” is not defined in the Act. 26. The word “place” indicates a physical location or a link to a particular geographical point. The place must be “fixed” or “permanent”. The ordinary meanings of the words “fixed” and “permanent” indicate that the physical location must be lasting and unchanging and not temporary. 27. The Commissioner notes that a similar concept of “fixed establishment” is used in the Income Tax Act 2007 and the phrase “permanent establishment” is used in New Zealand’s double tax treaties. Case law discusses the meanings of these phrases, and the concepts overlap with the concept of a “fixed or permanent place”. 28. The Commissioner’s view is that the “fixed establishment” and “permanent establishment” concepts are not equivalent to “fixed or permanent place” under the Goods and Services Tax Act. This is because, for income tax purposes, the linkage required between a “permanent establishment” or a “fixed establishment” and a business is stronger than the linkage required, for GST purposes, between a fixed or permanent place and the New Zealand activity. 29. For income tax purposes, the fixed establishment is “a fixed place of business in which substantial business is carried on by the person”. The requirement to carry on a business through the fixed place is also included in the definition of a permanent establishment, which refers to “a fixed place of business through which the business of a person ... is wholly or partly carried on”. For GST purposes, the definition of resident requires that the “fixed or permanent place” simply relates to the activity that is being carried on. It does not require that the activity amount to a business, nor does it require that the activity be carried on in or through the fixed or permanent place. 30. In addition, the income tax terms are defined to specifically exclude a number of establishments (such as, facilities for storage, display or delivery) while the GST definition is general in its terms. However, the Commissioner accepts that the various commentaries relating to the OECD Model Tax Convention and the OECD Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to prevent BEPS may be useful in understanding the similarities and differences in the terms. “Having” a fixed and permanent place “relating” to the activity 31. Having a fixed or permanent place looks at the connection between the person and the place. “Having” a place does not require ownership or a formal lease of the physical location but will require the person to have a place at their disposal, or available for their use, relating to their New Zealand activity. As para (a) refers to the person “having a fixed or permanent place”, the relationship that the person has with the place must be enduring or lasting as opposed to temporary. 32. Finally, if the person has a fixed or permanent place, that place must be related to the taxable activity or other activity in New Zealand. This means that there must be a connection between the activity and the place. This is illustrated in Example 1 to Example 5 and Example 8 and Example 9. 33. The ordinary meaning of “relating” is a connection between things: Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12th ed, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2011). This suggests a degree of connection is required between the fixed or permanent place and the relevant activity. 34. The context of the provision does not appear to require a departure from the ordinary meaning of “relating to”. The provision is part of the definition of “resident” in the Act, which affects both the imposition of GST on supplies under s 8 and whether supplies can be zero-rated under the zero-rating provisions. In general, these provisions are intended to give effect to the destination principle, under which supplies of goods and services are taxed in the jurisdiction where the goods and services are consumed. Requiring a connection between a person’s activity in New Zealand and a fixed or permanent place in New Zealand before the person is considered resident for GST purposes (and subject to GST at the standard rate) is consistent with that purpose. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 27 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 35. In Example 6 and Example 7 the non-resident company owns property in New Zealand. In both Example 6 and Example 7, the property does not “relate to” the taxable activity carried on in Australia but is related to an activity of making accommodation available in New Zealand. “To the extent that” 36. For GST purposes, a person is deemed to be resident in New Zealand “to the extent that” the person carries on, in New Zealand, any taxable activity or any other activity while having any fixed or permanent place in New Zealand relating to that taxable activity or other activity. 37. Similarly, the definition of “non-resident” in s 2 states that non-resident “means a person to the extent that the person is not resident in New Zealand” \[emphasis added\]. 38. The use of the phrase “to the extent that” means that a single legal person can, for the purposes of the Act, be both resident and non-resident. In Example 6 – Holiday house in New Zealand and Example 7 – Holiday house used as a place of residence and home office, the non-resident company is treated as resident for GST purposes to the extent of the activity of providing accommodation in New Zealand. Unincorporated bodies – para (b) of the definition of resident 39. Paragraph (b) of the definition of resident provides that an unincorporated body will be deemed to be resident in New Zealand if the body has its centre of administrative management in New Zealand. 40. This is necessary to provide clarity for unincorporated bodies who can register under the Act. This is because unincorporated bodies are not separate legal entities for income tax purposes, so cannot establish their residency under any specific income tax rules. 41. The “centre of administrative management” test is a factual enquiry that focuses on where the day-to-day administrative management of the unincorporated body is carried out, rather than the controlling or superior management function. This means that the centre of administrative management is where the day-to-day business is carried on as opposed to where the unincorporated body is ultimately controlled from. Day-count tests – para (c) of the definition of resident 42. The residency status of a natural person for income tax purposes is based on two rules: the permanent place of abode test and the day-count rules. There are two “day-count” rules: ••Section YD 1(3) of the ITA 2007 provides that a natural person is a New Zealand resident if they are personally present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in total in a 12-month period. For income tax purposes, s YD 1(4) of the ITA 2007 treats the person as a resident from the first of those 183 days. ••Under s YD 1(5) of the ITA 2007, a person who is a resident under the day-count test provided in s YD 1(3) stops being a resident if they are personally absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in total in a 12-month period. Again, for income tax purposes, s YD 1(6) of the ITA 2007 treats the person as not resident from the first of those 325 days. 2 43. For GST purposes, para (c) modifies the day-count tests used when determining the residence and non-residence of a natural person so that the rules in s YD 1(4) and (6) of the ITA 2007 are ignored and the start and end dates are prospective, commencing on the day after the relevant day that triggers the residence or non-residence: (c) the effect of the rules in section YD 1(4) and (6) of that Act are ignored in determining the residence or non- residence of a natural person, and residence is treated as— (i) starting on the day immediately following the relevant day that triggers residence under section YD 1(3) of that Act; or (ii) ending on the day immediately following the relevant day that triggers nonresidence under section YD 1(5) of that Act \[Emphasis added\] 44. The reason for this difference is to ensure that when supplies are made, a supplier can apply the correct GST treatment based on the residency of the recipient at the time the supply is made. 45. Before para (c) was amended to read as quoted in \[43\], the rules led to uncertainty for suppliers. For example, a supply to a 2 For further information on the income tax residency tests, see “IS 16/03: Tax residence”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 10 (October 2016): 2. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 28 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS non-resident who was outside New Zealand at the time of the supply, might be zero-rated. However, that might have later been found to be incorrect if the recipient’s New Zealand residence was backdated under s YD 1(4) or s YD 1(6). This is illustrated in Example 11 – Residence – Day-count tests. 46. The amendment ensures the supplier can establish the correct GST treatment at the time of supply. Branches and divisions Overview 47. Where a registered person carries on a taxable activity in branches or divisions, s 56 allows the person to apply to the Commissioner to register the branch or division as a separate registered person. 48. A requirement for registering the branch or division as a separate person is that each branch or division maintains an independent system of accounting and can be separately identified, either by reference to the nature of the activities carried on or the location of the branch or division (s 56(2)). 49. A non-resident person, who has a branch or division making supplies in New Zealand, may apply to have that branch or division registered under s 51. The branch or division is then treated as a separate person for GST purposes (s 54B(5)). 50. If the branch or division is registered in New Zealand (under s 51) and has a fixed or permanent place relating to the activity carried on, the branch or division may be resident for GST purposes under para (a) of the definition of resident. 51. Because the registered branch or division is treated as a separate person for GST purposes, the non-resident person can maintain their non-resident status. This means the non-resident may be able to register under s 54B (provided they meet all the requirements of s 54B(1)). This is illustrated in Example 10 – Non-resident company with a New Zealand–based branch. For further details about the registration of nonresidents, see “IS 21/03: GST – Registration of non-residents under section 54B” (Inland Revenue, 2021). 52. It is important to note that there are separate obligations on non-resident or “overseas companies” under the Companies Act 1993. A non-resident company, as an “overseas company” who is “carrying on business in New Zealand”, is required to be registered under the Companies Act 1993 (s 334). Registration, by itself, of the non-resident company under the Companies Act does not give rise to residence under the GST Act. Further rules for branches or divisions– s 56B 53. Section 56B contains further rules for branches or divisions. This provision applies to certain supplies of imported goods and services which are subject to a reverse charge. These are supplies treated by s 8(4B) as made in New Zealand or, where a liability for output tax has arisen under s 20(3JC). The reverse charge requires the recipient to account for output tax on the supply. 54. Section 56B will only apply to a person if they carry on activities both inside and outside New Zealand, through branches or divisions. For this purpose, a branch or division includes a head office of a company. 55. Section 56B provides that for this purpose each branch and division: ••is treated as a separate person, carrying on a separate activity; ••inside New Zealand is treated as a resident; and ••outside New Zealand is treated as a non-resident. 56. Importantly, s 56B(4) provides that these rules apply whether or not the branch or division is registered for GST under s 56. 57. The reason for the introduction of s 56B was to clarify that a supply which is subject to the reverse charge provisions, between branches or divisions (including a Head Office) of an entity that operates both in New Zealand and outside of New Zealand, is treated as a supply, even though the parties may be a single legal entity. 58. For further information about the rules related to: ••imported services, see “GST on cross-border supplies of remote services”, Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 28, No 6 (July 2016): 12; ••imported goods, see “GST on low-value imported goods”, Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 31, No 8 (September 2019): 2; and ••later amendments, see “GST on low-value imported goods remedials”, Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 32, No 4 (May 2020): 81. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 29 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Examples 59. The following examples demonstrate how the rules will likely apply in different scenarios. Example 1 – When a person is resident for GST Overseas engineering company BWBuild Co is not resident in New Zealand under s YD 2 of the ITA 2007. The company has a contract to perform in New Zealand. The contract requires BWBuild to provide design services and oversee the construction of an irrigation plant. The company leases, for a 12-month term, office space in a local building from which it carries out the services under the contract. During the term of the lease, BWBuild is carrying on its taxable activity in New Zealand while having a lease of the office space. In this instance, the office space constitutes a fixed or permanent place relating to the activity of providing design services and overseeing the construction of an irrigation plant. The office space is at the disposal of the company for the term of the lease. A 12-month term is of sufficient duration to have an element of permanence. Therefore, BWBuild is deemed resident for GST for the activities it carries out under the contract. Example 2 – Not resident – no fixed or permanent place Following on from Example 1, two years later, BWBuild Co is asked to provide consultancy services to Design Co, a company that is providing similar design services. The contract provides that BWBuild will train Design staff on the use of software BWBuild developed. For this contract, it is agreed BWBuild will provide two staff for an initial period of six weeks and further support, as required, over the following three months. The staff will work out of Design’s premises. During this period BWBuild is carrying on a taxable activity in New Zealand in providing the services under the contract. BWBuild does not lease or own or have any other arrangements for any other premises in New Zealand at this time. While BWBuild can use Design’s premises for the purpose of carrying out the services under the contract, its staff have a limited right of access to the premises and for a short period of time. On these facts, BWBuild does not have a “fixed or permanent” place, as Design’s premises are not at BWBuild’s disposal during the term of the contract. Therefore, BWBuild is not a resident for GST purposes in relation to the activities under this contract. Example 3 – Not resident – no fixed or permanent place Anakin Co is a non-resident entity that provides satellite data to customers outside New Zealand. It obtains the satellite data from its satellites sending the data back to earth through antennas around the world. As part of its operation, Anakin obtains the right to use an antenna owned and maintained by Lucas Farms in a rural New Zealand location. Anakin wants to register under s 54B to claim back the GST component of any service charges from Lucas Farms and any other GST costs that may be charged in New Zealand in carrying on its activity. However, Anakin wonders whether the right to use the antenna might be treated as a fixed or permanent place, meaning Anakin would be treated as New Zealand resident for this activity. While the antenna is fixed or permanently located on land, Anakin’s arrangement with Lucas Farms does not give Anakin exclusive use of the antenna or enable it to make alternative maintenance arrangements. Therefore, the antenna or any associated space around it cannot be regarded as permanently at Anakin’s disposal. This arrangement to use the antenna does not mean Anakin has a fixed or permanent place in New Zealand. Therefore, under this arrangement, Anakin is not a resident for GST purposes in relation to this activity. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 30 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Example 4 – Supply of machinery to New Zealand – not a fixed or permanent place Duke Engineering Co is a US-resident company that supplies, on a three-year lease, a large piece of machinery to Butler Co, a New Zealand manufacturing company. The machine remains the property of Duke and is to be removed from New Zealand at the end of the contract. Duke wonders whether having the machine in New Zealand might mean that Duke has a fixed or permanent place in New Zealand. Duke is a manufacturer of equipment with a worldwide operation. It makes supplies of equipment by way of sale or lease. The machine is leased to Butler and housed in Butler’s premises. While the lease of the machine is for a period that has an element of permanence, the machine itself is not a fixed or permanent “place” that Duke has relating to its activity in New Zealand. The premises in which the machine is located are also not available or at the disposal of Duke and cannot be regarded as a fixed or permanent place relating to their activities in New Zealand. Example 5 – Staff seconded to New Zealand Following on from Example 4, eight months into the lease, Butler Co contacts Duke Engineering Co to say it is having production issues with the machine. Duke agrees to send one of its engineers (Harry) to New Zealand to tune up the machine and train the local staff during the contracted warranty and support period. The contract provides that the engineer will work on the premises and will use equipment supplied by Butler. Harry remains an employee of the US company during this time, but he works under day-to-day supervision of Butler. Butler reimburses Duke for Harry’s salary costs. After five months, everything is working smoothly, and Harry returns to the US. Although Duke is providing services in New Zealand during the warranty and support period, it has limited rights to Butler’s premises. Harry’s presence is only for the purpose of this contract. The premises are not at Duke’s disposal, and therefore Duke does not have a fixed or permanent place relating to the activities carried on in New Zealand. Example 6 – Holiday house in New Zealand Baker Floyd is a marketing firm based in Australia. The company leases an apartment in Queenstown so that its directors and staff can holiday there. The lease is for a five-year term with a right of renewal for a further four years. The apartment is left unoccupied when not required by the directors or staff. Baker Floyd does not carry on its taxable activity of providing marketing services in New Zealand as the activities it carries on are supplies of services made to customers in Australia. However, the making available of the apartment in Queenstown to its directors or staff is still an “activity”. Whether the activity is a taxable activity depends on whether the supplies of the accommodation to its directors and staff are made for consideration and whether the activity, if it were carried on by a natural person, is a private recreational pursuit or hobby (s 6(3)(aa)). The apartment is a place that is permanently available to Baker Floyd in New Zealand. Therefore, Baker Floyd has a place that is both fixed and permanent in New Zealand relating to the activity it carries on in New Zealand. Baker Floyd is resident “to the extent of ” that activity. However, the apartment is not a fixed or permanent place relating to the Australian marketing activity. If Baker Floyd makes taxable supplies in New Zealand by supplying accommodation in the apartment, Baker Floyd will need to consider whether to register for GST under s 51 in order to be entitled to claim back any GST input tax charged on supplies relating to the apartment in Queenstown. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 31 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Example 7 – Holiday house used as a place of residence and home office Following on from Example 6, due to restrictions on travel during the COVID-19 pandemic, Baker Floyd is unable to use the Queenstown apartment for its intended purpose. However, Tom, a director of the company and a New Zealand resident, moves his family to New Zealand to be closer to his elderly parents. The Queenstown apartment is now the family home of Tom and Mary and their children. Tom continues working for the company and has an office set up in the apartment. He has regular Zoom meetings and phone calls and continues to negotiate contracts with customers in Australia. Baker Floyd is still carrying on two activities. It is still making supplies of marketing services to customers in Australia. Also, Baker Floyd is carrying on the activity of providing accommodation in the apartment in New Zealand to Tom and his family. The apartment is a fixed or permanent place that relates to only one of the activities carried on by Baker Floyd. This is the activity of providing accommodation in the apartment to Tom and his family. This is likely to be an exempt supply of accommodation in a dwelling (s 14(1)(c)). This means Baker Floyd is resident for GST purposes, “to the extent” it carries on activities in New Zealand while having a fixed or permanent place “relating to” the activity. However, as Baker Floyd is making exempt supplies in New Zealand it will not have any output tax liability. Also, it will not be able to claim back any input tax on expenses such as power or rates incurred for the property, as these will not be acquired for the purposes of making taxable supplies in New Zealand. Example 8 – Use of a logistics facility TransformU Co is an American wholesaler that, from time to time, imports yoga and Pilates fitness equipment into New Zealand for supply to fitness studios in New Zealand and Australia. The goods are stored at the warehouse of logistics firm Palatine Xpress Co. An employee of Palatine assists with the importation documents in New Zealand. The goods are stored until TransformU directs them to be shipped to New Zealand or Australian customers and are stored as part of the service supplied by Palatine. TransformU makes no supplies in New Zealand to unregistered customers. Therefore, although the goods are in New Zealand at the time of supply, they may be treated as supplied outside New Zealand under s 8(4). TransformU pays a storage fee based on the cubic area the goods occasionally occupy. It also pays service fees for the importation assistance and transport of the goods. TransformU is not treated as a New Zealand resident for GST purposes as it does not have a fixed or permanent place in New Zealand. TransformU could consider registering under s 54B to claim back any input tax incurred. Registration under s 54B would enable TransformU to claim back the GST incurred on the logistics service provider’s fees but will not enable the claiming back of the GST charged under s 12(1) on importation of the goods into New Zealand. This is because, when a non-resident registered under s 54B imports goods that are to be delivered to another person in New Zealand, s 20(3LC) treats the recipient of the goods as having paid the GST and the nonresident as not having paid the tax. See IS 21/03: GST – Registration of nonresidents under section 54B, for more information. Example 9 – Lease of part of a logistics warehouse TransformU has seen increasing demand for its equipment and wants to extend the range of goods it will supply. Several potential customers have asked whether they can view a sample of the goods before placing an order. TransformU enters into a contract with Palatine to have an area adjacent to the general warehouse set aside for their exclusive use. This includes a display area for potential customers to view the products. The ability to view the products at this location is advertised on their website. The contract term is for 12 months, with a right of renewal for a further 6 months. The leased space is at the disposal of TransformU and is related to the activity of promoting and supplying the goods in New Zealand. TransformU therefore is carrying on an activity in New Zealand while having a fixed or permanent place in New Zealand relating to the activity. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 32 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Example 10 – Non-resident company with a New Zealand–based branch Cavolo Management Co is an overseas-registered company with a branch based in New Zealand. Cavolo applies under s 56 to have its branch CavoloNZ registered for GST. The head office of Cavolo plans to send two of its senior employees to a management conference in Auckland and has paid their conference fees. It asks whether it could register separately from CavoloNZ under s 54B to claim back the GST incurred on its employees’ expenses in attending the conference. The head office of Cavolo may register separately from its New Zealand branch, under s 54B, to claim back the GST incurred provided the costs relate to the overseas-based business activities and do not relate to the taxable activity of the New Zealand branch. Example 11 – Residence – Day-count tests Anna is an Australian chef living in Melbourne. She arrives in New Zealand on 18 May 2021 and takes a temporary job in a Nelson restaurant. On 13 June 2021 she returns to Melbourne. Anna really enjoyed her time in New Zealand and is considering returning and opening her own food truck business in New Zealand. She contacts John, a New Zealand lawyer for advice on what the legal requirements would be. John invoices her for the advice on 28 July 2021. He zero-rates the supply because the advice is to a non-resident, who is outside New Zealand at the time he gives the advice. Anna returns to New Zealand on 11 August 2021 and takes up another temporary chef ’s position while she looks for a suitable food truck opportunity. In October Anna finds a food truck for sale and agrees to purchase it. Settlement will take place on 1 February 2022. Based on the day-count tests, Anna will become a New Zealand resident for GST purposes on 14 January 2022. This is because she will then have been personally present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in a 12-month period. She is present for 27 days in May and June, and a further 156 days from 11 August to 13 January 2022. Under para (c) of the definition of “resident”, she is treated as resident for GST purposes starting on the day immediately after the day that triggers residence under s YD 1(3) of the ITA 2007. Anna is therefore resident for GST purposes from 14 January 2022 (the day after 13 January 2022). Therefore, John correctly zero-rated the supply of advice to Anna in the invoice dated 28 July 2021. For income tax purposes Anna would be treated as a resident from the first day of the 183-day period under s YD 1(4) ITA 2007, so from 18 May 2021 (presuming she did not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand prior to that date).

LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS Determination EE003 – Payments provided to employees that work from home; Employee use of telecommunications tools and usage plans in their employment Application Determination EE003 (the Determination) applies to relevant payments made by employers for the period from 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2023. Background 1. Amounts paid by an employer to an employee to reimburse that employee for costs that they incur in connection with their employment are taxable in the hands of the employee unless the payment is exempted by the provisions of s CW 17 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 2. Under s CW 17 a reimbursing payment is treated as exempt income to the employee to the extent that the expenditure in question would be ordinarily deductible to the employee if the employment limitation did not apply. The employment limitation is the rule that prevents an employee from claiming most deductions for expenditure incurred in deriving employment income. 3. As the expenditure in question must also be ordinarily deductible, there needs to be a connection between the expenditure and the performance of the employee’s job. It also means that the expenditure cannot be private expenditure or expenditure of a capital nature (however, an amount can be paid for a depreciation loss). 4. Employers may find it administratively difficult to establish the extent to which expenditure is incurred by employees in connection with their employment income or is of a private or capital nature. They may also find it difficult to establish or realistically estimate the expenditure each of their employees has incurred (or is likely to incur). 5. To remove some of this difficulty and reduce the compliance costs for employers, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) has, over the past two years, published several determinations that deal with the additional expenditure that employees may face when they work from home and/or use their personal telecommunications tools and usage plans in their employment. DET EE001 Determination EE001: Employee use of telecommunications tools and usage plans in their employment 6. In December 2019 the Commissioner issued Determination EE001. This determination provided guidance on arrangements where employees agree to use their own telecommunication devices and/or usage plans for their employment. EE001 sets out proportions of expenditure or loss that the Commissioner accepted as being exempt income of an employee. The proportions differed depending on whether a device or usage plan is used by the employee principally for employment. 7. EE001 also provided a de minimis rule which treated a payment made to an employee of up to $5 per week as exempt income of the employee. All that was required for this de minimis rule to apply was for there to be an arrangement where the employee provided their own telecommunications tools and usage plan, or just their usage plan, and the employee agreed to use these for their employment. 8. Determination EE001 could be used in relation to payments made to employees for mobile phone and internet costs incurred by employees as an ordinary incident of their day-to-day employment. The payment could be made irrespective of where the employee worked from; the determination was not limited to those employees that worked from home. 9. It should be noted that Determination EE001 was “open ended”; it did not have a cessation date. Amalgamating all previous determinations into this determination means that all the provisions previously contained in those determinations now have a consistent end date (of 31 March 2023). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 35 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS 10. Although Determination EE001 is now being amalgamated into this determination, its contents remain unchanged, other than for the inclusion of an end date. In particular, employers that wish to reimburse those employees that are required to use their personal telecommunications tools and/or usage plans in their employment may do so, even where the employee is not required to work from home. See \[28\] and \[29\] for further discussion on this topic. Determination EE002: Payments to employees for working from home costs during the COVID-19 pandemic 11. During the initial COVID-19 pandemic national lockdown, some employers made payments to employees to reimburse the additional costs incurred by those employees in having to work from home. Inland Revenue was asked to clarify the tax treatment of such payments. 12. Subsequently Determination EE002 was published in April 2020. Determination EE002 was issued as a temporary response to the COVID-19 pandemic and applied to reimbursement payments of up to $15 per week, made by employers during the six-month period from 17 March to 17 September 2020, so long as the employee who received the payment was working from home as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Where this occurred, the reimbursement payments were exempt income. 13. The $15 amount that was able to be treated as exempt income excluded payments made to reimburse employees for the use of their personal telecommunications tools and usage plans. Effectively this meant that, where appropriate, employees that incurred expenditure for both working from home and the use of their personal telecommunications tools and/or usage plans, they were able to be reimbursed a total of $20 per week and have that amount treated as exempt income. 14. To ensure that these payments continued to be treated as exempt income after the lockdown period ended, the Commissioner issued Determination EE002A: Variation to Determination EE002 - Payments to employees for working from home costs during the COVID-19 pandemic. This determination mirrored Determination EE002 but extended the timeframe of the determination out to 17 March 2021. It also removed the requirement that the expenditure or loss must be incurred by the employee because the employee was required to work from home because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 15. In February 2021 this timeframe was further extended to 30 September 2021 by the issue of Determination EE002B: Variation to Determination EE002A - Payments to employees for working from home cost. As with the previous determination extension, determination EE002B applied to any payment made to an employee that worked from home, to the extent it was to reimburse that employee for costs incurred in working from home. This meant that, where appropriate, employees that incurred expenditure on both working from home and the use of their personal telecommunications tools and/or usage plans continued to be able to be reimbursed a total of $20 per week. As it is now necessary to extend determination EE002B beyond that determinations’ expiry date of 30 September 2021, the Commissioner has decided to take this opportunity to make it easier for employers and employees to locate the information that they require by amalgamating all previous determinations into one publication. Determination This Determination is made under s 91AAT of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and s CW 17(2C) and (2D) of the Income Tax Act 2007. It may be cited as; Determination EE003: Payments provided to employees that work from home; Employee use of telecommunications tools and usage plans in their employment and it applies to the following payments made by employers for the period from 1 October 2021 to 30 March 2023. This determination’s requirements and exclusions 16. For this Determination to apply: ••An employer must make a payment to an employee. ••The payment must be for expenditure or a loss incurred (or likely to be incurred) by the employee. ••The expenditure or loss must be incurred by the employee in deriving their employment income and not be private or capital in nature (the capital limitation does not apply to an amount of depreciation loss). ••The payment must be made because the employee is doing their job and the employee must be deriving employment income from performing their job. ••The expenditure or loss must be necessary in the performance of the employee’s job. ••Where an employee is partly working from home and partly outside of their home, the home-based work must be more than minor. For example, the Determination can apply to an employee who works at the employer’s premises on alternate days. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 36 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS 17. This Determination does not apply to: ••Any payment that is already the subject of a payment as expenditure on account of an employee 1 . ••Any payments made for a period after an employee ceases to work from home (other than telecommunications payments made in accordance with \[28\] of this determination). ••An amount paid under a salary sacrifice arrangement. This determination is not binding on employers or employees 18. This Determination is not binding on employers or employees. An employer or employee may treat a different amount paid to the employee as exempt if they have evidence to demonstrate that in their circumstances some other amount is appropriately treated as exempt income. Weekly thresholds of this determination 19. Under this determination, where an employer pays an employee who is working from home an allowance, or pays an allowance in respect of the employees use of their personal telecommunications equipment and/or usage plans (an “affected employee”), the most appropriate of the following options can be chosen and that amount treated as exempt income of the affected employee: Where the affected employee works from home but does not use their own telecommunications tools and/or their own usage plans. 20. Up to $15 per week of the amount paid by the employer can be treated as exempt income of the affected employee. The same treatment can be applied to an equivalent amount paid for a different time period, $30 per fortnight for instance. 21. The Commissioner considers this to be a de minimis amount that recognises: ••any potential increase in household costs that an affected employee may incur when working from home, ••any amount of depreciation loss on existing depreciable assets (but see \[33\] – \[44\] in relation to newly acquired assets), but ••excludes any reference to telecommunications tools and/or usage plans. Where the affected employee both works from home and uses their own telecommunications tools and/or their own usage plans for their employment. In this circumstance an employer and an affected employee may choose one of the following options: The de minimis option: 22. Up to $20 per week of the amount paid can be treated as exempt income of the affected employee. The same treatment can be applied to an equivalent amount paid for a different time period, $40 per fortnight for instance 23. The Commissioner considers this to be a de minimis amount that recognises: ••any potential increase in household costs that an affected employee may incur when working from home, and ••telecommunications costs (previously set out in Determination EE 001), and ••any amount of depreciation loss on existing depreciable telecommunications assets (but see \[33\] – \[44\] in relation to newly acquired assets). Principally business use option: 24. Per \[20\], this option allows up to $15 per week of the amount paid to be treated as exempt income of the affected employee. The same treatment can be applied to an equivalent amount paid for a different time period, $30 per fortnight for instance. This amount excludes any amount paid in relation to the use of the affected employee’s telecommunications usage plans. 25. In addition to this $15, where the affected employee uses their personal telecommunications tools and/or their usage plans principally for business purposes, employers can treat any reimbursement of up to 75% of the amount of the affected employee’s total usage plan bill as exempt income of that employee. If the cost of the employee’s usage plan is not a regular amount, then a reasonable estimate of the likely expenditure is acceptable. See \[30\] – \[32\] for further discussion regarding reasonable estimates. 1 Per s CW 17(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 37 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS An amount of depreciation loss on existing telecommunications assets that are owned by the employee may also be paid using the Commissioner’s depreciation rates for the item (but see \[33\] – \[44\] in relation to newly acquired assets). Principally private use option: 26. This option allows up to $15 per week of the amount to be treated as exempt income of the affected employee on the same basis as described in \[24\]. 27. In addition to this $15, where the affected employee uses their personal telecommunications tools and/or their usage plans principally for private purposes, employers can treat any reimbursement of up to 25% of the amount of the affected employee’s total usage plan bill as exempt income of that employee. If the cost of the employee’s usage plan is not a regular amount, then a reasonable estimate of the likely expenditure is acceptable. See \[30\] – \[32\] for further discussion regarding reasonable estimates. An amount of depreciation loss on existing telecommunications assets that are owned by the employee may also be paid using the Commissioner’s depreciation rates for the item (but see \[33\] – \[44\] in relation to newly acquired assets). Where an affected employee does not work from home, but uses their own telecommunications tools and/or usage plans in the course of their employment 28. In this circumstance, an employer may choose one of the following options: ••de minimis option: This option allows up to $5 per week of the amount paid to be treated as exempt income of the affected employee. The same treatment can be applied to an equivalent amount paid for a different time-period, $10 per fortnight for instance. The Commissioner considers that this de minimis amount recognises all costs that an affected employee may incur, including any amount of depreciation loss on existing depreciable telecommunications assets that the employee may use (but see \[33\] – \[44\] in relation to newly acquired assets). ••The principally business use option: Per \[25\], employers can treat any reimbursement of up to 75% of the amount of the affected employee’s total usage plan bill as exempt income of the employee. If the cost of the employee’s usage plan is not a regular amount, then a reasonable estimate of the likely expenditure is acceptable. See \[30\] – \[32\] for further discussion regarding reasonable estimates. An amount of depreciation loss on existing telecommunications assets that are owned by the employee may also be paid using the Commissioner’s depreciation rates for the item (but see \[33\] – \[44\] in relation to newly acquired assets). ••The principally private use option: Per \[27\], employers can treat any reimbursement of up to 25% of the amount of the affected employee’s total usage plan bill as exempt income of that employee. If the cost of the employee’s usage plan is not a regular amount, then a reasonable estimate of the likely expenditure is acceptable. See \[30\] – \[32\] for further discussion regarding reasonable estimates. An amount of depreciation loss on existing telecommunications assets that are owned by the employee may also be paid using the Commissioner’s depreciation rates for the item (but see \[33\] – \[44\] in relation to newly acquired assets). 29. This Determination does not apply where there is no employment income under the arrangement, that is, where the employer provides the telecommunications tool and pays for the usage. In such circumstances there may be FBT implications. It is noted that s CX 21 provides an exemption for business tools. Reasonable estimate to be made 30. As is the case when making any apportionment to account for the business use of an asset, reasonable judgement must be exercised and there must be some reasonable evidential basis to justify the apportionment used. 31. However, it may be difficult to determine the level of use precisely and this Determination is intended to allow for less than precise estimation. The employer may for instance rely on some evidence of time spent to show that the asset is used principally for business purposes. However, the employer may instead choose to obtain a signed declaration from an employee that telecommunications tools will be used principally for employment purposes. 32. It is expected that the apportionment used would be reviewed periodically to check that the level of use remains the same. A review once every two years would be adequate. If an employer has obtained a signed declaration from an employee that telecommunications tools will be principally used for employment purposes, then a review is only required if there has been a material change to the employee’s circumstances. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 38 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS Payments for the cost of newly acquired furniture and equipment and telecommunications equipment 33. The Commissioner recognises that the employee may need to acquire personal home office furniture or equipment or telecommunications equipment to enable them to effectively work from their home. Where assets are acquired for this purpose, an employee would incur a depreciation loss which the employee would be able to claim as a deduction, but for the employment limitation 2 . 34. Because of the low-value asset rule, for many assets the depreciation loss is likely to be equal to the cost of the asset. 3 35. Where an employer wishes to reimburse the employee for the cost that they incurred in acquiring their home office furniture or equipment, this Determination provides that they can use one of the following options. ••the safe harbour option for furniture and equipment and a separate safe harbour option for telecommunications equipment, or ••the reimbursement option. The safe harbour option 36. Under this option an employer can treat payments of up to $400 made to reimburse the employee for the costs incurred in acquiring new furniture and equipment as exempt income. Additionally, they may also treat payments of up to $400 made to reimburse the employee for the costs incurred in acquiring new telecommunications equipment as exempt income. Each of these $400 limits apply to the costs of ALL the furniture and equipment, and all telecommunications equipment that the employee acquires. It is not an item by item limit. 37. The safe harbour option saves an employer from having to identify the costs that their employees have or are likely to incur, and from having to make judgements about the extent to which the furniture or equipment is used by employees for their employment. 38. If an employer adopts this safe harbour option, they cannot treat any future allowance or reimbursement payment for any subsequent furniture or equipment, or telecommunications equipment purchases made by the employee as exempt income. It is not an amount that refreshes on a regular basis; annually for instance. The reimbursement option 39. Under this reimbursement option, an amount paid by an employer will be exempt income of an employee if: ••The amount is for furniture or equipment or telecommunications equipment purchased by the employee to enable them to work from home, and ••The amount paid is no more than the deduction that the employee would have been entitled to for depreciation loss on the furniture or equipment (or the cost of the asset, in the case of low-value assets) for the income year in which the payment is made, but for the employment limitation. 40. The deduction that the employee would have been entitled to for an asset and, therefore, the amount that can be paid as exempt income, is dependent on the extent to which the employee uses the asset for their employment. This means that the amount that can be paid as exempt income will be equal to a proportion of the yearly depreciation loss on the asset (or a proportion of the cost of the asset in the case of a low-value asset). 41. Applying s CW 17, where there is evidence that an asset will be used exclusively for employment purposes, 100% of the yearly depreciation loss on the asset (or the total cost of the asset, in the case of a low-value asset) can be paid as exempt income of the employee. Further, under this Determination: ••Where an employee who uses an asset principally (but not exclusively) for their employment, an amount of no more than 75% 4 of the yearly depreciation loss on the asset (or the cost of the asset, in the case of a low-value asset) can be paid as exempt income of the employee. 2 Note that to the extent that an employee incurs a depreciation loss on existing furniture or equipment, this loss is included in the exempt income thresholds. 3 Note that the threshold for low-value assets that were purchased before 17 March 2020 was $500. For assets purchased on or after 17 March 2020 and before 17 March 2021 the threshold was $5,000 and from 17 March 2021 the threshold was decreased to $1,000. 4 In this context, the use of the words “no more than” indicates that it is up to the employer to determine the extent to which they are prepared to reimburse the employee for any amount of depreciation loss. But for those wishing to use this option, the exempt portion of any reimbursement can be no more than 75% of the applicable depreciation loss (and 25% where the item is used principally for private use). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 39 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS ••Where an employee uses an asset principally for private use, an amount of no more than 25% of the yearly depreciation loss on the asset (or the cost of the asset, in the case of a low-value asset) can be paid as exempt income of the employee. 42. The reimbursement option will require an employer to identify the cost of the asset for which the reimbursement is paid as well as determining whether the asset is being used exclusively or principally for employment purposes or whether the asset is being used principally for private purposes (so that they can calculate the appropriate proportion). For assets that are not low-value assets (which are likely to be uncommon), the employer will also need to apply the relevant depreciation rate to calculate the depreciation loss that would have been available to the employee. 43. It is acknowledged that the reimbursement option could be onerous in some cases, for instance, where an employer has many employees. That is why the safe harbour option has also been provided. 44. A written statement from an employee to their employer that the employee intends to use an asset for their employment, and whether principally or not, will be sufficient to establish such use. An email or expense claim application is sufficient to show the employee’s intended use of the furniture or equipment. This determination was signed by me on 25 August 2021. Rob Falk National Advisor, Technical Standards, Legal Services Inland Revenue FDR 2021/03: A type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund for which a person may not use the fair dividend rate method (The Daintree Core Income Trust – New Zealand Dollar class of units) Any investment by a New Zealand resident investor in the NZD class units of the Daintree Core Income Trust, to which none of the exemptions in section EX 29 to 43 of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply, is a type of attributing interest for which the investor may not use the fair dividend rate method to calculate foreign investment fund income from the interest. Reference This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Technical Specialist - Network, under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Discussion (which does not form part of the determination) Investments in the NZD class units of the Daintree Core Income Trust, an Australian Registered Managed Investment Scheme, are an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (“FIF”) for New Zealand resident investors when none of the exemptions in section EX 29 to EX 43 of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply. The Fund is structured as an Australian Unit Trust and is a registered multi-class Managed Investment Scheme. Under section EX 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007 an exemption may arise for an Australian Unit Trust and a New Zealand resident investor so that a person’s rights in the unit trust in an income year are not an attributing interest. The determination will only apply when an attributing interest arises. New Zealand resident investors are required to apply the FIF rules to determine their tax liability in respect of their investment in shares in the Fund each year. The Fund invests in a portfolio of global fixed interest securities and other financial arrangements. The Fund has on issue three types of unit class that provide holders of each class with an interest in the pool of investments held by the Fund. The NZD Unit Class of the Fund is a unit class denominated in New Zealand dollars. Foreign currency hedging arrangements are in place in relation to the NZD Unit Class of the Fund which effectively provide investors in this class with a New Zealand dollar denominated return on the financial arrangements held by the Fund. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 40 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS The policy intention is that the FDR method of calculating FIF income should not be applied to investments that provide a New Zealand resident investor with a return similar to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment. It is appropriate for the Commissioner to take into account the whole of the arrangement in ascertaining whether an investment in a FIF provides the New Zealand-resident investor with a return akin to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment. On this basis, where a New Zealand resident invests in the NZD Unit Class of the Fund, and holds an attributing interest in the FIF, I consider that it is appropriate for the investor holding that investment to be excluded from using the FDR method. Scope of determination This determination is issued on the basis of information provided to the Commissioner before the date of this determination and applies to an attributing interest in a FIF held by New Zealand resident investors in a non-resident issuer where: 1. The non-resident issuer: ••Is an Australian Registered Managed Investment Scheme; ••Is known at the date of this determination as the Daintree Core Income Trust; and ••Is operated with separate classes of unit. 2. The attributing interest consists of the New Zealand dollar denominated units issued in the Daintree Core Income Fund, a class of units that provides an interest in the underlying assets of the fund that predominantly (i.e. 80% or more by value at a time in the income year) consist of financial arrangements such as international fixed interest securities; and 3. The investment interest attributable to the New Zealand dollar denominated class of shares are subject to currency hedging arrangements undertaken by the non-resident issuer for the purpose of eliminating exchange rate risk for New Zealand investors on a highly effective basis Interpretation In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires- “Fair dividend rate method” means the fair dividend rate method under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. "Financial arrangement" means financial arrangement under section EW 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007. “Foreign investment fund” means foreign investment fund under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. and "Non-resident" means a person that is not resident in New Zealand for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 2007. Determination An attributing interest in a FIF to which this determination applies is a type of attributing interest for which a person may not use the FDR method to calculate FIF income from the interest. Application Date This determination applies for the 2022 income year and subsequent income years. However, under section 91AAO(3B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, this determination does not apply for a person and an income year beginning before the date of the determination unless the person chooses that the determination applies for the income year. Dated on this 10th day of September 2021 Greg Adamson Technical Specialist Network Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 41 QUESTION WE'VE BEEN ASKED This section of the TIB sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions people have asked. They are published here as they may be of general interest to readers. QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED QB 21/09: How to determine the cost price of bloodstock Question How is the cost price of bloodstock determined? Answer At the end of each year bloodstock must be valued at its cost price less any reduction applying for that year. Given this, when valuing bloodstock for tax purposes, the overarching principle is that, wherever possible, actual cost should be used as the basis of valuation. Where the actual cost is not known with certainty, such as with home-bred progeny, a consistent means of establishing the cost price of that progeny is still required. For home-bred progeny, the cost price should reflect the cost to the breeder of producing the foal. Key terms Bloodstock means a horse that is a member of the standardbred or thoroughbred breed of horses; and includes a share or interest in such a horse. 5 Cost price means the cost associated with purchasing or producing bloodstock. All components of cost price are exclusive of G ST. 6 Reduction means the amount the cost price of the bloodstock is reduced by at the end of the income year, applicable to bloodstock aged 2 years or older that have been acquired for breeding. 7 This is also referred to as the “specified write down”. Explanation 1. This Question We’ve Been Asked outlines how to determine the cost price of bloodstock; including when progeny is home bred, when the stallion is owned by the taxpayer, and when a mare is purchased in-foal. It replaces the obsolete Public Information Bulletin (PIB) items Bloodstock Cost Determination in PIB 166 and PIB 175. What this QWBA covers 2. This QWBA sets out how to determine the cost price of bloodstock in the following situations: ••bloodstock that has been purchased – excluding in-foal mares ••bloodstock that is home bred – including when the stallion used is owned by the breeder, or when the stallion or mare has been leased ••bloodstock that has been purchased as an in-foal mare. 3. It also clarifies how unborn foals are to be treated at balance date. 5 s YA 1 – definitions “bloodstock”, Income Tax Act 2007. 6 s YA 1 – definitions “cost price”, Income Tax Act 2007. 7 s EC 41, EC 42, EZ 5, or EZ 6, Income Tax Act 2007. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 42 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED Background 4. Bloodstock, whether purchased or homebred, is initially required to be valued at its cost price. 8 In either case this will be the actual cost incurred in acquiring the animal. Where bloodstock is home-bred, the outlay or overheads incurred by the breeder in producing the progeny should be used to establish its cost price. 9 5. It is worth noting that although some items of expenditure need to be attributed to the foal to ascertain its cost price, the expenditure remains deductible to the taxpayer where it meets the ordinary tests for deductibility. Unborn foals at balance date 6. Unborn foals are not required to be valued at balance date. 10 This is so even where a mare is purchased by a breeder in-foal. See \[13\]-\[23\] for further discussion regarding the treatment of in-foal mares. Purchased bloodstock – excluding in-foal mares 7. Bloodstock that is purchased should be valued at its acquisition cost plus the cost of getting the horse to its new location. This value may include items such as the acquisition cost, vet and valuation fees, transportation, and travel insurance. Example Example 1 – Purchased bloodstock Henry is a breeder who purchases a 2 year old filly for $20,000. He pays $300 for transport and another $1,250 for vet and valuation fees. He also pays an additional $150 for travel insurance. The total cost price of the filly is $21,700. Home bred Progeny 8. Foals are valued at their cost price on the breeders’ first balance date after they are born. 11 Any expenditure incurred in raising a foal after this first balance date is not required to be added to the cost price of the foal. 9. As servicing costs are incurred in the production of assessable income, they are fully deductible in the year in which the expenditure is incurred (as noted at \[5\]. This applies even if the foal dies either prior, or subsequent to its birth. 10. The cost price of all home bred progeny is made up of the following components: 12 ••the stallion service fee paid, and ••any reduction attributable to the mare in the year of foaling, and ••any foaling, weaning (and vet fees incurred in rearing the foal) between the birth of the foal and the first balance date. Where a breeder employs external parties to undertake the foaling and weaning of progeny (as well as any associated veterinary needs), the cost of these activities is required to be attributed to the cost of the foal. Where the foaling and weaning of progeny is undertaken by the breeder personally or the breeder’s employees, the cost (or a reasonable estimation of the cost) to the breeding business of these activities should be attributed to the cost of the foal. Where external parties are not employed, it is acknowledged that in some cases, arriving at the exact cost to the breeder of these activities (or even a reasonable estimate of that cost) may be difficult. In view of this, the Commissioner will accept a de minimis amount of $500 to be used as an acceptable approximation of these foaling and weaning expenses (vet fees will invariably be charged by an external party and are therefore not included in this de minimis figure). Stallion owned by breeder 11. Where the stallion is owned by the breeder the service fee component of a foal’s cost can be calculated in one of the 8 ss EC 39(3) and EC 44, Income Tax Act 2007. 9 TRA Case S12 (1995) 17 NZTC 7,102. 10 This replaces advice previously given in Public Information Bulletin 175, July 1998 (at page 8). 11 s EC 44, Income Tax Act 2007. 12 TRA Case S12 (1995) 17 NZTC 7,102. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 43 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED following two ways (the breeder can choose which option best suits them): ••the service fee usually charged by the breeder to an arms-length party (this represents the “economic cost” of the service to the breeder, being the service fee forgone to service their own stock), or ••the direct costs of the stallion in the year of service the number of mares serviced where the direct costs are an accumulation of insurance, external service costs (such as vet fees), and the stallion’s reduction in the year of service. Leased bloodstock 12. If a mare has been leased, there will be no reduction available to the breeder leasing that bloodstock that could be attributed to the cost of any progeny. In this circumstance, the cost price of the progeny must, instead, include any lease fee paid in the year of foaling. 13. If a breeder that is leasing a stallion wishes to use the direct costs formula at \[11\], that breeder will need to include all lease payments made in the year of service as part of the direct costs of the stallion in the year of service in the calculation. This expense replaces the reduction of the stallion in the year of service in the calculation. Examples Example 2 – Homebred progeny, service fee paid for use of stallion Margaret pays a service fee of $12,500 to have one of her mares serviced. At the time the foal is born the mare’s cost price is $18,000 and the mare is 5 years old. A foaling fee of $400, a $350 weaning fee and vet fees of $400 are also incurred during the year. The cost price of the foal is as follows: $12,500 stallion service fee $4,500 reduction on mare in year of foaling 13 $750 foaling and weaning fees $400 vet fee $18,150 total cost price Example 3 – Homebred progeny, stallion owned by breeder Hamish is a breeder who owns a 6-year old stallion; the service fee he usually charges is $4,000. Hamish decides to service three of his mares with the stallion, which also serviced 12 mares from third parties. The stallion’s vet fees for the year come to $300 and his insurance is $2,700, the reduction available in that year is $0 (the stallion has already been fully reduced and has a closing value of $1, so there is no reduction in the year of service). Market value Per \[11\], if Hamish chooses the first option, the service fee component of any resulting foals would be $4,000. Direct cost Using the second option, the service fee component would be: vet fees + insurance + reduction in year of service ($300 + $2,700 + $0 = $3,000) number of mares serviced (15) The service fee component of any resulting foals would be $200. 13 s EC 42, Income Tax Act 2007 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 44 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED Example 4 – Home bred progeny, mare leased Thorough Stud Limited leases a mare. For the year of foaling the mare’s lease fee payments amount to $7,200. Thorough Stud Limited also pays a stallion service fee of $6,000. Up until the first balance date, the vet and foaling fees were incurred totalling $1,200. The cost price of the foal is as follows: $6,000 stallion service fee $7,200 mare’s lease fee $1,200 foaling and vet fees $14,400 total cost price of the foal The purchase of in-foal mares 14. The usual gestation period for a foal is a little over 11 months. It is therefore likely that a mare purchased in-foal will still be in-foal on the first balance date with the new owner. This being so, for mares purchased in-foal there needs to be two ways of determining the cost price, dependent on whether the foal is born before the first or second balance date of the new owner. 15. Irrespective of the year in which the foal is born, on the first balance date after its birth it is required to be valued in the manner described at \[10\]. Service fee component of a mare purchased in-foal 16. As previously discussed, one of the components of a foal’s cost is the stallion service fee. Where the mare has been purchased in-foal, the service fee would have been paid by the mare’s previous owner. Generally, the details of this service fee (or the usual service fee charged by the stallion owner) should be easily obtainable. This service fee will make up a part of the total purchase price of the mare but will need to be separated out at the time the cost price of the foal is determined. This is on the basis that the service fee component of the mare’s purchase price is the amount of the premium paid for the unborn foal (or at least a reasonable proxy for that premium). 17. In the unlikely event that the service fee component is not able to be ascertained, the Commissioner will accept an apportionment of the acquisition price between the mare and the foal, based on the recommendation of a recognised bloodstock valuer. 18. If the amount of the service fee is the same or more than the total acquisition price 14 of the in-foal mare, then the mare should be valued at $1, (the lowest value possible under current legislation). 15 The remainder of the acquisition price will be attributed to the foal’s cost price. This recognises the reality that, in this circumstance, the price paid was to acquire the foal and not the mare. Foal born in year 1 19. If the foal is born before the first balance date of the new owner, the service fee component of the acquisition price for the mare would be allocated to the foal. The service fee is deducted from the acquisition price of the mare before applying any reduction to the mare’s cost price for that year. 20. The foal’s cost price will be determined using the method already discussed in \[10\] and Example 2. Foal born in year 2 21. If the mare is still in-foal at the new owners’ first balance date, the cost price of the mare still needs to be established. In this scenario this would be the total acquisition cost of the mare. The reduction applicable to the mare in that year would then be applied to this total acquisition price. 22. In the second year of ownership, if no live foal results from the pregnancy, the mare will remain valued at this written down amount and the year two reduction applied to it. 23. When the foal is born in the second year, a cost price will need to be determined for both the mare and the foal at the 14 Inclusive of any costs associated in acquiring the mare, per \[7\]. 15 s EC 45, Income Tax Act 2007. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 45 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED breeder’s balance date for that year. To do this, the service fee component needs to be removed from the mare and attributed to the foal. This lowers the mare’s value (by the amount attributed to the foal). The year two reduction to the mare can then be applied to this resulting lowered value. 24. The foal’s cost price will be comprised of this service fee component, the year two reduction on the mare and any foaling, weaning and vet fees incurred (as discussed at \[10\] and Example 2). Example Example 5 - Mare purchased in-foal A 4 year old mare was purchased in-foal for $20,000 – this includes transportation and insurance. The service fee paid for the mare by the previous owner was $5,000. Scenario A - Mare foals in year 1 (before the first balance date of the new owner) Mare: Cost price: $20,000 less the service fee of $5,000 – which is attributed to the cost price of the foal = $15,000 Reduction: cost price of mare ÷ (9 − age of mare) $15,000 divided by (9-4) = $3,000 Closing value: (cost price – reduction) = $12,000 Foal: Cost price (closing value): $3,000 (reduction from mare) +$5,000 (service fee) +$1,000 (foaling and weaning fees) +$500 (vet fees) = $9,500. Scenario B - Mare foals in year 2 (after first balance date of the new owner) Year 1 Mare: Cost price: $20,000 Reduction: cost price of mare ÷ (9 − age of mare) $20,000 divided by (9-4) = $4000 Closing value (cost price – reduction) = $16,000 Year 2 Mare: Opening value in year 2 (from closing value in year 1): $16,000 less the service fee of $5,000 (which is attributed to the cost price of the foal) = $11,000 Reduction: Opening value of mare (less service fee reduction) ÷ (9 − age of mare) $11,000 ÷ (9 – 5) = $2750 Closing value: (cost price – reduction) = $8,250 Foal: Cost price (closing value): $2,750 (year 2 reduction from mare) + $5,000 (service fee) + $1,000 (foaling and weaning fees) + $500 (vet fees) = $9,250.

Question If I run a hotel, motel or boarding house and live on site, what expenditure can I claim? Answer If you have a business of providing accommodation through a hotel, motel, boarding house, or other business premises, and live on-site, any expenses you incur relating solely to the running of your business are fully deductible. However, expenses relating to your private quarters or family life are not deductible. This is because you cannot claim a deduction for expenses that are private or domestic in nature. If the expenses relate to both your private quarters and your business, you can claim a deduction to the extent that the expenses relate to the running of your business. This requires you to calculate the portion of these mixed expenses that are attributable to your business. Key terms Mixed expenses means expenses that relate to both your business and other purposes, such as private or domestic purposes. Mixed-use areas means areas of your premises used for both business and other purposes. Proprietor means a self-employed owner or operator of a motel, hotel, boarding house or other business premises used to provide accommodation to guests. Private quarters means a section of the business premises set aside or used for domestic activities by the Proprietor and the Proprietor’s family. Explanation 1. This item applies to self-employed proprietors of hotels, motels, boarding houses, or any other businesses that provide accommodation through business premises. If you provide short-term accommodation in your own home or a private dwelling through a platform such as Airbnb or Bookabach, see QB 19/05 to QB 19/09. This item supplements those items on short-term accommodation where the accommodation is provided in business premises. 2. This item explains how to apportion expenditure that is incurred for both business and private purposes. 3. This item updates and replaces “Adjustment to costs when domestic establishment attached to business premises”, Ta x Information Bulletin Vol 5, No 11 (April 1994): 9. This item applies from the 2021/22 income year. 4. This item does not apply to accommodation providers that operate as companies or through other separate legal entities. This is because the law applies to these entities differently. What expenses can I claim? 5. Expenses you incur are deductible from your income to the extent that you incur them in carrying on your business. 16 However, deductibility is subject to some limitations. 17 If one of these limitations applies to your expenses, a deduction will not be available to the extent the limitation applies. 6. One of these limitations is the private limitation. 18 The private limitation applies if you incur expenses that relate solely to your household, family unit, or personal life. You can’t claim a deduction for these private expenses because of the private limitation. 16 Section DA 1. 17 Section DA 2. 18 Section DA 2(2). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 47 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED 7. This means that if an expense relates solely to your business, you can claim all of the expense in your income tax return provided none of the other general limitations apply, such as the capital limitation. You can also claim for the depreciation of capital assets used in your business. For more information on depreciation, see \[21\]. 8. If you are self-employed and you have employed a manager or other person that lives on site, expenses incurred on their private quarters are fully deductible, as these are incurred in carrying on your business. 9. If you personally live on site, then you will likely incur expenses that relate to both your business and your private quarters. This item refers to these expenses as “mixed expenses”. Mixed expenses are deductible to the extent they relate to your business. This item outlines how to apportion your mixed expenses between business and private purposes. How do I apportion mixed expenses? 10. The first step in working out what you can claim in your income tax return is to separate mixed expenses from expenses incurred solely for business purposes (for which you can claim 100%) and expenses incurred solely for private purposes (for which you can’t claim anything). 11. Table 1 – Examples of types of expenditure lists some examples of expenses you might incur and what you can claim for them. Table 1 – Examples of types of expenditure Business expenses (fully deductible)Private expenses (not deductible)Mixed expenses (partially deductible) Advertising costs; Any commission or fee you pay to an advertising platform or transaction facilitator (this does not include any service fee the guests pay the platform – just fees you pay); Business insurance; Telephone and internet expenses if you have a separate internet connection for business use and guests; Supplies used exclusively by guests. Groceries used by your and your family; Petrol, insurance, and maintenance for a personal car; House or contents insurance if you have a separate policy for your private quarters. Power bills; Telephone and internet expenses if you don’t have a separate internet connection for guests; Interest on your mortgage; Rates; Rent you pay for the use of the premises; Repairs and maintenance that cannot be attributed to wholly business or private areas. 12. Some mixed expenses can be separated out or dissected where these expenses have distinct, severable parts, such as an itemised invoice or bill. For example, if you have multiple phone plans through the same provider, you can dissect the part of your phone bill that relates to the business line if the bill itemises these expenses. 13. Once you’ve separated mixed expenses that can’t be dissected from those that relate solely to your business or private use, the next step is to calculate what portion of those mixed expenses relates to your business. This is called apportionment. 14. The method you use to apportion expenses needs to be fair and reasonable. Where building expenses are being split between business and private use, the courts have usually apportioned these on a space and time basis. 19 This means working out the floor area of the building that is used for business purposes, private purposes and mixed-use. You may then need to apportion the mixed-use areas based on the amount of time they are used for business and private purposes. Apportioning expenses is not an exact science, but the figure you reach must be fair and reasonable, 20 and based on evidence that a particular part of the expense is deductible. 21 15. Generally, using a space and time calculation will be appropriate for calculating the business use of certain areas of your premises. The first step is to work out the floor area of your premises used exclusively by your guests or for business purposes as a proportion of the total area of your premises. If 160m 2 of your premises is used solely for business purposes, and the total size of your premises is 200m 2 , then you can claim 80% of your mixed expenses in your return. As these areas are used solely for business purposes, you don’t need to make any adjustment for time. 19 CIR v Banks \[1978\] 2 NZLR 472 (CA). 20 Ronpibon Tin NL v FC of T (1949) 8 ATD 432 (HCA). 21 Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR 1978\] 2 NZLR 485 (CA). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 48 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED 16. In addition, if you have mixed-use areas in your premises, you can claim a deduction for these spaces based on the portion of time those areas are used for business purposes. You need to work out how much time on average the mixed-use area is used for business purposes. In general, Inland Revenue will accept 50% as a baseline for the amount of time mixed-use areas are used for business purposes where there is about equal business and private use, or where the business and private uses are too intertwined to measure each separately. If the area is not often used for business purposes, then the business use is likely to be less than 50%. Examples 1 and 3 show how these calculations might look in practice. 17. If another method is easier or more accurate in your circumstances, you may use that method instead. Regardless of the method you use, the same principles of apportionment should apply: ••separate out expenses that relate solely to your business or solely to private purposes; then ••apportion mixed expenses by identifying which part of the expenses relate to your business. 18. You must keep records to support the method you use for apportionment (for example, calculations of floor area, estimates of business and private use and evidence of asset valuations). 19. Once you’ve worked out what percentage of mixed expenses you can claim, you may continue to use this figure for future income years unless your circumstances change. Example 1 – Apportioning deductible expenses when proprietor lives on one floor of hotel building Te Ahurei is a self-employed operator of a small hotel and restaurant. Te Ahurei needs to work out her business expenses for the 2022 income year. She has carefully kept her private expenses such as groceries and petrol for her family car out of the business. Without these expenses, Te Ahurei still incurred $700,000 of business expenses for the 2022 income year. By identifying those expenses that were wholly for her business, Te Ahurei works out that $600,000 is fully deductible in her return. She then needs to calculate how much of the remaining $100,000 on mixed expenses (such as power, internet and mortgage interest) she can claim. Her first step is to calculate which areas of her hotel are for business, private, or mixed purposes. The hotel has five floors. The ground floor operates as a bar, restaurant and reception. The first, second, and third floors contain the guest rooms of the hotel. The fourth floor is occupied by Te Ahurei and her family as a residence, but Te Ahurei also uses some areas in the residence to help with the running of the hotel – there is a large, purpose-built laundry equipped with industrial washing machines which are used for washing guest linen daily. Although Te Ahurei uses the laundry for family laundry as well, it is a purpose-built business area and the private use is too small to be reasonably calculated. The dining area is regularly used for meeting with staff, bookkeeping, managing bookings, and taking calls after hours. The floor areas of the top floor of Te Ahurei’s premises are shown in the diagram below: Living room 60m 2 Bedroom 2 17m 2 WC 3m 2 Bedroom 1 26m 2 Laundry 30m 2 Bathroom 7m 2 Dining room 20m 2 Kitchen 20m 2 Bedroom 3 17m 2 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 49 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED Te Ahurei must calculate what proportion of her mixed expenses she may deduct for the areas of the house used exclusively for business and what proportion she may deduct for mixed-use areas. As four of the floors in the building are used exclusively for business purposes, Te Ahurei can claim 80% of her mixed expenses by default. This figure is calculated by dividing the portion of the premises used exclusively for business purposes by the total area of premises, and then multiplying this figure by 100 to get a percentage. In this case, as the floors are equal size, the number of floors could be used rather than the floor area in square metres (m 2 ): 4 x 100 = 80% 5 As Te Ahurei’s mixed expenses totalled $100,000, she can claim 80% of this ($80,000) in her return as it relates to the 4 floors used for business purposes. She apportions the remaining $20,000 of her mixed expenses to see if she can deduct any further amount. Te Ahurei’s private quarters can then be separated out: 150m 2 Private areas – 0% deductible 20m 2 Mixed-use areas – partially deductible 30m 2 Business areas – 100% deductible First, Te Ahurei calculates the proportion of her mixed expenses that relate to the laundry that will be deductible. The laundry is 30m 2 out of the total floor area of her private premises of 200m 2 . Deductible portion of mixed expenses for laundry = 30 x $20,000 = $3,000 200 Te Ahurei then calculates what proportion of her mixed expenses she can claim for the mixed-use areas. She decides to use the well-accepted space and time method. The only mixed-use area is the dining room of 20m 2 . From a time perspective, the dining room is used about equally for business and private use given the daily staff meetings and so Te Ahurei considers that 50% business use is appropriate. The apportionment for the dining room is as follows: Deductible portion of mixed expenses for dining room = 20 x 50% x $20,000 200 Deductible portion of mixed expenses for dining room = $1,000 This means Te Ahurei can claim $4,000 (being $3,000 + $1,000) of the mixed expenditure for her private premises. Adding this figure to the $80,000 figure for the other 4 floors, the total amount Te Ahurei can claim for her mixed expenses is $84,000 (84%). This is in addition to her business expenses of $600,000. Can I apportion certain expenses differently? 20. As stated at \[14\], it will generally be appropriate to use a space and time method for apportioning expenses that relate to your whole premises. The approach in this item can also apply to individual items of expenditure where a different apportionment is appropriate. For instance, if you have evidence to support a different, more accurate, way of calculating business use for a certain expense, this can be used instead. This is illustrated in Example 2. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 50 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED Example 2 – Apportionment of power expenses Using the same facts as Example 1, Te Ahurei breaks down her power bills for the 2022 year. She discovers using electricity usage monitors that despite her private premises taking up nearly 20% of the floor area of her business premises, the restaurant and hotel areas, and industrial washing machines, are responsible for around 95% of her power use. As power bills are usually calculated based on use, Te Ahurei could apportion her power bill based on usage, rather than space and time. In the previous example, Te Ahurei determined that Inland Revenue will accept that 84% of her mixed expenses are attributable to business use and deductible. If Te Ahurei has evidence showing the breakdown of her power bills, Inland Revenue will accept a deduction for 95% of her power expenses for the 2022 year. Te Ahurei must record details from the electricity usage monitors, and/or retain other records of the breakdown of power usage. What about depreciation? 21. You can also claim deductions for the depreciation of chattels in your home that are used for your business. You will need to make an adjustment for business use of private assets. See the Inland Revenue website using search term: depreciation for more information on depreciation methods and rates. The Inland Revenue guide IR260 Depreciation – a guide for business contains a section on adjustments for business use and examples of how to calculate the apportionment between business and private use for depreciation purposes. Example 3 – Apportioning expenses for motel with multiple buildings Baticul Lodge is a beach-front motel. The self-employed owners and operators of the motel, Luke and Asch, incurred $500,000 of business expenses for the 2022 income year. These expenses are 100% deductible. Luke and Asch need to work out how much they can claim for their mixed expenses of $75,000. Their purely private expenses are not included as they can’t be deducted. The two buildings on the motel premises have a total area of 1,400m 2 . One building is the main motel building, which contains 10 units for use by guests. The second building opens to a reception area and small shop for groceries and outdoor accessories. Luke and Asch live behind this reception area in a two-bedroom unit, with a home office in the front. The reception building is also attached to a large garage which is used to house the family vehicle and to store kayaks, boogie boards, life jackets and fishing equipment for guests. The following plan shows the areas used for business, private and mixed use: Rest of residence 170m 2 Reception and shop 100m 2 Home office 30m 2 Motel rooms 1000m 2Beach Road Garage 100m 2 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 51 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED Luke and Asch need to work out how much they can claim for their mixed expenses in relation to these mixed-use areas. 170m 2 Private areas – 0% deductible 130m 2 Mixed-use areas – partially deductible 1100m 2 Business areas – 100% deductible Of the 1,400m 2 area, 1,100m 2 (78.6%) is exclusively for business purposes. Therefore, Luke and Asch can deduct $58,950 of their $75,000 mixed expenses in relation to the business areas. Business portion of mixed expenses = 1,100 x $75,000 = $58,950 1,400 The home office is used as the main hub for the administrative work for the motel. This area is used exclusively for business purposes by either Luke, Asch or their employees during regular office hours, and is also frequently used by Luke and Asch at other times for general administration and management of the motel. The computer in this home office is also Luke’s personal computer, and the office is sometimes used in the evenings or mornings in a personal capacity. They work out that the home office is used for business purposes approximately 80% of the time. This means that Luke and Asch can deduct 80% of their mixed expenses in relation to the home office area. The home office can be calculated on a space and time basis using the floor area of the home office, which is 30m 2 , and 80% for the time it is used for business purposes: Business portion of home office expenses = 30 x 80% = 1.7% 1,400 Luke and Asch can claim 1.7% of their total mixed expenses in relation to the home office, which is $75,000 x 1.7% = $1,275. The other mixed-use area, the garage, is used roughly equally for both business and private purposes, so Luke and Asch will use the default figure of 50% for the time factor for these expenses. The garage is 100m 2 so apportionment of the garage is calculated as: Business portion of garage expenses = 100 x 50% = 3.6% 1,400 This means they can claim 3.6% of their mixed expenses in relation to the garage, which is $75,000 x 3.6% = $2,700. Adding all these figures together, Luke and Asch work out that the total they can claim for their mixed expenses for the 2022 income year is $62,925 (83.9%): $58,950 + 2,700 + 1,275 = $62,925 They can claim this in addition to their business expenses of $500,000. Example 4 – Apportionment in boarding house Elanor operates a 10-bedroom boarding house that she also lives in. Elanor uses one of the bedrooms exclusively as her personal room. The 9 other bedrooms are occupied by long-term tenants. Every other room in the house is accessible and used by both Elanor and the other tenants in the house, including the living room, kitchen, and bathrooms. The total size of the house is 350m 2 , with Elanor’s room taking up 30m 2 . The 9 other bedrooms take up 180m 2 . The remaining 140m 2 is mixed-use areas as they are used by both Elanor for private purposes and by other tenants, which is business use. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 October 2021Inland Revenue Department 52 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED 30m 2 Private areas – 0% deductible 140m 2 Mixed-use areas – partially deductible 180m 2 Business areas – 100% deductible Elanor carefully ensures that none of her private expenses are included in her expenses relating to the boarding house. Her total business expenses for the 2022 year are $60,000. Of that sum, $35,000 relates solely to expenses relating to the guests, and $25,000 relates to mixed expenses. The $35,000 of expenses that relate solely to guests is fully deductible. Apportioning the mixed expenses by space The $25,000 of mixed expenses first need to be apportioned on a space basis. Elanor can claim 100% of her mixed expenses for the other 9 bedrooms and cannot claim anything in relation to her bedroom. Fully deductible portion of mixed expenses = 180 = 51.4% x $25,000 = $12,857.13 350 Non-deductible portion of mixed expenses = 100 = 8.6% x $25,000 = $2,142.87 1,400 Partially deductible portion of mixed expenses = 140 = 40% x $25,000 = $10,000 350 Fully deductible portion of mixed expenses 12,857.13 Non-deductible portion of mixed expenses 2,142.87 Partially deductible portion of mixed expenses 10,000.00 Total mixed expenses 25,000.00 Apportioning the partially deductible expenses by time Elanor notes that the common areas, and expenses relating to these common areas, are used primarily by the other tenants. Elanor considers that she can claim 90% in relation to the common areas, as they are used 90% of the time by the other 9 tenants and only 10% of the time by Elanor. This is how Elanor calculates what she can claim for her mixed expenses: Business portion of partially deductible expenses = 90% x $10,000 = $9,000 Elanor can claim this in addition to the amounts she can claim for the $12,857.13 in relation to the bedrooms, meaning the total amount she can claim is $21,857.13 for the 2022 income year: Deductible amount of mixed expenses = $12,857.13 + $9,000 = $21,857.13 Even if some of the other rooms are not occupied by tenants for part of the year, these rooms are not used at all by Elanor for anything but business purposes, so she can continue to claim 100% of her expenses for these bedrooms. If Elanor began using one of the rooms as an office or for storage when it is not occupied, or if Elanor had a family member stay with her in one of the rooms, she would need to make an adjustment for the private use of these areas.

NEW LEGISLATION Taxation (COVID-19 Support Payments and Working for Families Tax Credits) Act 2021 Overview The Taxation (COVID-19 Support Payments and Working for Families Tax Credits) Act 2021 was passed under urgency on 23 November 2021. The Act received Royal assent on 25 November 2021. It amends the Tax Administration Act 1994 and Income Tax Act 2007. The new legislation amends the existing COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payments (RSP) Scheme into a more general COVID-19 Support Payments (CSP) Framework to provide the Government with the flexibility to continue supporting businesses under a variety of scenarios. The Act also increases the Family Tax Credit, Best Start Tax Credit, the Minimum Family Tax Credit, and the Family Credit abatement rate. Minor remedial changes are also made to the Working for Families indexation settings. COVID-19 Support Payments Framework Sections 3, 7AAB, 7AAC, 157 and schedule 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994; sections MB 13 and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The Act contains a number of amendments to adapt the existing RSP scheme into a more general CSP Framework. Background The Taxation (COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payments and Other Matters) Act 2020 amended the Tax Administration Act 1994 and Income Tax Act 2007 to introduce provisions allowing the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to make grants to eligible businesses impacted by increases to the COVID-19 Alert Levels. The COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payments (RSP) scheme was explicitly connected to the COVID-19 Alert Level Framework and was limited to “an escalation in COVID-19 Alert Levels”. Due to the move to the COVID-19 Protection Framework, the RSP scheme needed to be adapted to provide the Government with the flexibility to continue supporting businesses in a variety of scenarios. Key features The new Act made the following changes to the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) by amending: • • section 7AAB authorising the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to make grants to eligible businesses • • section 7AAC which allows the scheme to be activated by Order in Council • • the definition of “tax” in section 3 of the TAA to allow Inland Revenue to use its existing debt management and care and management powers to administer the scheme, and • • schedule 7 of the TAA to allow the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to publish information relating to the scheme, including names of persons to whom the Commissioner has made a grant under the scheme. Application date The amendments apply from the date the Act received Royal assent. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 2 March 2022Inland Revenue Department 2 NEW LEGISLATION Detailed analysis The Act amends the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Income Tax Act 2007. As with the RSP scheme, the CSP framework is provided for in primary legislation to allow the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to use her existing tax administration powers for the purposes of administering the CSP framework. The amendments in this Act do not make available any powers that were not already available for the administration of the RSP scheme. Section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 The definition of “tax” in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act is amended to include an amount payable in relation to a grant made under the new framework. The amendment would allow Inland Revenue to continue to use its existing debt management and care and management powers to administer grants under the CSP Framework. Section 7AAB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 The amendment to section 7AAB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 expands the existing RSP framework to allow the Governor-General, by Order in Council, to authorise grants to be made to an eligible person financially affected by a public health measure, a business circumstance, or a matter related to COVID-19. The CSP framework retains the overall objective of the RSP scheme, namely supporting eligible businesses affected by COVID-19 restrictions, but it will no longer be specifically linked to the COVID-19 Alert Level Framework or limited to “an escalation in COVID-19 Alert Levels”. This ensures that the Government will have the flexibility to continue to support businesses under a variety of scenarios. Section 7AAC of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Amendments to section 7AAC of the Tax Administration Act 1994 are consequential changes to replace references to the RSP scheme with the CSP scheme. This ensures that, similar to the RSP scheme, the CSP framework will allow for the payment activation criteria, eligible persons, circumstances of the payment, and calculation of payment amounts to be set by Order in Council. Section 157 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 The definition of “income tax” in section 157(10) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is amended to include the entire amount of the grant that the recipient has to pay back. In the event that the recipient makes a default in the repayment of the grant to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, the Commissioner is able to pursue the outstanding balance by issuing a notice under section 157. Schedule 7, part A, clause 13B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 The amendment to schedule 7, part A, clause 13B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to publish information relating to the CSP scheme. This power was an integrity measure for the RSP scheme and the amendment ensures that it is available for the CSP scheme. The provision allows the Commissioner to publish information including the names of the persons to whom the Commissioner makes a grant under the scheme. However, the Commissioner is limited in the types of information that can be published and the clause imposes a time limit of 24 months for the information to remain published. This time limit may be extended by Order in Council made under section 7AAC on the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue. Although this is not specified in the Act, Inland Revenue will publish specific information relating to the payment of the support payments: • • the name of the recipient of the grant • • the amount paid, and • • the period of alert level escalation for which this payment relates. Inland Revenue will not publish details where: • • the recipient has fewer than three employees, or • • the amount paid is capped due to the “low revenue decline” test. This protects the privacy of the recipient by ensuring their actual revenue cannot be calculated based on the amount paid. The information will be published on a searchable database on the Inland Revenue website. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 2 March 2022Inland Revenue Department 3 NEW LEGISLATION Section MB 13 of the Income Tax Act The amendment to section MB 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007 excludes a payment under the scheme from the calculation of a person’s family scheme income. This is because a grant made under the scheme is for business purposes only. As the grant is not available for private use, it should not be included in calculating a person’s family scheme income. Section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act The definition of “exempt interest” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 is amended to include interest payable in relation to the repayment of a grant under the scheme. This amendment relates to resident withholding tax (RWT) and ensures the grant recipient does not have to deduct RWT on any interest charged by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Working for Families Sections MD 3, MD 13, ME 1, MF 7, MG 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The Act increases the Family Tax Credit (FTC), the Best Start Tax Credit (BSTC), the Minimum Family Tax Credit (MFTC), and the Family Credit Abatement rate. The Act also makes minor, remedial adjustments to the Working for Families (WFF) indexation settings. Background The WFF scheme provides financial support to low- and middle-income families with children. Key features The Act makes the following changes to the Income Tax Act 2007 by amending: • • Section MD 3 to increase the FTC eldest child rate from $5,878 to $6,642 and the subsequent child rate from $4,745 to $5,412 • • Section MD 13 to increase the Family Credit Abatement rate from 25% to 27% • • Section ME 1 to increase the MFTC threshold from $31,096 to $32,864 • • Section MF 7 to: –change the Consumers Price Index (CPI) measure used for the purposes of WFF indexation from the CPI (All groups excluding cigarettes and other tobacco products) to the CPI (All groups) measure; and –reset the start date from which future cumulative increases in the CPI are measured to 1 October 2021. • • Section MG 2 to increase the annual BSTC rate from $3,120 to $3,388. Application date The above changes take effect from 1 April 2022, with the exception of the amendments to section MF 7, which take effect from 26 November 2021, the day after the Act received Royal assent. Detailed analysis The Act amends the Income Tax Act 2007. Section MD 3: Family tax credit rates increased The Act increases the FTC eldest child rate from $5,878 to $6,642 and the subsequent child rate from $4,745 to $5,412, from 1 April 2022. These increases combine a scheduled inflation-indexation of the FTC with an additional $5 per week, per child increase. The FTC provides financial support to low- and middle-income families with children. FTC rates are indexed to inflation to ensure they maintain their real value over time. An inflation-indexed increase of the FTC rates is triggered when the CPI has a cumulative increase of 5% since the rates were last adjusted. An increase was triggered in the September 2021 quarter when cumulative CPI increases exceeded 5% (ultimately reaching 8.57%) since the last adjustment on 1 July 2018. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 2 March 2022Inland Revenue Department 4 NEW LEGISLATION The additional $5 per week, per child increase is intended to help reduce child poverty and alleviate the financial pressure and hardship brought on by COVID-19 restrictions. Section MD 13: Family Credit Abatement rate increased The Act increases the Family Credit Abatement rate from 25% to 27% from 1 April 2022. The Family credit abatement rate determines the rate at which the FTC and In-work tax credit payments reduce once family income exceeds the Family Credit Abatement threshold of $42,700. Section ME 1: Minimum Family Tax Credit increased The Act increases the MFTC guaranteed minimum income level for working families not receiving a main benefit (prescribed amount) from $31,096 to $32,864 per year from 1 April 2022. The change ensures that sole-parent families are financially better off in work, rather than on a benefit. The prescribed amount is adjusted annually in line with increases to main benefits to ensure the policy intent of the MFTC is maintained. Section MF 7: Remedial amendments to indexation settings The Act amends the CPI measure used for calculating the inflation indexation of FTC and BSTC rates, changing from the CPI (All groups excluding cigarettes and other tobacco products) measure back to the CPI (All groups) measure. In 2017, the CPI measure used to calculate inflation indexation of WFF payments changed from CPI (All groups) to CPI (All groups excluding cigarettes and other tobacco products) from 1 April 2018. The change in CPI measure was to prevent increases in tobacco prices, resulting from annual tobacco excise tax increases, flowing through to increases in WFF payments. With annual tobacco excise tax increases ceasing at the end of 2020, the CPI measure used has been amended, reverting back to CPI (All groups). The Act also resets the start date from which future cumulative CPI increases are measured to 1 October 2021. Section MG 2: Best Start Tax Credit increased The Act increases the annual BSTC rate from $3,120 to $3,388 from 1 April 2022 to reflect increases in inflation. The BSTC provides financial support for all families during the first year of their child’s life and for low- and middle-income families during the second and third years of their child’s life. Like FTC rates, the BSTC rate is indexed to inflation to ensure it maintains its real value over time. An inflation-indexed increase is made to the BSTC rate when the CPI has a cumulative increase of 5% since the rate was last adjusted. An increase was triggered in the September 2021 quarter when cumulative CPI increases exceeded 5% (ultimately reaching 8.57%) since 1 July 2018 when the BSTC was introduced. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 2 March 2022Inland Revenue Department 5 BINDING RULINGS This section of the TIB contains binding rulings that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has issued recently. The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates their tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see Binding rulings: How to get certainty on the tax position of your transaction (IR715). You can download this publication free from our website at www.ird.govt.nz BINDING RULINGS BR Prd 22/01: Kiwibank Ltd This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Kiwibank Limited. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of ss BG 1, CC 7, EW 15, EW 31, RE 1(1) and RF 2(1). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is a product that Kiwibank offers to its customers. The product is marketed as the “Kiwibank Offset Mortgage” (the Product). The Product allows a customer to elect that interest payable by the customer on a loan made by Kiwibank should be calculated by offsetting the balance of the loan against the aggregate credit balances of certain nominated transaction and savings and investments bank accounts (hereafter referred to as “credit accounts”) held either by that customer or by certain other eligible person(s). Interest is payable on the net notional balance of these combined accounts. This Ruling does not consider the tax consequences of any arrangement under which a credit account holder agrees to offset his or her credit account balance against another person’s home loan account balance in return for valuable consideration. Further details of the Arrangement are set out below. Background 1. The Product is a feature that Kiwibank offers to new and existing customers. The Product is available to both individual customers and business customers, including companies and trusts. 2. The Product is capable of affecting the way in which interest is calculated on loans offered by Kiwibank which had an agreed fixed periodic repayment arrangement (also referred to as the “table portion” of a loan). Kiwibank also offers loans with a revolving credit feature whereby amounts can be repaid or re-borrowed at any time provided the principal, interest, fees and costs on the loans do not exceed the specified maximum credit limit (also referred to as the “revolving portion” of a loan). The Product does not apply to “revolving portion” loans. 3. In overall commercial terms, the economic consequences for a customer of using the Product, or using a revolving portion loan product bearing a variable interest rate, are broadly the same. 4. Prior to the introduction of the Product, customers of Kiwibank could elect for their table portion loan to have one or more of three components: fixed, variable, and construction components. 5. The “fixed component” of the loan is subject to a fixed interest rate for a fixed term. Customers may repay all or part of a fixed component at any time, although in certain circumstances they may be charged with a fixed rate break cost for making any repayment that exceeds an early repayment limit agreed with Kiwibank. 6. The “variable component” of the loan is subject to a variable interest rate. Customers may repay all or part of a variable component of a loan at any time without any break costs. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 2 March 2022Inland Revenue Department 6 BINDING RULINGS 7. The “construction component” of the home loan is available where the home loan is obtained for the purpose of buying land and building a house on it or renovating a house on land the borrower already owns. The construction component of the home loan is subject to a variable interest rate and can be borrowed in stages (as opposed to a fixed or variable component which must be borrowed in a lump sum). 8. Kiwibank recognises that customers may have a range of accounts, including various deposit and loan accounts. Therefore, Kiwibank introduced the Product, which introduced a new component called an “offset variable component”. 9. When a customer elects that all or part of a loan is to have an offset variable component, interest accruing on that loan, or that portion of the loan, is to be calculated by reference to a notional balance. The notional balance is calculated by offsetting the debit balance of the offset variable component of the loan against the total credit balances multiplied by the existing published Kiwibank “offset ratio” of nominated everyday banking and savings and investments accounts (referred to as the “credit accounts”). This lowers the interest payable and the variable component of the loan. Therefore, it results in a greater proportion of a customer’s regular loan repayments being applied in reduction of the principal of the offset variable component of the loan. 10. This feature effectively treats a group of accounts in a collective or aggregated manner for the purposes of calculating interest accrued on the offset variable component of the loan. This feature is intended to make the Kiwibank overall banking relationship more attractive to current and potential customers. Interest calculations Calculations of interest on an offset variable component of a loan 11. Interest payable on an offset variable component of the nominated loan is calculated by reference to a notional balance. This notional balance is determined, for the purposes of that calculation only, by reducing the balance of the offset variable component of the loan by the aggregate of the credit balances of the nominated credit accounts. 12. The rate of interest applicable to the Product is the “offset variable interest rate”. The offset variable interest rate is one of a number of different rates which Kiwibank uses, under the Terms and Conditions of the various loans to which the Product applies. The offset variable interest rate may be above or below Kiwibank’s variable interest rate. 13. Interest is not calculated separately in respect of each account and then offset. Instead, a net notional balance is calculated across all the relevant accounts. The notional balance equals the offset variable component of the loan less (i.e., “offset” against) the credit balances of the nominated credit accounts. Interest is then payable on that net balance at the offset variable interest rate. This is the case as a matter of law (in terms of the terms of contractual relationship under the various Terms and Conditions applicable to eligible loans offered by Kiwibank) and as a matter of practice (in terms of Kiwibank’s computer and accounting systems). 14. The offsetting is solely for the purpose of calculating the notional balance on which interest is calculated. There is no actual transfer of funds, no set-off or “netting” of funds together in an account, and no transfer of any interest in or entitlement to funds. Importantly, the customer has no legal entitlement to interest on credit balances. This is the case even if the customer’s total credit balances exceed the customer’s loan balance. 15. Interest is calculated on a daily basis and is debited to the loan account on a regular basis. Loan repayments are credited periodically into the loan accounts, which will pay the periodic interest and reduce the principal outstanding. Such payments are made from a Kiwibank account that the customer has selected. This account may or may not be another credit account that the customer has nominated to participate in the Product. 16. The offsetting aspect of the Product essentially offers the same economic benefits to customers as a revolving portion loan in terms of reduced interest costs (through a reduced balance on which interest is calculated) and consequently will accelerate loan repayments. With a revolving portion loan, funds that would otherwise be in a savings or cheque account are paid into the loan account (but are available to be redrawn). 17. Kiwibank has made the Product available to business customers. However, business customers do not have the ability to group their accounts with accounts of another entity, as individuals can. No interest payable on credit accounts 18. Under the terms and conditions that Kiwibank and its customers have agreed for this Product, no interest is payable by Kiwibank on the credit balances of the credit accounts that customers have nominated to participate in the Product. This agreement applies regardless of whether those credit balances exceed the debit balance of the loan facility. This means that if the debit balance of a loan facility is less than the aggregate of the credit balances of the nominated credit accounts, no interest is paid or payable by Kiwibank. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 2 March 2022Inland Revenue Department 7 BINDING RULINGS Eligibility requirements 19. The product is only available to: ••An individual who holds an eligible loan with Kiwibank; ••Two individuals who are married, in a civil union, or in a de facto relationship and who hold an eligible loan with Kiwibank; ••A company which holds an eligible loan with Kiwibank; and ••A trust which holds an eligible loan with Kiwibank. 20. “Eligible loans” will be the following loan products currently offered by Kiwibank: ••Business loans secured by residential property; and ••Home loans. 21. The following additional persons can elect to “offset” their Kiwibank credit account against the loan of an individual customer or two individual customers who are married, in a civil union, or in a de facto relationship: ••(a) a child or children of the customer (or one of the customers); or ••(b) a parent or parents of the customer (or one of the customers). 22. Children and parents of individual customers can have a registered address with Kiwibank that is different from that of the customer’s. 23. An offset variable component of a loan can be “offset” against nominated accounts of the customer(s) or other eligible persons (in the case of individual customers). Other features of an offset variable component 24. The offset variable component is not an independent product; it is a component of a loan. The following features (amongst others) apply to the offset variable component along with the other components of a table portion loan: ••Interest is calculated on a daily basis, and is debited to the loan account on each specific payment date. ••Customers may repay all or part of an offset variable component of a loan at any time without any break costs. ••The interest and principal of an offset variable component are repayable by way of regular payment cycles over the term of the offset variable component, except in relation to any applicable interest-only period. Only interest payments are required to be made during an interest only period. “Repayment holidays” are also available, where no interest or principal is payable during a specific period. ••All amounts owing under the table portion (including any offset variable component and other components) must be repaid in full on the last day of the loan term. ••The offset variable interest rate can vary at any time. Kiwibank will give the customer notice before changing the rate: –If the offset variable interest rate increases, the customer’s regular payments for the offset variable component will automatically increase if this is necessary to enable the customer to pay off the offset variable component over the agreed term. –If the offset variable interest rate decreases, the customer’s regular payments for the offset variable component will remain the same, so the term of the loan will shorten. However, the customer can elect to reduce the amount of the regular payment so that the offset variable component can be repaid over the same term. ••If an existing customer elects to convert a part or all of an existing variable rate table portion loan to have an offset variable component, the customer must agree that Kiwibank’s applicable terms and conditions for the Product will apply. ••A customer may have more than one loan account to which the terms and conditions of the Product apply, but each such loan account is treated separately. In the case of individual customers only, they may group their loan and credit accounts with the credit accounts of other eligible individuals. ••A transaction or deposit account (e.g., everyday banking, savings and investments accounts) may be nominated to link to one or more loan accounts under the Product terms and conditions. If the outstanding balance of the various loan accounts exceeds the balance of the deposit account, the order of offsetting is determined by the “priority” ranking of each loan, as designated by the customer. ••Interest cannot be capitalised on any loan to which the Product applies, except to the extent of any interest component on a defaulted payment which may be capitalised by adding it to the daily balance of the relevant loan. The defaulted interest does not become part of the outstanding principal loan balance and will remain an outstanding interest payment. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 2 March 2022Inland Revenue Department 8 BINDING RULINGS Terms and conditions for the Product 25. Each Kiwibank loan is documented under a collection of documents: (a) In respect of home loans: i) The Home Loan Terms and Conditions, which are contained in a booklet that Kiwibank issues (as amended and updated from time to time) and which set out the generic provisions applicable to all Kiwibank home loan facilities. ii) The Home Loan Agreement, which contains specific provisions about the home loan facility that is being made available to a specific customer, including the amount and timing of regular payments calculated on a basis that will repay the loan over the applicable term. (b) In respect of other loans: i) The Lending Terms and Conditions for Business and Rural Banking – effective December 2012, which set out the generic provisions applicable to all of Kiwibank’s business lending facilities. ii) The Loan Agreement, which contains particular and specific provisions in relation to the business loan facility that is being made available to a specific customer including the amount and timing of regular payments, calculated on a basis which will repay the loan over the applicable term. (c) In respect of all loans: i) The General Terms and Conditions, that contains the terms that govern the general banking relationship between Kiwibank and its customers. The General Terms and Conditions may also contain specific terms and conditions that apply to particular accounts and services. ••In the event that there is any conflict between any part of the General Terms and Conditions and the Home Loan Terms and Conditions, the Home Loan Terms and Conditions will apply. ••In the event that there is any conflict between any part of the General Terms and Conditions and the Lending Terms and Conditions for Business and Rural Banking, the Lending Terms and Conditions for Business and Rural Banking apply. Groups of accounts 26. The product is based on a group of participating accounts. The following rules explain which accounts can be included in the group: (a) The accounts of an individual, or the individual and joint accounts of married, de facto and civil union couples, any of their children, and any of their parents may be combined as part of one group. To illustrate, Sarah and Peter have a home loan facility with Kiwibank. If Sarah and Peter and their child, Michael, each have a savings account with Kiwibank, the home loan facility could be offset by the credit balances of the various accounts held by them. (b) Borrowers of the home loan facility and owner of other transaction accounts nominated for the “offset” feature must be either: i) all residents of New Zealand for tax purposes; or ii) all non-residents of New Zealand for tax purposes. (c) Companies, trusts and sole traders are eligible to participate in the product. Companies, trusts, and sole traders may group their transaction and eligible loan accounts for the purposes of the product. However, a company, trust, or sole trader may not group their accounts with the accounts of any other individual or entity. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 2 March 2022Inland Revenue Department 9 BINDING RULINGS Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: (a) All interest rates related to the Product are arm’s length market interest rates. (b) The “offset ratio” as described in the updated August 2021 “Kiwibank Home Loan and Conditions” shall not exceed one, when applied to credit accounts. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: (a) No consideration is paid, or payable, by virtue of the offset feature of the Product for the purposes of calculating income and expenditure under ss EW 15 or EW 31. (b) No income arises under s CC 7 for Kiwibank’s customers in relation to the Arrangement (c) For the purposes of the “resident withholding tax rules” (as defined in s RE 1(1)) and the “non-resident withholding tax rules” (as defined in s RF 1(1)), there is no payment of, or entitlement to, interest in relation to the credit accounts participating under the Arrangement, that would give rise to an obligation to deduct resident withholding tax or non- resident withholding tax or pay an approved issuer levy. (d) Section BG 1 does not apply to the Arrangement. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 June 2021 and ending on 31 May 2026. This Ruling is signed by me on the 4th day of February 2022. Sonya Duncan Group Lead, Customer Compliance Services, Significant Enterprises About this document Product Rulings are issued by the Tax Counsel Office and Customer and Compliance Services. Product Rulings set out the Commissioner’s view on how tax laws apply to a particular “product” – which is an arrangement that a specified taxpayer is likely to enter into with a number of people on identical terms. Taxpayers who enter into the arrangement described in a Product Ruling may apply the ruling but are not obliged to do so. Product Rulings are binding on the Commissioner. This means that if you are entitled to apply a Product Ruling and you have calculated your tax liability in accordance with the ruling, the Commissioner must accept that assessment. A Product Ruling applies only to the taxation laws and arrangement set out in the ruling, and only for the period specified in the ruling. It is important to note that a general similarity to an arrangement covered by a Product Ruling will not necessarily lead to the same tax result.

Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 2 March 2022Inland Revenue Department 11 TECHNICAL DECISION SUMMARIES Facts | Ngā meka 1. The Taxpayer is an incorporated company. The company’s business activities are land ownership and management. 2. The Taxpayer filed its income tax return for the disputed period, which included a deduction for business expenditure. The return resulted in losses being carried forward. 3. Subsequently, a computer-generated notice of assessment (the Assessment) for the disputed period was issued to the Taxpayer by Customer and Compliance Services of Inland Revenue (CCS). The Assessment recorded an amount of tax to pay, as opposed to a loss. 4. The Taxpayer issued a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (TNOPA) upon receipt of the Assessment. The TNOPA stated that the Assessment was incorrect. It responded to the errors in the Assessment and maintained that it had no profit-making activities and the losses recorded in the self-assessment were correct. The exact reasons for these errors were unclear, but it appears to have been a result of Inland Revenue’s system pulling figures from the return that were entered incorrectly by the Taxpayer or by the system. 5. In response, CCS issued a Notice of Response (CNOR). In its CNOR, CCS did not dispute any of the issues raised in the TNOPA. However, CCS asserted that the Taxpayer had not proven it was carrying on a business and was, therefore, not entitled to a deduction for its expenditure. 6. The Taxpayer asserted that the CNOR was unlawful by retrospectively justifying the Assessment on the basis that the Taxpayer was not in business, rather than addressing the errors raised in the TNOPA. Issues | Ngā take 7. The issues considered in this dispute were: ••whether CCS was entitled to propose an adjustment in the CNOR regarding the Taxpayer’s entitlement to the expenditure claimed without issuing a further Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA); and ••if so, whether the Taxpayer has proven it was in business and, therefore, was entitled to the deductions claimed in its return. Decisions | Ngā whakatau 8. The Tax Counsel Office (TCO) decided that: ••The CNOR did not meet the requirements of a Notice of Response (NOR) under s 89G and the dispute should be discontinued. A new NOPA is required if the CCS wishes to dispute the Taxpayer’s entitlement to the expenditure. ••In light of the conclusion to issue one, it was not appropriate for TCO to consider whether the Taxpayer is in business. Reasons for decisions | Ngā take mō ngā whakatau Issue 1 | Take tuatahi: Adjustments in notice of response 9. The main issue is whether CCS is entitled to propose an adjustment in the CNOR regarding the deductibility of expenses claimed by the Taxpayer without first issuing a NOPA. 10. The Taxpayer argued that CCS acted inconsistently with the requirements for a NOR in s 89G because the CNOR did not address the issues raised in the TNOPA but instead took a statement regarding profitability in the TNOPA and used this as an admission that the Taxpayer is not carrying on a business. Alternatively, it can be inferred that the Taxpayer was arguing that CCS was acting inconsistently with s 89C by proposing these adjustments without issuing a NOPA. NOR requirements 11. Section 89G sets out the requirements of a NOR. A NOR must notify the issuer of the NOPA that the adjustment proposed is rejected and must state concisely the facts or legal arguments in the NOPA that is considered wrong and state why they are wrong. 12. Additionally, s 89G(2)(e) provides a NOR must state the quantitative adjustment to any figure in the NOPA that results from the arguments relied on by the issuer of the NOR, i.e., state concisely by how much they consider an adjustment in the NOPA is incorrect. 13. The purpose of a quantitative adjustment in a NOR in a taxpayer-initiated dispute is to establish the extent to which the Commissioner agrees or does not agree with the proposed adjustments in a TNOPA. While the arguments in a dispute may Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 2 March 2022Inland Revenue Department 12 TECHNICAL DECISION SUMMARIES be refined or changed over the course of the dispute, there is nothing to suggest a NOR can operate as a vehicle to propose a separate adjustment involving new grounds outside the scope of the NOPA. 1 14. This is consistent with the purpose of the dispute procedures more generally, as set out in s 89A. This is to reduce the likelihood of disputes by encouraging open and full communication and early identification of the basis for a dispute concerning a disputable decision. 2 15. There is no case law directly relating to the Commissioner’s ability to raise new issues during the NOR stage of a dispute but the case CIR v Delphi Fishing Ltd considered the Commissioner’s ability to provide additional information under s 89M(8) in response to a taxpayer’s Statement of Position (SOP). 3 Section 89M(8), which has parallels with s 89G, has a constraining feature in that the additional information must be in response to the other party’s material. 4 16. The Delphi Fishing case found that there must be limits on the Commissioner’s ability to raise new matters as otherwise it would be unfair to a taxpayer. Further, this would limit the time the taxpayer has, and the avenues through which they are able, to respond to the arguments raised by the Commissioner. Having restrictions on the Commissioner’s ability to raise new matters in the course of a dispute is consistent with the purpose of the disputes process in s 89A. 17. The CNOR in this dispute did not meet the requirements of s 89(2). It did not state any of the facts or legal arguments in the TNOPA that CCS thought were wrong; CCS agreed with the Taxpayer that there were errors in the Assessment. Instead, the CNOR raised the argument that the Taxpayer has failed to provide evidence it was entitled to the deduction for the expenditure incurred. 18. TCO considered a possible argument that CCS had disallowed the expenditure in the Assessment by virtue of recording a profit figure rather than a loss, and it would follow that the adjustments sought in the TNOPA was about expenditure and the CNOR was responding to those adjustments. 19. However, this argument did not accord with the facts. The Assessment does not show a breakdown of expenditure or income and there is nothing to suggest that the Assessment reflected Inland Revenue’s belief that the Taxpayer was not in business. 20. It was considered that the adjustments proposed in the TNOPA did not concern expenditure, and the adjustments proposed in the CNOR are separate adjustments from those proposed in the TNOPA. 21. Further, the adjustments proposed in the CNOR cannot be categorised as a quantitative adjustment under s 89G(2)(e). It does not state the extent to which CCS disagrees with the TNOPA. It raised a different issue. 22. The inclusion of the proposed adjustments in the CNOR limited the Taxpayer’s ability to address the arguments. It is unlikely that Parliament intended the Commissioner to be able to use a NOR to raise a separate issue regarding deductibility of expenditure when the dispute concerned errors in an assessment which both parties agreed were errors. Dispute should be discontinued 23. If a taxpayer disputes the validity of a dispute document issued by the Commissioner, the Commissioner may form the view that the dispute document is valid and continue with the dispute and the taxpayer can contest the validity of the document before the TRA or a court if the matter proceeds to challenge stage. However, if the Commissioner forms the view that one of the Commissioner’s dispute documents is invalid it would be open to the Commissioner to discontinue the dispute. 5 24. On the basis that TCO considers the CNOR to be invalid, the dispute should be discontinued. NOPA required 25. For completeness, TCO considered the requirement to issue a NOPA by the Commissioner. 1 See the Official’s Report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on Submissions on the Taxation (Annual Rates, Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2004 (August 2004) and the Commissioner’s standard practice statement SPS 16/06: Disputes resolution process commenced by a taxpayer at para 136. 2 See also Allen v CIR (2005) 22 NZTC 19,473 (CA) at \[15\] and Vinelight Nominees Ltd v CIR (2012) 25 NZTC 20,155 (HC) at \[29\]. “Disputable decision” is defined in s 3 as an assessment or a decision of the Commissioner under a tax law, with a number of specified exceptions. 3 CIR v Delphi Fishing Ltd (2004) 21 NZTC 18,525 (HC). 4 CIR v Delphi Fishing Ltd at \[58\]. 5 This approach is consistent with case law that considered the approach to be taken when the validity of a taxpayer’s dispute document is in question. See CIR v Alam and Begum \[2009\] NZCA 273, (2009) 24 NZTC 23,564 (CA) and Riccarton Construction Limited v CIR (2010) 24 NZTC 24,191 (HC). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 2 March 2022Inland Revenue Department 13 TECHNICAL DECISION SUMMARIES 26. Inland Revenue’s published position is that a new NOPA may be needed if a new adjustment is proposed or the basis for the original adjustment has fundamentally changed. 6 Further, if the Commissioner decides to increase the quantum of any proposed adjustments after the NOPA is issued the Commissioner must issue a new NOPA. 7 27. This requirement is supported by s 89B(1), which allows the Commissioner to issue one or more NOPAs in respect of a tax return or an assessment; and by s 89C, which requires a NOPA to be issued before the Commissioner can make an assessment, unless an exception applies. 28. In this dispute, none of the exceptions apply in s 89C to enable CCS to issue an assessment as proposed in the CNOR without acting in breach of s 89C. It is further noted that s 114 would not operate to enable the Commissioner to knowingly issue an assessment in breach of s 89C or any other provision of the TAA. 8 29. Therefore, if CCS wishes to pursue a dispute regarding the expenditure incurred by the Taxpayer, it will need to issue a new N O PA . Issue 2 | Take tuarua: Whether taxpayer in business 30. In light of the conclusion to issue one, it was not appropriate for TCO to consider whether the Taxpayer is in business. If CCS wishes to pursue a dispute regarding expenditure, it will need to issue a new NOPA proposing new adjustments for this issue. 6 This was explained in the Tax Information Bulletin item “Introduction to the new disputes resolution process”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 8, No 3 (August 1996) at page 12. 7 The Commissioner’s Standard Practice Statement: SPS 16/05 Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, para 60 and 62. This SPS concerns Commissioner-initaied disputes and these paragraphs concern the ability to propose adjustments at the SOP phase. However, it is considered the same principles apply to the Commissioner’s ability to propose another adjustment outside the scope of the issues in a TNOPA. 8 Under s 114, an assessment made by the Commissioner is not invalidated through a failure to comply with a provision of the TAA or another Inland Revenue Act. However, this provision is designed to prevent administrative error invalidating an assessments and case law indicates that it may not protect the Commissioner in cases of “conscious maladministration” or “abuse of power”.

The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates their tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see Binding rulings: How to get certainty on the tax position of your transaction (IR715). You can download this publication free from our website at www.ird.govt.nz BINDING RULINGS BR Prd 22/10: Silver Fern Farms Limited This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Silver Fern Farms Limited. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of s 11A(1)(w). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the supply to Silver Fern Farms Limited of units representing the removal of greenhouse gas from the atmosphere by owners of land containing permanent mapped and identified woody vegetation, where that vegetation is not already registered under the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. Background 1. Silver Fern Farms is a processor, marketer and exporter of premium quality lamb, beef and venison. Silver Fern Farms is 50% owned by Silver Fern Farms Co-Operative Limited, a co-operative company representing the interests of its members, and 50% owned by Shanghai Maling (Hong Kong) Limited. Carbon reduction programme 2. Silver Fern Farms has entered into an agreement with Toitū Envirocare (Toitū) dated 30 June 2020 (the Toitū Agreement) to achieve “Toitū carbonzero Certification” in accordance with PAS 2050:2011 Specification for the assessment of the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of goods and services (British Standard) for a cradle to grave assessment of emissions in relation to “100% Grass Feed Beef for Export to the USA”. 3. Toitū is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Manaaki Whenua – Landcare Research, a Government-owned Crown Research Institute. Toitū Envirocare’s offerings currently serve over 400 clients worldwide. Toitū is a member of the International Emissions Trading Association and has been accredited by the International Carbon Reduction and Offset Alliance. Both organisations require compliance with international standards and best practice. Toitū also verifies compliance with the following internationally recognised carbon credit standards: Gold Standard, Fairtrade Gold Standard, Clean Development Mechanism and Permanent Forest Sinks Initiative. 4. The “Toitū carbonzero Certification” accurately measures an entity’s greenhouse gas emissions, and puts in place strategies to manage, reduce and offset impacts. Compliance with the programme is independently verified annually to maintain certification. 5. Toitū issued a certificate, valid until 30 April 2023, confirming that Silver Fern Farms’ “100% Grass Feed Beef for Export to the USA” has met the requirements to achieve the Toitū carbonzero Certification. In relation to compensating for annual emissions, the certificate states: Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 2 BINDING RULINGS Ongoing compensation of emissions will be performed using a rolling 3 month forecast and actual sales cycle. Compensation is achieved by using non-credited removals\[FN3\] from farm suppliers, to reduce the net emissions balance to 0. The first compensation period is from 1st January 2022 to 31st March 2022, and will be repeated hereafter. \[FN3 - Measured and verified removals within the reporting organisations measurement boundary that are not registered as a carbon credit. The non-credited removals used are also accounted within the national inventory of the host country, New Zealand.\] 6. To achieve these non-credited removals, Silver Fern Farms will enter into agreements with its farmers (the Suppliers) for the supply of units representing the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by way of sequestration through permanent vegetation (the Services Agreement). The Services Agreements 7. Under the Services Agreement, the Suppliers agree to provide, and Silver Fern Farms agrees to buy, the “Services”. Clause 11 of Appendix 1 of the Services Agreement defines the “Services” as follows: 11. Services Definition 11.1 The Service You will provide Us \[Silver Fern Farms\] is the supply of carbon Removals, namely, the supply of units representing the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere where one unit = one tonne of carbon dioxide that would otherwise have been emitted into the atmosphere. Your end to end Service includes: 11.2 Cooperating in the identification, measurement, and classification of Vegetation on Your Property; 11.3 Providing information and cooperation to support this Service including: (a) making available the legal titles that make up the Property that may be used for this Service; (b) providing information relating to any ETS \[New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme\] registered forest and the Vegetation on the Property that may be used for this Service; (c) permitting the mapping of the Service through processing by Our suppliers, for example, remote satellite mapping of the Property based on the legal titles You provide to Us; (d) permitting Our suppliers and or authorised auditors to enter Your Property upon reasonable notice when it is necessary for them to measure, audit and verify that the Removals on Your Property do physically exist and its value aligns with how We have classified it; and (e) checking whether Vegetation mapped does physically exist and aligns with how We have classified it, including accessing satellite maps of the Property to verify the Vegetation providing the Service annually. together (the “Service”). 8. Clause 1.1 of the Services Agreement defines “Removals” as follows: “Removals” means up to 80% of Vegetation occurring on Your Property that may be used by You upon request by Us to provide a Service to reduce the net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the lifecycle of a certified net carbon zero meat product provided or supplied to Us. 9. Clause 1.1 of the Services Agreement defines “Vegetation” as follows: Vegetation: mapped and identified woody vegetation occurring on your Property that is: (a) permanent vegetation; (b) made up of woody species; (c) an average of at least 15 metres in width; (d) at least 0.25 hectares in area; (e) not registered in the ETS; (f) not registered as vegetation on any voluntary carbon market; and (g) not claimed as removals within any other product lifecycle. 10. Clause 1.1 of the Services Agreement defines “Permanent” as “the Vegetation will never be cut down or removed”. 11. The Services Agreement provides that the Supplier will be paid at a rate of $10 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e) or as otherwise expressly agreed by the parties in writing. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 3 BINDING RULINGS 12. Under cl 3.1 of the Services Agreement, the Supplier agrees to sell and provide the Services to Silver Fern Farms on an exclusive basis. The Supplier also warrants that they will not apply for any other recognition of the Removals and that the Removals will not be traded, sold, registered or otherwise in the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme or any other carbon market (cl 4.6). 13. The finalised and executed Services Agreements will not be materially different to the draft document emailed to Inland Revenue’s Tax Counsel Office on 10 December 2021. 14. Silver Fern Farms have engaged Lynker Analytics Limited to map the Suppliers’ properties and identify the area of each type of vegetation. It has also engaged Carbon Forest Services Limited to validate the mapping information as correct and calculate the amount of carbon sequestered in accordance with the Field Measurement Approach. This data is then verified by Toitū under the Toitū Agreement in accordance with the standards required by JASANZ ISO 14065 Greenhouse gases – Requirements for greenhouse gas validation and verification bodies for use in accreditation or other forms of recognition. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: (a) The Services that the Suppliers provide to Silver Fern Farms under each Services Agreement are zero-rated supplies for GST purposes under s11A(1)(w). The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 11 August 2022 and ending on 10 August 2025. This Ruling is signed by me on the 11 th day of August 2022. James McKeown Tax Counsel Lead, Tax Counsel Office Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 4 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT Operational statements set out the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s view of the law in respect of the matter discussed and deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. OPERATIONAL STATEMENT OS 22/04: Charities and Donee Organisations - Part 1 Charities Scope 1. The purpose of Operational Statement OS 22/04: Charities and Donee Organisations is to assist entities in the not-for- profit sector to understand their tax obligations and available tax benefits. This statement is published in two parts: Part 1 discusses charities and Part 2 discusses donee organisations. 2. New Zealand’s not-for-profit sector makes an important contribution to the wellbeing of New Zealanders. One way the Government supports the sector is by providing favourable tax treatments for the sector. These come in various forms, depending on the characteristics of the entity involved; for example, various income tax exemptions for the business and non-business income of charities, resident withholding tax (RWT) exemptions, fringe benefit tax (FBT) exclusions, goods and services tax (GST) concessions and interest-free student loans for overseas volunteers of approved charitable organisations. For charities that have donee status, donors may receive favourable tax treatments such as donation tax credits, payroll giving tax credits and income tax gift deductions. 3. Following brief comments about where to get more information, the application date of this statement, and the not-for- profit sector, Part 1 of the Operational Statement: considers what is a charity, including in the context of the two main Acts governing charities: the ITA and Charities Act 2005 (Charities Act) (see from \[13\]); addresses the relationship between Charities Services | Ngā Ratonga Kaupapa Atawhai (a unit of the Department of Internal Affairs | Te Tari Taiwhenua) and Inland Revenue (see from \[24\]); explains what charitable purposes are, because that is important to deciding whether an organisation is a charity (see from \[37\]); outlines the different tax treatments that may be available (see from \[44\]); discusses the implications for Māori organisations (see from \[171\]), explains the rules for charitable trusts (see from \[183\]), and non-resident charities (see from \[192\]); discusses the tax implications of ceasing to be a tax charity or deregistration (see from \[202\]); and sets out administrative matters (see from \[231\]) and highlights other disclosure and reporting regimes (see from \[252\]). An appendix of legislation and list of references conclude Part 1. 4. Part 2 of the Operational Statement provides guidance to entities wanting to become donee organisations or that are already donee organisations, including the benefits of being a donee organisation, how to obtain approval as a donee organisation, the requirements for a “charitable or public benefit gift” and the requirements for a donation tax receipt. 5. Part 2 also addresses other administrative tax matters relevant to donee organisations, including record-keeping and the implications of a donee organisation with charitable purposes being removed from the register maintained by Charities Services (Charities Register, described at \[28\]). 6. Topics relevant to Part 1 that are covered in Part 2 are cross-referenced. Further information 7. Inland Revenue has a dedicated email address for inquiries about charities and donee organisations: charities.queries@ird.govt.nz Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 5 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT 8. More information about charities is on the Inland Revenue website. 1 All references whether to webpages, reports or other items are listed with their full URL in the References at the end of this document. Application date of this statement 9. This Operational Statement (Parts 1 and 2) will apply from 10 October 2022. Not-for-profit sector 10. New Zealand’s not-for-profit sector is diverse and includes many different types of organisations and entities. A not- for-profit organisation is any society, association or group, incorporated or unincorporated, the activities of which are not carried on for the profit or gain of any individual and the rules of which do not allow any money or property to be distributed to any member. 11. Different parts of the not-for-profit sector have different tax treatments, depending on their characteristics: Tax charities – the status of which generally results in an income tax exemption. This category includes organisations registered under the Charities Act (registered charities), deregistered charities (only for a limited period), charities that began the process of becoming a registered charity before 1 July 2008 (which meet other conditions) and a small number of non-resident charities approved as a tax charity by the Commissioner. Donee organisations — the status of which gives tax benefits to donors who make gifts of money (donations) to them. This category includes charities and not-for-profit organisations with cultural, philanthropic or benevolent purposes. Charitable organisations — the status of which may enable them to benefit from exclusion from the FBT rules. Other not-for-profit organisations — organisations not otherwise covered above, which do not have the purpose of making a profit for any individual. They can potentially access tax exemptions or other administrative concessions provided for in the Inland Revenue Acts. (The Inland Revenue Acts are defined in s YA 1 of the ITA and listed in schedule 1 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA).) Examples of tax exemptions available to not-for-profit organisations are the income tax exemption for amateur sports promoters (s CW 46) and the income tax deduction of up to $1,000 (s DV 8). 12. A not-for-profit organisation may or may not be a charity, depending on whether it satisfies the legislative requirements described in this part. Additionally, a not-for-profit organisation may or may not be a donee organisation, depending on whether it satisfies the legislative requirements described in Part 2 of this Operational Statement. Some not-for-profit organisations are both a charity and a donee organisation, while some are neither. Definition of a “charity” 13. There is no legislative definition of a “charity” in the ITA or Charities Act. However, common law 2 has established that the hallmarks of a charity are that: the purposes of the charity are for the public benefit; and the purposes are charitable within the sense the law recognises. Both public benefit and charitable purposes are discussed from \[37\]. 14. The ITA defines a “tax charity, “charitable organisation” and “donee organisation” and the Charities Act defines a “charitable entity”. 15. A charitable entity that has obtained registration under the Charities Act is referred to in this Operational Statement as a “registered charity”. 16. All registered charities will meet the definition of tax charity under the ITA. However, there are other entities that are tax charities that are not registered charities. 17. The definitions under the ITA and Charities Act overlap. 1 Inland Revenue, Charities | Ngā kaupapa atawhai (webpage). 2 A-G v Family First NZ \[2022\]) NZSC 80 at \[10\] – \[12\], Re Greenpeace of NZ Inc \[2014\] NZSC 105, \[2015\] 1 NZLR 169 at \[18\]. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 6 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT Figure 1: Relationship between overlapping definitions in the ITA and Charities Act Charitable organisation (ITA) Tax charity (ITA) Charitable entity (Charities Act) “registered charity” Donee organisation (ITA) 18. Whether or not a charity is registered does not affect its legal status or its ability to accept funds from the public. However, to qualify for the favourable tax treatments, a charity must meet the legislative requirements described in this Operational Statement. 19. A “charitable entity” is a society, institution or the trustee(s) of a trust that is (or are) registered as a charitable entity under the Charities Act (s 4 of the Charities Act). 20. Requirements for registration (s 13 of the Charities Act) are as follows: For a society or institution to be registered, it must be established and maintained exclusively for charitable purposes (see from \[38\]) and not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual. For trustees of a trust to be registered, the trust must be of a kind in relation to which an amount of income is derived by the trustees in trust for charitable purposes. The name of the entity (as per s 6 of the Charities Act) must be the name of the incorporated board (if incorporated under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957) or the name of the trust or a name nominated by the trustees if the trust does not otherwise have a name. 21. Once registered under the Charities Act, the charitable entity is commonly known as a “registered charity”. 22. A “charitable organisation” means, for a quarter or an income year, an association, fund, institution, organisation, society or trust to which s LD 3(2) or schedule 32 applies (s YA 1). It may include an entity removed from the Charities Register (but only for a limited time), but it does not include a local authority, a public authority or a university. Charitable organisations are discussed in more detail in Part 2 of this Operational Statement. 23. A “tax charity” (defined in ss YA1 and CW 41(5)) is: a trustee, society or institution registered as a charitable entity under the Charities Act; a trustee, society or institution that has started the process of registration before 1 July 2008 and intends to complete the process and has not notified the Commissioner that it is not a tax charity; a non-resident trustee, society or institution that carries out charitable purposes outside New Zealand that is approved by the Commissioner as a tax charity in circumstances where registration under the Charities Act is unavailable; and entities removed from the register (but only for a limited period). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 7 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT Role of Charities Services 24. The Charities Act provides for the registration of entities (defined in s 4 of that Act as societies, institutions or trustees of a trust) as charitable entities. The purposes of the Charities Act (s 3 of that Act) include promoting public trust and confidence in the charitable sector, encouraging and promoting effective use of charitable resources, providing for registration and deregistration of charities, and requiring compliance with certain obligations. 25. Under the Charities Act, three members of the Charities Registration Board (the Board) are appointed by the Minister responsible for the administration of the Charities Act and are required to act independently from the Minister. The Board is the statutory decision maker responsible for decisions on the registration and deregistration of charities (s 8 of the Charities Act). 26. In addition, the Board delegates routine decisions to Charities Services, a unit of the Department of Internal Affairs (s 9 of the Charities Act). 27. Charities Services (s 10 of the Charities Act): provides a registration and monitoring system for charitable entities; collects and processes annual returns, including making available registered charities’ annual financial information on the publicly accessible Charities Register; provides an inquiry function into alleged breaches of the Charities Act or serious wrongdoing in connection with a registered charity; supplies information to Inland Revenue; and provides support and education to charities on good governance and management practice. 28. Charities Services maintains a public, searchable Charities Register 3 containing a list of all charities registered under the Charities Act. The Charities Register helps the public, funders and other users make better-informed decisions about charities they may wish to support. 29. For a society or an institution to be eligible to register with Charities Services, generally it must have been established and be maintained exclusively for charitable purposes and not be carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual. If it is established and maintained partly for charitable purposes and partly for benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes it may be able to register with Charities Services, provided the benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes are ancillary to the charitable purposes. 30. In the case of trustees of a trust, the trust will qualify for registration with Charities Services if it is of a kind in relation to which an amount of income is derived by the trustees in trust for charitable purposes (s 13 of the Charities Act). Trusts that derive income in trust for benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes that are not also regarded as charitable purposes may not be registered with Charities Services unless those purposes are ancillary to the charitable purposes. 31. An entity may be removed from the Charities Register at its request or at the direction of the Board. The grounds for removal include where: the entity is not or is no longer qualified for registration as a charitable entity; the entity has engaged in serious wrongdoing; any person has engaged in serious wrongdoing in connection with the entity; or the entity has significantly or persistently failed to comply with the Charities Act (for example, non-filing of annual returns). 32. Before an entity can be removed from the Charities Register at the direction of the Board, it has a reasonable opportunity to make submissions to the Board. The Board’s decision can be appealed to the High Court or be subject to an application for judicial review. 33. One of the Government’s aims in establishing the charities registration process was to create, as much as possible, a seamless interface between a charity’s registration and its entitlement to tax exemptions, including by way of s 30 of the Charities Act, which allows Charities Services to provide information to Inland Revenue. 34. To further enable Charities Services and Inland Revenue to work together, a memorandum of understanding provides for the sharing of information in respect of charitable entities. 4 3 Charities Services, Search the register (webpage). 4 Inland Revenue, Department of Internal Affairs (DIA) | Te Tari Taiwhenua (DIA) - Supplying of information in respect of charitable entities (webpage). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 8 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT 35. All such information exchanges take account of relevant legislative provisions regarding confidentiality of tax information and the requirements of the Privacy Act 1993 and the Official Information Act 1982. 36. The Charities Services website provides general information about charities and how to apply for registration. 5 Charitable purposes 37. For a society or institution to be a charity, it must be established and maintained exclusively for charitable purposes. For a trust to be a charity, its income must be derived by the trustees in trust for charitable purposes. 38. The definitions of “charitable purpose” in s YA 1 of the ITA and s 5 of the Charities Act are materially the same and relevantly provide that charitable purpose includes “every charitable purpose, whether it relates to the relief of poverty, the advancement of education or religion, or any other matter beneficial to the community”. 39. A charity’s purpose or purposes must be of public benefit within the sense the law recognises as charitable. 6 This is assessed by considering the end that is advocated, the means promoted to achieve that end and the manner in which the cause is promoted (Re Greenpeace at \[76\]). 40. The definitions of charitable purpose (in s YA 1 of the ITA and s 5 of the Charities Act) also provide specifically that a marae will have a charitable purpose where its: physical structure is on Māori reservation land; and funds are used only for the administration and maintenance of the land and the structure of the marae or for a purpose that is a charitable purpose (s YA 1 of the ITA and s 5(2)(b) of the Charities Act). 41. Further, the definitions of charitable purpose provide that the public benefit requirement for charitable purposes will not be defeated simply because beneficiaries or members are related by blood (s YA 1 of the ITA and s 5(2)(a) of the Charities Act). 42. An entity may be eligible for charitable registration, even if it has a non-charitable purpose, where the non-charitable purpose is merely ancillary (s 5(3) of the Charities Act). 43. Sporting organisations may be eligible for registration, provided the promotion of amateur sport is the means by which its charitable purpose is pursued (see s 5(2A) of the Charities Act). Summary of tax treatment available to charities 44. Tax charities in New Zealand are generally treated favourably for tax purposes as a reflection of wider government objectives. The annual Tax Expenditure Statement the Treasury produces for the Budget provides further transparency around policy-motivated “expenditures”. These tax expenditures take the form of an exemption, allowance, preferential tax rate, deferral or offset that reduces a tax obligation to achieve a specific policy objective. This Operational Statement focuses on the expenditures related to charities and not-for-profit organisations, sometimes referred to as “concessions”. 45. This support is provided for in the ITA, primarily through income tax exemptions. One exemption is for the non-business (passive) income of a tax charity (s CW 41). Another exemption is for the business income of a tax charity (s CW 42), subject to the additional territorial and control restrictions (see from \[81\]). 46. Income tax exemptions are a departure from the Government’s broad-based, low-rate tax framework. Therefore, as a matter of general principle, exemption from income tax is restricted to organisations that are both not-for-profit and operate for the public benefit – the main category of such organisations being registered charities. 47. Certain charities and not-for-profit organisations with New Zealand purposes are also eligible to be treated as donee organisations, meaning taxpayers may receive tax benefits for donations of money made to these organisations. Donee organisations are discussed in more detail in Part 2 of this Operational Statement. 48. Other tax treatment available may include RWT exemptions, FBT exclusions, GST concessions and interest-free student loans for overseas volunteers of approved charitable organisations. Also discussed from \[171\] are special tax treatments of Māori organisations that are registered charities. 49. The favourable tax treatment available to tax charities will not be available to a board incorporated under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957 unless the board becomes a registered charity. For more information about the tax treatment of charitable trusts, see from \[183\]. 5 Charities Services, Charities Services | Ngā Ratonga Kaupapa Atawhai (webpage). 6 A-G v Family First NZ \[2022\] NZSC 80 at \[10\] – \[12\], Re Greenpeace of NZ Incorporated \[2014\] NZSC 105, \[2015\] 1 NZLR 169 at \[18\] Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 9 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT 50. One area where tax charities do not receive favourable treatment is in the imputation system. Under the imputation system, a company effectively attaches income tax credits (known as “imputation credits”) to dividends distributed to shareholders. The shareholders then use those imputation credits to reduce their own income tax liability in respect of the dividend they receive. Where a shareholder is a tax charity that does not have to pay tax on the dividend received, the imputation credits cannot be used and the credits cannot be refunded. Income tax exemptions Qualifying for income tax exemptions 51. Income tax exemptions for tax charities are provided under: s CW 41 – exemption for non-business income; and s CW 42 – exemption for business income. 52. In addition, charitable bequests may be exempt from income tax (s CW 43). There are further specific exemptions from income tax, for example for community housing trusts and companies (s CW 42B), friendly societies (s CW 44) and bodies promoting amateur games and sports (s CW 46), amongst others provided under Subpart CW of the ITA. 53. There are also restrictions on when the non-business income of a council-controlled organisation will be eligible for the income tax exemptions. 54. A council-controlled organisation is defined in s YA 1 more broadly than in s 6(1) of the Local Government Act 2002 and can include an organisation that is not a company. Generally, an organisation will be a council-controlled organisation where: it is subject to the direct or indirect control of one or more local authorities; or a local authority has the direct or indirect power to control at least 50% of the votes at any meeting of the members or controlling body of the organisation, or the direct or indirect right to appoint at least 50% of the trustees, directors or managers of the organisation. 55. A council-controlled organisation will not be eligible for tax exemptions for non-business or business income unless it is operating a hospital as a charitable activity or operating a hospital as a charitable activity on behalf of the local authority (ss CW 41(4) and CW 42(2)). Income tax exemption for non-business income (s CW 41) 56. Section CW 41 provides a tax charity with an income tax exemption for non-business income. An example of non-business income is investment income (for example, interest or dividends). Section CW 41 also allows the income tax exemption for non-business income of a deregistered charity (but only for a limited time). 57. This exemption does not apply to any income derived from a business carried on by, or for or for the benefit of, the tax charity (this situation is dealt with under s CW 42). Income tax exemption for business income (s CW 42) 58. Section CW 42 provides an income tax exemption for business income when certain conditions are satisfied at the time the income is derived. 59. To qualify for the business income exemption: a tax charity must derive the income directly or indirectly from a business (see from \[66\]); the business must be carried on by, or for, or for the benefit of the tax charity (see from \[72\]); the entity carrying on the business must be a registered charity at the time the income is derived (see from \[79\]); the territorial restriction must be satisfied (see from \[81\]); and the control restriction must be satisfied (see from \[90\]). 60. Each of these five requirements is discussed in a separate subsection below. 61. The main difference between the tests under ss CW 41 and CW 42 is that exemption under s CW 42 is subject to the additional territorial and control restrictions. 62. The “territorial restriction” applies where the charitable purposes of the tax charity that derives the business income are not limited to within New Zealand (see from \[ 81\]). The territorial restriction requires that the business income be apportioned and only the income apportioned to charitable purposes in New Zealand can be exempt. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 10 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT 63. The “control restriction” requires that no person with some control over the business can direct or divert income derived from the business to their benefit or advantage (see from \[90\]). 64. A registered charity that carries on a business for or for the benefit of another tax charity is referred to as the “operating entity”. The tax charity that the operating entity carries on its business for, or for the benefit of, is referred to as the “controlling entity”. (The controlling entity may also be a registered charity, but it is not required to be one.) 65. For more information about the applicability of the business income exemption under s CW 42, see the explanation of the amendments to the legislation. 7 Tax charity derives income directly or indirectly from a business 66. The first requirement to qualify for the business income tax exemption is that the tax charity must derive income directly or indirectly from a business. 67. “Business” is defined for the purposes of the ITA in s YA 1 as including any profession, trade or undertaking carried on for profit. 68. The leading case on the meaning of “business” is Grieve v CIR \[1984\] 6 NZTC 61,682 (CA), which established the following: The words “for profit” in the context of the definition of “business” mean with the intention of making a profit. A business means an activity of a commercial nature that is carried on in an organised and coherent way with the intention of making a profit (being a profit ascertained in accordance with ordinary commercial principles and excluding allowances and deductions provided as tax incentives). To determine whether there is a business, it is necessary to consider the nature of the activities and the taxpayer’s intention in carrying on the activities. Both subjective and objective evidence is relevant in determining whether the taxpayer’s intention in carrying on an activity is to make a profit. However, subjective evidence must be tested against objective evidence. The objective matters that may be relevant in determining a taxpayer’s intention in carrying on an activity include: the nature of the activity; the period over which it is engaged in; the scale of the operations and volume of transactions; the commitment of time, money and effort; the pattern of activity; and the financial results. A taxpayer’s motive (underlying purpose) for carrying on an activity is irrelevant in determining whether the activity is a business. 69. Many organisations in the not-for-profit sector engage in activities on a continuous and ongoing basis, commit time, money and effort to those activities, and conduct a large volume of transactions, with the intention of making a surplus. Organisations that carry on this type of activity are carrying on a business as that term is defined in s YA 1. 70. A trustee is treated as carrying on a business if they derive rents, fines, premiums or other revenues from a trust asset and the asset was disposed of to the trust by a person having control over the business (as described at \[94\]), and either the person retains or reserves an interest in the asset or the asset will revert to the person (s CW 42(3)). 71. Inland Revenue’s Public Ruling BR Pub 22/06, 8 while dealing primarily with the exclusion from FBT of benefits provided to employees of qualifying non-profit organisations (under s CX 25), outlines what constitutes a “business”. Business carried on by, or for, or for the benefit of the tax charity 72. The second requirement to qualify for the business income tax exemption is that the business is carried on by the tax charity or the business is carried on for or for the benefit of the tax charity. 73. If the tax charity is carrying on a business, the second requirement will be satisfied. 74. A business is carried on “for, or for the benefit of, a tax charity” where a registered charity (the operating entity) is carrying on a business for or for the benefit of the tax charity (the controlling entity). 75. Further, where a business is carried on by a registered charity in partnership with a non-charitable entity, the income derived may still be exempt under s CW 42 (subject to satisfaction of the territorial and control restrictions). 9 7 Inland Revenue, “Charities and donee organisations” section on “New Legislation” in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31, No 4 (May 2019) at 132-133 (publication). 8 Inland Revenue, Public Ruling BR Pub 22/06 - Fringe Benefit Tax - Charitable and Other Donee Organisations and Fringe Benefit Tax (May 2022) at page 9 (publication). 9 Inland Revenue, QB 21/03: Charities business \[income\] exemption - business carried on in partnership (Question we’ve been asked / 2021, May 2021) at (11) (publication). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 11 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT 76. This will also be the case where a non-charitable entity is in partnership with an operating entity carrying on a business for, or for the benefit of, a controlling entity. 10 77. A business is not automatically considered to be carried on for, or for the benefit of, a tax charity merely because some of the income from the business is paid to a tax charity.  Instead, the business must be carried on for or for the benefit of the tax charity. 78. A business does not cease to be carried on for, or for the benefit of, a tax charity if the business income is accumulated from year to year, as long as the income and resulting assets are ultimately paid to the tax charity. 11 Entity carrying on the business must be a registered charity 79. The third requirement to qualify for the business income tax exemption is that the entity carrying on the business must be a registered charity at the time the income is derived. 80. From the 2020/21 income year, where business income is derived by an operating entity for a controlling entity, the operating entity must itself be a registered charity to qualify for the business income exemption. The controlling entity must be a tax charity. The controlling entity may also be a registered charity (although this is not a requirement). Application of the territorial restriction 81. The fourth requirement to qualify for the business income tax exemption is that the territorial restriction is satisfied. 82. Where an entity’s charitable purposes are limited to within New Zealand, the territorial restriction is satisfied, so no apportionment of income is required. 83. Where an entity’s charitable purposes are not limited to within New Zealand, the territorial restriction applies and the business income must be apportioned reasonably between the purposes within New Zealand and those outside New Zealand and taxed accordingly. Only income apportioned to the charitable purposes in New Zealand is exempt income (s CW 42(4)). 84. There is no prescribed apportionment methodology in s CW 42. One just and reasonable manner of apportioning income would be to examine the historical distribution pattern and apportion in that manner. 12 85. It is considered that a method based on the historical distribution pattern might be reasonable, subject to the following caveats: Where the taxpayer has retained income, an apportionment based on the historical distribution pattern might still be appropriate, provided there are no indications the purposes of the taxpayer are to change in the future. If apportionments have been based on a historical distribution pattern in the past, but the taxpayer’s purposes change, apportionment would be justified to take that change into account. 86. This does not mean the “historical distribution pattern” apportionment method is the only reasonable apportionment method. Other methods may be reasonable, depending on the facts of the case. 87. The courts have considered apportionment more generally in the context of allowable deductions. 13 This case law can be useful in determining a reasonable apportionment. These cases establish that when determining what is reasonable in cases of apportionment: where an amount can be apportioned between purposes it should be, but where it serves two purposes indifferently the best apportionment that can be made must be made based on the facts of the case; and although an apportionment cannot be based on mere speculation, absolute precision may not be possible, and some degree of arbitrariness is acceptable if no better apportionment can be made on the facts. 88. The term “New Zealand” is defined in s YA 1. It is an inclusive definition (that is, it is not exhaustive) and includes the continental shelf and the water and air space above the continental shelf that is beyond New Zealand’s territorial sea (subject to some limitations). In essence, “in New Zealand,” when used as a territorial description, means the islands and territories within the Realm of New Zealand; but does not include the self-governing state of the Cook Islands, the self- governing state of Niue, Tokelau or the Ross Dependency. 10 Inland Revenue, QB 21/03: Charities business \[income\] exemption - business carried on in partnership (Question we’ve been asked / 2021, May 2021) at (13) (publication). 11 Calder Construction Co Ltd v CIR \[1963\] NZLR 921 (SC). 12 CIR v Dick \[2002\] 2 NZLR 560 (HC). 13 Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271 (CA); NZ Co-operative Dairy Co Ltd v CIR (1988) 10 NZTC 5,215 (HC); Christchurch Press Co Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,124 (HC). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 12 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT 89. When tax charities undertake an ongoing self-assessment (required of all tax charities at least year by year), they must calculate a reasonable apportionment between charitable purposes within New Zealand and those outside New Zealand, where applicable. The tax charity must keep records to show where its charitable purposes are carried out, in New Zealand or outside New Zealand. Additionally, the tax charity must keep records of the method and rationale it used to apportion business income. Application of the control restriction 90. The fifth requirement to qualify for the business income tax exemption is that the control restriction is satisfied. 91. In this regard, the controlling entity and the operating entity are each required to ensure no person with some control over the business can divert an amount derived from the business for their own benefit or advantage or for the benefit or advantage of another person that is not for the purpose of the tax charity (see s CW 42(5) to (8)). 92. In any audit, documentation will be examined to determine whether a person with some control over the business is able to exert influence that would enable someone to receive a benefit or advantage. 93. Adequate records of the decision-making process (for example, minutes of meetings and resolutions), as well as documentation such as trust deeds, constitutions and accounting records must be kept. The meanings of “some control over the business” and “benefit or advantage” are discussed from \[94\] and \[106\] respectively. Meaning of “some control over the business” 94. The first matter to be consider within the control restriction is whether any person has some control over the business to be able to divert an amount. 95. A wide spectrum of situations exists in which a person may be able to exercise some control over a business. At one extreme are situations of duress or oppressive conduct, or where the person controls the decision-making in terms of majority voting rights or with associated persons controlling the board, or where the trust instrument grants a right of veto over decisions to that person. At the other end of the spectrum are situations where the settlor is consulted but has no power to direct or the person in question is only one of several trustees or directors involved in decision making. 96. Generally, whether a person can divert an amount by materially influencing decisions is a matter of fact and degree. When considering whether a person has some control over the business, it is not necessary for the benefit or advantage to be actually received. 97. Under s CW 42(7), a person does not have some control over a business merely because they provide professional services to the trust or company by which the business is carried on and their ability to determine the benefit or advantage arises because they are: providing services in professional public practice; a statutory trustee company; the Public Trust; or the Māori Trustee. 98. In some circumstances a person will be treated as having some control over the business of the charity and as being able to direct or divert amounts from the business to their own benefit or advantage (s CW 42(5)). This will be the case if they are directly or indirectly able to determine or materially influence the determination of the nature or extent of a relevant benefit or advantage, or the circumstances in which a benefit or advantage is given or received, because they are: a settlor or trustee of the trust carrying on the business; a shareholder or director of the company carrying on the business; a settlor or trustee of a trust that is a shareholder of the company carrying on the business; or an associated person of any settlor, trustee, shareholder or director described above. 99. In instances where two or more people can influence a decision, whether a person is able to materially influence may depend on whether the person actually participates in the discussion and decision making. Even if a person is in the minority of the decision-making group, they may still exert material influence over the decision to their advantage (for example, because they are well regarded). 100. Where there is a sole trustee, the implication is that the sole trustee can exert the requisite influence. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 13 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT 101. Past behaviour (such as the pattern of distributions or whether benefits have been afforded to any person who is able to influence the entity by virtue of their status) can be a guide to whether, in practice, the person in question can materially influence the setting of benefits (CIR v Dick). 14 102. Where it is clear that the setting of any benefit or advantage has been undertaken in a scientific manner to ensure market value is paid, the Commissioner will accept that there has been no material influence to provide a benefit or advantage (CIR v Dick). 103. A person’s legal, as well as practical, ability to divert an amount by influencing the decision will be considered (CIR v Dick). 104. The Companies Act 1993 provides certain rights and powers to shareholders and directors. The control test will not be satisfied where those rights enable a person to influence the decisions of the business to divert an amount from the business to the benefit or advantage of a particular person that is not for the purpose of the operating entity or controlling entity. When the control test is not satisfied, the income derived from that business will not be exempt from tax under s CW 42. 105. The company’s board may enact special provisions to restrict or eliminate the powers given by the Companies Act to shareholders or directors that could enable them to influence company decisions. Meaning of “benefit or advantage” 106. The second matter to be considered within the control restriction is whether a person with some control over the business (as described above) can direct or divert an amount derived from the business to the benefit or advantage of a person as described in s CW 42(1)(c). 107. A benefit or advantage that is received or can be received by a person is defined widely in s CW 42(8) and includes: receiving something that may or may not be convertible into money; deriving an amount that would be income of the person (with certain exclusions); and retaining or reserving an interest in an income-earning asset, if the person has disposed of the asset to the trust or the asset will revert to them. Charitable bequests (s CW 43) 108. Another income tax exemption that may be available relates to charitable bequests. A charitable bequest is a gift made to a charity in a will. 109. The intent of s CW 43 is to exempt income accruing to an executor or administrator of a deceased’s estate to the extent to which the amount: arises or is attributable to assets of the estate that have been left to a tax charity (s CW 43(2)); and if derived by the tax charity, would have been exempt income under s CW 41 (non-business income) or s CW 42 (business income) (s CW 43(3)). 110. Section CW 43 operates to allow income derived by the deceased’s executor or administrator between the date of death and the end of the income year following the income year in which death occurred to be exempt, regardless of the charity not being registered under the Charities Act. Income accruing between the date of death and the distribution of the estate would be taxable, if it were not for s CW 43(4) and (5). However, any such income the charity derives after this period will not be exempt, unless the charity is a tax charity. Resident withholding tax exempt status 111. Another type of income tax exemption available to charities relates to RWT. RWT is a tax that is deducted from investment income before the investor receives it. 112. From 1 April 2020, the Commissioner accepts a person registered under the Charities Act as having RWT-exempt status for the duration of their registration and they will no longer need to apply for an exemption certificate. 113. Entities that held an RWT certificate of exemption before 1 April 2020 were added to the electronic register of those with RWT-exempt status unless: their exemption was cancelled, expired or revoked; or if the entity was exempt under an Act other than the Inland Revenue Acts and it had not been approved under criteria contained in the Inland Revenue Acts. 14 CIR v Dick \[2002\] 2 NZLR 560 (HC). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 14 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT 114. Payers of non-business income to tax charities can now check in real-time, by IRD number, that an entity has RWT-exempt status and the date from which that exemption started on the RWT-exemption register (see s RE 29). 15 115. The Commissioner also publishes the date RWT-exempt status ended on the RWT-exemption register. (The start and end dates of RWT-exemption are no longer published in the New Zealand Gazette.) 116. Entities on the RWT-exemption register must notify the Commissioner if they no longer meet the criteria for the exemption (s 32K(2) of the TAA), unless they are a charity that is deregistered, in which case the Commissioner will receive the information from Charities Services directly. For more information about RWT-exemption status when a charity is deregistered, see \[223\]. 117. More information about RWT generally is available on Inland Revenue’s website 16 including in: Resident Withholding Tax on Interest (RWT) Payer’s Guide (IR283); 17 and Resident Withholding Tax (RWT) on Dividends: Payer’s guide (IR284). 18 Non-resident withholding tax 118. If a charity pays passive income (such as interest or dividends) to a non-resident (referred to as non-resident passive income), the charity needs to register as a non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) payer, deduct NRWT from the payment and remit the NRWT to the Commissioner. 119. Note that non-resident passive income does not include exempt income, such as the passive investment income of a non- resident charity recognised as a “tax charity” (s CW 41(5)). 120. For more information about NRWT generally, see NRWT: Payer’s guide (IR291). 19 Fringe benefit tax exclusion 121. Not-for-profit organisations are liable for FBT unless the exclusion from FBT in s CX 25 applies to them. 122. The exclusion in s CX 25 applies to charitable organisations, which are defined in s YA 1, and include most donee organisations. The definition of charitable organisation also includes registered charities removed from the register that have challenged the decision and have not yet received a final decision. 123. Local authorities, public authorities and universities are excluded from being charitable organisations, so the standard FBT rules apply to them. 124. For ease of reference, in this Operational Statement the types of not-for-profit organisations that can rely on the FBT exclusion in s CX 25 are referred to as “qualifying organisations”. 125. Qualifying organisations carry on a variety of activities. Those activities may include business activities. Those business activities may be within the organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic purposes or outside those purposes – even if undertaken to help fund the organisation’s benevolent, charitable, philanthropic or cultural purposes. 126. The exclusion from FBT for qualifying organisations is set out in s CX 25(1) and applies to the extent to which the qualifying organisation provides a benefit to an employee mainly in connection with their employment and the qualifying organisation’s activity is: not a business; or a business and the business activity is within the qualifying organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic purposes. 127. The FBT exclusion does not apply where benefits are provided by way of short-term charge facilities (s CX 25(2) and (3)), see \[141\]. Meaning of “mainly in connection with employment” 128. Section CX 25(1)(a) applies only where the employee receives the benefit mainly in connection with their employment. 129. This wording recognises that a qualifying organisation may provide benefits to people who are acting in different capacities for the organisation. It is not unusual for people to be employed by the organisation in a particular role and for those same people to also provide additional or different services to the organisation, for example, on a voluntary (unpaid) basis. 15 Inland Revenue, Resident withholding tax exemption register | Te rēhita aweretanga tāke kaiponu kainoho-tāwāhi (webpage). 16 Inland Revenue, Resident withholding tax (RWT) | Te tāke kaiponu kainoho (webpage). 17 Inland Revenue, IR283 - Resident withholding tax on interest (RWT) - payer’s guide (June 2020) (publication). 18 Inland Revenue, IR284 - Resident withholding tax (RWT) on dividends - payer’s guide (September 2020) (publication). 19 Inland Revenue, IR291 - NRWT - payer’s guide (September 2020) (publication). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 15 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT 130. A potential liability for FBT will arise only where an employee receives a benefit from a qualifying organisation mainly in their employment capacity and not in some other capacity (for example, their voluntary capacity). 131. A benefit will be provided to an employee of a qualifying organisation mainly in connection with their employment, if the benefit arises primarily in connection with their employment. If an employee is only employed by a qualifying organisation (that is, they do not do voluntary work), then any benefits provided to that employee are provided in connection with their employment. However if, for example, the employee is both employed by and volunteers for a qualifying organisation, it is necessary to determine in which capacity the benefit primarily arises. 132. If the benefit arises equally in connection with both capacities, the benefit will be provided mainly in connection with the capacity in which the employee is predominately engaged. Activity that is not a business 133. Where the qualifying organisation’s activity is not a business and a benefit is provided to an employee mainly in connection with their employment, the exclusion from FBT applies. 134. For the meaning of business and carrying on a business, see from \[66\]. Activity that is a business and “within the qualifying organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic purposes” 135. Where the qualifying organisation’s activity is a business and a benefit is provided to an employee mainly in connection with their employment, the exclusion from FBT applies only if the business activity is within the qualifying organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic purposes. 136. Determining whether a qualifying organisation’s business activity is within its benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic purposes requires an understanding of the types of activities the qualifying organisation is carrying on. 137. The Commissioner considers activities are carried on within a qualifying organisation’s purposes when they: are the performance of a qualifying organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic purposes; or directly facilitate the carrying out of the qualifying organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic purposes. 138. Activities the Commissioner considers will usually be characterised as being carried on within a qualifying organisation’s purposes include: the carrying out of the qualifying organisation’s purposes; appeals for funds for the qualifying organisation’s purposes; passive investment and management of the qualifying organisation’s funds, so long as the organisation does not carry on a business of fund investment; and the administration of the above activities. 139. If the employment of the qualifying organisation’s employee consists of the carrying on by the organisation of a business whose activity is outside the organisation’s charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes, benefits provided to the employee will not come within the exclusion provided by s CX 25. When this is the case, the organisation may be subject to FBT. 140. For more information and practical examples of where the FBT exclusion will or will not apply, see Inland Revenue’s Public Ruling BR Pub 22/06 20 . Short term charge facilities 141. The exclusion from FBT in s CX 25(1) does not apply to benefits provided by way of short-term charge facilities in specified circumstances (s CX 25(2) and (3)). 142. A short-term charge facility, as defined in s CX 25(3), is an arrangement that: enables an employee of the qualifying organisation to obtain goods or services that have no connection with the employer or its operations by: –buying or hiring the goods or services; 20 Inland Revenue, Public Ruling BR Pub 22/06 - Fringe Benefit Tax - Charitable and Other Donee Organisations and Fringe Benefit Tax (May 2022) at page 20 (publication). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 16 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT –charging the costs of the goods or services to an account; or –providing consideration other than money for the goods or services; and requires the employer to provide some or all of the payment or other consideration for the goods or services; and is not a fringe benefit under s CX 10. 143. A short-term charge facility includes some vouchers but does not include an employment-related loan (s CX 10). An example of a fringe benefit provided by way of a short-term charge facility is in Inland Revenue’s Public Ruling BR Pub 22/06. 21 144. To determine whether a taxable fringe benefit has been provided when a qualifying organisation provides a benefit to an employee, first determine the lesser of 5% of the employee’s salary and wages for the tax year or $1,200. If the value of the benefit provided by way of a short-term charge facility is more than this figure, then a taxable fringe benefit has been provided (s CX 25(2)). Goods and services tax and non-profit bodies 145. There are also favourable GST rules for non-profit bodies (including charities). GST is a broadly based consumption tax that is imposed under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) on the supply of goods and services in New Zealand and on imported goods. 146. The GST Act has provisions relating to a “non-profit body” (s 2(1) of the GST Act). For the purposes of the GST Act, a non- profit body is any society, association or organisation, whether incorporated or not, that is: carried on other than for the purposes of profit or gain to any proprietor, member or shareholder; and by the terms of its constitution, rules or other document constituting or governing the activities of that society, association or organisation, prohibited from making any distribution whether by way of money, property or any other way, to any such proprietor, member or shareholder. 147. In general, charities fall within the definition of non-profit body in the GST Act, depending on the terms of their constitution and rules. 148. The threshold for mandatory GST registration for a non-profit body is the same as for any other entity, as is the requirement for keeping GST records (see from \[231\]). Non-profit bodies operating below the threshold for mandatory GST registration may voluntarily register. However, in either case (that is, mandatory or voluntary registration), the non- profit body must have a taxable activity to qualify. 149. Consistent with the general rules for GST, the taxable activity of a non-profit body must be a continuous or regular activity involving the making of supplies of goods and/or services for consideration. 150. Consideration in relation to the supply of goods and services to any person includes any payment made or any act or forbearance, whether or not voluntary, in respect of, in response to or for the inducement of the supply of any goods and services, whether by that person or by any other person. However, it does not include any payment made by any person as an unconditional gift to any non-profit body (s 2(1) of the GST Act). 151. The receipt and payment of unconditional gifts are outside the scope of GST. An unconditional gift is defined in s 2(1) of the GST Act. It is a payment, voluntarily made to any non-profit body for the carrying on or carrying out of the purposes. No identifiable direct valuable benefit can or may arise in the form of a supply of goods and services to the person making the payment (or any associated person). However, an unconditional gift does not include any payment made by the Crown or a public authority. For more information on unconditional gifts and GST, see GST: Unconditional gifts (IS 20/09). 22 152. GST-registered non-profit bodies can claim an input tax deduction for most goods and services they acquire (even if the goods and services do not directly relate to the making of taxable supplies) to the extent that they are not used for the making of exempt supplies (s 20(3K) of the GST Act). 153. An example of an exempt supply is the supply by any non-profit body of donated goods and services (s 14(1) of the GST Act). Donated goods and services are goods and services that are gifted to a non-profit body and intended for use in the carrying on or carrying out of the purposes of that non-profit body (s 2(1) of the GST Act). For example, the sale of donated clothing by a non-profit body would be an exempt supply, so not liable to GST. 21 Inland Revenue, Public Ruling BR Pub 22/06 - Fringe Benefit Tax - Charitable and Other Donee Organisations and Fringe Benefit Tax (May 2022) at page 22 (publication). 22 Inland Revenue, Interpretation Statement IS 20/09 – GST - unconditional gifts (December 2020) (publication). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 17 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT Election for an asset to not be part of taxable activity 154. From 15 May 2018 to 31 March 2021, a non-profit body could have made an election under s 20(3KB) of the GST Act, with respect to a supply, to exclude the supply from the effect of s 20(3K) of the GST Act. 155. When such an election was made with regards to an asset, when the non-profit body sells that asset it will not be subject to GST on the sale (or an equivalent event). Valuation on deemed disposal of assets by GST deregistration 156. Section 88 of the GST Act provides for the valuation of supplies of assets used by GST-registered non-profit bodies. This section requires: a non-profit body to be bound by a tax position concerning the output tax on the disposal of an asset if the tax position is taken in a return before 15 May 2018 (s 88(1) and (2) of the GST Act); and the availability of an election concerning the value of a supply that is made during the period 15 May 2018 to 31 March 2021 as a consequence of the GST deregistration of the non-profit body (s 88(3) to (5) of the GST Act). Input tax credit limitation for the acquisition of second-hand goods 157. The amount of input tax credit that may be claimed by a registered recipient of a second-hand good that has been subject to an election under s 20(3KB) or s 88(4) is limited to the amount of GST paid by the non-profit body under the election. This limitation applies when the recipient is: associated with the original owner; a non-profit body; or associated with a non-profit body (s 88(6) to (8) of the GST Act). Further GST information 158. Other sections of the GST Act that may be relevant to non-profit bodies include ss 2A(1)(f)–(h) (meaning of associated persons), 6(3) (taxable period returns), 19A(1(a)(iii) (requirements for accounting on payments basis), 19D(2B) (invoice basis for supplies over $225,000) and 51(5) (persons making supplies in course of taxable activity to be registered). 159.

Interest-free student loan concession 162. Usually, when someone with a student loan travels overseas for more than six months, they are charged interest on their loan. 163. If a charitable organisation obtains approval under the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011, volunteers working for the organisation overseas may be able to keep their student loan interest free. The concession may apply if work is performed for no more than 24 months and is performed voluntarily or for no more than a token payment. 164. The volunteer work for the charitable organisation must be to: relieve poverty, hunger, sickness, or the impacts of war or natural disaster; or improve the economy or raise educational standards in a country that is on the OECD list of countries receiving development assistance. 165. For a charitable organisation to obtain this approval, it must submit a letter to the Commissioner explaining why the organisation should be granted approval. The organisation should send the letter through the online myIR service if it has such an account, otherwise via email to charities.queries@ird.govt.nz or via post to Inland Revenue, PO Box 1147, Palmerston North Central, Palmerston North 4440. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 19 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT 166. The letter should include: whether the charitable organisation is a registered charity; whether the charitable organisation is a non-resident tax charity with an income tax exemption approved by the Commissioner; information on the work the charitable organisation does; details of the work volunteers will do for the charitable organisation; and details of any payments for which the volunteers will qualify. 167. If the charitable organisation is not a registered charity in New Zealand, it must also provide: a copy of the charitable organisation’s trust deed, constitution or other governing rules; whether it is recognised as a charitable organisation with an overseas tax authority or government charity regulator (if so, copies of the relevant documentation should be provided); evidence of standing and credibility as a charitable organisation; whether the charitable organisation is publicly accountable; monitoring and evaluation processes in place; accounting and record keeping practices; and any other relevant matters. 168. If the Commissioner approves the charitable organisation as one whose volunteers may be exempted from interest on their student loans, it will be added to the approved charitable organisation list. It may then apply for the suspension of interest on the student loans of its volunteers, if the criteria are satisfied. 169. The application to suspend interest on a particular volunteer’s student loan must be made to the Commissioner by submitting a letter, on the charitable organisation’s letterhead, stating: the volunteer’s name; the volunteer’s IRD number; the length of time the volunteer will spend overseas; the specific tasks and duties the volunteer will undertake; and details of any payments the volunteer may receive for the work. 170. For more information about the interest-free student loan concession, see Inland Revenue’s website. 27 Māori organisations 171. Many Māori organisations, including marae, are registered charities with obligations, advantages and tax treatment consistent with charities generally. However, additional specific rules should be noted. 172. In addition to charitable purposes including the relief of poverty, the advancement of education or religion, or any other matter beneficial to the community, the definition of charitable purpose (s YA 1 of the ITA and s 5 of the Charities Act) also provides that a marae will have a charitable purpose where its: physical structure is on land that is a Māori reservation referred to in Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 | Māori Land Act 1993; and funds are used only for the administration and maintenance of the land and structure of the marae or for a purpose that is a charitable purpose (s YA 1 of the ITA and s 5(2)(b) of the Charities Act). 173. The definitions of charitable purpose also provide that the public benefit requirement for charitable purposes will not be defeated simply because beneficiaries or members are related by blood (s YA 1 of the ITA and s 5(2)(a) of the Charities Act). 174. Māori organisations can receive many types of payment such as subscriptions, grants, subsidies, donations, koha, fees, raffle money and trading profits from selling assets. Most of these income types are taxed under general taxation principles, with some specific treatment. For more information, see Inland Revenue’s factsheet Payments and Gifts in the Māori Community (IR278). 28 27 Inland Revenue, Charitable organisations and the student loan scheme | Ngā whakahaere kaupapa atawhai me te kaupapa pūtea taurewa ākonga (webpage). 28 Inland Revenue, IR278 – Non-profit groups | Ngā Roopu Kore Moni Hua: Payments and gifts in the Māori community (December 2015) (publication). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 20 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT 175. Further information about, for example, the treatment of koha and Māori donee organisations generally is in Part 2 of this Operational Statement. Charitable registration of a marae on land that is a Māori reservation 176. To register as a charity with Charities Services, a marae on land that is a Māori reservation referred to in Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 | Māori Land Act 1993 should provide Charities Services with: the Māori reservation location (block name and/or number or Māori Land Court order or Gazette notice relating to the setting apart of land as a Māori reservation); a copy of its charter (drawn up by the reservation trustees), if available; any other governing document such as rules, a trust deed or constitution; details (such as names, positions, addresses and dates of birth) of the trustees of the Māori reservation; information about the marae such as who is part of the marae (such as iwi, hapū, whānau, church, wider community or other specific groups); and details of the activities of the marae (such as providing facilities for hui, whānau gatherings, wānanga, community gatherings and meetings; organising events such as cultural, sporting, local community, fundraising and educational events; running programmes such as training, social or health services; running events to promote religious beliefs; running language or cultural groups; holding tangihanga and unveilings; looking after urupā; and any other specific activities). Registration of Māori entities under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957 177. Many Māori organisations with charitable purposes, such as Māori private training establishments and certain hapū and iwi organisations, seek incorporation as a board under the Charitable Trusts Act (see from \[183\]). Trusts established under Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 | the Māori Land Act 1993 178. Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 | the Māori Land Act 1993 was established to assist in retaining Māori land (comprising Māori customary land and Māori freehold land) in Māori ownership. Five types of land-holding trusts can be established under this Act, and they are generally designed to limit the further fragmentation of Māori land titles by limiting certain rights of succession. 179. The trustees of any trust established under Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 may apply to the court for an order that they hold any part of the trust’s income on trust for such charitable purposes as are specified in the court order (s 245 of Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993). 180. Where the income derived by the trustees is deemed to be income derived by trustees in trust for charitable purposes under s 24B of the Māori Trust Boards Act 1955, they meet the principal requirement for registration under the Charities Act (s 13 of the Charities Act) and, if registered under the Charities Act, the income could be exempt under s CW 41 or s CW 42 of the ITA. Deregistration for marae on land that is a Māori reservation established under Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 181. A deregistered charity will generally be required to pay tax on the net assets it retains (deregistration tax). For more information about deregistration, see \[202\]. 182. For the purposes of deregistration tax, in the context of a marae on Māori reservation land, the value of the land and improvements on the land will be excluded from the net asset calculation (s HR 12 of the ITA). Charitable trusts 183. Section HC 13 defines a charitable trust, for the purposes of the “trust rules” (also a defined term – see s YA 1), as a trust: for which all income derived or accumulated, in the current or any earlier income year, is held for charitable purposes; and for which any income derived in the current year is exempt income under s CW 41(1) or s CW 42(1). 184. The charitable trust may or may not be incorporated under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957. However, to be eligible for an income tax exemption under s CW 41 or s CW 42, the charitable trust must also be a registered charity under the Charities Act. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 21 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT 185. Under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957, a charitable society or the trustees of a charitable trust may be incorporated as a board and included on the register of charitable trusts the Companies Office maintains. As with any charity, these boards may make profits on their trading activities, but the profits must be used for their charitable purposes and cannot be distributed to members. Boards incorporated under the Charitable Trusts Act may be eligible for favourable tax treatment if they meet certain requirements. For example, the charitable income tax exemptions (ss CW 41 and CW 42) require a charity to be a tax charity, which may require registration under the Charities Act. Similarly, charities must be registered to access donee status unless the Commissioner approves their donee status where they have benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes (see s LD 3(3) and Part 2 of this Operational Statement). 186. Generally, trustees of a trust who derive assessable income for a tax year must file a tax return and provide certain additional information (see s 59BA(1) of the TAA). However, trustees of a trust incorporated as a board under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957 are relieved of the requirement to include some of the information with the return (s 59BA(3) (c) of the TAA). Additionally, from 30 March 2021, trustees of a trust that is a registered charity are also relieved of this requirement (s 59BA(3)(d) of the TAA). 187. Special rules regarding distributions and settlor liability apply to charitable trusts. 188. While many charitable trusts will not have “beneficiaries” and will instead use funds for charitable purposes, the s YA 1 definition of charitable purposes is broad enough to include trusts that have beneficiaries. Distributions of amounts that are not beneficiary income are exempt income under ss HC 20 and CW 53. Distributions of beneficiary income, where that income is exempt income of the charitable trust under s CW 41 or s CW 42, is exempt income of the beneficiary. 189. A settlor can be liable, as agent of the trustee, for the tax liabilities of the trustee where no trustee is resident in New Zealand. However, this rule does not apply to settlors of charitable trusts (s HC 29(4)). This rule ensures residents who make donations to charitable trusts that have non-resident trustees are not liable for any tax liabilities of the trust. 190. Charitable trusts are subject to the provisions of the Trusts Act 2019 that set out mandatory and default duties of the trustees. However, the one duty that will not affect trustees of Charitable Trusts is the requirement that trustees disclose basic trust information to beneficiaries (s 50(2) of the Trusts Act 2019). 191. For more information about the tax treatment of charitable trusts, see Interpretation Statement IS 18/01: Taxation of trusts – income tax. 29 Non-resident charities Overview 192. To be eligible for registration by Charities Services, a non-resident charity must be either: established in New Zealand; or have a very strong connection to New Zealand. 193. To be registered with Charities Services, charities do not have to be incorporated. However, if a non-resident charity is incorporated, it must be incorporated under New Zealand law to be considered “established in New Zealand.” For example, a non-resident charity that is a company must be incorporated in New Zealand under the Companies Act 1993. 194. If a non-resident charity is not incorporated under New Zealand law, it can be registered with Charities Services if it has a very strong connection to New Zealand. For more information about how Charities Services determines whether a “very strong connection to New Zealand” exists, see the Charities Services website. 30 195. Non-resident charities that cannot be registered by Charities Services may still apply to the Commissioner for an exemption from income tax on their non-business income as a “tax charity” (s CW 41(5)(c)). The organisation must fulfil the Commissioner’s required criteria as set out in the guidelines for being a non-resident tax charity. 31 29 Inland Revenue, Interpretation Statement: IS 18/01 - Taxation of trusts - income tax (June 2018), at 86–89 (publication). 30 Charities Services, International charities and activities (webpage). 31 Inland Revenue, Tax exemptions for non-resident charities | Ngā aweretanga tāke mō ngā kaupapa atawhai kainoho-tāwāhi (webpage). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 22 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT Guidelines for non-resident charities applying to be a tax charity 196. When making an application to the Commissioner to be recognised as a tax charity, under s CW 41(5)(c), the non-resident charity must: produce evidence of having been declined registration by Charities Services due to an insufficient connection to New Zealand; or explain why it considers it would not be able to be registered with Charities Services. 197. A non-resident charity seeking to be recognised as a tax charity must satisfy the Commissioner that it: is not resident in New Zealand; carries out all of its charitable purposes overseas; is not carried on for and does not apply any funds towards the private profit of any individuals; and is recognised as being charitable by one or more overseas charities regulators or tax authorities. 198. Applications to be recognised as a tax charity should include: the non-resident charity’s constitution, trust deed or other governing documents; evidence of incorporation or legal registration in its (main) country of residence; certification or a letter confirming it has charitable status or registration with one or more overseas charities regulators or tax authorities; information about the work it does, which may include annual reports, brochures, articles, testimonials or relevant websites; and evidence Charities Services declined registration because it had an insufficient connection to New Zealand or an explanation of why it believes it is not able to register with Charities Services. 199. If the Commissioner approves the non-resident charity as a tax charity, it may be eligible for the non-business (passive) income exemption under s CW 41. The non-resident charity will not be eligible for the business income exemption under s CW 42. 200. If a non-resident charity is not exempt from New Zealand tax under the provisions of s CW 41, it may be eligible for relief from taxation in New Zealand under a double tax agreement between New Zealand and the country of residence of the non-resident charity. For more information on double tax agreements generally, see the Inland Revenue website. 32 201. Application by a non-resident charity wishing to be recognised by the Commissioner as a tax charity should be sent, along with supporting information, to: Inland Revenue, PO Box 1147, Palmerston North Central, Palmerston North 4440; or charities.queries@ird.govt.nz. Tax implications of ceasing to be a tax charity or deregistration 202. A charity’s tax obligations, including income tax, RWT-exemption, FBT-exclusion and donee organisation status may all be affected if the charity ceases to be a tax charity or is deregistered (see \[210\]–\[221\]). Additionally, a charity may be subject to a “deregistration tax” when it ceases to be a tax charity or is deregistered. 203. A charity is deregistered when it is removed from the register held by Charities Services (s 32 of the Charities Act). A charity ceases to be a tax charity when it no longer meets the requirements in the definition of tax charity in the ITA, see \[23\]. 204. A charity that has ceased to be a tax charity or been deregistered needs to determine whether any new tax obligations apply and from what date. Date from which tax obligations will apply 205. Where a charity ceases to be a tax charity, tax obligations will arise from the date that it ceases to qualify as a tax charity. 206. Where a charity is deregistered, when tax obligations arise depends on why the charity was deregistered (see Table 2) 32 Inland Revenue, Double tax agreements (DTAs) | Ngā whakaaetanga tāke taurua (DTA) (webpage). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 23 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT Table 2: When tax obligations arise following deregulation Situation triggering deregistrationDate tax obligations will apply Voluntary deregistration (provided the charity does not come within any of following three situations) From the date the charity voluntarily deregistered. Failure to file annual returns with Charities Services as required (provided the charity has otherwise always kept to its rules held on the Charities Register) From the date the charity is deregistered or all appeals are final or exhausted, whichever comes later. Failure to keep to its rules held on the Charities Register (after an initial period of compliance) From the date the charity stopped keeping to its rules (unless it is otherwise exempt). Failure to keep to its rules held on the Charities Register from the time of registration As if the charity were never a tax charity. Income tax rates applicable after ceasing to be a tax charity or upon deregistration 207. If a charity is incorporated under the Incorporated Societies Act 2022 (or during that Act’s transition period, under the Incorporated Societies Act 1908) or the Companies Act 1993, it is considered to be a company for income tax purposes. If it does not qualify for a tax exemption, its income is taxed at the company rate. 208. A charity that operates as a trust, including trusts incorporated under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957, that are not tax- exempt are liable for tax on the trustee’s income. For more information, see the Inland Revenue website 33 and Trusts and Estates Income Tax Rules (IR288). 34 209. A charity that is not incorporated under a specific Act and is not entitled to a tax exemption is liable for income tax at the same rate as an individual taxpayer. However, it does not qualify for any of the tax credits individual taxpayers can claim. Income tax on net assets of deregistered charity (“deregistration tax”) 210. A tax applies on the current market value of accumulated net assets of a deregistered charity if it does not dispose of or transfer its net assets for a charitable purpose within one year of deregistration. The value of the net assets retained is treated as income unless the deregistered charity qualifies for another tax exemption. The income tax on the value of net assets is commonly referred to as the “deregistration tax” (ss CV 17 and HR 12). 211. Deregistration tax applies unless a deregistered charity has within one year from its end date (the day of final decision, s HR 12(7)): re-registered as a charity; or disposed of or transferred its net assets: –to a registered charity; or –for charitable purposes; or –as set out in its rules while it was on the Charities Register. 212. A deregistered charity that has not taken these actions needs to include the current market value of its net assets on deregistration in its income tax return (unless it is exempt under a provision other than s CW 41 or s CW 42). 213. The income tax return that must include the value of the deregistered charity’s net assets is the return for the period that includes the day one year after the end date. 214. For example, if a charity voluntarily deregisters on 1 November 2020 and keeps some assets, it needs to include the value of those assets in its 2022 income tax return. This is because 2 November 2021 (the day one year after the end date) is in the 2022 income year. 33 Inland Revenue, Trusts and tax residency | Ngā rōpū kaitiaki me ngā kainoho tāke (website). 34 Inland Revenue, IR288 - Trusts and estates income tax rules (March 2021) (publication). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 24 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT When a charity will not be liable for deregistration tax 215. A deregistered charity is not liable to pay the deregistration tax if: the charity was involuntarily deregistered by Charities Services or the Charities Registration Board before 1 April 2015 (ss 31 and 32(a)–(e) of the Charities Act); the charity was voluntarily deregistered before 14 April 2014; the charity was deregistered after 1 April 2019 and had net assets worth $10,000 or less one year after its end date (s HR 12(2)(c)); or the deregistered charity was a company and was deregistered because its shares were disposed of and the disposal was for market value consideration (s HR 12(2)(b)).

The value of the net assets of a deregistered charity is determined by the current market value of the total assets of the charity at its end date, less the current market value of the total liabilities of the charity on its end date (s HR 12(3)). 217. Market value refers in general terms to the price that an asset would be sold for in an arm’s length transaction. This is usually determined from market-based evidence by appraisal. In two situations valuing assets and liabilities at market value is not required: Where certain assets (premises, plant, equipment and trading stock) have a prescribed valuation method in the deregistration rules. That value should be used for the purposes of the net assets calculation. If the deregistered charity has assets and liabilities not subject to the prescribed valuation method, and it valued these assets and liabilities at fair value to comply with Public Benefit Entity International Not-for-Profit Accounting Standard 17, then the fair value should be used for the purposes of the net asset calculation. 218. Not included in the value of net assets are (s HR 12(3)): assets disposed of or transferred for charitable purposes or in accordance with the charity’s rules and within one year of the end date; assets received from the Crown to settle a Treaty of Waitangi claim; assets received from the Crown to settle a claim under the Māori Fisheries Act 2004; marae land and improvements as defined in Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 | the Māori Land Act 1993; assets, other than money, that were gifted or bequeathed to the charity when it was exempt from income tax; and in some circumstances, assets that are shares in companies. 219. Large charities sometimes operate as part of a group, with charitable entities holding equity investments in other registered charities. If a parent entity and one or more members of a charitable group are deregistered at the same time, the value of the parent’s shares in the subsidiary is ignored for the purposes of calculating the parent’s income under the deregistration tax rules (s HR 12(3)(d)). 220. The net assets include the value of depreciable property and financial arrangements held at the time of deregistration. 221. For examples of how to calculate net assets (including how to value depreciable property and financial arrangements), see Charitable and Donee Organisations (IR255). 35 Organisations that run businesses for charity and deregistration tax 222. An entity that is not a registered charity but derived exempt income under s CW 42 before 1 April 2020 and subsequently ceases to meet the requirements for exemption under s CW 42 (for example because it failed to register as a charity by 31 March 2020) is subject to the deregistration tax. RWT-exempt status when a charity is deregistered 223. When a charity is deregistered, it will have RWT obligations unless it qualifies for a different exemption from RWT (s 32E(k) of the TAA). Examples of other RWT exemptions include where a charity is a community housing entity (s CW 42B), an amateur sports promoter (s CW 46), a body promoting scientific or industrial research (s CW 49) or a community trust (s CW 52). 35 Inland Revenue, IR255 - Charitable and donee organisations (December 2021) at 37–39 (publication). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 25 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT 224. The deregistered charity needs to notify its bank and anyone else that pays it interest or dividends that its RWT-exempt status has ended. 225. The deregistered charity’s status is updated to “cancelled” on the RWT-exemption register the Commissioner maintains. FBT-exclusion when a charity is deregistered 226. If the deregistered charity does not come within the definition of a charitable organisation (s YA 1), and it remains operating and provides fringe benefits to its employees, then it is liable for FBT (s CX 25). Donee organisation status when a charity is deregistered 227. When a registered charity is deregistered, it will not lose its donee organisation status, provided it has a philanthropic, benevolent or cultural purpose and it applies to the Commissioner to maintain donee status on this basis. 228. If it does not have one of these purposes and had only a charitable purpose, different rules apply. It will keep its donee status up to the date it is removed from the Charities Register or when all appeals of the decision to deregister are final or exhausted, whichever is the later. 229. A deregistered charity that had only charitable purposes will lose its eligibility to issue donation tax receipts, meaning that donors to the entity will not be able to claim tax credits or donation deductions for donations made to the entity during the period of deregistration (s LD 3). For more information, see Part 2 of this Operational Statement. More information on consequences of deregistration 230. For further guidance about the consequences of deregistration, see: Charitable and Donee Organisations (IR255); 36 “New rules for deregistered charities”; 37 “Tax on net assets of deregistered charities: Remedial amendment”; 38 and “Charities and donee organisations”. 39 Administrative matters 231. Under the Inland Revenue Acts, charities are required to meet certain administrative tax requirements, for example, obtaining an IRD number (if required, as described below), keeping records, and self-assessing each year whether the charity meets the income tax exemption requirements and/or the requirements for other tax treatments. 232. An IRD number is required if the charity: has any non-exempt income; is a registered charity (registered charities are automatically RWT exempt and the RWT-exemption register operates by IRD number rather than name); has obligations for GST, PAYE, RWT, NRWT or FBT; or is a donee organisation. 233. If a registered charity wishes to change its legal structure, it can do so by filling in an update details form and providing its new rules to Charities Services. The new entity can keep its existing Charities Services registration number. For more information about updating details, see the Charities Services website. 40 However, being a new legal entity, it must obtain a new IRD number. 234. Each tax charity must make a self-assessment each year on whether all of its income is exempt. The Commissioner can challenge a charity’s decision about the availability of an income tax exemption through the Inland Revenue disputes process. 235. A tax charity must comply with usual GST, PAYE and FBT return filing requirements, if applicable. 36 Inland Revenue, IR255 - Charitable and donee organisations (December 2021) at 35–40. 37 Inland Revenue, “New Rules for Deregistered Charities”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 26, No 7 (August 2014) at 65–69 (publication). 38 Inland Revenue, “Tax on Net Assets of Deregistered Charities: Remedial Amendments”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 30, No 5 (June 2018) at 107–108 (publication). 39 Inland Revenue, “Charities and Donee Organisations”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31, No 4 (May 2019) at 132–137 (publication). 40 Charities Services, Update charity details (webpage). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 26 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT Record-keeping requirements 236. Charities have information and reporting obligations under the Charities Act (if registered) and under reporting standards set by the External Reporting Board (XRB), the independent Crown entity responsible for developing and issuing accounting standards. Charities must also comply with the record-keeping requirements of the Inland Revenue Acts, including the usual record-keeping requirements under s 22 of the TAA if the charity is in business and under s 75 of the GST Act if the charity is GST registered. These sections require a taxpayer to keep business and GST records in New Zealand and in either English or te reo Māori. 237. Section 22 of the TAA requires a charity that carries on a business in New Zealand to keep sufficient business records to enable the Commissioner to ascertain whether tax is payable and if so, in what amount, and all other tax matters relating to that business. These records should be kept for a minimum of seven years, even if the charity ceases operating. 238. Section 75 of the GST Act requires generally that every person registered for GST must keep records, including books of account (whether contained in a manual, mechanical, or electronic format) recording receipts or payments or income or expenditure, and also includes vouchers, bank statements, invoices, tax invoices, credit notes, debit notes, receipts and such other documents as are necessary to verify the entries in any such books of account. 239. Charities should keep sufficient records to calculate any tax liability and/or to demonstrate eligibility for tax exemptions or concessions (s 32 of the TAA). Depending on the entity and its activities, this may include receipt and payment account books, bank statements, invoices (including GST tax invoices), receipts and wage records for employees and donation tax credit receipts. 240. Section 58 of the TAA provides that every gift-exempt body must, when notified by the Commissioner, furnish a return of its funds derived or received in any tax year and showing the source and application of those funds, together with such other particulars as the Commissioner may require. 241. A “gift-exempt body” is defined in s 3(1) of the TAA (for purposes of s 32 of the TAA) and means: (a) any society, institution, association, organisation, trust, or fund specifically named in Schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007; or (b) any other person who has RWT-exempt status following an application made under section 32E(2)(k) or (l) in relation to a tax year in which they have that status. 242. For further information on record keeping, see Retention of Business Records in Electronic Formats, Application to Store Records Offshore and Keeping Records in Languages other than English or Te Reo Māori (SPS 21/02). 41 Alterations to a charity’s founding documents 243. In the past, the Commissioner suggested charities include clauses in their founding documents that restrict the alteration of certain clauses without prior approval from the Commissioner. The relevant clauses were those defining the charitable purposes or objects, relating to personal advantage, regarding rule changes and regarding winding up. 244. The Commissioner no longer gives prior approval to clause changes and recommends charities remove from their founding documents any such requirement for the Commissioner’s approval. 245. To facilitate this, the Commissioner suggests an amendment to a charity’s alterations clause to include, for example, “No addition to or alteration or removal from the rules shall be made if it detracts from the charitable nature of the organisation or allows private pecuniary benefits to any individual(s)”. 246. Charities Services must be notified of any change to the rules of a registered charity within three months after the effective date of the change. In these cases, the charity must provide Charities Services with a copy of the amendment to its rules. Charities can also provide a copy of the minutes of the meeting (or other record of the decision) specifying the change and effective date of the change. 247. If a charity is incorporated (under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957, Incorporated Societies Act 2022 or Companies Act 1993), it may also have obligations to provide notice of changes to its rules to other authorities (for example, the Companies Office). 41 Inland Revenue, Standard Practice Statement SPS 21/02 - Retention of business records in electronic formats, application to store records offshore and keeping records in languages other than English or te reo Māori (May 2021) (publication). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 27 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT Binding ruling applications 248. An entity may apply to the Commissioner for a binding ruling (which includes private rulings and short-process rulings) under part 5A of the TAA. A private ruling is the Commissioner’s interpretation of how a tax law applies to a particular arrangement, person or item of property. This can include, for example, a private ruling in relation to whether certain types of income derived are exempt from tax under s CW 41 and/or s CW 42 or in relation to the entity’s status (for example, whether it is a non-profit body for the purposes of the GST Act). 249. If the entity receives a private or short-process ruling under part 5A of the TAA, the Charities Act requires that the entity be treated as having satisfied certain of the essential requirements for qualifying as a charitable entity under s 13(2)–(3) of the Charities Act (also referred to in this Operational Statement as a registered charity). 250. The Commissioner has recently entered into a memoranda of understanding with the Department of Internal Affairs to coordinate how their overlapping roles with respect charities will operate. 42 251. For more information about binding rulings, see the Inland Revenue website. 43 Other disclosure and reporting regimes Charities that are foreign trusts for income tax purposes 252. New Zealand law considers that a trust is not an entity, but a description of an equitable obligation the law imposes on a person holding property to deal with that property in a certain way, namely, for the benefit of beneficiaries or a charitable purpose. A “foreign trust” for income tax purposes is a trust established overseas or in New Zealand but where no settlor is resident in New Zealand at any time (s HC 11). 253. A foreign trust that is also a registered charity was exempt from the foreign trust disclosure rules until 31 March 2019. From 1 April 2019, however, a foreign trust that is also a registered charity is subject to the foreign trust disclosure rules that require disclosure of some information that is not collected under the Charities Act. This includes identifying particulars and contact details for settlors, trustees and beneficiaries (s 59B of the TAA). 254. Where the Commissioner becomes aware of potential money laundering or terrorism financing activity by a charity that is a foreign trust, the information disclosure rules in part C of schedule 7 of the TAA (disclosures to certain agencies for certain purposes) apply. The Commissioner is permitted to share information relating to the registration (or absence of registration) of a foreign trust with the Department of Internal Affairs and New Zealand Police. 255. For more information about foreign trusts see: Special report - Foreign Trust Disclosure Rules; 44 Tax Information Bulletin Article - “Foreign trust disclosure rules”; 45 and Inland Revenue website - Foreign trusts with New Zealand resident trustees. 46 Charities and international financial reporting obligations 256. The United States Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) and the OECD initiated Common Reporting Standard (CRS) for automatic exchange of financial account information are financial reporting regimes introduced to combat and prevent tax evasion by persons that invest outside their jurisdiction of tax residence. 257. Part 11B of the TAA gives effect to and implements FATCA and the CRS in New Zealand law. 258. Charities may have obligations under one or both of FATCA and CRS. These obligations could apply because the charity is a New Zealand financial institution or because the charity holds an account with a New Zealand financial institution. The term “financial institution” includes obvious financial businesses such as banks and insurers, but it can also include some trusts and other entities that handle investments. This definition is broad, so will include certain charities. 42 Inland Revenue, Department of Internal Affairs (DIA) | Te Tari Taiwhenua (DIA): ”Supplying of information in respect of charitable entities” (webpage). 43 Inland Revenue, What is a binding ruling?

Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 28 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT 259. New Zealand and the United States have entered into a FATCA memorandum of understanding (FATCA MoU 47 ) that provides the following organisations are not financial institutions for FATCA purposes: organisations incorporated under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957; organisations registered under the Charities Act; and donee organisations as defined in the ITA. 260. Therefore, under the FATCA MoU, these types of entities do not have FATCA due diligence and reporting obligations. Instead, if they hold accounts with New Zealand financial institutions, they are required to respond to due diligence queries from those institutions about their FATCA status. 261. The CRS takes a different approach to that under FATCA and does not offer a similar exclusion from the definition of financial institution for certain charities and donee organisations. This means such entities need to consider whether they are financial institutions with CRS due diligence and reporting obligations (even if excluded from FATCA requirements). 262.

Control over activities (4) For the purposes of subsection (2)(c), for an income year, a person is treated as having some control over the activities, and as being able to direct or divert amounts from the activities if, in the tax year, they are described in section CW 42(5)(a) and (b) and (6) (Charities: business income). No control (5) For the purposes of subsection (2)(c), a person described in section CW 42(7)(a) and (b) is not treated as having some control merely because of the factors in section CW 42(7)(a) and (b).

CW 43 Charitable bequests Exempt income (1) An amount of income derived by a deceased’s executor or administrator is exempt income to the extent to which the requirements of subsections (2) and (3) are met, having regard to all relevant matters including— (a) the terms of the deceased’s will, including the rights of annuitants, legatees, and other beneficiaries; and (b) the nature and extent of the debts and liabilities of, and other charges against, the estate and their likely effect on the income and assets available for distribution to the beneficiaries; and (c) the shares and prospective shares of the beneficiaries in the income and assets of the estate. Gift to charity (2) The first requirement is that the amount arises from or is attributable to assets of the estate that have been left to a trust, society, or institution of a kind referred to in section CW 41(1). Exempt in hands of charity (3) The second requirement is that the amount, if derived by the trust, society, or institution or by a business carried on by, or for, or for the benefit of it, would be exempt income under section CW 41 or CW 42. Timing of registration as charitable entity (4) An amount of income derived by a deceased’s executor or administrator that is derived during the period beginning on the deceased’s date of death and ending at the end of the income year that follows the income year in which the deceased died is not prevented from being exempt income under this section merely because the trustee or trustees of the trust, the society, or the institution is not, or are not, a tax charity.

The purpose of Operational Statement OS 22/04: Charities and Donee Organisations is to assist entities in the not-for- profit sector to understand their tax obligations and available tax benefits. This statement is published in two parts: Part 1 discusses charities and Part 2 discusses donee organisations. 2. New Zealand’s not-for-profit sector makes an important contribution to the wellbeing of New Zealanders. One way the Government supports the sector is by providing favourable tax treatments for the sector. These come in various forms, depending on the characteristics of the entity involved; for example, for tax charities - various income tax exemptions for the business and non-business income, and for charitable organisations - resident withholding tax (RWT) exemptions, fringe benefit tax (FBT) exclusions, goods and services tax (GST) concessions and interest-free student loans for overseas volunteers of approved charitable organisations. Donee organisations that meet the definition of tax charity and/or charitable organisation may qualify for these favourable tax treatments, discussed in more detail in Operational Statement OS 22/04: Charities and Donee Organisations: Part 1 Charities. 3. For charities that have donee status, donors may receive favourable tax treatments such as donation tax credits, payroll giving tax credits and income tax gift deductions. 4. Following brief comments about where to get more information, the application date of this statement, and descriptions of donee organisations and donee status, Part 2 provides guidance to entities wanting to become donee organisations or that are already donee organisations. It discusses: the types of entity that can become a donee organisation, including registered charities, entities requiring the Commissioners approval as a donee organisation, donee organisations by definition and donee organisations approved by Parliament (see from \[15\]); tax benefits including tax credits and gift deductions for charitable or other public benefit gifts made by donors and FBT concessions (see from \[108\]); 5. Part 2 also addresses other administrative tax matters relevant to donee organisations, including record-keeping (see \[153\]), self-assessment and notification requirements (see \[160\]), binding rulings (see \[163\]), winding up a donee organisation (see \[165\]), and deregistration (see \[167\]). 6. Part 1 of the Operational Statement explains what a charity is, including in the context of the ITA and the Charities Act 2005 (Charities Act). Part 1 also addresses the relationship between Inland Revenue and Charities Services | Ngā Ratonga Kaupapa Atawhai (which is part of Te Tari Taiwhenua | Department of Internal Affairs), what charitable purposes are and the different tax concessions that may be available. It also sets out administrative tax matters, implications of deregistration and special rules for certain entity types. 7. Topics relevant to Part 2 that are covered in Part 1 are cross-referenced. Further information 8. The Inland Revenue dedicated email address for inquiries about charities and donee organisations is charities.queries@ird.govt.nz 9. More information about donee organisations is on the Inland Revenue website. 1 All references whether to webpages, reports or other items are listed with their full URL in the References at the end of this document. Application date of this statement 10. This Operational Statement (Parts 1 and 2) will apply from 10 October 2022. 1 Inland Revenue, Donee organisations needing to register with Charities Services | Ngā whakahaere whiwhi takoha me rēhita ki ngā Ratonga Kaupapa Atawhai (webpage). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 44 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT What is a donee organisation and donee status 11. “Donee organisation” is defined in s YA 1 as “an entity described in section LD 3(2) (Meaning of charitable or other public benefit gift) or listed in schedule 32 (Recipients of charitable or other public benefit gifts)”. 12. Section LD 3(2) refers to “a society, institution, association, organisation, or trust that is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of an individual, and whose funds are applied wholly or mainly to charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand” among others. 13. An organisation that meets the definition of donee organisation is referred to as having “donee status”. 14. The main advantage of being a donee organisation is the benefit it brings to the donors who make charitable or other public benefit gifts of $5 or more. Individuals who make such gifts may qualify for tax benefits (such as donation tax credits or payroll giving tax credits), while companies and Māori authorities can qualify for tax benefits (such as income tax gift deductions). These tax benefits are subject to maximum limits. Types of donee organisations 15. To qualify for donee status, an entity must satisfy at least one of the descriptions of a donee organisation set out in s LD 3(2) or be listed in schedule 32 as a recipient of charitable or other public benefit gifts. 16. The four types of donee organisation are: most entities registered with Charities Services (see from \[17\]); entities with benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes (not registered with Charities Services) approved by the Commissioner (see from \[25\]); entities that automatically qualify by satisfying specific definitions (see from \[93\]); and entities that apply funds for other than charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes in New Zealand, approved by Parliament and listed in schedule 32 (see from \[96\]). Donee organisations registered with Charities Services 17. Part 1 of this Operational Statement describes the function of Charities Services with regards to charities and its interrelationship with Inland Revenue. 18. From 1 April 2020, an entity with charitable purposes must register as a charity with Charities Services, if eligible to do so, to obtain donee status. 19. Eligibility criteria for registering as a charity with Charities Services is explained in Part 1 of this Operational Statement. The Charities Services website contains the Charities Register listing all registered charities. 2 20. For a registered charity to qualify for and maintain donee status, it must apply its funds “wholly or mainly” to charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes within New Zealand (s LD 3(2)). In administration of this requirement, the Commissioner uses a “safe harbour” basis of 75% or more satisfying wholly or mainly for qualifying for donee status. To maintain donee status, an entity may calculate its percentage by using a rolling three-year average. However, if in any year it applies less than 50% to these purposes, it needs to notify Inland Revenue immediately (see from \[54\]). 21. Accordingly, entities registering with Charities Services are required to indicate if they intend to receive donations and the percentage of the entity’s funds that will be applied towards carrying out charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes overseas. If the registered charity indicates it intends to receive donations, then Inland Revenue uses the percentage information to determine whether the entity meets the “wholly or mainly” requirement of s LD 3(2) and is eligible for donee status without the registered charity making a separate application to the Commissioner. 22. If the registered charity meets the “wholly or mainly” requirement, it is published on the Commissioner’s list of approved donee organisations. 3 It is the responsibility of a donee organisation to advise Inland Revenue as soon as they cease meeting the “wholly or mainly” requirement (see from \[160\]). 23. Entities established for charitable purposes after 1 April 2020 and not registered with Charities Services will not be published on the Commissioner’s approved donee organisation list. The exceptions to this are entities that obtain the Commissioner’s approval (see from \[29\]) or, in a rare case, Parliament might approve a donee organisation that is not a registered charity (see from \[96\]). 2 Charities Services, The Charities Register | Te Rēhita Kaupapa Atawhai (webpage). 3 Inland Revenue, Commissioner’s list of approved donee organisations (webpage). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 45 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT 24. For more information, see Charitable and Donee Organisations (IR255). 4 Part 1 of this Operational Statement provides information about charities and their tax obligations. Entities requiring the Commissioner’s approval for donee status 25. Entities not eligible to register as a charitable entity with Charities Services may still apply to the Commissioner for donee status if they meet the definition of donee organisation in s YA 1. This definition refers to entities described in s LD 3(2) and includes entities whose funds are applied for benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes (see from \[39\]). 26. Applications to the Commissioner for donee status should be made in writing (see from \[89\]). 27. If approved, these entities are placed on the Commissioner’s list of approved donee organisations. 5 This process is referred to as “obtaining donee status”. 28. Donee organisations have a responsibility to monitor and self-assess their donee status and to advise the Commissioner as soon as they cease to be eligible to be a donee organisation. This is so the Commissioner can remove the entity from the approved donee organisation list. Types of entities that can seek Commissioner’s approval for donee status 29. Four categories of entities are eligible for the Commissioner’s approval of donee status, each with slightly different requirements: a society, institution, association, organisation or trust (see from \[30\]); a public institution (see from \[67\]); a fund (see from \[69\]); and a public fund (see from \[84\]). Other specific requirements for each of these categories are explained below. Requirements for a society, institution, association, organisation or trust to obtain donee status 30. The first category eligible for the Commissioner’s approval of donee status includes a society, institution, association, organisation or trust. For an entity of this type to obtain donee status from the Commissioner under s LD 3(2)(a), it must not be eligible to be a registered charity with Charities Services (for example, because its purposes are not charitable, but rather are benevolent, philanthropic or cultural) and it must be able to satisfy the Commissioner that: it is a society, institution, association, organisation or trust; its funds are applied wholly or mainly to charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes within New Zealand; and it is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual. 31. It is the Commissioner’s view that it will be difficult for a sports organisation to show benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes. However, it may be possible for a sports organisation to have charitable purposes and thus become a donee organisation by first becoming a registered charity. 32. The following elements of these requirements are explained further: charitable purpose (see from \[34\]); benevolent purpose (see from \[39\]); philanthropic purpose (see from \[44\]); cultural purpose (see from \[47\]); “wholly or mainly” application of funds (see from \[49\]); and requirement of no private pecuniary profit (see from \[60\]). 33. The terms benevolent, philanthropic and cultural are not defined in the ITA. The Commissioner’s operational position regarding the definitions of these terms is based on New Zealand common law and, where New Zealand courts have not fully determined the definition, the decisions of other jurisdictions. 4 Inland Revenue, IR255: Charitable and donee organisations (December 2021) (publication). 5 Inland Revenue, Commissioner’s list of approved donee organisations (webpage). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 46 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT Charitable purpose 34. The definitions of “charitable purpose” in s 5 of the Charities Act and s YA 1 of the ITA are materially the same. Both definitions provide that charitable purpose includes “every charitable purpose, whether it relates to the relief of poverty, the advancement of education or religion, or any other matter beneficial to the community”. 35. A charity’s purpose (or purposes) must be of public benefit within the sense the law recognises as charitable. 6 This is assessed by considering the end that is advocated, the means promoted to achieve that end and the manner in which the cause is promoted. 7 36. Generally, the Commissioner will consider applications only where an entity has benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes (rather than charitable purposes). Where an entity has only charitable purposes (rather than benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes), the Commissioner cannot approve that entity as a donee organisation unless it is ineligible for registration with Charities Services. 37. For more on charitable purposes, see Part 1 of this Operational Statement. 38. Although distinctly defined, the meaning of “charitable purpose” and the meanings of “benevolent”, “philanthropic” or “cultural” purposes can overlap considerably as described below. Benevolent purpose 39. The meaning of benevolent differs from the meaning of charitable and, in its ordinary use, has a meaning wider than the word charitable. 8 Courts have found the meaning of benevolent to be so vague that it caused a trust for “charitable and benevolent” purposes to be void for uncertainty. Similarly, a bequest for “charitable or benevolent purposes” was found not be a charitable gift, due to the vagueness of meaning of “benevolent” permitting the possibility that all of the funds could be used for non-charitable, but benevolent, purposes. 9 40. However, s 61B of the Charitable Trusts Act 1957 now provides that where there are charitable purposes, the inclusion of non-charitable and invalid purposes does not invalidate a trust where the intention was to create a charitable trust. 41. Benevolence is not limited to the provision of money, housing, food, medicine or other basic elements. The provision of services to relieve distress may be benevolent, even if the services are not free. 10 42. An institution with the predominant purpose of making a profit for its owner will not have a benevolent purpose because it is not desiring to do good for others. 11 43. The promotion of sport and the relief of suffering by animals are not benevolent purposes. 12 Philanthropic purpose 44. Philanthropic purposes are more narrowly defined than benevolent purposes. While a benevolent purpose may be directed to the goodwill of a particular individual only, a philanthropic purpose indicates goodwill to humankind at large. 13 45. A philanthropic purpose relates to the promotion of the welfare of other human beings in general. 14 It is not limited to the provision of necessities. The provision of schools, libraries, public art galleries, museums, or free or subsidised concerts could be a philanthropic purpose. 15 6 A-G v Family First NZ \[2022\] NZSC 80 at \[10\] – \[12\], Re Greenpeace of NZ Inc \[2014\] NZSC 105, \[2015\] 1 NZLR 169 at \[3\]. 7 Greenpeace at \[76\]. 8 Re Knowles: Brown v Knowles \[1916\] NZLR 83 (CA) at 117, affirmed A-G v Brown \[1917\] AC 393 (PC); Molloy v CIR \[1981\] 1 NZLR 688 (CA) at 691. 9 Re Catherine Smith (deceased): Campbell v NZ Insurance Co Ltd \[1935\] NZLR 299 (CA) at 328, affirmed A-G v NZ Insurance Co Ltd \[1937\] NZLR 33 (PC). 10 Australian Council of Social Service Inc v Commissioner of Pay-roll Tax 85 ATC 4,235; Mines Rescue Board of New South Wales v FCT (2000) ATC 4,191; Trustees of the Indigenous Barristers’ Trust (2002) ATC 5,055; Northern Land Council v Commissioner of Taxes (NT) (2002) ATC 5,117. 11 Commissioner of Pay-Roll Tax v Cairnmillar Institute 92 ATC 4,307. 12 Northern NSW Football Ltd v Chief Commissioner of State Revenue \[2011\] NSWCA 51; FCT v Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Queensland Inc 92 ATC 4,441. 13 Re Knowles: Brown v Knowles at 128. 14 Re MacDuff \[1895-99\] All ER Rep 154; Residence “Joie de Vivre” Inc v Niagara Falls (City) \[1994\] OJ No 749; Rotary International v Commissioners of Customs & Excise \[1991\] VATTR 177; Hallé Concerts Society v Revenue and Customs Commissioners \[2016\] UKFTT 294; Wilson v Flowers 58 NJ 250 (1971). 15 Hallé Concerts Society v Revenue and Customs Commissioners \[2016\] UKFTT 294. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 47 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT 46. However, philanthropic purposes do not include purposes directed at the care and welfare of animals (other than human beings). 16 Cultural purpose 47. A cultural purpose relates to the training, development and refinement of mind, taste and manners. 17 An example of a cultural purpose is support for dramatic, theatrical, dance, choral or musical arts. 48. It is also the Commissioner’s view that the promotion of sport is not a cultural purpose. “Wholly or mainly” application of funds 49. To qualify for and maintain donee status under s LD 3(2)(a), an entity’s funds must be applied “wholly or mainly” to charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes within New Zealand. In this section of Part 2 of the Operational Statement, charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes are referred to collectively as “specified purposes”. 50. An entity applying to the Commissioner for donee status must indicate the percentage of its fund it anticipates applying to purposes other than for specified purposes within New Zealand. Provided the entity indicates this percentage is at or below 25%, the Commissioner will generally accept that the wholly or mainly requirement is satisfied (see the description of safe harbour from \[54\]). The donee organisation should subsequently assess its continuing compliance with this requirement each year. 51. The expression “funds are applied” suggests the: application of funds arises as a result of the organisation spending money or taking action to invest or set aside the money for future spending for some purpose or purposes; decision to accumulate funds has been made at the appropriate level in the organisation for decisions of that type according to its established management practices; for example, the trustees of a charitable trust resolving to set aside money in the trust’s on-call savings account pending a capital purchase; and decision to accumulate funds needs sufficient detail to be able to characterise that application of funds as advancing specified purposes within New Zealand. 52. The application of funds can occur on a continuing basis over the lifetime of the donee organisation. This is so, even though for administrative purposes to gauge compliance with the ongoing wholly or mainly requirement, it is more practicable to look at funds applied over a discrete period, such as a year, and then from year to year. 53. It is the specified purposes that must be “within New Zealand” not the application of funds. This means the location where funds are spent is not relevant. It is the objectively determined purpose sought to be achieved through the application of the funds that is important. For example, if funds were spent in Australia to produce an educational video to be used by a New Zealand charity in New Zealand, then the funds have been applied for charitable purposes in New Zealand. 18 Conversely, if funds are spent in New Zealand to produce an educational video for use in Australia, these funds are not applied for charitable purposes within New Zealand. 54. In terms of the requirement that the funds are applied wholly or mainly for specified purposes within New Zealand, the Commissioner will generally accept, without further enquiry, that a donee organisation meets the wholly or mainly requirement when it is within the administrative “safe harbour” percentage of 75% or more of its funds being applied for specified purposes within New Zealand. 55. An accepted three-step method to calculate the percentage of funds being applied for specified purposes within New Zealand is as follows: Step 1: Gather the charity’s “total funds”, using the statement of cash flows or statement of receipts and payments from the charity’s financial statements or performance reports. Step 2: Determine the amount of the charity’s “funds applied to specified purposes within New Zealand”. Step 3: Calculate the charity’s safe harbour percentage (step 1 amount divided by step 2 amount). 56. In determining step 2 it is necessary to decide whether money was spent, invested or set aside: entirely for specified purposes within New Zealand; 16 Kitchener-Waterloo and North Waterloo Humane Society v City of Kitchener \[1973\] 1 OR 490. 17 Molloy v CIR \[1981\] 1 NZLR 688 (CA). 18 Case T50 (1998) 18 NZTC 8,346 (TRA). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 48 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT entirely for purposes other than specified purposes within New Zealand; or for a combination of specified purposes within New Zealand and other purposes (apportion on a reasonable basis, including overheads and operating funds). 57. If a donee organisation fails to meet the safe harbour percentage (75%) in any year, the Commissioner will accept a revised calculation based on the current year and two preceding years. In such a case, the donee organisation can recalculate the percentage based on the cumulative total of its funds applied over the current and preceding two years. This allows some year-on-year variation for exceptional years. This is illustrated in Table 1. Table 1: Example of calculating safe harbour percentage allowing for year-on-year variation CategoryYear 1Year 2Year 3 Total funds ($)10,0005,0005,000 Funds applied to specified purposes within New Zealand ($) 9,0004,0003,000 Percentage of total funds applied to specified purposes within New Zealand 90%80%60% Cumulative total funds ($)10,00015,00020,000 Cumulative funds applied to specified purposes within New Zealand ($) 9,00013,00016,000 Cumulative percentage total funds applied to specified purposes within New Zealand 90%87%80% 58. For more information on these requirements, see Interpretation Statement IS 18/05: Income tax – donee organisations – meaning of wholly or mainly applying funds to specified purposes within New Zealand. 19 59. For more information on applying the safe harbour approach, including examples of how to determine when funds are applied to specified purposes within New Zealand and how to apply the rolling three-year cumulative approach that Inland Revenue will accept, see Interpretation Statement 18/05: Fact Sheet – applying the “safe harbour” approach (IS 18/05 FS). 20 Requirement of no private pecuniary profit 60. Another condition under the ITA for obtaining the Commissioner’s approval as a donee organisation is that the entity cannot be carried on for the private pecuniary profit of an individual. (This is also a requirement under the Charities Act for those entities that apply to become a registered charity.) This means a donee organisation’s funds must not be used to provide more than a minor personal benefit to its members, officers, trustees, related parties or associates. 61. Sometimes the stated aims or powers of an entity may allow benefits to members, but these benefits should be very limited. Examples of acceptable benefits are: newsletters that don’t require a subscription; voting rights to appoint officers of the entity; and benefits also available on the same terms to the public. 62. If any member can receive more than these benefits, then the entity is not eligible to be a donee organisation. Further, if a member can in any way influence (by way of their position or otherwise) the amount of any benefit they receive, the entity will not qualify as a donee organisation. 63. Examples of private or pecuniary profit to members include a member: being paid either beyond what is reasonable (more than the standard commercial rate) for their services or for services not actually provided; being reimbursed for expenses incurred on the donee organisation’s behalf beyond what is reasonable; transferring items to a donee organisation for a price that is above the arm’s length price; and earning interest on money lent to the donee organisation at higher than a usual commercial rate. 19 Inland Revenue, Interpretation Statement IS 18/05: Income tax – donee organisations – meaning of wholly or mainly applying funds to specified purposes in New Zealand (September 2018) (publication). 20 Inland Revenue, Interpretation Statement IS 18/05 FS (Fact Sheet): - Applying the ‘safe harbour’ approach (September 2018) (publication). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 49 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT 64. If an entity’s rules allow unrestricted benefits to members, a clause preventing this must be added before the Commissioner will grant donee organisation status. Examples of necessary clauses include: All income, benefit or advantage must be used to advance the charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes of the entity. No member of the entity or anyone associated with a member is allowed to take part in or influence any decision the entity makes in respect of payments to or on behalf of the member or associated person of any income, benefit or advantage. Any payments made must be for goods or services that advance the charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes and must be reasonable and relative to payments that would be made between unrelated parties. 65. Companies must also have clauses in their rules that: prevent distribution of dividends or payments to shareholders; or restrict current shareholders and the transfer and issue of shares to not-for-profit entities or trustees of a trust for charitable purposes. 66. For more information about the requirement of no private pecuniary profit, see also Charitable and Donee Organisations (IR255). 21 Requirements for a public institution to obtain donee status 67. The second category eligible for the Commissioner’s approval of donee status is a public institution. For a public institution to obtain donee status from the Commissioner under s LD 3(2)(b), it must be maintained exclusively for one or more of the following purposes within New Zealand: charitable; benevolent; philanthropic; or cultural. These purposes were described from \[34\]. 68. An institution is public if its purpose is to benefit an appreciable section of the community. 22 As a public institution, no funds can be applied for a private pecuniary profit (see from \[60\]). Requirements for a fund to obtain donee status 69. The third category eligible for the Commissioner’s approval of donee status is a fund. 70. For a fund to obtain donee status from the Commissioner under s LD 3(2)(c), the fund must be established and maintained: by a non-profit entity (being a society, institution, organisation or trust that is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of an individual); and exclusively for the purpose of providing money for one or more of the charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes within New Zealand of the non-profit entity. 71. The fund must become a registered charity if it is eligible to do so. If Charities Services determines that the fund is not eligible to register, the fund should provide evidence of this to the Commissioner, who may still consider the fund’s application for donee status if the fund satisfied all the requirements to become a donee organisation. It is the responsibility of the non-profit entity to monitor and self-assess the fund’s donee status and to advise the Commissioner as soon as the fund ceases to be eligible to be a donee organisation so that the Commissioner can remove the entity from the list of approved donee organisations. 72. The meanings of charitable, benevolent, philanthropic and cultural purposes were described from \[34\]. Defining a fund 73. In general terms, a “fund” in this context means an actual stock of money or assets set aside for charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes within New Zealand rather than a mere accounting expression. This includes, for example, a fund represented by a credit balance in a bank account. 21 Inland Revenue, Charitable and donee organisations (IR255) (December 2021) (publication). 22 Maughan v FCT (1942) 66 CLR 388 (HCA) at 397–398. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 50 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT Establishing the fund 74. A non-profit entity can set up such a fund by making book entries in its financial accounts, but the entries must be supported by an actual stock of money or other assets and show that the fund has been set up on a firm or permanent basis for the provision of money for charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes within New Zealand of the non-profit entity. Best practice suggests a fund is established and maintained through a combination of book entries and a document setting out terms for the establishment, operation and winding up of the fund (either as part of the rules of the non-profit entity or as a stand-alone document). 75. The fund must apply to the Commissioner to obtain donee status. In the application, it should be made clear that donee status is being sought for the fund (not for the non-profit entity). Using the fund’s money 76. The fund’s money must be used for, or used to provide money for, the charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes within New Zealand of the non-profit entity when it was established. Whether money is used for these purposes is determined by where those purposes are advanced (that is, within New Zealand) rather than where the fund’s money is spent. 77. The fund’s money may be used for purposes other than the provision of money for charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes within New Zealand, if those other purposes are subordinate or incidental to this purpose and are not independent purposes. 78. The non-profit entity may use the fund’s money to meet or reimburse costs it incurs in administering the fund. This includes a contribution to meet a reasonable share of the non-profit entity’s administration costs where such costs include the costs of administering the fund. 79. The non-profit entity may use the fund’s money to meet or reimburse costs it incurs advancing the non-profit entity’s purposes, provided these are exclusively charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes within New Zealand and are consistent with the purposes of the fund. Maintaining the fund 80. The fund must be maintained for the provision of money for charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes within New Zealand of the non-profit entity throughout its lifetime, including the disposal of the fund’s money or other assets if wound up. 81. Maintaining the fund requires maintaining the actual stock of money or other assets consistent with any book entries, as the fund’s actual stock of money or other assets at its establishment may change over time. Best practice suggests movements of the money or other assets in the fund are tracked and reported on in the non-profit entity’s financial accounts. 82. It may be preferable to keep the fund, in particular the fund’s money, separate from the non-profit entity’s other money and assets, for instance, by having a separate bank account for the fund. This makes it easier to show an actual stock of money exists and that the purposes of the fund have been maintained over time (by seeing how the money in the account has been used). 83.

Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 51 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT What is a public fund 85. In general terms, a “public fund” in this context means an actual stock of money or assets set aside for charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes within New Zealand, rather than a mere accounting expression. This includes, for example, a public fund represented by a credit balance in a bank account. A public fund originates in a public initiative, and the public both contributes to and participates in the administration of the fund. 86. For a public fund to obtain donee status from the Commissioner under s LD 3(2)(d), the public fund must be established and maintained exclusively for the purpose of providing money for one or more of the following purposes within New Zealand: charitable; benevolent; philanthropic; or cultural. These purposes were described from \[34\]. 87. A public fund must meet the requirements for use of the fund’s money (see from \[76\]) and for maintaining the fund (see from \[80\]) with the modification that a reference to a registered charity should be read as the public fund. 88. For more information, see QB 22/02: Donations: What is required to establish and maintain a “public fund” under s LD 3(2) (d) of the Income Tax Act 2007. 26 Written applications to the Commissioner for donee status 89. Charities will automatically be considered for donee status on their registration by Charities Services (where they have indicated they intend to receive donations). These charities should not make a separate application to the Commissioner for donee status. 90. Entities that do not have charitable purposes or for any other reason are not eligible to register with Charities Services, may seek donee status by applying to and receiving approval by the Commissioner (for example, if they have benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes). There is no prescribed form of application; instead, those entities seeking to obtain donee status approval from the Commissioner should send their request through the online myIR service or write to the Commissioner seeking approval to be placed on the Commissioner’s list of approved donee organisations. 91. The written application (through myIR or by post to Inland Revenue, PO Box 1147, Palmerston North Central, Palmerston North 4440) should include: the entity’s IRD number – if the entity has no IRD number, then an application for one must be made and can be done online; 27 a copy of the entity’s rules, constitution, trust deed or other founding documents (as applicable); a copy of the entity’s certificate of incorporation (if applicable); a copy of the letter or other communication with Charities Services in which the entity’s application to be a registered charity was declined or an explanation of why the entity believes it is not eligible to register; details of how the entity has been or will be operated, including: (i) how the entity’s funds will be applied; (ii) for an entity that is a society, institution association, organisation or trust - whether (and what percentage) of the funds will be applied for purposes outside New Zealand; and (iii) for an entity that is a public institution, a fund or a public fund - confirmation that the entity’s funds will not be applied for purposes outside New Zealand. 92. It is often helpful to include further information if it illustrates the objects, activities and achievements of the entity, such as website references, reports, newsletters, media articles or testimonials. 26 Inland Revenue, QB 22/02: Donations - what is required to establish and maintain a “public fund” under s LD 3(2)(d) of the Income Tax Act 2007? (Questions we’ve been asked / 2022) (publication). 27 Inland Revenue, New Zealand business or organisation IRD number application | Te tono i tētahi tau tāke mō tētahi pakihi, whakahaere rānei kei Aotearoa (webpage). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 52 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT Other entities that automatically qualify as donee organisations by definition 93. Section LD 3(2) describes certain types of entities that are recognised as being donee organisations: a community housing entity (as defined is s CW 42B), if at the time the gift is made the entity is eligible to derive exempt income under s CW 42B (community housing trusts and companies) (see s LD 3(2)(ac)); a board of trustees that is constituted under subpart 5 of part 3 of the Education and Training Act 2020 and is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual (see s LD 3(2)(bb)); and a tertiary education institution (as defined in s YA 1) that is established under subpart 3 or subpart 4 of part 4 of the Education and Training Act 2020 (and has not been disestablished under that Act) that is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual (ss LD 3(2)(bc) and YA 1). 94. Entities meeting these definitions do not need to seek approval from the Commissioner and will generally not be included on the Commissioner’s list of approved donee organisations (although historically, many of these entities have been included on the list). This type of entity may appear on the list if it is a registered charity. 95. For example, boards of trustees of state schools and state integrated schools are donee organisations by virtue of s LD 3(2) (bb), even though they may not be listed in the Commissioner’s list of approved donee organisations. School parent-teacher associations or parent support groups that are established independently from the school’s board of trustees may qualify as donee organisations, but they need to apply to the Commissioner to obtain donee status. Further guidance on gifts made by parents to state and state-integrated schools is in: QB18/10: Income Tax – state schools and donation tax credits; 28 and QB 18/11: Income Tax – state integrated schools and donation tax credits. 29 Charities approved as donee organisations by Parliament (schedule 32 of the ITA) 96. Entities that apply a significant part (or all) of their funds for purposes other than charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes within New Zealand can be approved as donee organisations only by Parliament. 97. Legislation, rather than approval by the Commissioner, is used to implement decisions to grant donee status in these cases. This is because it is an exception to the policy that tax benefits for donations should be limited to entities with purposes within New Zealand. 98. The Commissioner recommends to Cabinet whether an application should be granted or not. If approved by Parliament as a donee organisation, schedule 32 to the ITA is amended to add the entity. 99. A charity seeking to obtain donee status in this way should be prepared to provide, among other things: the charity’s goals and long-term vision; the charity’s governing documents (constitution and trust deed) showing that its activities and purposes are consistent with Cabinet’s criteria (see \[103\]); evidence that its purposes are entirely within the purposes described in the guidelines for Cabinet criteria and that no personal pecuniary profit can be derived; governing documents that contain clauses governing the nature and extent of discretionary powers, the winding-up clause and the ability to amend the governing document; the charity’s internal policies and procedures, where relevant; for example, an anti-money laundering policy, a child protection policy or a memorandum of understanding with the charity’s key stakeholders; information about the charity’s past, current and proposed activities; the charity’s in-country partners; the charity’s financial statements; evidence of the degree of control over the application of the charity’s funds overseas and procedures to ensure accountability for funds; the planning, monitoring and evaluation processes used regarding the application of the charity’s funds, including how recipients use the funds, as well as the processes used to select beneficiaries or projects to support; and evidence of the charity’s legal presence in New Zealand and whether it is a registered charity. 28 Inland Revenue, QB18/10: Income Tax – state schools and donation tax credits (Question we’ve been asked / 2018) (publication). 29 Inland Revenue, QB 18/11: Income Tax – state integrated schools and donation tax credits (Question we’ve been asked / 2018) (publication). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 53 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT 100. Applicants for overseas donee status should complete a request form, 30 then send it with supporting documents by email to policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz or post to Inland Revenue, Policy and Regulatory Stewardship, PO Box 2198, Wellington 6140. 101. Inland Revenue makes an initial assessment and contacts the charity’s representative to make any necessary further enquiries. Any concerns or issues with the charity or its officers or trustees are communicated to the relevant parties directly. Generally, trustees or officers will be asked to consent to a New Zealand Police vetting check. 102. The Commissioner’s review process is very involved (multi-year, including enactment) to manage risk, to inform spending decisions to be made by Ministers, and because Ministers want to be assured of the credibility, transparency and accountability of the applicant so tax relief afforded by donee status is appropriately targeted and the potential misuse of public money is minimised. 103. Following the review, the Commissioner makes a recommendation to Cabinet. Cabinet decisions to grant or decline donee status are made using the overseas donee guidelines set by Cabinet. The guidelines require that the funds of the charity should be principally applied towards: the relief of poverty, hunger, sickness or the ravages of war or natural disaster; or the economy of developing countries (recognised by the United Nations); or raising the educational standards of a developing country (recognised by the United Nations). 104. In terms of which countries are “developing countries”, Cabinet uses as a guideline, the United Nations list of least developed countries, 31 which is reviewed every three years by the United Nations Economic and Social Council, considering the recommendations by the Committee for Development Policy. 105. The eligible purposes set out in the guidelines align with the Government’s overseas development objectives (disaster relief, provision of humanitarian aid and assisting developing countries) and are narrower than the common law meaning of “charitable purpose” and the legislative framework in the Charities Act 2005. 106. Additionally, a charity seeking donee status must be resident in New Zealand, and it is preferable that the charity be registered under the Charities Act. A charity formed for the principal purpose of fostering or administering any religion, cult or political creed will not qualify. 107. There are ongoing requirements once an entity gains donee status and is listed in schedule 32, including the requirements for provision of donation tax receipts (see from \[143\]), record keeping (see from \[153\]), to self-assess and notify changes (see from \[160\]) and regarding winding up of the organisation (see from \[165\]). Tax benefits of being a donee organisation 108. The main advantage of being a donee organisation is the benefit it brings to the donors who make charitable or other public benefit gifts. Individuals, companies and Māori authorities may qualify for tax benefits, such as donation tax credits, payroll giving tax credits or income tax gift deductions. 109. Where a donee organisation is a tax charity (as defined in ss YA 1 and CW 41(5)), it may be entitled to exemption from income tax on certain parts, or all, of its income. Where a donee organisation is a charitable organisation (as defined in s YA 1) it may be entitled to the FBT exclusion and/or its volunteers overseas may be entitled to maintain interest-free status of their student loans. Where a donee organisation is a non-profit body (as defined in s 2(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985) it may also qualify for GST concessions. Each of these tax concessions is described more fully in Part 1 Charities. Tax credits and deductions for charitable or other public benefit gifts 110. Individuals may claim donation tax credits and companies and Māori authorities may claim income tax gift deductions, if they make qualifying “charitable or other public benefit gifts”. 111. A charitable or other public benefit gift is defined in s LD 3 and means a gift of money or a subscription of $5 or more paid to a donee organisation (so long as any subscription provides no rights arising from membership). It does not include testamentary gifts (that is, a gift made in a will) or gifts made by forgiving some or all of a debt (s LD 3(1)(c)). 30 Inland Revenue, Form IR 464: Overseas donee status request (October 2012) (publication). 31 United Nations, List of Least Developed Countries (as of 24 November 2021) (publication). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 54 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT Gift to a donee organisation 112. To qualify as a charitable or other public benefit gift, the gift must be made to an entity that is: on the Commissioner’s list of approved donee organisations; or not included on the approved donee organisation list, but meets one of following descriptions of a donee organisation: a community housing entity (s LD 3(2)(ac)), school board of trustees (s LD 3(2)(bb)) or tertiary education institution (s LD 3(2)(bc)); or listed in schedule 32 of the ITA (recipients of charitable or other public benefit gifts). Gift of money of $5 or more 113. To qualify as a charitable or other public benefit gift for the purposes of s LD 3, there must be a “gift of money of $5 or more”. 114. The Commissioner considers that to qualify as a “gift of money of $5 or more” there must be a payment of money of $5 or more that is made voluntarily and in circumstances where the donor receives no material benefit or advantage in return. Ordinarily, a gift will confer a benefit on the donee organisation. 115. The Court of Appeal in Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Trust Board and Coward v CIR (2020) NZCA 143 found that whether a payment is a gift for the purposes of s LD 1 (where no sham and tax avoidance is at issue) must be ascertained by: considering the true nature of the transactions by carefully considering the legal arrangement actually entered into and carried out within its context and in light of the surrounding circumstances; and determining whether the payments made under those transactions are gifts in light of the text and purpose of the donation tax credit rules. 116. A charitable or other public benefit gift does not include the transfer of property or services to a donee organisation. 117. If something is purchased from a donee organisation, such as a ticket to an event or the purchase of goods (for example, at a charity auction), the payment is not a gift. 118. The Court of Appeal in CIR v Roberts \[2019\] NZCA 654 found that the forgiveness of debt could qualify as a gift of money. However, after Roberts, s LD 3(1)(c) was amended to specify that a charitable or other public benefit gift does not include “a gift made by forgiving some or all of a debt”. This amendment was retrospective to 1 April 2008, with a savings provision that means taxpayers who claimed a donation tax credit or income tax gift deduction for the forgiveness of debt before 16 December 2019 are allowed the claim or deduction. 119. A gift does not need to be made directly to a donee organisation. For example, it can be made through a third-party, such as an employer via payroll giving (see from \[129\]) or through an online fundraising platform. 120. Online fundraising platforms, such as crowdfunding services, allow a donor to authorise the service provider to pass on their donation to the recipient of the funds. Whether the donor has made a qualifying gift of money of $5 or more to a donee organisation is determined on the same criteria as any other gift. For the purposes of claiming a tax credit refund or deduction, the amount that may be claimed is determined by the receipt issued. If the Commissioner considers any administrative charge made by the fundraising platform is unreasonable or excessive, she may reject or adjust the amount of the donation credit or deduction claim. 121. Further guidance on the attributes of gifts to donee organisations is in QB 16/05: Donee Organisations and Gifts. 32 QB 16/05 also provides examples to illustrate the Commissioner’s view on when certain common fundraising activities may or may not involve gifts (for example, a charity dinner and dance, charity auction, supporter package for a dramatic society, supporter package for a performing arts centre, supporter afternoon tea, friends’ packages, and payments supporting a local football club). While reflecting the Commissioner’s considered view, QB 16/05 should be considered in conjunction with subsequent legislative amendments and the decisions in Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Trust Board and Roberts described above. Donation tax credits for individuals 122. When individuals make qualifying charitable or other public benefit gifts, they are generally entitled to a refundable donation tax credit of 33.33% of such gifts, provided the gift is no more than the amount of the individual’s taxable income for the year (s LD 1 of the ITA and s 41A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA)) and provided they are not an absentee (s 41A(11) of the TAA and s LD 1 of the ITA). 32 Inland Revenue, QB 16/05: Donee Organisations and Gifts (Questions we’ve been asked / 2016) (publication). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 55 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT 123. Gifts of less than $5 to a donee organisation can still qualify an individual for a donation tax credit if they are made under an instalment arrangement that is approved by the donee organisation. This means regular instalments can be made and recorded throughout the year for that donor, with each donation clearly attributable to the donor. At the end of the year, the total gift, as returned on the organisation’s end-of-year accounts for that person, must be $5 or more to qualify for a donation tax credit. 124. Individuals can submit their donations tax receipts to the Commissioner through the online myIR service during the tax year or at the end of the tax year. Whichever method is used, the application is processed at the end of the tax year. Individuals have four years from the end of the tax year in which the donation was made to claim donation tax credit refunds (s 41A(6) of the TAA). 125. When the Commissioner has considered an application, the person will be notified of the amount of the credit and refund allowed. If the Commissioner refuses a refund of a tax credit (in full or in part), the taxpayer can challenge that decision through the disputes process by issuing a Notice of Proposed Adjustment. For more information about the disputes process, see the Inland Revenue website. 33 126. Individuals can also make charitable or other public benefit gifts by way of payroll giving (see \[129\]). 127. A donor may ask the Commissioner to apply some, or all, of a donation tax credit to satisfy a liability under the Inland Revenue Acts (s RM 10(2) of the ITA and s 173T of the TAA). If a donor does not make such a request, the Commissioner may apply the refund to satisfy any liability of that donor (s RM 10(3)). 128. For more information on making donation tax credit claims, see the Inland Revenue website. 34 Payroll giving 129. The payroll giving scheme provides a tax credit for gifts of money that are deducted from an employee’s pay through their employer’s payroll (ss LD 4 to LD 8). The amount of the tax credit is limited to the amount of tax for the person’s pay for the period. Employees receive an immediate reduction in tax by way of tax credit, as a reduction in their PAYE each pay period. This eliminates the need to collect and keep receipts to claim tax relief on gifts of money at the end of the year. To participate in the payroll giving scheme, the recipient organisation must be a donee organisation. 130. Where an employer makes payroll giving donations to a donee organisation, the donee organisation must issue a payroll giving donation tax receipt in the participating employer’s business name (not in the name of the individual employees who donated). 131. Employees do not include their payroll giving receipts in their IR526: Tax Credit Claim Form at the end of the year. 35 Employers must include employees’ payroll giving donations in IR348: Employment Information 36 and adjust the PAYE sent to Inland Revenue by the amount of tax credits for payroll giving donations. For further information, see the guide IR617: Payroll Giving. 37 Income tax gift deductions for companies 132. A company can claim an income tax gift deduction for a charitable or other public benefit gift it makes to a donee organisation (s DB 41(2)). “Company” is defined in s YA 1 broadly enough to include certain societies and clubs. 133. The amount of the company’s deduction is limited to the company’s net income for the relevant income year (that is, essentially annual income less annual expenses before the donation is deducted). 134. Where money is transferred by a company that has been deregistered as a charity, to another charity, that payment does not qualify for an income tax gift deduction as a charitable or other public benefit gift (s DB 41(2B)). Income tax gift deductions for Māori authorities 135. A Māori authority may claim an income tax gift deduction for donations made to a Māori association or a charitable or other public benefit gift made to a donee organisation (s DV 12). 136. The amount of the Māori authority’s deduction is limited to the Māori authority’s net income for the relevant income year (that is, essentially annual income less annual expenses before the donation is deducted). 137. Where money is transferred by a deregistered charity that is a Māori authority to a charity in accordance with the charity deregistration rules, that payment does not qualify for an income tax gift deduction (s DV 12(1B)). 33 Inland Revenue, Disputes | Ngā wenewene (webpage). 34 Inland Revenue, Processes for donation tax credits (webpage). 35 Inland Revenue, IR526: Tax Credit Claim Form (October 2020) (publication). 36 Inland Revenue, IR348: Employment Information (April 2020) (publication). 37 Inland Revenue, IR617: Payroll Giving (April 2020) (publication). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 56 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT 138. For further guidance on Māori authorities, see: Becoming a Māori Authority (IR487); 38 Māori Authority Tax Rules (IR1202); 39 and Payments and Gifts in the Māori Community (IR278). 40 Administrative provisions – donation tax credits and income tax gift deductions 139. The usual four-year time bar provisions apply to company and Māori authority income tax returns that include deductions claimed for charitable or public benefit gifts (s 108 of the TAA). 140. For individuals, from 1 April 2019, for the purposes of determining the time bar period (s 41A(6B) of the TAA), the: payment of a refund is treated as an assessment; and four-year time bar period starts at the end of the tax year in which the person applied for the refund. 141. This means that, absent any wrongdoing in relation to the donation tax credit refund or deduction claimed for charitable or public benefit gifts, the Commissioner cannot amend a taxpayer’s claim (to adjust it up or down) after four years have passed. 142. Specific anti-avoidance rules apply when a person enters into an arrangement and the arrangement has a purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of s LD 1 (s GB 55 of the ITA). Companies and Māori authorities continue to be subject to the general anti-avoidance provision (s BG 1 of the ITA). Donation tax receipt requirements 143. The Commissioner’s requirements for donee organisations when issuing donation tax receipts to donors for gifts they have made are contained in IR255: Charitable and Donee Organisations. 41 144. To assist donors to make claims and to enable the Commissioner to efficiently consider those claims, the donee organisation should provide the donor with a receipt that includes: the donee organisation’s official stamp or letterhead with the donee organisation’s full name (and branch, if appropriate); the donee organisation’s IRD number and Charities Services registration number (if applicable); the donor’s full name (and address, if known); the full amount and date of the donation (or, if payments were made throughout the year, the total donation amount for the income year ending 31 March provided the entity had donee status for the entire income year); a clear statement that the amount received is a donation – the donation amount should be clearly separated from any other amounts covered by the receipt (subscription fees, amounts paid for goods or services, or raffle tickets are not donations, so should be shown separately from the donation amount on the receipt); the name, designation and signature of a person authorised to accept donations for the donee organisation (this may be an electronic signature); and a receipt number, unique to each receipt. 145. Where a receipt for the donee organisation is re-issued as a replacement, it must be clearly marked “copy” or “replacement”. 146. Treasurers and officers of donee organisations should not authorise or sign their own receipts or those relating to their immediate family members. 147. Donee organisations should keep current the contact details of persons authorised to oversee donations, such as the secretary or treasurer, as Inland Revenue may wish to contact them to verify receipts. To update Inland Revenue, use the form IR401: Appoint an Executive Office Holder to Act on Your Behalf. 42 148. Where a donor uses a tax agent or representative to apply for a refund of their donation tax credit, the tax agent or representative must see the receipt of the donor’s charitable or other public benefit gift, and the donor must retain the receipt for four tax years after the tax year to which the claim relates (s LD 1(4)). 38 Inland Revenue, IR487: Becoming a Māori Authority (December 2017) (publication). 39 Inland Revenue, IR1202: Māori Authority Tax Rules (May 2022) (publication). 40 Inland Revenue, IR278: Non-profit groups - Payments and Gifts in the Māori Community - Factsheet (December 2015) (publication). 41 Inland Revenue, IR255: Charitable and donee organisations (December 2021) (publication). 42 Inland Revenue, IR401: Appoint an Executive Office Holder to Act on Your Behalf (March 2019) (publication). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 57 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT 149. To claim a donation tax credit, a donor needs to have a valid donation receipt. 150. A donor can start the process of claiming donation tax credits during the year by uploading receipts online as donations are made, rather than waiting to submit everything at the end of the tax year. 151. The donation tax credit is limited to the taxable income of the donor, which is known only at the end of the tax year. All receipts uploaded during the year will be processed as a single claim. 152. If receipts cannot be uploaded online, they may still be submitted along with the IR526: Tax credit claim form after the year end. 43 Record keeping 153. While registered charities have information and reporting obligations under the Charities Act, they must also comply with the requirements of the Inland Revenue Acts. 154. All donee organisations should keep sufficient records in English or te reo Māori to calculate any tax liability and to demonstrate eligibility for tax exemptions or concessions. Depending on the entity, records may include receipt and payment account books, bank statements, invoices, receipts and wage records for employees (s 32 of the TAA). 155. Additionally, donee organisations must also keep a record of: the sources of any donations made to it; and how its funds have been used, within New Zealand or overseas. 156. If the Commissioner requests, a donee organisation may be required to provide a breakdown of donations received, including donor details, respective payment dates and payment methods (s 58 of the TAA). 157. If a donee organisation is registered for GST, it must keep records as required under s 75 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. 158. Records should be kept for a minimum of seven years, even if the donee organisation ceases operating. 159. For further information on record keeping, see Standard Practice Statement: Retention of business records in electronic formats, application to store records offshore and keeping records in languages other than English or te reo Māori (SPS 21/02). 44 Requirement to self-assess and notify changes 160. All donee organisations must continually self-assess to determine whether they continue to meet the donee status requirements. 161. If a donee organisation determines that it no longer meets the requirements in s LD 3, it must immediately cease issuing donation tax receipts and inform the Commissioner of its change in circumstances by post to Inland Revenue, PO Box 1147, Palmerston North Central, Palmerston North 4440 or by email to charities.queries@ird.govt.nz. 162. The entity will then be removed from the Commissioner’s list of approved donee organisations (if it was included there). If the entity is listed in schedule 32, the Commissioner will inform Parliament that the entity no longer qualifies for inclusion and Parliament will take the necessary steps to remove it from the schedule. Binding rulings 163. An entity may apply to the Commissioner for a binding ruling (which includes short process rulings) under part 5A of the TAA. A binding ruling is the Commissioner’s interpretation of how a tax law applies to a particular arrangement, person, or item of property. 164. For more information about binding rulings, see the Inland Revenue website, What is a binding ruling? 45 43 Inland Revenue, IR526: Tax credit claim form (October 2020) (publication). 44 Inland Revenue, Standard Practice Statement -SPS 21/02: Retention of business records in electronic formats, application to store records offshore and keeping records in languages other than English or te reo Māori (May 2021) (publication). 45 Inland Revenue, What is a binding ruling? (webpage). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 58 OPERATIONAL STATEMENT Winding up a donee organisation 165. On winding up, consistent with the “wholly or mainly” requirement, a donee organisation’s remaining income and/or assets should be applied to charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes within New Zealand. The donee organisation’s rules or constitution should contain provisions outlining what will happen to remaining income and assets on winding up. 166. A donee organisation may have other statutory requirements that apply on winding up (for example, requirements on liquidation or dissolution by the Registrar of Incorporated Societies under the Incorporated Societies Act 1908). 46 Deregistration 167. Charities that are deregistered (whether voluntarily or because of failing to meet their filing obligations with Charities Services) lose donee status. If the charity appeals the deregistration, it should notify the Commissioner, as it can then retain donee status until its appeal is determined (s LD 3(2)(ab)). 168. If the deregistered charity does not appeal the deregistration, donors to these deregistered entities will not be able to claim a donation tax credit or income tax gift deduction for any donations made to the charity during the period of deregistration. 169. A deregistered charity must ensure its donation tax receipts, websites and newsletters clearly state that donations made after the date of deregistration will not qualify a donor for a donation tax credit or an income tax deduction. 170. The deregistered charity may make a written application to the Commissioner to again be a donee organisation, demonstrating their benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purpose and satisfaction of the other requirements (see from \[89\]). Removal as a donee organisation 171. The Commissioner’s decision to remove an organisation’s donee status is a “disputable decision” (defined in s 3(1) of the TAA) meaning it may be challenged under part 8A of the TAA. For more information about the disputes process, see the Inland Revenue website, Disputes. 47 Appendix – Legislation Income Tax Act 2007 CX 25 Benefits provided by charitable organisations When not fringe benefit (1) A charitable organisation that provides a benefit to an employee does not provide a fringe benefit except to the extent to which— (a) the employee receives the benefit mainly in connection with their employment; and (b) the employment consists of the carrying on by the organisation of a business whose activity is outside its benevolent, charitable, cultural, or philanthropic purposes.

(3) To avoid doubt, if the purposes of a trust, society, or an institution include a non-charitable purpose (for example, advocacy) that is merely ancillary to a charitable purpose of the trust, society, or institution, the presence of that non-charitable purpose does not prevent the trustees of the trust, the society, or the institution from qualifying for registration as a charitable entity. (4) For the purposes of subsection (3), a non-charitable purpose is ancillary to a charitable purpose of the trust, society, or institution if the non-charitable purpose is— (a) ancillary, secondary, subordinate, or incidental to a charitable purpose of the trust, society, or institution; and (b) not an independent purpose of the trust, society, or institution.

Facts | Meka 1. In September 2020, Customer and Compliance Services, Inland Revenue (CCS) issued a series of default income tax and GST assessments to the self-employed Taxpayer and imposed associated evasion shortfall penalties. The shortfall penalties were reduced by 50% for previous behaviour under s 141FB. The default income tax assessments related to the 2007, 2008, 2015, and 2018 income years. The GST assessments covered the 6-month GST periods occurring during the 2014, 2015, 2017 and 2018 income years. 2. CCS also issued an Agreement to Amend Assessment (AAA) form to the Taxpayer in which they proposed to adjust the Taxpayer’s tax assessments for the 2014 and 2017 income years and impose an evasion shortfall penalty in each year, reduced by 50% under s 141FB for previous behaviour. In December 2021 the Taxpayer signed the AAA form and returned it to CCS. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 71 TECHNICAL DECISION SUMMARIES 3. The Taxpayer issued a Notice of Proposed Adjustment in January 2021 (TN O PA), and CCS issued a Notice of Response in March 2021. During the conference stage of the dispute the Taxpayer agreed that they would no longer dispute the core tax that was in issue, but they would continue to dispute the shortfall penalties. The Taxpayer issued a Statement of Position in January 2022 (TSOP), and CCS issued a Statement of Position in March 2022 (CSOP). In the CSOP, CCS argued that the Taxpayer was deemed to have accepted the default assessment shortfall penalties and, if they were wrong in this respect, the Taxpayer’s liability for the penalties was proved by the available evidence. The Taxpayer disputed these arguments. Issues | Take 4. To determine whether the Taxpayer was liable to pay the evasion shortfall penalties CCS imposed in relation to the default assessments, the Tax Counsel Office, Inland Revenue (TCO) considered the following issues: Was the Taxpayer deemed to have accepted the shortfall penalties? Was the Taxpayer liable under s 141E of the TAA for evasion shortfall penalties? This involved consideration of the following sub-issues: –Did the Taxpayer take tax positions in respect of which shortfall penalties could be imposed? –The onus and standard of proof. Decisions | Whakatau 5. TCO decided that: The Taxpayer was prohibited from challenging the default assessment shortfall penalties in a hearing authority. Therefore, in practical effect, the Taxpayer is deemed to have accepted the default assessment shortfall penalties. The Taxpayer took tax positions in respect of which shortfall penalties could be imposed and CCS met the onus of proving to the required standard of the balance of probabilities that the Taxpayer is liable for the default assessment shortfall penalties under s 141E. If the Taxpayer had disputed the AAA form penalties in a NOPA and raised the same arguments that they did in the TSOP, the arguments would not have succeeded. Reasons for decisions | Pūnga o ngā whakatau Issue 1 | Take tuatahi: Deemed Acceptance 6. Under s 138B(3) a disputant who does not propose an adjustment to an assessment within the response period for the assessment is prohibited from challenging the assessment. A taxpayer disputes an assessment by issuing a NOPA as provided in s 89D. 7. Section 89F requires a NOPA to be in the prescribed form (IR 770) and it must contain the information specified in ss 89F(3)(a) and (b). In summary a NOPA must: identify the taxpayer’s proposed adjustments; state the facts and the law in sufficient detail to inform the Commissioner of the grounds for the taxpayer’s proposed adjustments; state how the law applies to the facts, and include copies of significantly relevant documents. 8. In this dispute, the Taxpayer’s NOPA did not meet the requirements of ss 89F(3)(a) and (b) because it did not mention the shortfall penalties. While it was arguable that a letter issued by the Taxpayer’s agent on 27 January 2021 might meet the requirements of those sections, this ultimately did not assist the Taxpayer. This was because the letter is not in the prescribed form for a NOPA, and it was provided outside of the 4-month response period during which the Taxpayer was required to propose adjustments to the shortfall penalties. This meant that the Taxpayer was prohibited from challenging the assessments in a hearing authority. Therefore, in practical effect, the Taxpayer is deemed to have accepted the shortfall penalties. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 72 TECHNICAL DECISION SUMMARIES Issue 2 | Take tuarua: Liability for evasion shortfall penalty 9. Although it was considered that there was non-compliance with s 138B(3), the merits of the Taxpayer’s claim that they were not liable for shortfall penalties was considered by TCO. This approach was taken in the event that the Taxpayer chooses to file a challenge under s 138B and the TRA or a Court holds that there has been compliance with the statutory requirements and, as such, the challenge may be made and there is no effective deemed acceptance of the shortfall penalties. 10. Section 141E(1)(a) imposes a shortfall penalty for evasion on a taxpayer if the following requirements are satisfied: 1 The taxpayer has taken a tax position. A tax position is a position or approach to tax under a tax law as taken in or in respect of a tax return, income statement, or due date. 2 Taking the tax position has resulted in a tax shortfall. A tax shortfall is the difference between the tax effects of the correct tax position and the tax effects of the taxpayer’s tax position. 3 The taxpayer has evaded the assessment or payment of tax. Evasion requires an intention to avoid the assessment or payment of tax known to be chargeable: –The element of intention will be satisfied if the taxpayer knows that their action or omission will breach a tax obligation. There must be some blameworthy act or omission on the part of the taxpayer. The required intent for evasion can be inferred from surrounding circumstances and conduct. 4 –Recklessness can amount to evasion and involves the conscious taking of risk. Recklessness will be proven where: 5 Facts actually known to the taxpayer were such that they must have put the taxpayer on inquiry that a tax obligation may not be met. The taxpayer made a conscious decision to ignore the facts without making further inquiry. 11. The penalty payable for evasion or similar act is 150% of the resulting tax shortfall. 12. The onus of proof rests with the Commissioner to show that a taxpayer is liable for a shortfall penalty for evasion under s 141E. 6 This is different from the other shortfall penalties where the onus of proof is on the taxpayer. The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities. 7 Tax position and tax shortfalls 13. The Taxpayer was required to file GST and income tax returns for the periods in respect of which shortfall penalties have been imposed. The Taxpayer’s failure to meet this requirement means that they took tax positions regarding the provision or non-provision of the returns. Further, the Taxpayer’s failure to pay any of the tax owing in each period means that they took tax positions regarding their liability for tax in those periods. As the Taxpayer’s tax positions were “nil” tax positions, they resulted in tax shortfalls. The amount of the tax shortfall in each period is the amount of tax CCS assessed as payable for the period when they made the default assessment for the period. Knowledge and intentions 14. The Taxpayer argued that their non-compliance was attributable to unaddressed mental health problems. A person’s health may be a relevant consideration when determining if the person is liable for shortfall penalties. 8 However, TCO concluded the Taxpayer did not provide medical evidence that showed their health issues rendered them incapable of exercising the sort of judgment that would have avoided the tax shortfalls that occurred in this case. Further, the Taxpayer’s non- compliance occurred over a significant number of years that spanned beyond the periods in dispute, and during the years of non-compliance, the Taxpayer was able to earn significant amounts of income. These circumstances indicated that the 1 The shortfall penalty for evasion or a similar act is considered in the Interpretation Statement: Shortfall Penalty—Evasion as published in Ta x Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 11 (December 2006). 2 Definitions of “tax position” and “taxpayer’s tax position” in s 3 of the TAA. 3 Definition of “tax shortfall” in s 3 of the TAA. 4 Taylor v Attorney-General \[1963\] NZLR 261 (SC); Lloyds Bank Ltd v Marcan \[1973\] 2 All ER 359; Case H90 (1986) 8 NZTC 619; Case N47 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,388; R v G \[2013\] NZCA 146. 5 Case H90 (1986) 8 NZTC 619; R v Harney \[1987\] 2 NZLR 576 (CA); Case P29 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,213; Case S100 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,626; R v G \[2013\] NZCA 146. 6 Section 149A(2) of the TAA. 7 Section 149A(1) of the TAA. 8 Case Y21 (2008) 23 NZTC 13,227. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 10 November 2022Inland Revenue Department 73 TECHNICAL DECISION SUMMARIES Taxpayer was capable of exercising better judgement when dealing with their tax obligations including, obtaining and retaining the help of a tax professional. 15. The available evidence showed that the Taxpayer knew they were required to file income tax and GST returns by their due dates and that they knew they were required to include the income from their self-employed activities in the returns. The Taxpayer’s knowledge was demonstrated by the fact they filed 3 GST returns and attempted to file one income tax return during the early periods of their self-employed activities. The Taxpayer’s knowledge was also demonstrated by the fact they discussed their outstanding tax obligations with two tax accountants and had numerous contacts with Inland Revenue staff in which their tax obligations were also discussed. Further, in July 2016 the Taxpayer filed an income tax return for the 2016 income year. 16. The available evidence also supported an inference that the Taxpayer evaded tax. The inference arose because although the Taxpayer was aware of their filing obligations, they chose not to meet them and as a consequence of this, tax that should have been assessed was not assessed. In the alternative, at a minimum the available evidence supports a conclusion that the Taxpayer intended to evade tax in the sense that they acted recklessly. The Taxpayer’s knowledge that they were required to prepare and file income tax and GST returns which included their income would have put them on notice that preparing the returns might show they had tax liabilities. This circumstance supports an inference that the Taxpayer did not file their returns because they did not want to pay the tax that they knew was owing or suspected was owing in each period and, as such, they acted recklessly. 17. A conclusion that the taxpayer intended to evade tax is also supported by the significant extent of the Taxpayer’s non- compliance, their dealings with Inland Revenue staff, their dealings with the tax accountants, and their decision to file an income tax return for the 2016 income year in which they claimed a tax refund. Shortfall penalties in the 2014 and 2017 income years 18. If the Taxpayer wished to dispute the shortfall penalties in the AAA form, the appropriate course would have been for the Taxpayer to issue a NOPA proposing adjustments to the penalties within the applicable response period. The Taxpayer did not do this. It was observed that even if the Taxpayer had disputed the penalties and in doing so raised the same arguments that they did in the TSOP against the default assessment shortfall penalties, the same result would have applied. This was because the tax shortfalls that relate to the penalties in the AAA form were in all material respects the same as the tax shortfalls that related to the default assessment shortfall penalties. As such, the matters that supported a conclusion the Taxpayer was liable to pay the default assessment shortfall penalties also supported a conclusion that the Taxpayer was liable to pay the AAA form shortfall penalties.
