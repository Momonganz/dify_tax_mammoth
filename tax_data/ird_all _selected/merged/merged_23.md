changes to the Goods and Services Act 1985 (the GST Act) will zero- rate business-to-business supplies of financial services. This is intended to alleviate distortions caused by the current exempt treatment of financial services, which has the potential to overtax the supply of financial services to businesses. The changes integrate the supply of financial services more fully into the GST system by taxing at the rate of zero-percent certain supplies of financial services to businesses and allowing financial service providers to claim input tax credits in respect of those supplies. This is in contrast to the current exempt treatment whereby GST is not charged and financial service providers are unable to claim input tax credits. The proposed changes zero-rate the supply of financial services from financial service providers to business customers if the customer (or the group to which the customer belongs) is a GST-registered person who has an activity of making taxable supplies that equal or exceed 75 percent of their total supplies in a 12-month period. This means that a financial services provider will be able to zero-rate supplies of financial services made to most businesses such as those that sell goods at a wholesale or retail level, are involved in manufacturing or primary production or provide professional services. Financial services will not be zero-rated if: • the services are supplied to businesses such as other financial institutions which make exempt supplies that exceed 25 percent of their total supplies; 1 or • the services are supplied to non-registered persons (or final consumers). Services that can be zero-rated under these proposals are set out in the definition of “financial services” contained in the GST Act. The definition of financial services is not being amended in this bill. This definition was, however, reviewed as part of the proposals to zero-rate business-to-business supplies of financial services. The government proposed in the October 2002 discussion document GST and financial services that the activities of third-parties be excluded from the definition, thereby making them taxable at the standard rate of GST of 12.5 percent. However, because of the negative impact it was suggested this reform would have on the savings industry it has not proceeded further. 1 Supplies of financial services as between financial institutions will, however, qualify for a special input tax credit for the supplier to the extent that the recipient financial institution supplies financial services to taxable businesses. 4 Eight submissions were made supporting the proposed zero-rating of business-to- business supplies of financial services. Of the eight submissions received, one supported the reforms as part of a package associated with the proposed introduction of the reverse charge mechanism. Five made recommendations about the scope of the zero-rating proposals and various other technical issues. 5 ZERO-RATING BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS SUPPLIES OF FINANCIAL SERVICES Issue: Support proposals Clauses 104(2), 109(2), 111, 113(5), 114, 115, 116(1) and 119 Submissions (1W – New Zealand Business Roundtable, 13 – New Zealand Venture Capital Association Inc, 18W – Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, 19 – Business New Zealand, 32 – New Zealand Bankers’ Association, 33 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 45W – Promina) The submissions note their support for the proposed amendments that zero-rate business-to-business supplies of financial services. The New Zealand Bankers’ Association supports the amendments as part of the package associated with the introduction of the proposed reverse charge. Business New Zealand hopes that the savings created by the proposals will be passed on to business consumers. Submissions also endorsed the government’s intention that Inland Revenue issue public guidelines to assist taxpayers in determining when supplies of financial services may be zero-rated. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Maintain an ongoing review of policy principles concerning GST and financial services Submission (32 – New Zealand Bankers’ Association) It is possible that academic developments both in New Zealand and internationally will enable further refinement of the GST treatment of financial services. Comment Officials are continuing to review international developments on the conceptually correct GST treatment of financial services. 6 Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Valuing financial services Submission (39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The basis for determining the value of an exempt supply should be legislated or Inland Revenue be required to publish a safe harbour basis for determining the value of an exempt supply. Comment Financial services can be priced in one of two ways. A financial institution may charge its customers a discrete fee (for example, 25¢ per transaction regardless of the value of the transaction) or it may take a margin on the transaction based on a set percentage, such as an interest rate or commission (for example 10 percent of funds managed or a difference between rates or percentages such as a 2 percent charge, being the difference between a lending rate of 6 percent and a borrowing rate of 4 percent). In most cases the value of a supply of financial services should be determined on the basis of the net amount received for the service. 2 This means that the value of the supply must take into account the costs or fees incurred in making that supply. Officials consider that a net output and input approach should be the general rule used for valuing financial services under the proposed new zero-rating rules in relation to business-to-business supplies of financial services. This rule is applied in respect of determining the value of supplies for the purposes of apportioning input tax credits between taxable and exempt supplies. For this rule to apply generally, it is assumed that most financial service providers will adopt a turnover or Commissioner-approved method of apportioning input tax credits. However, officials understand that some financial service providers may adopt different methods of apportioning input tax, such as directly attributing input tax to taxable and exempt supplies. For certain supplies, such as those for which a specific fee is charged, it may be appropriate for the value to be determined on a gross basis. 2 This is consistent with the principles established in the European Court of Justice decision Commissioners of Customs and Excise v First National Bank of Chicago (case C-172/96). 7 This variation in the way that financial services can be valued and the variety of methods that can be used to apportion input tax means that including a rule in the GST Act that provides an acceptable basis of valuing exempt supplies may not be appropriate for all taxpayers. However, it is recommended that Inland Revenue prepare a commentary on the best way to value financial services in the guidelines. Recommendation That the submission be declined but note that commentary on the valuation of exempt supplies will be included in the proposed Inland Revenue guidelines on how registered persons should comply with the new zero-rating of business-to-business supplies of financial services. Issue: Commencement date Clause 2(15) Submissions (30 – Investment, Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand Inc, 32 – New Zealand Bankers’ Association) The proposed deferred application date of at least 12 months after the date that the bill receives the Royal assent is supported. For ease of compliance the application date should coincide with the start of a quarter (1 April, July, October or January). (Investment, Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand) A 12-month leeway, as proposed, is required in order to enable banks and other service providers to introduce systems changes required to implement the proposals. (New Zealand Bankers’ Association) Comment As noted in the commentary on the bill, the government has recognised that the proposed reverse charge on imported services and the proposal to zero-rate business- to-business supplies of financial services will require affected registered persons, particularly those in the financial services sector, to change accounting, computer and similar technical systems. For this reason the proposed reverse charge on imported services and zero-rating of business-to-business supplies of financial services will apply no earlier than 12 months after enactment. Officials agree that the commencement date of the proposals should coincide with the start of a financial quarter. This will further assist in reducing compliance costs associated with the transition to the introduction of the reverse charge and zero-rating of business-to-business supplies of financial services. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 8 Issue: Meaning of term “financial services” – financial intermediation Clause 103 Submissions (13 – New Zealand Venture Capital Association Inc, 39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 42W – KPMG) • The definition of “financial services” should be amended to include the holding of both debt instruments and equities. The GST Act should be amended to make clear that the activity of investment in equity and the continued holding of equity investments in an equity fund are financial services. A clear definition is required and a legislative, rather than operational, response will minimise compliance costs and uncertainty. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, KPMG) • The business-to-business proposals should apply to all financial intermediation services, including the activities of equity funds. (New Zealand Venture Capital Association, Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Comment Officials have spoken to the Venture Capital Association and ICANZ regarding the issues raised in their submissions. From these discussions and the written submissions it appears that the issues concern the application of the definition of financial services as contained in the GST Act rather than the new zero-rating rules contained in this bill. The submissions are in response to various ways that some financial transactions are structured and the decisions financial service providers have made in relation to outsourcing certain activities or retaining them in-house. As such, the reforms suggested by submissions will have a significant impact on the way that GST applies to financial services. The impact of this on the business community and the government in terms of revenue forgone has yet to be determined. Officials consider that further work is required to resolve the underlying principles supporting the definition of “financial services” and recommend that additional consultation be undertaken with interested parties. Officials recommend including the issue on the government’s tax policy work programme and will report to Ministers once the issues have been properly considered. Recommendation That the submissions be declined but note that officials are continuing to work on this issue and recommend including it on the government’s tax policy work programme. 9 Issue: Meaning of term “financial services” – management services Clause 103 Submission (39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The treatment of management services for other investment vehicles such as group investment funds and unit trusts should be the same as the treatment of superannuation schemes and life insurance. Comment There are two options for reform in relation to the treatment of management services supplied to group investment funds and unit trusts. These are to either: • remove the management of superannuation funds from the scope of the definition of financial services; or • include the management of group investment funds and unit trusts within the scope of the definition (as advanced by submissions). The outcome of either option ensures the consistent GST treatment of management fees in relation to long-term savings products. Officials consider that the option most consistent with the overall objective of properly integrating financial services into the GST base and removing tax cascades would be to remove the management of superannuation funds from the definition of financial services. This would, however, be strongly opposed by the long-term savings industry, and officials therefore recommend that, without further consultation, no change occur in this area at this time. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Meaning of term “financial services” – participatory securities Clause 103 Submission (43W – Russell McVeagh) A new definition of “participatory security” in the definition of “financial services” in the GST Act should be inserted. This new definition should refer to the use of the term “participatory security” in the Income Tax Act 1994 rather than the Unit Trust Act 1960. 10 The effect of this change would be to widen the definition by not limiting it to unit trusts offered to members of the public. The new definition should apply retrospectively. Comment The GST treatment of participatory securities and other equity securities is currently under review by officials. Officials have a number of concerns relating to use of participatory securities (and equities generally) being used to recharacterise taxable supplies of goods and services as exempt financial services and with the appropriate GST treatment of equities generally. These issues were raised in the recent case Gulf Harbour Development Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue 3 and in submissions received on the discussion document GST and financial services, 4 in relation to timeshare arrangements. Because of the current work in this area, officials consider that the change recommended by the submissioner should not proceed at this time. Recommendation That the submission be declined but note that officials are currently reviewing the GST treatment of participatory securities and other equities as part of the government’s tax policy work programme. Issue: New sections 11A(1)(q) and (r) – the 75 percent threshold Clause 109(2) Submissions (39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 45W – Promina) • The proposed 75 percent taxable supplies threshold (to determine whether a customer of a financial institution is entitled to receive zero-rated supplies) should be removed and replaced with the principal purpose test. Alternatively, the proposed 75 percent threshold should be lowered to a percentage greater than 50 percent to allow flexibility and reduce compliance costs. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) • The proposed 75 percent threshold should be lowered to 70 percent. Lowering the threshold from 75 percent to 70 percent will provide a greater margin of error for suppliers who, in most cases, will be obliged to rely on estimates of the level of taxable supplies made by their customers. It will also broaden the base of supplies to which the zero-rating provision can be applied. (Promina) 3 Unreported, High Court, M1930-SD01, 27 June 2003. 4 GST and financial services: a government discussion document, October 2002. 11 Comment Officials consider that the 75 percent threshold is an appropriate threshold for determining when a customer is eligible to receive zero-rated financial services. The proposed zero-rating rules are designed to reduce the extent to which tax cascades of GST may arise in relation to supplies of financial services between financial service providers and business customers. This means that zero-rating should apply only when the business customer has a predominant activity of making taxable supplies since, as a general rule, tax cascades do not arise when supplies are made to businesses that make exempt supplies. Because the precise setting of the threshold is a matter of judgement, as with most thresholds, opinions will vary as to where it is best set. The threshold of 75 percent was based on the understanding that most business taxpayers would clearly fall on one side or other of a percentage of this size. For example, businesses that sell goods at a wholesale or retail level and manufacturers may have an incidental function of providing credit but it will rarely, if ever, amount to close to 25 percent of turnover. This threshold, supported by appropriate guidelines, should be sufficient to address concerns and provide taxpayers the necessary flexibility when ascertaining whether or not to zero-rate financial services to business customers. Officials consider that any problems associated with the threshold will, in any event, still exist even if the threshold were set at a lower percentage. Further, early comments from interested parties on these proposals suggest that at least some large financial service providers, which have a significant proportion of final consumer customers, will, under these proposals, be making taxable supplies of more than 50 percent of their total supplies. This means that a lower percentage threshold could provide those institutions with full input tax credits (albeit with subsequent apportionment to reflect the level of non-taxable supplies), which may be excessive relative to the size of the tax cascade the reforms are attempting to address. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 12 Issue: New sections 11A(1)(q) and (r) – 12 month period of assessment Clause 109(2) Submissions (18W – Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, 39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand New sections 11A(1)(q) and 11A(1)(r) should be redrafted to clarify that the twelve- month period can include months either prior or subsequent to the taxable period in which the financial services are supplied. This flexibility will eliminate the potential for abnormal activities conducted by taxpayers to affect their overall eligibility to receive zero-rated financial services. Comment As noted in the discussion document GST and financial services, the government intended that the period of assessment could be either retrospective or prospective, depending on the nature and circumstances of the customer. New sections 11A(1)(q) and (r) have been drafted to refer to “a 12-month period that includes the taxable period”. This means that the 12-month test is already drafted in such a way that allows a financial institution to undertake a prospective and/or retrospective analysis of a customer’s activity. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: New section 11A(1)(r) – drafting issue Clause 109(2) Submission (44 – MinterEllisonRuddWatts) The reference to “person” in the second line of new section 11A(1)(r) should be a reference to a “registered person”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 13 Issue: New section 11C – election as to whether zero-rating rules apply Clause 111 Submission (26 – New Zealand Law Society) The new zero-rating rules as they affect the supply of financial services could potentially impose significant compliance costs in terms of obtaining information from a recipient of the supplier’s financial services as to the actual level of taxable supplies made by those recipients. The new zero-rating rules are mandatory unless the taxpayer elects out. The opposite situation to that required by new section 11C should be the case. That is, a financial institution who wishes to take advantage of the new zero-rating provisions should elect into those rules. This is consistent with other elective provisions in the GST Act which, if elected to be applicable, involve an element of compliance cost. Comment Whether taxpayers should be required to elect into or out of the new zero-rating rules involves balancing two competing considerations: • The new rules result in the correct policy outcome and produce a reduction in the economic inefficiencies created by the present exempt treatment of financial services. Taxpayers should be required to apply the zero-rating rules because continuing to exempt business-to-business supplies of financial services potentially gives rise to a cost for businesses. • As the new rules are likely to result in an increase in compliance costs with limited benefits to some financial service providers and their customers, taxpayers should be required to elect into the rules only if they consider that the benefit of the new rules outweigh the costs. On balance, officials consider that the better policy response is to allow taxpayers to elect into the new rules. This means that financial service providers will have to balance their customers’ expectations of zero-rated financial services and the cost that the institutions will need to incur to determine the eligibility of those customers under the rules against the overall benefit of an increased entitlement to input tax credits. While this means that exemption will remain the default treatment of financial services (thereby retaining inefficiencies in the New Zealand economy), officials acknowledge that the costs associated with the new rules may be high for taxpayers other than the larger financial institutions in New Zealand. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. New section 11C should be redrafted to provide that taxpayers must elect into the rules rather than elect out. 14 Issue: New sections 11C and 11D – placement of election provision Clause 111 Submissions (18W – Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu) The placement of new section 11C, which provides that registered persons may elect out of the new zero-rating of business-to-business supplies of financial services, does not fit within the current scheme and layout of the GST Act. New section 11C should be inserted into section 21 of the GST Act. Comment The submission’s concern would appear to apply also to the placement of new section 11D regarding the methodology used by taxpayers for zero-rating business-to- business suppliers of financial services. While officials agree that section 11C and section 11D should be moved, we do not agree that they should be inserted into section 21. Section 21 of the GST Act imposes a liability for GST (output tax) when goods and services are applied for a purpose other than that of making taxable supplies. Sections 11C and 11D do not relate to the imposition of output tax. Officials do note, however, that the current placement of these sections is inconsistent with the scheme of the Act (as raised by the submissioner), and we recommend moving the new sections to follow section 20 of the GST Act. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part by moving sections 11C and 11D to follow section 20 and providing appropriate cross-references to assist users of the GST Act. Issue: New section 11D – application of new section 11A(1)(q) and (r) – guidelines and safe harbours Clause 111 Submissions (42W – KPMG, 44 – MinterEllisonRuddWatts, 45W – Promina) • The Commissioner should issue guidelines to assist registered persons to determine when a supply of financial services can be zero-rated. If a method is approved for determining an amount based on supplies made by another person, that should be considered a “safe harbour” and the Commissioner should not be able to reassess any GST returns furnished on that basis. 15 The guidelines should be prepared in consultation with interested parties, be publicly available and cover all relevant industry groups. If a Commissioner-approved method is not available for taxpayers, interest and shortfall penalties should not apply. If there are revenue concerns the “safe harbour” should not apply to associated person transactions. (KPMG) • New sections 11A(1)(q) and (r) should affirmatively allow zero-rating when a financial institution correctly identifies a recipient as a person who, according to a method approved by the Commissioner, makes taxable supplies in excess of the 75 percent threshold. In these circumstances, adopting the method approved by the Commissioner should be a “safe harbour” protecting the taxpayer against any requirement to make subsequent adjustments. (MinterEllisonRuddWatts) • The development of administrative guidelines by Inland Revenue is supported as this will assist taxpayers in determining whether customers are appropriately categorised as businesses that are entitled to receive zero-rated financial supplies. As part of any administrative guidelines, specific categories of customers or products should be identified as automatically qualifying for zero- rating. (Promina) Comment The application of the new zero-rating rules relating to business-to-business supplies of financial services as set out in new section 11D allows taxpayers to adopt one of two practices: identify the particular characteristics of a customer on a transaction by transaction basis or apply a method approved by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. The nature of the business undertaken by financial service providers suggests that analysis on a transaction-by-transaction basis will not be practical for the majority of supplies to businesses. For this reason the government has acknowledged that guidelines will be required to assist taxpayers in determining when supplies of financial services should be zero-rated. 5 Reasonable care by a financial service provider in ascertaining a customer’s characteristics should provide a sufficient safe harbour against an assessment being amended by the Commissioner and interest and shortfall penalties, even if it is subsequently shown that the customer provided incorrect information to the financial institution. Compliance with the guidelines will provide a strong indication that taxpayers have taken reasonable care in discharging their tax obligations. In some instances reasonable care will have been taken, but a change is required to the GST treatment of certain transactions, either as a result of a change in the customer’s activity or the financial institution becoming aware that information supplied by the customer was not correct. In such cases, given that the financial service provider will have complied with the guidelines at the relevant time, it is expected that the financial service provider will be required to alter the GST treatment of future transactions only 5 Refer Commentary on the Bill – Taxation (Annual Rate, GST, Tran-Tasman Imputation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, page 8. 16 from the date that it was alerted to the change or to the fact that incorrect information was supplied. The Commissioner may, however, need to amend an assessment when adherence to the guidelines would clearly result in an outcome that is inconsistent with the objective of the zero-rating rules – for example, if the guidelines inadvertently zero- rated supplies to those that do not make predominantly taxable supplies or final consumers. An administrative process for determining reasonable care as a standard and for what constitutes reasonable care is considered preferable to legislation as it provides the flexibility needed for Inland Revenue and taxpayers to reach agreed positions which are in line with the objectives of zero-rating. Inland Revenue officials anticipate that the guidelines will be prepared in consultation with interested parties and that these will be made publicly available once finalised. This process is expected to commence early next year. Recommendation That the submissions and officials’ comments be noted. Issue: New section 11D – level of detail that needs to be obtained from customers Clause 111 Submissions (39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 45W – Promina) • The information required to estimate the characteristics of a customer should be limited to the following information only: – the GST registration status of the recipient or a reasonable assumption; – a broad description of the recipient’s business; – if relevant, a broad description of the business and registration status of the recipient’s customers. Recipients should not be compelled to divulge any information and suppliers should not be required to update the information more than annually. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) • New section 11D should be amended to provide further clarification as to how the level of taxable supplies made by customers and financial intermediaries should be determined. Further, the level of accuracy required in determining the level of taxable supplies and the ability to place reliance on information provided by customers should be clarified. (Promina) 17 Comment Officials consider that, within the legislative framework, conditions for when zero- rating may apply are best determined administratively by allowing taxpayers and Inland Revenue to develop methodologies for whether a customer is eligible to receive zero-rated supplies. Consultation on the proposals with interested parties has shown that, in the interests of reducing compliance costs and other concerns, there is a strong preference that the zero-rating rules work without the financial institution being required to contact the customer. As noted in the discussion document GST and financial services, 6 the government considers that as the difference between zero-rating and exemption can generally be described as the respective ability to claim input tax credits, it is expected that the recipient of financial services should not be required to have any direct involvement in terms of the provision of any information in order to determine whether a transaction qualifies for zero-rating. Officials consider that this approach is consistent with the need to reduce compliance costs, as is our recommendation that taxpayers are given the option to elect into rules rather than having to specifically elect out. The criteria presented by ICANZ appear to be broadly consistent with what is expected would be required at an administrative level under the proposed guidelines. It is not recommended that there be a legislative set of criteria as this will not provide the flexibility to ensure that the information required is appropriate for individual circumstances. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part but further clarification of the information sought from taxpayers be made through guidelines, not legislation. Issue: New section 20C Clause 114 Submissions (42W – KPMG) The submission raises a number of issues concerning the application of new section 20C (which allows an input tax credit in respect of certain supplies between financial service providers): • Item “a” of new section 20C should be redrafted so that it is based on all available deductions for all supplies made by the registered person rather than as it is currently written, which limits item “a” to deductions in respect of supplying financial services. 6 GST and financial services, page 25. 18 • New section 11D should clearly apply to deductions available under new section 20C. New section 11D provides that a registered person must determine whether a customer is eligible to receive zero-rated financial services from statistics obtained from the customer or by using a method that is approved by the Commissioner. In respect of new section 20C, components “d” and “e” of the formula are based on another person’s taxable and total supplies respectively. • The Commissioner should be able to approve a method to determine the fraction d/e. It is arguable that new section 11D would not apply to deductions claimed under new section 20C. • In order to reduce compliance costs it is recommended that the Commissioner approve a method of determining supplies made by another party in respect of deductions made under new section 20C. • New section 20C should be redrafted to apply to suppliers of financial services that do not use the turnover method to apportion input tax. Comment New section 20C is intended to apply in a different manner from the general zero- rating rules in proposed sections 11A(1)(q) and (r). The proposed section 20C is in response to submissions that the proposals contained in the discussion document GST and financial services did not adequately address the tax cascade that could arise in respect of supplies between financial service providers. As noted in the discussion document, 7 broadly applying the basic zero-rating rules for supplies between financial service providers could create a tax advantage in respect of supplies to final consumers. This would arise where financial services supplied to an interposed financial institution and on-supplied to the final consumer were zero-rated. As the case for entirely zero-rating financial intermediation has not been made, officials consider exemption is still the most appropriate policy response in relation to taxing business-to-consumer supplies of financial services. The government recognised, however, that denying the zero-rating of supplies of financial services between financial service providers, to the extent that the services are on-supplied to eligible business customers, does not achieve the best policy outcome as a proportion of the tax cascade would remain. For these reasons new section 20C was developed. Provided actual information in relation to business supplies by those financial service providers is obtained, supplies of financial services to recipient financial service providers are able to be recognised in the overall amount of input tax credits claimed by the first financial service provider. Allowing the Commissioner to approve a general method to determine the fraction d/e, such as an industry average, was considered at the time of consultation but officials noted that for the main trading banks alone there is a differential of up to 25 percent in the level of customers that are potentially eligible to receive zero-rating. This variation is expected to be considerably more pronounced across the wider 7 GST and financial services, page 23. 19 financial services industry. Officials therefore consider that an industry average method would not be an appropriate option as the level of relief may not correspond to the activities of the parties concerned. Concerns with accuracy have been integral in developing the proposals to zero-rate business-to-business supplies of financial services. For this reason the deduction under new section 20C must correlate to the activities of the recipient financial institution and their respective ratio of business and non-business customers. New section 11D concerns estimates of supplies that should be zero-rated and is not, therefore, relevant to the application of new section 20C. In relation to the other points raised by the submission: • Whether item “a” of the formula gives the right outcome: Inland Revenue will, in setting guidelines for zero-rating, review the deduction allowed under 20C to determine at a detailed level if it provides the correct policy outcome. While the numerical example provided in the submission appears compelling, it assumes that the GST cost incurred is evenly spread across all activities. This is not always the case. Further, it does not take into account the fact that a taxpayer may adopt a number of methods of apportionment whereby certain costs may be directly attributed to exempt and taxable activities. Officials note that the issue is relevant only for entities that are not solely engaged in the provision of financial services and who are not therefore currently subject to the same level of tax cascading as those who are. • That the formula be re-drafted so that it applies more broadly: New section 20C does not assume that taxpayers use the turnover method of apportioning input tax. The formula is meant to apply broadly across different apportionment methodologies but requires that information be formatted in a particular manner to allow taxpayers to determine the value that can be claimed as a deduction from output tax. The only complexity in relation to the formula is that it requires the appropriate information to be supplied by the direct supplier. This is seen as necessary to ensure that if accurate information is not provided by the direct supplier the deduction will not be allowed. Recommendation That the submission be declined but that in relation to item “a” Inland Revenue should review the practical application of the formula to determine whether it achieves the correct policy outcome. 20 Issue: Base maintenance (1) Clause 104, 115 and 116 Submissions (39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 42W – KPMG) The proposed amendments (which restrict the ability to obtain up-front input tax credits for second-hand goods) could be seen as revenue protective at the expense of consistency with the policy underlying the main zero-rating proposals. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Section 3A(2)(c) should not be amended to deny a second-hand goods notional input tax credit when goods are acquired for the making of supplies that are zero-rated under the main zero-rating proposals. (KPMG) Comment The restriction in relation to the one-off deduction is necessary to ensure that when the principal purpose for goods and services changes from an exempt to a taxable purpose as a result of zero-rating there will not be a significant revenue loss from up- front input tax credits. Rather, the additional input tax credits arising from the new zero-rating rules will be required to be claimed periodically over the period during which the goods and services are used. The restriction in the ability to claim credits for second-hand goods is intended to prevent large one-off input tax credits from the transfer of existing assets (for example, land) from an entity that is exempt to an associated entity that has a principal purpose of making taxable supplies as a result of the new zero-rating rules. Both are, therefore, anti-avoidance measures aimed at protecting the revenue base and are not inconsistent with other anti-avoidance provisions in the GST Act. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Base maintenance (2) Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment is necessary to ensure that supplies of financial services between associated parties are required to be valued at market if the financial services provider is entitled to zero-rate the supply under proposed section 11A(1)(q) or (r) or is entitled to a deduction under proposed section 20C. 21 Comment The GST Act generally requires that supplies between associated persons are valued at open-market value if there could otherwise be an underpayment of GST. This rule is primarily directed at supplies made to unregistered recipients at less than full value. However, if the supplier and the recipient are both registered for GST this general rule is “switched off” as any increase in GST (output tax) returned by the supplier would be matched by an equivalent increase in input tax credits available to the recipient. The transaction in question would, therefore, be revenue neutral from the government’s point of view, and requiring an uplift to market value would impose unnecessary compliance costs for no revenue gain. In respect of supplies of financial services it has previously not been necessary to prescribe a valuation rule as the supplier is generally not required to charge GST on the supply of financial services and the recipient is unable to recover an input tax credit as GST has not been paid. The new zero-rating rules in proposed section 11A(1)(q) and (r), concerning supplies of financial services to businesses, and the deduction allowed under proposed section 20C, in respect of supplies of financial services between financial services providers, change this position. Officials consider that it is necessary to require financial services providers to value supplies of financial services to associated entities at market. This is primarily to ensure that there is no overvaluation of the financial services supplied. Unlike the normal situation when ordinarily taxable non-financial goods and services are supplied between two associated registered persons, the GST consequences created by proposed sections 11A(1)(q) and (r) and 20C are not neutral because of the increase in input tax credits that can otherwise be claimed as a result of removing the exemption of financial services supplied to businesses. For example: • If a financial services provider supplies zero-rated financial services (under proposed section 11A(1)(q) and (r)) to an associated business it will be able to claim input tax credits in respect of supplying those financial services. If the financial services provider apportions input tax credits on the basis of turnover it may inflate the value of services supplied to the associated business with a view to maximising its overall access to input tax credits. The input tax credits claimed in respect of the supply to the associate may, therefore, be greater relative to the size of the tax cascade the reforms are attempting to address. • In the case of proposed section 20C the supplier (the first financial services provider) is able to obtain a further deduction of input tax relative to the value of financial services supplied to another (recipient) financial services provider if the recipient supplies financial services to businesses. If the first financial services provider inflates the value of the services supplied this could also create a larger deduction under proposed section 20C relative to the size of the tax cascade the reforms are attempting to address. Because of these risks, officials recommend that financial services between associated persons be valued at market value if the financial services provider is entitled to zero- rate the supply under proposed section 11A(1)(q) or (r) or is entitled to a deduction under proposed section 20C. This will require an amendment to section 10(3A) of the GST Act to ensure that it does not “switch off” the general rule (that supplies of goods and services between associated person to be valued at market) when supplies of 22 financial services are made between registered associated persons in these circumstances. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: New section 26B Clause 119 Submissions (30 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand Inc, 32 – New Zealand Bankers’ Association, 45W – Promina) • All but Promina submit that new section 26B, which requires wash-up adjustments to the zero-rating calculation, be removed. (All) • New section 26B can easily result in the continual requirement to make adjustments to prior GST periods as and when information comes to light as to the status of the recipient of a supply. The entire zero-rating proposal requires certain estimates/proxies to be established and used as a reasonable basis for determining the level of taxable supplies made by customers who purchase financial services from financial services providers. New section 26B would require banks to constantly determine whether estimates made are accurate, and, if not, to make adjustments accordingly absent any explicit clearance not to do so from the Commissioner. It would not be possible to comply with this requirement. (Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand, New Zealand Bankers’ Association) • Proposed section 26B is supported as it protects taxpayers from penalties and interest until such time as the taxpayer has actual knowledge of the error. However, it should be amended so that an adjustment is only required when the error is detected within four years of the end of the taxable period during which the error arose. (Promina) Comment Proposed section 26B is intended to address situations when differences arise in the level of input tax recovery allowed for a given period based on a taxpayer’s estimation of their zero-rated supplies against what should actually have been claimed for that period. The new section requires an adjustment to be made if a taxpayer has made a return based on supplies made by another person and an inaccuracy in the determination of those supplies has affected the accuracy of the return. If this has resulted in an excessive input tax credit recovery, output tax is payable in respect of the excess. If the result is an under-recovery of input tax credits, further input tax credits are allowed. 23 The Commissioner can relieve the taxpayer from making an adjustment if satisfied that the taxpayer’s estimated amount gives an overall result for zero-rated supplies under sections 11A(1)(q) and (r) that is not significantly greater than the result that would arise if actual rather than estimated figures were used. New section 26B requires the adjustment to be made either in the taxable period in which the inaccuracy becomes apparent or in a later period that is acceptable to the Commissioner. Officials note the New Zealand Bankers’ Association’s concern that it would not be possible to comply with new section 26B since it implies that it is possible to establish an exact, correct figure for zero-rating. Officials also note that, even if it were possible to establish a correct figure, it would need to be established in each case to determine whether new section 26B needed to be applied. This could create significant compliance and administrative costs. Removing proposed section 26B would, in most cases, mean that compliance with the zero-rating provisions had occurred if the taxpayer had applied a method of estimation agreed with the Commissioner under new section 11D. However, the Commissioner would be able to use his or her general power to amend an assessment of a taxpayer’s return in the event that the taxpayer had not applied the method to the Commissioner’s satisfaction, or had not agreed an estimation. Recommendation That the submissions by Investment Savings and Insurance Association and New Zealand Bankers’ Association be accepted. Officials recommend that clause 119, which introduces new section 26B, be removed from the bill. Issue: Drafting issue – grouping rules Clause 122 Submission (44 – MinterEllisonRuddWatts) Section 55(7)(d) should be amended so that both taxable and exempt supplies to a member of a GST registered group are treated as made to the representative member. If this is not done, when a supply of financial services is made to a member of a GST registered group other than the representative member it will not be clear whether or not zero-rating is available. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. GST on imported services: introducing a reverse charge 27 OVERVIEW Clauses 101, 102, 104(1), 105, 106, 107, 108, 109(1), (3) & (4), 110, 113(1)-(4) & (6), 117, 118, 121, 122, 123 and 124 The proposed changes to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act) will introduce a “reverse charge” mechanism to tax certain imports of services. The reverse charge is intended to alleviate the current distortion in favour of imported services created by the non-taxation of imported services compared to the taxation of domestically supplied services. It also aligns New Zealand’s GST system with that of most other countries with a VAT or GST system and the treatment of services with that of goods. The reverse charge will require GST registered recipients of supplies of imported services to self-assess GST on the value of the services if: • the services are not acquired by a person who makes taxable supplies that represent 95 percent or more of total supplies; and • the supply of those services, if made in New Zealand by a registered person, would be a taxable supply. This means that if a registered person has an activity which does not consist of making solely taxable supplies and imports services that would be subject to GST if supplied in New Zealand, the recipient will be required to add GST to the price of the services and return the GST to Inland Revenue. The recipient of a supply of imported services will be treated as the person who made the supply for the purpose of imposing and enforcing the reverse charge and for determining whether the GST registration threshold is exceeded. For all other purposes in the GST Act the recipient of a supply of imported services will remain the recipient, rather than the supplier, of the services. The proposed changes also apply the reverse charge to related party internal charges. Such charges will exclude amounts relating to salaries and interest. Twelve submissions were made on the introduction of a reverse charge to tax imports of services. Two submissions did not support the introduction of a reverse charge, three (two written and one oral) supported the introduction of a reverse charge, and one supported the introduction of a reverse charge as part of a package including reforms to the GST treatment of financial services. Nine submissions made recommendations about the scope of the reverse charge and various other technical issues. 28 POLICY BASIS FOR THE REVERSE CHARGE Submissions (19 – Business New Zealand, 39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) A reverse charge should not be introduced, as: • the substitutability issues it is intended to address only exist theoretically, not in fact; • it will disadvantage GST groups with non-resident members as opposed to solely resident member groups; and • it will add costs (including compliance costs) to New Zealand businesses, especially those in the financial sector. Comment Submissions state that the services that will be subject to the reverse charge are not substitutable, as New Zealand firms do not produce equivalent services, or, because the New Zealand entity is either a branch or subsidiary of an offshore company, it has no choice but to receive the services from offshore. While officials understand these concerns, in most instances there is nothing in the inherent nature of the services supplied which would preclude their supply by a third party in New Zealand. In the absence of the reverse charge, the distortionary effects of not imposing GST on such supplies would therefore remain. Submissions’ arguments on the lack of New Zealand-sourced substitutes for services provided from overseas are based on a static view of the market for services, instead of recognising that the market is rapidly changing. The arguments also do not recognise the possibility that the GST disadvantage New Zealand suppliers face may well be a factor in any potential lack of New Zealand substitutes for overseas services. A reverse charge mechanism based on taxing only specific services with New Zealand substitutes would be extremely difficult to operate – the degree of substitutability of services is often a subjective issue and any list of services would rapidly become obsolete. Such a mechanism would also be inconsistent with the broad-based approach to GST in New Zealand, and may raise questions as to why a similar treatment is not applied to imported goods. Officials consider, in any event, that the exclusions for salary and interest components in intra-group and inter-branch transactions which are, in part, intended to recognise the concerns as to actual substitutability raised by submissions, ensure that mixed offshore-resident groups will not be disadvantaged compared to wholly resident groups. 29 While officials are mindful of compliance costs, the competitive, production and consumption distortions caused by the current exclusion of imported services from the New Zealand GST base justify imposing GST on imported services. The change is also necessary to protect against any future significant erosion of the GST base caused by increases in the volume of imported services as a result of the growth in electronic commerce. We note that the New Zealand Business Roundtable (submission 1W) and PricewaterhouseCoopers (submission 33) support the introduction of a reverse charge, and that the New Zealand Bankers’ Association (submission 32) supports the introduction of a reverse charge as part of a package including reforms to the GST treatment of financial services. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 30 DEFINITION OF “NON-RESIDENT” Clause 101 Submission (18W – Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu) The definition of “non-resident” should be amended to make it consistent with the definition of “resident”. A person is a resident “...to the extent that that person carries on...any \[activity\], while having any fixed or permanent place in New Zealand relating to that \[activity\]”. Therefore a person should be defined as a non-resident to the extent that they are not a resident. Comment Officials agree the change suggested by the submission, which will ensure that the definition of “non-resident” is not broader than intended. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 31 IMPORTED SERVICES AND THE REGISTRATION THRESHOLD Clause 105 Submissions (26 – New Zealand Law Society, 43W – Russell McVeagh) Persons making supplies who are not registered and are below the registration threshold should not be required to register and pay GST on all supplies they make solely because importing services (and being deemed to be the supplier of those services) takes the level of supplies they make over the registration threshold. Comment Under the proposed amendments, supplies of imported services that a person receives are treated as supplies made by that person for the purposes of imposing GST and enforcing liability to GST under the reverse charge. Therefore when the total of a person’s supplies that would be taxable if they were a registered person and supplies of imported services that would be subject to the reverse charge if they were a registered person exceed $40,000 per annum (the registration threshold), the person will be required to register for GST and charge GST on all of those supplies. Submissions use the example of an unregistered business making $38,000 of supplies that would be taxable importing $2,001 of services that would be subject to the reverse charge if the business were a registered person. As services that would be subject to the reverse charge are added to the amount of taxable supplies, and the total value of those supplies is in excess of $40,000, the business would be required to register for and charge GST on all of the taxable supplies it makes, not just the supplies subject to the reverse charge. In comparison, a person making the same level of supplies ($38,000) who purchases $2,001 of services from a supplier in New Zealand is not treated as having made the supply of $2,001 and is, therefore, not required to register for and charge GST. Submissions state that this is inequitable, and that the activity of making taxable supplies should be treated as separate from the importation of services – that is, the person would have two activities, making supplies of goods and services, and importing services. Officials acknowledge that a person in the situation described above importing services will be in a different position than a person purchasing services domestically. This is an accepted result of the use of the reverse charge mechanism proposed for New Zealand, and applied in the European Union, Canada and, latterly, Australia. The existence of boundaries such as the registration threshold means that there will always be perceptions of inequality, depending on which side of the threshold a person falls. 32 The registration threshold is based on judgements about compliance costs and the distortions involved in not taxing supplies of goods and services. While $40,000 is the compulsory threshold, it is open to taxpayers to make these judgements themselves as, provided a taxable activity is carried on, they may choose to register for GST below the threshold. In the situation outlined by submissions the unregistered person purchasing services in New Zealand would be subject to GST on those services – either directly if the supplier was registered, or indirectly through the inability to claim input tax credits (or tax cascades) if the supplier was unregistered. The unregistered person could in fact be in a more disadvantageous tax position as a result of tax cascades than the person who was registered. This is the reason many entities with total supplies under the $40,000 threshold opt to register for GST – in fact around 20 percent of all registered persons with a turnover of under $40,000 are registered. Officials do not, therefore, agree that the difference between the taxpayers below and above $40,000 is necessarily as significant as the submissions indicate. Furthermore, $40,000 per annum has proved to be a practical threshold at which the carrying on of a taxable activity is considered sufficiently large (after compliance cost considerations) to be brought into the GST base. Whether the size of the activity arises from making taxable supplies, importing services or a mixture of both is not in officials’ view a significant consideration. Submissions’ proposal that the recipient of a supply of imported services not aggregate supplies of imported services with other supplies it makes would result in one entity have two separate activities. Officials consider that having two separate activities would add an unjustifiable level of complexity while perpetuating the distortions the reverse charge is intended to remove. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 33 APPLICATION OF SECTION 78 CONCERNING ALTERATION IN GST LAW TO SUPPLIES UNDER THE REVERSE CHARGE Clause 105 Submission (30 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand) Section 78(2) allows parties to a contract to adjust the price in the contract for a change in the GST law. Section 78 should not apply for the purposes of the introduction of the reverse charge. It could allow a non-resident supplier to increase the price charged for services when they are not the party on which the reverse charge is imposed, and therefore not the party which bears the increase in costs brought about by the introduction of the reverse charge. Comment Section 78(2) allows the supplier of the goods and services to adjust the price following a law change. Under the reverse charge, the recipient is treated as the supplier for the purposes of liability for GST and other limited purposes only. Section 78(2) cannot, therefore, be sensibly applied to the reverse charge. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 34 CLAIMING INPUT TAX CREDITS AND MAKING ADJUSTMENTS Clause 105 Submission (26 – New Zealand Law Society) It should be explicitly stated in the legislation that input tax credits are available to, and adjustments are able to be made by, registered persons who have self-assessed GST under the reverse charge. Comment The GST Act allows an input tax credit to a recipient of goods and services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Adjustments by way of output tax are then made in the current or later GST periods to reflect any non-taxable use. Correspondingly, if the goods and services are acquired for a principal purpose other than of making taxable supplies no input tax credit is available other than by way of an adjustment to reflect any taxable use in the current or later periods. This method for apportioning GST costs between taxable and exempt supplies will apply under the reverse charge as for this purpose the recipient of the relevant supply will remain the recipient and not the supplier. Thus, although the GST cost of the imported services will have been charged by the recipient, an input tax credit will be available to the recipient to the extent that the services are used in making taxable supplies. The submission argues that the wording of current sections 3A and 21E(2)(a) would preclude a registered person in the situation above from claiming an input tax credit or making an adjustment for a change in use in respect of that supply. It interprets the words “...tax charged under section 8(1) on the supply of goods and services made to that person...” in section 3A (and substantially similar words in section 21E(2)(a)) as meaning that the tax must have been charged by the natural supplier of the imported services (the non-resident), and not the recipient of the supply who has self-assessed the tax under the reverse charge (the New Zealand resident importer). Officials do not consider that the plain words of the section support the submission’s contention – neither section refers to tax being charged by a person, and tax being charged by a person is not a concept that the GST Act generally recognises. Tax is charged on a supply, and output tax is returned by a person. Officials therefore consider that it is sufficiently clear that input tax credits are available to, and adjustments are able to be made by, registered persons who have self-assessed GST under the reverse charge. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 35 THE REVERSE CHARGE MECHANISM Clause 106 Issue: Remove the recipient’s 95 percent of turnover test Submissions (26 – New Zealand Law Society, 44 – MinterEllisonRuddWatts, 45W – Promina) The test based on the recipient’s turnover (95 percent or more taxable supplies) should be replaced with a test based on the purpose for which the recipient acquired the services. Options submitted are that the reverse charge apply when a service is not acquired for solely taxable purposes, when it is not acquired wholly for the purposes of a taxable activity, or when it is acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. If the principal purpose test were adopted, the change in use adjustment provisions could be amended to ensure that GST is charged to the extent that imported services are not used for taxable purposes. Comment The reverse charge will require GST registered recipients of supplies of imported services to self-assess GST on the value of the services if: • the services are not acquired by a person who makes supplies of which 95 percent or more are taxable supplies; and • the supply of those services, if made in New Zealand by a registered person, would be a taxable supply. This means that if a registered person has an activity which does not consist of making, in effect, solely taxable supplies and imports services that would be subject to GST if supplied in New Zealand, the person will be required to add GST to the price of the services and return the GST to Inland Revenue. The discussion document GST and imported services 8 proposed that the reverse charge apply if a person imported services other than for the sole purpose of making taxable supplies. That is, if the recipient of the services was acquiring the services other than 100 percent for making taxable supplies the import of those services would be subject to the reverse charge. This would require the recipient to consider the purpose for which they had acquired each imported service in order to determine whether they were required to return GST under the reverse charge. They would then have to further consider to what extent they had acquired the services for either taxable or non-taxable activities to determine whether they were entitled to an input tax credit for the supply, and, if so, over what period. 8 GST and imported services: a government discussion document, June 2001. 36 During consultation officials were advised that a test based on the nature of the business, that is, whether the person made, in effect, solely taxable supplies or not, would be a simpler test to apply. The nature of the business is judged according to the supplies the person makes over a twelve-month period – if 95 percent or more of the supplies a person makes in a twelve-month period are taxable supplies the reverse charge will not apply to any services they acquire. Officials consider that the test proposed will remove a significant number of taxpayers from the need to apply the reverse charge while reducing any risk to the revenue base and being less or at least no more compliance cost-intensive than the other methods proposed. The adoption of the 95 percent threshold is based on the de minimis test in section 21(4), which allows a registered person to use goods and services acquired for taxable purposes for a small level of exempt purposes without requiring output tax adjustments to reflect the exempt purposes. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Lower the percentage threshold in the recipient’s turnover test Submissions (26 – New Zealand Law Society, 45W – Promina) Reduce the threshold of taxable supplies in the recipient’s turnover test to either 90 percent or 75 percent. Comment Reducing the threshold of taxable supplies in the recipient’s turnover test below 95 percent, to either 90 percent or 75 percent, would allow registered persons making material levels of non-taxable supplies to escape the application of the reverse charge. The reverse charge is intended to apply to all persons making other than, in effect, solely taxable supplies. Officials consider that the five percent allowance for non- taxable supplies in the test as currently drafted will exclude the majority of entities making solely taxable supplies from the ambit of the reverse charge. As noted in our previous response, the 95 percent figure is also consistent with the exempt supplies adjustment de minimis in section 21(4). Officials do not consider it is valid to compare the reverse charge test with the test for zero-rating of financial services. The test for zero-rating of financial services gives more leeway to the registered person zero-rating services as it must make a “calculated guess” at the status of the taxpayer to which it is supplying services. Seventy-five percent is a high enough figure to allow all entities making predominantly taxable supplies of services to receive zero-rated supplies, without including a disproportionate number of entities making significant amounts of non- taxable supplies. The reverse charge does not require the recipient of the services to estimate the status of taxpayers to whom it is making supplies – the registered person 37 will know the status, be it taxable, exempt or otherwise, of the supplies it is making, so a greater degree of precision is justified. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Target only exempt supplies Submission (43W – Russell McVeagh) The registered recipient’s turnover test should be altered so that the reverse charge will apply when 5 percent or more of a person’s supplies are exempt, rather than when less than 95 percent of their supplies are taxable. Comment The submission states that the reverse charge should only be targeted at persons making supplies of exempt services, as only supplies to such persons cause the distortions that the reverse charge is aimed at removing. While many of the persons that will be subject to the reverse charge will be suppliers of exempt services, the group of suppliers of services targeted by the reverse charge is broader, encompassing all persons making other than taxable supplies. This includes exempt supplies, other non-taxable supplies and final consumption. Adopting the submission’s test would, therefore, narrow the application of the reverse charge and perpetuate some of the distortions intended to be removed. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Insert a de minimis Submission (30 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand) A de minimis threshold should be included in the reverse charge so that it does not apply to supplies under $10,000 in value. Comment Officials consider that a dollar figure de minimis is inappropriate in the context of a reverse charge mechanism, and note that the five percent allowance for non-taxable supplies fulfils a role similar to a de minimis. A dollar figure de minimis leaves the 38 reverse charge open to circumvention by splitting a supply into smaller component supplies which fall below the de minimis. This is especially a risk when related party transactions are involved, as are many of the transactions that will be subject to the reverse charge. Officials also question the suggested quantum of the de minimis – a $10,000 transaction is a significant transaction, especially for medium and smaller registered persons. During discussion of its submission at the Finance and Expenditure Committee meeting considering the submission, the submissioner stated that its proposed de minimis would reduce compliance costs by allowing some leeway for taxpayers to “miss” transactions that might be insignificant in their systems, or not enter their systems, so that the taxpayer would not be subject to penalties. Officials consider that small errors by taxpayers can be dealt with pragmatically under the compliance and penalties rules, instead of adopting the submission’s approach, which would undermine the effectiveness of the reverse charge. Officials are also concerned that there would be an increase in compliance and administration costs with having to identify and itemise transactions under a dollar level de minimis to ensure exclusion from the reverse charge. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The twelve-month period Submission (26 – New Zealand Law Society) Section 8(4B)(b), which will apply the reverse charge if services are acquired by a person who, in a twelve-month period that includes the date of the supply of services, makes supplies of which less than 95 percent in total value are taxable supplies, should be amended so that a registered person can take a reasonable view as to whether they will meet the test in a twelve-month period. Comment Officials agree that the test, as currently worded, will be impractical to apply, as there can be many twelve month periods which include the date of the supply of services, and there is no guidance as to which period should be used. The test will be amended to be consistent with the test for GST registration in section 51 of the Act. This test looks at the end of any month where the total value of supplies in that month and the 11 months immediately preceding that month exceeds the registration threshold. It also allows the use of a test which looks at whether at the beginning of any month where there are reasonable grounds for believing that the total value of the supplies to be made in that month and the 11 months immediately following that month will exceed the registration threshold. 39 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Remove “in New Zealand” from section 8(4B)(c) Submission (30 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand) The reference to “...in New Zealand...” should be removed from proposed section 8(4C)(c) as it is potentially confusing. Comment The reverse charge will apply to imported services if, among other requirements, the “...supply, if made in New Zealand by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by the person, would be a taxable supply...”, as required by section 8(4C)(c). Officials consider the meaning of section 8(4C)(c), and the use of the phrase “...in New Zealand...” in particular, is clear – it is referring to the hypothetical situation of the services in question being supplied in New Zealand, by a hypothetical registered person in the course or furtherance of its taxable activity. If this hypothetical supply by the hypothetical registered person would be taxable, then the services which are being considered, those supplied to the New Zealand registered person which has in the “real world” imported the services, will be subject to the reverse charge. Officials therefore consider that no change is justified to section 8(4C)(c). Recommendation That the submission be declined. 40 COST ALLOCATIONS Submissions (32 – New Zealand Bankers’ Association, Matter raised by officials) • Clause 106 should be amended so that a cost allocation from a non-resident to a resident is subject to GST under the reverse charge. The new provision would treat an allocation of costs from a non-resident to a resident as a taxable supply of services for the purposes of the reverse charge, except to the extent that the cost allocation is consideration for a supply of services to the resident, and therefore already subject to GST under the reverse charge. Note that salaries and interest allocated to a New Zealand subsidiary or branch are excluded in determining the value of the supply under the reverse charge. (Matter raised by officials) • The New Zealand Bankers’ Association submission refers to an officials’ draft provision in relation to cost allocations for possible inclusion in the bill: “(4C) An allocation of costs by a non-resident to a resident is treated as being a supply of services that satisfies section 8(4B)(c) except to the extent that the costs allocated do not relate to consideration provided for goods or services received by a non-resident.” The submission argues that the proposed cost allocation provision should not be introduced, as: – is not necessary because the general reverse charge provisions will tax cost allocations; – is incomprehensible; – will result in GST being charged where there is no consumption in New Zealand; and – will tax imports of goods twice. Comment In some circumstances individual services supplied to a business will not be charged for or identified separately. This may be the case within a group of companies or single multi-national company, where the parent company or head office may, for example, allocate a proportion of its costs to the various parts of the enterprise. The existence of a supply of services may not be easily ascertainable in this situation. The charging of a global sum, or allocation of global costs, does not, however, change the fact that a supply may have been made to which at least part of the costs relate. 41 Thus, in principle, the nature of the charge, be it a global sum or a specific charge for specific services, should not affect the GST treatment of any supplies made. Officials had, therefore, suggested in consultation with the submissioner before introduction of the bill that an allocation of costs from a non-resident to a resident should be treated as a taxable supply of services. The issue was not, however, dealt with in the bill as further consideration was needed as to how it would best be presented. An officials’ draft was provided to the submissioner and this forms the basis of their submission to the Committee. Officials now consider that a provision should be included in the legislation to treat as a supply of services an allocation of costs to a New Zealand resident that is in respect of goods or services provided to a non-resident. This would ensure that a charge by an offshore-related entity is subject to the reverse charge except to the extent that certain excluded amounts are able to be identified. It is important that it be clear that, subject to certain exclusions, an allocation of costs that relates to services indirectly supplied to a person is a supply under the Act. The Act does not deal very well with composite supplies or with the issue of nexus between a supply and any goods and services and there is, therefore, quite a lot of confusion in this area. For example, take the situation of a group with a UK-based parent and a wholly owned subsidiary in New Zealand embarking on an international advertising campaign. The UK parent contracts with a US based PR firm to arrange the production and screening of a series of generic advertisements in all of the countries in which the group operates. In this situation there would, in effect, be a supply of advertising services to the New Zealand subsidiary. However, because the contract is with the UK parent only, it is unclear whether the New Zealand subsidiary itself receives a supply of services for the purposes of the reverse charge. US PR COMPANY UK Co. (Parent) UK(NZ) Co. (Wholly- owned Sub.) Services £ 42 The proposed legislation, as drafted, operates on an assumption that cost allocations are included in the reverse charge as there is an explicit carve-out for interest and salaries. However, following further analysis, officials consider that the intention that cost allocations be subject to the reverse charge except to the extent of any such exclusions needs to be made explicit. The exclusion under officials’ draft section 8(4C) is intended to be limited to cash contributions or other amounts in relation to which there is no underlying supply, and would not, therefore, give rise to the substitutability concerns that the reverse charge is intended to address. Officials agree that its scope is difficult to determine. In addition, cash contributions and the like are generally managed in some other way, such as through the provision of loans, so that the exclusion is arguably unnecessary. Officials therefore propose to remove the exclusion. The submission states that the cost allocations provision will result in GST being charged when there is not necessarily any consumption in New Zealand. It is difficult to determine definitively where all the benefit of a supply accrues – it is just as difficult, in many circumstances, to determine where a service is consumed. This is why the general place of supply rules in section 8(2) of the GST Act are based on the residence of the supplier, with all supplies by New Zealand suppliers treated as resulting in consumption in New Zealand, and the zero-rating provisions fulfilling the role of carving out those specific, listed supplies that are considered to result in consumption outside New Zealand. The reverse charge is based on the same principles as the general place of supply rules in section 8(2). Officials consider that the recommended changes in this report to clause 109 in relation to zero-rating, following a number of submissions on the point, will ensure that services which can definitively be said to be consumed outside New Zealand are not taxed under the proposed cost allocation provision. This is because the cost allocation provision, as with the general reverse charge rule, will be subject to the zero-rating provisions of the Act, as modified. We note that the submission’s concern with regard to a double impost of GST on goods will be removed if the exclusion from officials’ draft section 8(4C) is removed as recommended. Recommendation That officials’ submission be accepted. 43 REGISTRATION OF PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS Clause 106 Submission (18W – Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, 39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The legislation should be amended to ensure that private individuals are not required to register for, and pay, GST when they import more than $40,000 of services per annum, as: • it will impose compliance costs on individuals; • it will be difficult to enforce; • the UK does not require individuals to register for VAT; and • the discussion document GST on imported services stated that such supplies of imported services would not be taxed under the reverse charge. If this submission is rejected the legislation should be clarified to ensure that private individuals are required to register for, and pay, GST when they import more than $40,000 of services per annum. Comment Officials consider that $40,000 is a significant amount of services to import as an individual, and therefore registration for GST, and the compliance costs that this entails, is justified to protect the GST base. An individual importing such a level of services is acting in a manner akin to a registered business, and should be treated as such for GST purposes. We note that this threshold is generous compared to the treatment of imported goods. Officials do not anticipate that there will be many individuals who import in excess of $40,000 of services per annum. As time goes on and technology improves, the requirement to register will be easier to enforce, and the associated compliance costs should also decrease – while at the same time the level of imports of services by individuals could also increase because of improved technology. While the European Union’s VAT framework, of which the United Kingdom is a part, does not generally require private individuals to register for VAT, it recognises the magnitude of the distortions caused by the non-taxation of business-to-consumer transactions and instead requires non-resident suppliers to register for, and charge, VAT on supplies to EU resident consumers. Officials do not consider it is feasible for New Zealand to enforce its GST rules on non-resident suppliers generally, but we do consider that it is possible to require New Zealand resident individuals to register for GST in appropriate circumstances. Officials also note that Canada’s GST Act requires individuals to register for GST in certain circumstances when they import services. 44 Officials note that the discussion document GST and imported services stated only that there would not be a general requirement for private individuals to register for GST, and that it was specifically stated that private individuals who imported over $40,000 of services per annum would be required to register for GST. Recommendation That the submission be declined, and the legislation be clarified to ensure that private individuals who import more than $40,000 of services are subject to the reverse charge. 45 TIME OF SUPPLY RULES Clause 107 Submission (45W – Promina) The new time of supply rule for the reverse charge in section 9(2)(a)(iv) should also apply to supplies within New Zealand. Comment Section 9(2)(a)(iv) will, in conjunction with the existing subparagraphs (i) to (iii), fix the time of supply for a supply of services between associated parties which is subject to the reverse charge at the earliest of: • when an invoice is issued; • when payment is made in respect of the supply; or • the end of the taxable period that includes the date which is two months after the recipient’s balance date for the year the service was performed. This rule modifies the existing time of supply rules by allowing an extra period, until the end of the taxable period that includes the date which is two months after the recipient’s balance date for the year the service was performed, for determining the time of supply of services that are subject to the reverse charge. This rule applies when neither payment has been made nor an invoice received. This extra concessionary period was included after consultation indicated that there would be problems applying the normal associated party time of supply rules to cross- border supplies because of difficulties in obtaining information from offshore associates. Officials consider that these difficulties do not exist to such an extent within an entity in New Zealand as to justify extending this treatment to purely domestic supplies. The time of supply rules are fundamental to fixing an entity’s GST liability, and any changes to the general rules in the Act create the potential for tax planning opportunities and the ability to inappropriately defer GST, as has occurred in the past with certain deferred settlement transactions. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 46 VALUE OF SUPPLY RULES Clause 108 Issue: The associated party valuation rules Submission (30 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand) The associated party valuation rules should not apply to supplies under the reverse charge in any circumstances, or the exclusion from the rules in new section 10(3B) should be broadened to include supplies that contribute to a depreciable cost. Comment The associated party valuation rules in section 10(3) of the GST Act require supplies between associated parties generally to be valued at the market value of the supply. The use of the open market value rule for supplies between associated persons in the context of the reverse charge, however, could lead to an increase in compliance costs and potentially to a revenue loss if tax deductions resulting from the deemed value of supply were taken into account. The valuation of services for which there is no charge could, in particular, involve substantial compliance costs. To minimise any compliance costs and revenue loss, under proposed section 10(3B) the cost basis for supplies between associated parties will be required to be used if the consideration for the supply would be an allowable deduction to the New Zealand recipient under the Income Tax Act. This also applies where the consideration for the supply is nil, but the consideration would have been deductible if it were not nil. This concession is limited to situations where there is no net revenue gained from requiring market valuations, and is limited to cross-border supplies. There is still a general need to ensure that supplies of services between associated parties are not made for consideration that is below market value (which would result in an inadequate amount of GST being collected) in the same way as with transactions within New Zealand. The submission notes that the transfer pricing rules in section GD 13 of the Income Tax Act 1994 provide a discipline to ensure that the correct value is placed on a supply of services. However, the transfer pricing rules are only aimed at ensuring New Zealand firms are not charged an excessive amount for supplies they receive or charge an inadequate amount for supplies they make – they will not apply if a supply is received by the New Zealand firm for inadequate consideration. Therefore officials consider it is important that the associated party valuation rules continue to apply to the extent that there is net revenue gained from requiring market valuations. 47 Officials do not consider that it is appropriate to extend the concession to “supplies contributing to a depreciable cost.” Officials consider that such an extension would be inappropriate as the concession is intended to apply to services, and it is unclear in what circumstances services relating to depreciable costs would not be deductible. Officials therefore consider that the current concession is sufficiently broad, especially when compared to transactions wholly within New Zealand when the associated party valuation rules would apply fully. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Inter-branch supplies Submission (44 – MinterEllisonRuddWatts) Section 10(3B) should be amended so that supplies to branches are given the same treatment as supplies to members of groups. Comment For the purposes of the reverse charge, a branch in New Zealand will be treated as a separate entity, independent of its non-resident parent. Under general law, and under the Income Tax Act 1994, a head office and its branch are generally treated as a single entity, and any transfers of goods or services between the head office and its branch are not generally recognised as supplies. This means that there might not be an income tax deduction for supplies that are recognised for GST purposes, and the valuation rule in section 10(3B) would not be able to apply for inter-branch supplies. Officials agree that inter-branch supplies should be treated in the same way as intra- group supplies for the purposes of section 10(3B). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 48 THE SCOPE OF THE RELATED PARTY SUPPLY EXCLUSIONS FROM THE REVERSE CHARGE Clause 108 Issue: Exclude internal value-added Submission (30 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand) Section 10(15C) (which excludes salaries and interest from intra-group and inter- branch transactions) should be extended to exclude all internal value added in intra- group and inter-branch transactions from the reverse charge. Comment In many instances, charges for services from an associated overseas business will be incorporated into a larger sum. This may be the case, for example, within a group of companies or single multi-national company, where the parent company or head office may allocate a proportion of its costs to the various parts of the enterprise or charge a management fee (referred to as “internal charges”). Section 10(15C) provides that the value of related party services that are to be subject to the reverse charge is reduced by the value of any salary or interest charges from any member of a non-resident company’s group under section IG 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 that form a part of an internal charge. Interest is excluded because, to the extent that it retains its nature as interest, it represents a non-taxable supply which should be excluded from the scope of the reverse charge. Salaries are excluded for two reasons: • Salaries are not generally subject to GST in New Zealand: employees do not charge their employers GST on the services they provide (as opposed to independent contractors) so the salary component of “internal” services within a single entity, or within a group of companies, in New Zealand, will not bear GST. It is acknowledged that the salary component of services provided by third parties (including independent contractors) is subject to GST, and that as a part of the reverse charge reforms, New Zealand branches and subsidiaries are to be treated as separate from their offshore head offices and parents (meaning they are treated as third parties). However, consolidating the entities for this purpose is considered appropriate. • Acknowledging, to an extent, that there may be limited substitutability with related party transactions: although there is nothing inherent in the nature of the services that are provided from a head office or a parent company that would preclude their supply by a third party in New Zealand (such as accounting services and processing services), in many instances the New Zealand branch or 49 subsidiary has no choice but to receive services from its offshore head office or parent, as the offshore entity controls the New Zealand entity. To ensure there is no risk of offshore supplies creating distortions relative to domestic supplies from outside a group, the reverse charge should apply to intra-group and inter- branch supplies. However, to acknowledge that in some instances substitutability is limited, a concessionary carve-out of the salary component of related party charges is allowed. Officials consider that the exclusion of interest and salaries from related party charges is a reasonable concession, and strikes a pragmatic balance between: • the objective of imposing the tax on services that, if not taxed, would give rise to distortions; • the need to ensure that the revenue base is maintained – if internal charges were not taxed imported services could be routed through the offshore-related entity and the reverse charge avoided; • acknowledging that, in some instances involving related party transactions, substitutability is limited; and • the objective of minimising compliance and administration costs, limiting the extent to which the various components of the charge must be identified. Officials consider that other charges, such as internal value added, can too readily include third party elements because they are made up of any number of components. While officials accept that salaries are also open to substitution, they are likely to carry less of an avoidance risk because they involve a single charge. The use of offshore associated entities through which New Zealand entities are able to access supplies from offshore third party entities could very easily undermine the effectiveness of the reverse charge, so it is vital that the scope of the exclusions from the reverse charge is precise and limited. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Definition of a group of companies Submission (30 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand) Section 10(15C) should apply to intra-group transactions between companies in a group under section IG 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. 50 Comment As currently drafted, section 10(15C) applies to intra-group transactions if the non- resident member of the group supplying the services is part of a GST group for the purposes of section 55. However, for the purposes of the interest and salaries exclusions, the section applies to services supplied to the non-resident member (and then on-supplied to the New Zealand resident group member) by other non-resident members of a group of companies under section IG 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. The section should consistently refer to members of a group of companies under section IG 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Extend exclusions to domestic related party supplies Submission (45W – Promina) Section 10(15C) should be extended to apply to domestic intra-group and inter-branch transactions. Comment Section 10(15C) was intended to replicate the treatment of intra-group supplies under section 55 of the GST Act for supplies between non-resident and resident members of groups of companies under section IG 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, while taking into account the aim of taxing most imports of services. That is, the interest and salary exclusions allow internal charges to be disregarded to a degree. Officials consider that the GST grouping rules in section 55, which are aimed at consolidating related companies and thus allow them to disregard internal supplies for GST purposes, are sufficient to cater for domestic intra-group supplies and that there is no need to apply section 10(15C) to domestic intra-group supplies. Section 55 allows certain supplies to be disregarded for GST purposes, while section 10(15C) excludes parts of the consideration for a supply from GST – officials consider that these two approaches are not entirely consistent and it would be confusing and potentially contradictory to have two sets of rules covering the same sort of supplies domestically. Officials also note that the grouping rules in section 55 were intended to reduce compliance costs on groups of companies by not requiring certain supplies of services between members of a group to be accounted for. The change proposed by the submission would, if operated together with section 55, increase compliance costs. 51 However, as signalled in the discussion document GST and financial services, officials will be carrying out a broader review of grouping for GST purposes and will consider this issue during that review. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 52 ZERO-RATING UNDER THE REVERSE CHARGE Clause 109 Submissions (18W – Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, 26 – New Zealand Law Society, 30 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand, 32 – New Zealand Bankers’ Association, 39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 44 – MinterEllisonRuddWatts) The scope of the reverse charge should be narrowed to ensure that supplies of services that would be zero-rated if made in New Zealand will be zero-rated under the reverse charge. Comment Officials have examined the provisions of section 11A (which zero-rates services) to determine which services should remain zero-rated under the operation of the reverse charge. We consider that all zero-rating provisions, except for section 11A(1)(j), should apply fully to zero-rate services subject to the reverse charge. Section 11A(1)(j) zero-rates services “...that are physically performed outside New Zealand or are the arranging of services that are physically performed outside New Zealand...” These services, when supplied to a person in New Zealand, are exactly the services targeted by the reverse charge (for example, computer processing services provided from offshore). Zero-rating all such services would render the reverse charge ineffective. However, not all services within the scope of section 11A(1)(j) should be excluded from zero-rating under the reverse charge. Where the services are provided to a New Zealand resident who is outside New Zealand, and the services are consumed/received wholly outside New Zealand, zero-rating should apply. For example, if a registered sole trader took a holiday offshore, unconnected to their taxable activity, accommodation in a hotel outside New Zealand should be zero-rated. Offshore hotel accommodation provided to a company executive for business purposes should similarly be zero-rated. The application of section 11A(1)(j) should therefore, for the purposes of the reverse charge, be narrowed to allow such services to be zero-rated. Services which are intangible in nature, such as the provision of a legal opinion or feasibility study offshore, for which a New Zealand entity provides consideration in whole or part will, therefore, not be allowed to be zero-rated under the modified application of section 11A(1)(j). They will thus be subject to GST, on the basis that such services cannot be regarded as being wholly consumed offshore. 53 Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part, and section 11A(1)(a) to (i) and (k) to (r) apply to zero-rate supplies of services subject to the reverse charge. That section 11A(1)(j) apply to zero-rate supplies of services subject to the reverse charge where those services are provided to a New Zealand resident who is outside New Zealand, and the services are consumed/received wholly outside New Zealand. 54 CLAIMING INPUT TAX CREDITS – RECORD KEEPING REQUIREMENTS Clauses 113 and 117 Submissions (18W – Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, 30 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand, 32 – New Zealand Bankers’ Association, 39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Taxpayers should not be required to hold the information required by section 24B to justify claiming an input tax credit for a supply subject to the reverse charge, as they have paid output tax on that supply and the input tax credit will be based on the output tax they have paid. Comment Proposed section 24B will require recipients of services subject to the reverse charge to hold sufficient information to ascertain: • the name and address of the supplier: • the date on which, or the period during which, the supply was received: • a description of the services supplied: • the consideration for the supply: • the time by which payment of the consideration for the supply is required: • the amount of the consideration for an intra-group or inter-branch supply which has been excluded from the reverse charge as salary or interest. This information is important as it allows Inland Revenue to verify whether the recipient of a supply of imported services has correctly self-assessed GST on that supply of services. If the recipient has self-assessed and returned output tax on the supply officials consider that any input tax credit they may be able to claim in relation to that supply should be able to be based on that output tax paid. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 55 RECIPIENT AS A BAD DEBTOR Submissions (18W – Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, 39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The recipient of a supply of imported services should not be required to return GST for a supply if they refuse to pay for that supply (meaning they become a bad debtor of the offshore supplier). Comment Submissions contend that GST should be charged on a supply only where consideration has been received for that supply, and that where the recipient of a supply subject to the reverse charge refuses to pay for those services they should not be required to pay GST. Officials do not agree that this is necessarily so, especially with respect to imported services under the reverse charge. When a person receives a supply of imported services they will have consumed the services (unless they “return” those services) and should therefore be taxed on that consumption. Their choice not to pay for those services does not change the fact that they have consumed those services. Proposed section 25AA allows an alteration to output tax paid or input tax deducted in respect of supplies of services subject to GST under the reverse charge when there has been: • an agreed alteration to the consideration for a supply; • a fundamental alteration in the services supplied; or • the services or part of the services have been “returned” to the non-resident supplier (as may be the case with digitised products). Officials consider that section 25AA addresses all of the situations where it is appropriate that the recipient of a supply of imported services be able to alter the amount of GST in relation to such a supply. These are situations in which the value of the consumption that has occurred has been legitimately altered, and therefore the amount of GST that should be paid has altered. Officials also have concerns that GST could be avoided on the import of services merely by refusing to pay for those services and structuring transactions so that payment is received in another form. As a non-resident supplier is involved, identifying and tracing such transactions could be extremely difficult for Inland Revenue. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 56 OUTSIDE NEW ZEALAND Clause 123 Submission (42W – KPMG) “Outside New Zealand”, which is used in section 56B in relation to branches of a company, should be defined using the definition in section 11A(3). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 57 OTHER ISSUES Issue: Transitional provisions Submission (30 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand) Transitional provisions are needed to determine and apportion the time of supply for supplies which are provided on an ongoing basis which span the introduction of the reverse charge. Comment Officials agree that transitional provisions similar to those enacted when GST was first introduced should be used for the introduction of the reverse charge. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Guidelines Submission (30 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand) The Commissioner should issue guidelines on the documentation required to support the valuation of imported services. Comment Officials note that Inland Revenue is drafting detailed guidelines on the application of the reverse charge, which will cover documentation requirements for the valuation of services. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 58 Issue: Management fees for investment vehicles Submission (30 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand) The treatment of funds management services under the reverse charge should be clarified. Comment Under an agreement between Inland Revenue and ISI, the proportion of funds management services that are taxable has been estimated at ten percent of the total charge for the funds management services provided. Officials can confirm that this treatment will also apply to identical services provided by offshore funds managers. Recommendation That it be noted that the treatment of funds management fees under the reverse charge will be the same as that given to domestically provided funds management services. Issue: Terminology used in calculation of tax payable Clause 1B Submission (Matter raised by officials) The terminology used in calculating tax payable under section 20 of the GST Act should be clarified in relation to the definition of “input tax”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Trans-Tasman imputation 61 OVERVIEW Australia and New Zealand are reforming their imputation laws to reduce a long- standing problem of the double taxation of certain trans-Tasman investments, known as “triangular tax”. Australian and New Zealand shareholders of trans-Tasman companies that choose to take up these reforms will be allocated imputation credits representing New Zealand tax paid and franking credits representing Australian tax paid, in proportion to their ownership of the company. However, each country’s credits can be claimed only by its residents. New Zealand is also introducing a new form of grouping for imputation purposes only which Australian companies may also join. This is an attempt to mitigate the problem that imputation credits cannot pass through companies resident in neither Australia nor New Zealand. Submissions have welcomed the reform but hold the general view that this should be only the beginning of further such developments between Australia and New Zealand. Most submissions were of an implementational or technical nature, most of which are supported by officials. 62 IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES Issue: Elections before the law is enacted Submissions (33 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 43W – Russell McVeagh, 39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Inland Revenue should state how Australian companies can take advantage of the new rules before the law has been passed. Alternatively, retrospective attachment of imputation credits should be allowed. Comment Officials do not support the retrospective attachment of imputation credits as information on how Inland Revenue plans to treat elections received before the legislation is passed is on the Inland Revenue website in the trans-Tasman imputation section. Inland Revenue has also agreed to publish those details in an upcoming Tax Information Bulletin. Recommendation That the submissions be declined with respect to the retrospective attachment of imputation credits. Issue: Foreign investor tax credit rules Submission (42W – KPMG) Dividends paid to Australian residents should be exempt from non-resident withholding tax, as is the case in Australia, rather than be subject to the foreign investor tax credit rules. Comment Wherever possible the intention of the trans-Tasman imputation reform was to leave existing New Zealand rules unchanged except to allow Australian companies to join the imputation rules. It was not necessary to amend the foreign investor tax credit rules in any form to allow Australian companies to pay dividends with New Zealand imputation credits attached. Officials therefore do not support the submission as it goes beyond what is necessary to enact the reform. 63 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Third country companies Submissions (14W – Australia New Zealand Business Council, 33 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 43W – Russell McVeagh, 39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Dividends should be able to flow through third country companies without the loss of imputation credits or the deduction of non-resident withholding tax. Alternatively, imputation grouping should be extended to include companies from countries other than Australia and New Zealand. Comment Officials do not support this submission as it would give imputation groups which contain Australian companies an advantage that consolidated groups that can contain only New Zealand companies do not. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Notice period for elections Clause 39 Submission (44 – MinterEllisonRuddWatts) The requirement for 30 days’ notice should apply only where an election has previously been revoked by the Commissioner. Comment The requirement for 30 days’ notice is to give the Commissioner time to process the application, and send information about the New Zealand imputation system to the Australian company to ensure it understands our rules before paying a dividend. The 30-day notice period is, therefore, important with reference to the payment of a dividend. Officials agree, however, that it is of little value with respect to the imputation credit account and therefore agree that it should be lifted in this instance. 64 Recommendation That the submission be declined except with regard to the maintenance of imputation credit accounts when the election should apply from the beginning of the imputation year in which the election is received. Issue: Date of formation of group Clause 15 Submissions (45W – Promina, 39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 43W – Russell McVeagh) Companies should have the option of forming or joining an existing imputation group from the later of: a) The beginning of the imputation year that is 30 days after the notice of election; b) the date the company becomes first eligible to join the imputation group; or c) the date of the election. (Promina) The date of formation of an imputation group should be the later of the beginning of the imputation year in which a notice is received or the date the imputation group was eligible to be formed or at the option of the company, the date of election. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Clarify from when an imputation group is formed. (Russell McVeagh) Recommendation Officials agree that the proposed legislation is not clear about when an imputation group is formed. However, we recommend that the application date for forming or joining an imputation group is the beginning of the imputation year in which the election is made. This is consistent with the other provisions with this reform. Issue: More than one consolidated group to be allowed to group for imputation purposes Clause 45 Submissions (45W – Promina, 39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Imputation grouping provisions should allow for members of more than one consolidated group to group for imputation, and the balances of the existing consolidated imputation credit accounts should be combined into one opening balance for the new imputation group. 65 Comment Officials accept that the proposed legislation envisages only that one consolidated group would wish to be the basis of an imputation group and agree in principle that it should be possible for members of more than one consolidated group to form an imputation group. Officials also agree that combining the balances of the consolidated imputation credit accounts would be the simplest option of making this work. However, it is possible for consolidated groups while currently 100 percent commonly owned to have imputation credits individually with different continuity profiles. For example, assume consolidated group A and B now are both fully owned by C. However, consolidated group A had previously been owned 90 percent by C and 10 percent by D and subsequently C bought out D's 10 percent share. Consolidated group B has always been owned by C. Consolidated group A has a different continuity profile for the credits that arose before the ownership change in a way that consolidated group B does not. Thus it would not be appropriate to allow those credits to be combined in one account. However, if A had no residual credits from the previous ownership structure, and all the current credits in its account arose after C bought out D, there would be no problems with A’s credits being combined with B’s in an imputation group. Officials therefore agree that members of more than one consolidated group may form or join an imputation group when the credits of all the consolidated groups have the same continuity profile. Consolidated groups with different continuity profiles, as in A and B above, should not be entitled to group for imputation until the residual credits with a different profile have been passed to shareholders. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted subject to the credits of the consolidated groups having the same shareholder continuity profile. 66 Issue: Interface with dividend withholding payment rules Clauses 47, 48, 49 and 50 Submissions (43W – Russell McVeagh, 45W – Promina) • The consolidated group rules for dividend withholding payment accounts should be amended to apply to consolidated imputation groups that do not include an Australian company, and a combined DWP account should be able to be used. Any company that maintains an existing DWP account and is a member of an imputation group should have the option of ceasing to be a DWP account company from the later of the start of the imputation year, 30 days after the notice of election and the date the company joins the imputation group. If any company ceases to be DWP account company on the date of election, all the DWP credits should be transferred to the company (or consolidated group’s ICA). (Promina) • Members of an imputation group should be able to transfer imputation credits to their DWP account to the extent that the imputation credits arise from tax on net foreign attributed income. (Russell McVeagh) Comment The creation of imputation groups in the proposed legislation is an attempt to mitigate the ‘third country issue’. As Australian companies cannot maintain a dividend withholding payment account, there is no need to extend the concept to dividend withholding payment accounts or make changes to the dividend withholding payment rules generally. Officials do, however, agree that amendments are necessary to cater for: • crediting and debiting of dividend withholding payments and credits when the individual members of an imputation group or resident imputation subgroup do not have a dividend withholding payment account; and • transfers from individual members’ or the consolidated group’s dividend withholding payment accounts to an imputation group’s imputation credit account. Recommendation That the submissions be declined with the exception of consequential amendments to the consolidated imputation group rules. 67 Issue: Interface with policy holder credit account rules Clauses 47, 48, 49 and 50 Submissions (33 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 42W – KPMG, 45W – Promina) Grouping of policy holder credit accounts only should be allowed. (Promina) The consolidated group rules for policy holder credit accounts in subpart ME should be amended to apply to consolidated imputation groups. (Promina, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, KPMG) If the submission above is accepted then where one or more consolidated groups maintain a PCA they should be able to use a combined PCA based on the individual PCAs formerly used by the consolidated groups. (Promina) Comment The creation of imputation groups in the proposed legislation is an attempt to mitigate the “third country issue”. This is not an issue for policy holder credit accounts as the credits cannot be passed up a chain of companies, so there is no need to make changes to the policy holder credit account rules generally. Officials do, however, agree that amendments are necessary to cater for the fact that transfers need to be able to be made, consistent with the existing rules, to and from individual members’ policy holder credit accounts and an imputation group’s imputation credit account. Recommendation That the submission to allow grouping for policy holder credit account purposes be declined but that consequential amendments be made to the consolidated imputation group rules. Issue: Details of elections Submission (42W – KPMG) The legislation should set out the details of any election notices required under the new Trans-Tasman imputation rules. 68 Comment The legislation prescribes that the election has to be made “in a form acceptable to the Commissioner”, and the current details of what that entails is set out on the Inland Revenue website. As the requirements relate to companies that themselves may have no presence in New Zealand, officials consider it appropriate that the legislation allows the Commissioner to determine what information is needed from an Australian electing to maintain an imputation credit account. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Extending the deemed loss from further income tax payments by Australian companies without an income tax liability Clause 43 Submission (42W – KPMG) The deemed loss that arises when an Australian imputation credit account company cannot use a payment of income tax should also be able to be carried back for that company if it chooses, or grouped with other group companies. Comment The current provisions already provide a benefit to Australian imputation credit account companies that may not generally pay income tax in New Zealand and so may not be able to use the payment of further income tax against a future New Zealand income tax liability. New Zealand companies in a similar position are not given this option, so officials do not support extending this benefit further from wholly owned companies to group companies, as submitted. Additionally, payments of further income tax can be used only against future income tax liabilities, not past liabilities, so officials do not support carrying the payment back to past liabilities for Australian companies. Recommendation That the submission be declined 69 Issue: Post-implementation review Submission (30 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand) A post-implementation review should be committed to and undertaken. Comment For most major tax policy reforms, a post-implementation review is the final stage in the generic tax policy process. The precise timing of such a review is dependent on a number of factors which could include difficulties with complying with the legislation. As it not clear at this stage that there are difficulties with the legislation or any other such factors that would indicate a post-implementation review was a priority, officials do not support the submission. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 70 MINOR TECHNICAL ISSUES Issue: Dual resident companies Clause 39 Submission (44 – MinterEllisonRuddWatts) The exclusion for Australian resident companies treated as resident of another country under a double tax agreement should be narrowed to include only cases where the treaty excludes the right to tax Australian income. This is because that is the effect of the current exclusion for New Zealand dual resident companies. Comment Officials accept that the proposed wording may theoretically exclude companies over which Australia retains full taxing rights on worldwide income even though they are treated as non-resident of Australia under a double tax agreement. Such situations must, however, be rare as the advantage of being treated as non-resident of Australia under a double tax agreement is that Australia no longer has full taxing rights over a company’s worldwide income. On balance, officials’ view is that the value of simpler wording in the proposed legislation for almost all cases outweighs the situation that a company treated as non- resident of Australia over which Australia maintains full taxing rights cannot maintain an imputation credit account. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Other technical matters Clauses 2, 15, 45 and 82 Submissions (14W – Australia New Zealand Business Council, 33 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 42W – KPMG, 43W – Russell McVeagh, 45W – Promina) • Make the legislation clear that a resident subgroup may only have one member. (Australia New Zealand Business Council, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) 71 • The legislation should include provision to join an imputation group – legislation currently provides only for forming. (Australia New Zealand Business Council, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Russell McVeagh, Promina) • Clarify that special rules allowing consolidated groups to transfer balances when forming an imputation group override the current provisions that start a consolidated groups ICA at zero. (Promina) • The 1 October 2003 start date for payment of dividends should not apply to resident companies in an imputation group. The exchange rate provisions for Australian imputation credit account companies should interface with the exchange rate provisions for RWT. (KPMG) • The requirement that an imputation account must be filed whether a return of income is or not should be restricted to Australian imputation credit account companies. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Comment Officials agree that the legislation in the bill is deficient in the area identified in submissions. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Other drafting issues Clauses 9, 45, 47 and 48 Submissions (33 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 14W – Australian New Zealand Business Council, 39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 44 – MinterEllisonRuddWatts, 43W – Russell McVeagh) • Clarify that debits and credits go to the imputation credit accounts of both trans- Tasman imputation group and resident imputation subgroup. (PricewaterhouseCoopers, Australian New Zealand Business Council, Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) • The rules for determining the amount of an Australian dollar dividend should be put in Part M rather than CF as present. Clarify that the imputation credit account should be maintained in New Zealand dollars by Australian companies. (MinterEllisonRuddWatts) • New sections ME 10(1B) and (1D) should be rephrased to ensure the two subsections apply to situations they are intended to apply to. (Russell McVeagh) 72 Comment Officials agree with all the submissions except the request for clarification that the imputation credit account should be maintained in New Zealand dollars by Australian companies. This is because New Zealand imputation credits implicitly represent New Zealand tax paid in New Zealand dollars. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted except for the request for clarification that an imputation credit account be maintained in New Zealand dollars which should be declined. Deferred deduction rule 75 OVERVIEW Clause 14 The bill inserts a new Subpart ES which contains the deferred deduction rule, into the Income Tax Act 1994. The general purpose of the deferred deduction rule is to combat aggressive tax arrangements which provide taxpayers with excessive tax advantages. The tax savings occur regardless of the success of the arrangement. While the central problem with the arrangements in question is of asset valuation, targeting valuation is difficult in practice, given that the forecasts of income that underpin such valuations are inherently difficult to verify or challenge and are very subjective. The asset valuation question arises particularly where the purchaser is only contingently obliged to pay for the assets in question. Hence, the deferred deduction rule focuses on loans that the taxpayer is only contingently at risk of having to repay. Eight submissions on the proposed rule were received. They generally expressed concern about the scope of the rule and any potential for it to apply to genuine commercial activities. This concern has been expressed throughout the policy design phase of the deferred deduction rule, and the rule has been repeatedly modified in light of these concerns. Further modifications are proposed by officials to ensure that the deferred deduction rule does not apply to genuine commercial activities. Officials do not believe these proposals will necessarily stop all future schemes. Given the level of ingenuity and modus operandi of some tax advisers, it is possible that variations of today’s schemes that circumvent these rules will emerge in due course. This leads to two conclusions, that: • these rules will need to be monitored to ensure they apply to, and only to, appropriate transactions; and • that the general anti-avoidance rule should continue to apply whether these rules apply or not. 76 USE EXISTING POWERS Clause 14 Submission (7 – Screen Production and Development Association, 30 – Investment, Savings and Insurance Association, 33 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The deferred deduction rule is not necessary and existing legislation provides sufficient powers to attack offensive schemes. Comment The reference to existing legislation is presumably to the anti-avoidance provisions. The deferred deduction rule will overcome a number of difficulties being experienced with invoking the anti-avoidance provision. There is general uncertainty about the scope of the anti-avoidance provision. To date, Inland Revenue has been successful in combating a number of aggressive tax arrangements. However, it must be noted that a number of arrangements still need to be tested in court. One large case (the second largest alleged avoidance case) is currently before the High Court. Officials consider that there is some doubt about whether some of the targeted arrangements will constitute tax avoidance. The deferred deduction rule will be more certain in its application to aggressive tax schemes than the existing anti-avoidance provision is. In particular, one targeted arrangement (the largest alleged avoidance case) yields deductions of $70 million per year over 40 or so years. The fiscal risk if this is found not to be tax avoidance is very high. The substantive issues are due to be heard in the High Court early next year. Inland Revenue generally finds out about aggressive tax arrangements only after investors’ tax returns are filed. Under the current voluntary compliance tax system, a tax audit may not be carried out until a few years after a return is filed. There are often, therefore, significant delays before the tax can be recovered if the arrangement is considered to amount to tax avoidance. Under the deferred deduction rule, the investor will not be able to claim deductions if the arrangement meets the criteria for the rule. This should limit investors’ exposure to the anti-avoidance rule. From a practical perspective, a number of investors are surprised when Inland Revenue not only suggests that deductions under certain arrangements should be disallowed, under either technical or anti-avoidance grounds, but that penalties and interest might also apply. The compliance costs and stress faced by investors when an arrangement is audited should not be underestimated. The rule will also allow a major saving of Inland Revenue’s resources. To date, all of these arrangements have been found to constitute tax avoidance, but current resources used in identifying the cases and testing for tax avoidance can be deployed elsewhere. 77 The deferred deduction rule aims to: • protect the revenue base; • allow more efficient use of Inland Revenue’s resources; and • remove, in terms of the individual investors in these arrangements, unexpected exposure to interest and penalties on any resulting unpaid tax. It would therefore ensure that the tax system operates more efficiently and effectively. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 78 SCOPE OF THE DEFERRED DEDUCTION RULE Issue: Abusive tax arrangements Clause 14 Submission (2W – Brookfields Lawyers, 7 – Screen Production and Development Association) The deferred deduction rule should be restricted to abusive tax arrangements. Comment The deferred deduction rule has been crafted to be objective. A subjective rule, which would suffer from most of the difficulties of the existing anti-avoidance legislation, would not enable the previously listed objectives to be met. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Commercial reality Clause 14 Submission (39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) An additional test focusing on the commercial reality of an arrangement should be added to the gateway. Comment The deferred deduction rule has been carefully designed to provide objective tests for determining when the rule should apply and when it should not. Various submissions (in relation to the issues paper that was published previously, as well as to the bill) have identified various arrangements that could be caught, and each has been carefully considered in relation to whether the rule should apply to it or not. Changes have been made to the rule since the issues paper was published, and further changes are recommended in this report, to ensure that the rule does not apply inappropriately to commercial activities. 79 Inserting a gateway that focused on “commercial reality” is not appropriate because it would require a subjective decision to be made, which leads us back to some of the problems of applying the present anti-avoidance legislation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 80 SPECIFIC EXCLUSIONS Issue: Films Clause 14 Submissions (7 – Screen Production and Development Association) The deferred deduction rule should not apply to the film and television industries. Timing of the introduction is wrong for the film industry, given the present government consideration of the film industry. The deferred deduction rule will make raising finance for films and television difficult. Comment The film industry is already subject to a variant of this rule, which will be repealed as part of the deferred deduction proposals. The deferred deduction rule is a more refined version of this old rule and applies generically to all structures that use funding that is economically limited recourse. The timing of this tax bill in relation to the other government film initiatives is coincidental. Officials have been working on the issue for some years. Some participants in the film industry have utilised structures that are explicitly targeted. An example of this that is in the public arena is the film “Kids World”. Inland Revenue is aware of several other examples. The rule might make the raising of funds more difficult, but this will only be where the arrangement seeks to leverage off the tax base. Officials consider the rule should apply consistently to all taxpayers and see no reason to exclude film and television industries from the rule or to otherwise differentiate them, from other industries. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 81 Issue: Acquisition of shares Clause 14 Submission (2W – Brookfields Lawyers, 39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Share purchases should be excluded from the scope of the definition. Comment Officials are aware of investment products in relation to the acquisition of portfolio investments (less than 10 percent interests) in listed companies where the funding arrangements would be included in the bill’s definition of “money that is not at risk”. These products are not the type of arrangement that the deferred deduction rule is targeted at. Officials therefore recommend that an arrangement for the acquisition of a portfolio investment in a listed company should be added to the list of excluded assets. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in respect of portfolio investments in listed companies. Issue: Share purchase schemes Clause 14 Submissions (2W – Brookfield Lawyers, 39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Employee share purchase schemes should be removed from the scope of the deferred deduction rule. Comment Again, employee share purchase schemes are not a type of arrangement that is targeted by the deferred deduction rule. Officials agree with the submission that they should be removed from the scope of the deferred deduction rule. The exclusion would apply to sales of shares where a benefit to the purchaser is to be taxed under section CH 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Section CH 2 provides for the tax treatment of benefits conferred on a taxpayer in respect of the taxpayer’s employment or service, under an agreement to sell or issue shares in a company. 82 Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Interest paid on money that is not at risk Clause 14 Submission (44A – MinterEllisonRuddWatts) The deferred deduction rule should not apply where interest is paid on money that is not at risk and that creates a loss. Comment The mere payment of interest will not bring a transaction into the scope of the rule. Other features would have to be present as well, including the “money not at risk”. Further, there are difficulties with tracing interest and suggesting that it is not subject to the rule. The corporate interest deduction rules that were enacted in 2001 were partially predicated on the view that it was not always possible to trace interest payments through a group of companies because of the fungibility of money. There is no reason to believe that these difficulties do not exist still. Therefore, officials do not support this submission. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: 50 percent threshold Clause 14 Submission (7 – Screen Production and Development Association) One criterion for the deferred deduction rule is that the money that is not at risk in the arrangement is 50 percent or more of the total cost of arrangement property. The 50 percent ratio is too low and should be increased to 75 percent (or at least 61 percent). 83 Comment As the submission points out, a ratio of 75 percent would allow investors to make tax savings in excess of the money they invested, regardless of the success of the project. Accordingly, officials do not support this submission. The 61 percent alternative is carefully calculated to ensure that the tax base protects investors from any risk by ensuring they get their investment back as a tax refund. Officials consider both options to be inappropriate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Consolidation approach to measuring property Clause 14 Submissions (44A – MinterEllisonRuddWatts) Where borrowing is at one level and is used to acquire equity in another company, the provisions should allow for that other company’s assets to be considered in measuring the 70 percent test. This is of concern in terms of the potential for the section to have unintended consequences. Officials are asked to confirm what they are trying to achieve by section ES 1(3)(c) (consolidation accounting) and whether they have received quality financial accounting advice to the effect that the language used achieves the desired result. Comment Section ES 1(3)(c) ensures that the total cost of the property held by the investor and any affected associated persons is calculated on a consolidated basis. The purpose of this is to allow all relevant assets to be counted, while preventing double counting of intra-group assets, liabilities and equity. This will address explicitly the issue identified in submission 1, indirect ownership of property, as long as the “other company’s assets” constitute property that is subject to the arrangement. 84 The example from the commentary on the bill that illustrates this is reproduced below. Example 5: Determining whether the rule applies Tom puts $10,000 of his own money into a scheme-specific loss attributing qualifying company which in turn invests into a partnership of such companies. The partnership uses $7,000 of this to plant trees and obtains a deduction for it in year one. The balance is used as part payment for the land on which the trees are grown. The arrangement provides that the promoter will sell to the partnership land on which to grow trees. This land will cost $12,000 per partner. Because the partnership cannot afford to pay for the land in full, the promoter arranges a loan of $9,000 per partner. This results in the investors actually not being at risk of having to repay this finance from their non-scheme assets. In economic terms, the loan is limited recourse against the scheme’s assets and income. The cash flows and tax deductions, ignoring interest, are summarised below. Excess allowable deductions – section ES 1(1)(b) Section ES 1(1)(b) requires the allowable deductions of the investor and affected associated persons to be to be considered together. In the example, the loss attributing qualifying company, and the partnership of such companies are affected associated persons. The partnership of loss attributing qualifying companies does not have allowable deductions because section HD 1(1)(b) provides that there is no joint assessment for partnerships. Each partner takes into account their share of the allowable deductions incurred by the partnership. Allowable deductions claimed by Tom and the company are: Tom: $7,000 Loss attributing qualifying company: $7,000 Total: $14,000 However, section ES 1(2) provides that a loss arising under section HG 16(1) is ignored to the extent necessary to prevent double counting. The deduction claimed by Tom is attributed to him by the company, and is ignored to prevent double counting. Therefore, in the first year that Tom acquired an interest in the arrangement, the arrangement’s allowable deduction is $7,000. Gross income from the arrangement is nil, so the arrangement satisfies section ES 1(1)(b). Tangible property test – section ES 1(1)(c) The rule applies only if less than 70 percent of the property that is subject to the arrangement is tangible property that is land, buildings or major plant and machinery. “Land” means the surface of the ground, and anything attached to it. For the purposes of determining whether the property of the arrangement is tangible property: • the property is measured at cost (refer to section ES 1(3)(a)); • the investor and any affected associated persons are considered together as a group (refer to section ES 1(3)(b)); and • the cost of the property is calculated on a consolidated basis for elimination of intra-group balances, equivalent to that used for companies under generally accepted accounting practice in New Zealand (refer to section ES 1(3)(c)). 85 The investor and affected associated persons who are considered as a group are: • Tom; • the loss attributing qualifying company; and • the partnership of loss attributing qualifying companies. Tom owns the shares in the loss attributing qualifying company which is a partner in the partnership of like companies. The partnership owns land (including trees). Under consolidation principles, the $10,000 capital Tom holds in the loss attributing qualifying company needs to be eliminated. Likewise any capital or advances from the company to the partnership need to be eliminated. After consolidation, all of the property of the arrangement consists of land (including trees), so the deferred deduction rule does not apply. Officials recognise that such consolidation, in particular between individuals and their companies, is not a familiar concept. Officials consider that the following clarifications should be made: • It should be made clear that it is only the investor’s percentage interest in the assets and liabilities of the arrangement that is consolidated. Put another way, assets and liabilities should be consolidated on a proportionate basis as espoused in Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 25 or any replacement thereof. • Affected associated persons should include all shareholders and their loss attributing qualifying companies. This is appropriate because losses of those companies are attributed to all shareholders, not only those that own more than 25 percent of the shares (the section OD 7(1)(b) associated persons rule). • The date on which the assets and liabilities and the money that is not at risk are consolidated should be the latest balance date adopted by the investor or an affected associated person. Recommendation That the submissions be noted and the officials’ proposals be accepted. 86 PROMOTER Issue: Scope of the definition Clause 14 Submissions (2W – Brookfields Lawyers, 7 – Screen Production and Development Association, 33 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 44A – MinterEllisonRuddWatts) The definition of “promoter” is too wide and should be narrowed. In particular, ICANZ suggests that the definition be restricted by a requirement that there should be a specific minimum number of investors in an arrangement. (All) The definition of “promoter” should be confined to situations where there are one or more passive investors. (Screen Production and Development Association) Comment Officials agree that the scope of the definition of “promoter” is wide. Consideration has been given to limiting the scope of the definition by placing a requirement for a particular number of investors in each arrangement, but this suggestion is not appropriate for the deferred deduction rule. From a compliance perspective, such a requirement would lead to uncertainty because one investor may not necessarily be aware of others in an arrangement. There is also the issue of what would constitute “the same arrangement” as minor changes to the terms of an arrangement could be made in order to avoid the numerical requirement. Further, there is already some evidence that promoters are amending their schemes to ensure that the recently enacted promoter penalty rules, which require a minimum number of investors, cannot apply because they simply have one fewer investor than the minimum number required. Thus officials conclude that a numerical requirement should be effective against the widely held schemes, but will encourage, as an alternative, more tailored arrangements that will simply avoid the rule by having one fewer than the number of investors specified. In a number of cases it will be difficult to identify a “passive” investor. At the least, the investment entities are required to be in business. Limiting the definition of “promoter” to circumstances where there was one or more passive investors would not necessarily catch all targeted arrangements. 87 In order to allay some of the concerns expressed in the submissions, officials recommend that the definition be limited so that it applies only to a person who sells, issues or promotes an arrangement. This will also have the effect of simplifying the definition. It will not be necessary to include the exclusions from the definition that are currently in the bill as they will be unnecessary given this change. Recommendation That the submissions be noted, and that officials’ recommendation that the definition be limited to persons who sell, issue or promote an arrangement should be accepted. Issue: Advisors to financiers Clause 14 Submission (2W – Brookfields Lawyers) Professional advisors to a financier who is not a promoter should be excluded from the definition of “promoter”. Comment Under the bill it would be possible for an advisor to a financier to satisfy the definition of “promoter” if the advisor was significantly involved in formulating the arrangement. However, if officials’ recommendation in the previous submission is accepted, it will not be possible for such an advisor to be a promoter unless he or she is involved in selling, issuing or promoting the arrangement. Therefore, if that recommendation is accepted, no further action will be necessary. Recommendation That the submission be noted, but if officials’ recommendation in relation to the previous submission is accepted, no further action is necessary. 88 “MONEY THAT IS NOT AT RISK” Issue: Commerciality Clause 14 Submissions (2W – Brookfields Lawyers, 39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Certain financing arrangements included within the definition of “money that is not at risk” can be explained commercially and should not be included in the scope of the definition. Comment Officials accept that a number of financing arrangements that result in money not being at risk can be explained commercially. However, the money not at risk criterion is only one of the qualifying criteria for the deferred deduction rule. The rule will operate only where all the criteria set out in the proposed section ES 1 are present: • the arrangement has a promoter, • the arrangement produces losses in its early years, • the money that is not at risk constitutes 50 percent or more of the net arrangement assets of the investor and associated persons, and • the arrangement is other than an investment of 70 percent or more in tangible property that consists of land, building, or major plant or machinery. In particular, the fourth bullet point is key to targeting. Officials propose, as a result of submissions, to extend the categories of assets to which the rule will not apply. Thus the scope of the deferred deduction rule must be considered as a whole, not simply on the basis of the definition of “money that is not at risk”. It is crucial to the effectiveness of the deferred deduction rule that all funding that is, in effect, limited recourse is potentially subject to the rule. While other criteria have the effect of limiting the scope of the rule, it is not appropriate to narrow the definition of “money that is not at risk”. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 89 Issue: Consultation Clause 14 Submission (44A – MinterEllisonRuddWatts) Special consultation with banks and other financial institutions is desirable if it has not already occurred. Comment There have been a number of discussions with lawyers who are familiar with issues faced by financial institutions. The deferred deduction rule has been modified as a result of comments made. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: “Substantially similar economic effect” Clause 14 Submission (2W – Brookfields Lawyers) The extension of the definition of “money that is not at risk”, to a loan that has a substantially similar economic effect as the other elements of the definition, reduces the clarity of the provision and should be removed/replaced. Comment It is not possible to define precisely “money that is not at risk” because of the variety of funding arrangements that could be used to ensure that an investor may not be required to repay amounts owing. The definition therefore focuses on: • loans that are explicitly or economically limited recourse; and • loans where interest or repayments of principal are not required for ten years. To prevent the deferred deduction rule being circumvented, it is also necessary to include any other loans that have a similar effect. The tenor required in drafting the “catch-all” provision is loans that have a substantially similar economic effect. Officials consider that no amendment is appropriate or required. 90 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Materiality Clause 14 Submission (39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Section ES 2(4) should be removed. Comment Subsection ES 2(4) relates to loans where interest or repayments of principal are not required for 10 years (long-term loans). Subsection ES 2(4) provides that, for the purpose of determining whether a long term loan is “money that is not at risk”, a payment is not treated as being material to the extent it is made for a purpose of defeating the intention and application of this subpart. The submission argues that section ES 2(4) is illogical, tautologous and unnecessary. It points out that the element relating to long-term loans contains a materiality test, so if a payment is not material it is disregarded. If a payment is material then, by definition, it says there is no mischief and the loan is ordinary financing. Officials disagree. Subsection ES 2(4) will apply when what appears to be a material payment is made, but in such a way that the intent and the application of the deferred deduction rule is defeated. An example could be where it appears that a material payment has been made, but in fact the investor is not actually bearing the cost of the payment because the amount of the “payment” is being added to the money that is not at risk. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 91 Issue: Grants and government loans Clause 14 Submission (7 – Screen Production and Development Association) Grant-related suspensory loans, and loans from the Film Commission, the Film Fund Trust, New Zealand on Air and other government agencies should be specifically excluded from the definition of “money that is not at risk”. Comment At issue is the nature of these “loans”. These are generally, in effect, limited recourse loans, being repayable only if the project is successful. However, there are arguments that at least some of them are more in the nature of a grant than a loan. For example, the Film Commission accounts for its “loans” as if they were grants. Deductions for expenditure incurred are generally reduced when the expenditure is funded from grant-related suspensory loans or government grants to business. It may be appropriate for the “loans” to be excluded from the definition of “money that is not at risk”. However, this will be the case only if the “loan” is treated as a grant. Officials therefore are considering an amendment to clarify the tax treatment of these “loans”. The definition of “money that is not at risk” should not, at this stage, be amended to exclude government grants to business, grant-related suspensory loans, and loans from the Film Commission, the Film Fund Trust and New Zealand on Air. Further consultation is to take place on this issue. This is planned over the next six months, with any resultant amendments being introduced in a later tax bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined at this stage. Issue: Non-resident financiers Clause 14 Submissions (7 – Screen Production and Development Association, 26 – New Zealand Law Society, 44A – MinterEllisonRuddWatts) Exclusions from “money that is not at risk” should not be limited to lenders who are tax resident in New Zealand but should be expanded to cover loans made on arm’s length from all lenders (including offshore lenders). (New Zealand Law Society) 92 Overseas banks should qualify if they met certain specified criteria. For example, the exclusion from “money that is not at risk” could apply to banks that are listed on a recognised overseas stock exchange, are subsidiaries of companies that are listed on a recognised stock exchange, or are resident in countries with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement. (Screen Production and Development Association) The exclusion from “money that is not at risk” should be extended to banks and insurance companies registered and tax resident in grey list companies. (MinterEllisonRuddWatts) Comment Loans are excluded from the definition where the terms are on an arm’s length basis, and the lender regularly lends money on arm’s length terms and carries on business in New Zealand. This is on the basis that, where appropriate, enquiry can be made of the lender. In contrast, loans from some overseas lenders may be difficult to verify. Further, some overseas entities that call themselves banks may not, in fact, be banks. For example, the state of Delaware in the United States allows any company incorporated there to call itself a bank. Such an entity was used in the mass-marketed scheme “Kids World”. Accordingly, officials do not agree that the definition should be amended, at least at this stage. Recommendation That the submissions be declined, but the issue be kept under review. 93 ORDERING OF DEDUCTIONS Clause 14 Submissions (26 – New Zealand Law Society, 39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 42W – KPMG) Allow deductions for expenditure funded from investors’ contributions before applying the deferred deduction rule. Comment Officials consider that the fungible nature of money could make this approach too uncertain and complex to be of practical value to investors. Allowing the “at risk” money to be deducted first may also enable promoters to design arrangements that avoid the rules. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 94 APPLICATION Issue: Existing schemes Clause 14 Submissions (7 – Screen Production and Development Association, 26 – New Zealand Law Society, 33 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 42W – KPMG, 44A – MinterEllisonRuddWatts) The deferred deduction rule should not apply to existing schemes. Comment The bill provides for the deferred deduction rule to apply to future deductions claimed by existing arrangements, but in more limited circumstances than for new arrangements. Not only must all the criteria for the deferred deduction rule be present before the rule would apply to an existing arrangement, but the rule would apply only where a significant portion of the deductions (70 percent) claimed arise in respect of fixed life intangible property or computer software; or where there is a reasonable understanding by investors that there are ten or more investors. This further restriction should ensure there is no impact of the rule on existing arrangements that do not breach these criteria. Officials consider that the deferred deduction rule should apply to future deductions relating to existing arrangements that breach these criteria, because of the nature of those arrangements and the revenue cost involved. One series of arrangements, which may or may not constitute tax avoidance, has a fiscal cost of $70 million per year, and will continue to do so, if it is found to comply with tax law, for the next 40 or so years. These arrangements will go before the High Court early next year. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Criteria for existing schemes Clause 14 Submissions (44A – MinterEllisonRuddWatts) There is no principled basis for a distinction between arrangements with ten or more persons and arrangements with fewer than ten persons. That criterion should be omitted from the application provision. 95 The criteria for the rule applying to future deductions from existing arrangements should be that a significant portion of the deductions (70 percent) claimed arise in respect of fixed life intangible property or computer software, and there is a reasonable understanding by investors that there are ten or more investors. In the bill these criteria are alternatives. Comment The only policy reason for these limitations is to mitigate the effect of the rule on existing arrangements. Officials agree that the limitations are arbitrary. They serve to narrow the transitional impact of the proposed rule. In principle, all future deductions from existing arrangements should be subject to the rule according to the main criteria. Officials agree that the number “ten” is arbitrary, but a criterion such as this is needed. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 96 REPEAL OF SECTION DK 1 Clause 13 Submission (7 – Screen Production and Development Association) Section DK 1 should be retained and loans that are subject to section DK 1 should be excluded from the definition of “money that is not at risk”. Comment Section DK 1 partially reflects current policy in relation to film expenditure – that no deduction should be allowed to the extent that it is financed by way of limited recourse loans. However, the scope of the section DK 1 limited recourse rule is too narrow for this policy to be effective. The deferred deduction rule is more generous than section DK 1, even though its definition of “money that is not at risk” is wider in scope. Therefore the bill provides that section DK 1 will be repealed when the deferred deduction rule is enacted. As previously discussed, officials consider the film industry should be treated no differently to any other industry. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 97 DRAFTING ISSUES Issue: Clarification Clause 14 Submissions (2W – Brookfields Lawyers, 39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 44A – MinterEllisonRuddWatts) The “70 percent tangible property test” (see section ES 1(1)(c)) needs to be redrafted because it could exclude from the deferred deduction rule any undertaking where the expenditure does not produce property. (Brookfields Lawyers) Section ES 1(3)(a) should make it clear that the point at which the property is valued is the point when it is acquired by the arrangement. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Section ES 3(5) provides that a repayment of “money that is not at risk” should not be counted if it is repaid as the result of a transaction involving the use of put or call options. However, that provision may not work properly because the repayment could, on a literal interpretation of section ES 1(1)(d), cause the deferred deduction rule not to apply. (Brookfields Lawyers, MinterEllisonRuddWatts) Comment The first submission raises the point that expenditure that is immediately deductible may not constitute “property”. For the purposes of this part of the rule it should be regarded as property. With regard to the second submission, the proposed use of “cost” for valuation makes this submission redundant. The third submission raises a valid drafting point. Recommendation That the first and third submissions be accepted and the second submission be declined. 98 Issue: Simplification Clause 14 Submissions (2W – Brookfields Lawyers, 26 – New Zealand Law Society, 44A – MinterEllisonRuddWatts) Section ES 1(1)(c)) is not clear. (MinterEllisonRuddWatts) The use of the word “assumed” in subsections ES 1(2)(a) and (c), and the word “ignored” in subsections ES 1(2)(b) creates uncertainty. The wording of section ES 1(2) should be reconsidered, specifically the use of “assumed” and “ignored”. (New Zealand Law Society) The definition of “money that is not at risk” is difficult to interpret. (MinterEllisonRuddWatts) There are many provisions in the Act that target timing of deductions, notably the provisions contained in subparts EF and EH. It would be desirable to prescribe in what way subpart ES relates to those provisions. (Brookfields Lawyers) Comment Some of the concepts underlying the deferred deduction rule are complex. They are necessary to ensure that the rules target appropriate arrangements. However, consideration will be given to simplifying these concepts and the relevant drafting, if that is possible. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. GST and local authorities 101 OVERVIEW The proposed changes to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 for local authorities were referred to the Finance and Expenditure Committee by the Minister of Finance and Revenue on 18 July for inclusion in this bill. Interested parties were then invited to make submissions on the proposals. Policy objectives Resource Management Act 1991 and Local Government Act 2002 The Resource Management Act 1991 gives local authorities a framework and rules for administering the use of resources in local communities. As part of managing these resources it is necessary to consider what impacts on the wider community may occur on existing infrastructure assets and public goods. When considering a resource consent application a local authority may, provided it is in accordance with the council's district or regional plan, seek a contribution from the applicant. The contribution may be used either directly in connection with the work allowed under the resource consent (such as a public park or “green area” as part of new property development) or help supplement additional costs that may arise from pressure on existing infrastructure (such as additional demands on sewerage and drainage systems or roads). The Local Government Act 2002 applies similar principles in relation to local authorities seeking development contributions from parties undertaking property development within a territorial authority’s area of administration. Goods and services tax GST is meant to tax the consumption of goods and services in New Zealand by final consumers. This is achieved by applying GST to the widest possible range of goods and services supplied in New Zealand so that consumer patterns are not affected. To ensure that only final consumers face the full burden of GST, businesses receive a credit to offset the tax paid on purchases that are used to make supplies on which GST is imposed. Under the GST Act and relevant case law, GST is imposed according to whether there is a sufficient connection between a payment and any supply of goods and services made in return for the payment. This creates a boundary making it difficult at times to determine whether certain payments should be classified as payment for taxable goods and services (consumption subject to GST) or payments that do not attract GST. As outlined in the White Paper on GST, 9 it was noted that local authorities provide goods and services paid for by consumers by way of rates, fees, and other charges. In order that local authorities are treated in a manner consistent with other suppliers of goods and services, the policy intent is that fees and charges by local authorities would be subject to GST. 9 White Paper on Goods and Services Tax, March 1985 pg 14 and 34. 102 Commissioner of Inland Revenue v New Zealand Refining and Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust v Commissioner of Inland Revenue These cases (which have been raised by submissions) concerned whether GST should be imposed on certain payments by the Crown to the New Zealand Refining Company and the Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust. The New Zealand Refining 10 decision concerned whether an amount paid by the Crown to New Zealand Refining Company was consideration for a supply of goods and services to the Crown. The court considered that for GST to apply in respect of the payment made by the Crown it was necessary for there to be a link between the payment and the supply of goods and services from the New Zealand Refining Company Ltd. The court noted that GST is a tax on transactions, not receipts. From the facts in the case, the taxpayer was not contractually induced to keep operating in response to the payments from the Crown. As the taxpayer could arguably have shut down operations at any time, the payment from the Crown did not have the required nexus with any specific supplies made by the taxpayer for GST to apply. The Chatham Islands 11 decision concerned whether GST should be returned on an amount paid by the Crown to set up a trust to administer former Crown activities in the Chatham Islands. The court considered that the GST consequences arising from the payment depended on the legal form of the transaction – not its substance. As the payment from the Crown was not made pursuant to a covenant or other reciprocal obligation, the taxpayer did not make a supply to the Crown. Further, as the payment settled a trust it was not in response to or for the inducement of a supply of any goods and services. Inland Revenue draft ruling Inland Revenue released for public comment a draft ruling 12 which considered the application of GST to contributions made to local authorities under the Resource Management Act. The draft ruling considered the transactions in light of the facts surrounding the contributions and the background of the New Zealand Refining and Chatham Islands decisions. The draft ruling concluded that GST would not apply to financial contributions sought by a local authority in respect of an application for a resource consent. The basis for this was: • The emphasis in the case law on the need for reciprocal obligations between parties before a liability for GST will arise. • There is no direct and identifiable supply made by the local authority that is reciprocal to the payment of a financial contribution. The effect of the draft ruling was limited to the imposition of GST and did not consider the wider implications that could arise in respect of whether a resource consent applicant would be able to claim input tax credits in relation to GST paid on costs incurred. 10 (1997) 18 NZTC 13,187 11 (1999) 19 NZTC 15,075 12 PU0095a & d. 103 This draft ruling departs from Inland Revenue’s current interpretation, 13 which is that the supply of a resource consent, in return for the payment of a contribution by property developer, is subject to GST. If the consideration given by a registered property developer is non-monetary, Inland Revenue considers that the transaction is a barter transaction and that there are, therefore, two supplies that are subject to GST (and potentially corresponding input tax credits). Proposed legislation The proposed legislation confirms that financial contributions are consideration for the supply of goods and services by the local authority and thus treated in the same manner as rates. This is on the basis that the contributions can be regarded as consideration for the supply of goods and services undertaken by the local authority in response to certain activities allowed under the Resource Management Act. The amendment as proposed in the bill will require local authorities to return GST on cash and certain non-cash contributions. To prevent the risk of backdated claims for refunds the legislation applies retrospectively to 1 October 1991 in relation to contributions under the Resource Management Act 1991 (the application date of that Act). In respect of development contributions sought under the Local Government Act 2002, the amendment applies from 1 July 2003 (the application date of that Act). A savings provision has been inserted to ensure that taxpayers that have not charged GST on financial contributions in the past are not required to do so until the date that the proposed legislation is enacted. OVERVIEW OF SUBMISSIONS Opposition to proposed amendment Three submissions oppose the proposed amendment and are generally concerned with the technical basis of the change. Most submissions disagree with the amendment in light of the New Zealand Refining and Chatham Islands decisions. Submissions also comment on the practical difficulties that the proposed amendment will impose on local authorities, including the cash flow cost and that it may restrict local authorities’ ability to seek contributions. Alternative proposal The Society of Local Government Managers and Local Government New Zealand has proposed an alternative amendment that it believes addresses its members’ concerns and those of the government. 13 Binding ruling BR97/12 104 Remedial GST amendments Three submissions were also received on the remedial amendments referred to the Finance and Expenditure Committee concerning the GST treatment of late payment penalties imposed on local authority rates. Two of the submissions questioned the scope of the proposed amendment. One submission raised an issue concerning the GST treatment of postponed rates. 105 GST AND CONTRIBUTIONS MADE UNDER THE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ACT 1991 Issue: Oppose proposed amendment Submissions (12W – PricewaterhouseCoopers on behalf of the Auckland City Council, 31 – Society of Local Government Managers and Local Government New Zealand, 33 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Submissions oppose the proposed change and submit that it should not proceed. Specifically, they question the technical basis of the proposed amendment for the following reasons: • The proposed amendment extends the application of GST beyond its statutory scheme. GST is a tax on transactions, not on receipts. Further, there must be reciprocity between the supplier and recipient for a GST liability to arise. As such, a liability for GST should arise based on the contractual form of the transaction rather than its economic substance. These principles are supported by the Court of Appeal cases Commissioner of Inland Revenue v New Zealand Refining Company Limited and Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust v Commissioner of Inland Revenue. These principles mean that when an applicant makes a financial contribution there is no supply made by the local authority that is reciprocal to the payment of the contribution. Inland Revenue has in an exposure draft supported theses principles and signalled that the correct view of the law is that GST does not apply to financial contributions. (All) • The coercive power exercised by local authorities in their administration of the Resource Management Act 1991 should be viewed as a form of taxation. This emphasises that there is no element of reciprocity when a contribution is paid to a local authority. The contribution is therefore no more a consideration for the supply of goods and services that any other tax. (Society of Local Government Managers and Local Government New Zealand, PricewaterhouseCoopers) • No policy reasons have been advanced to explain why the ambit of the GST Act should be extended. Adjunct amendments such as the one proposed here undermine the purpose and statutory scheme of the legislation and create difficulties in interpreting the legislation. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) 106 • The proposal is inconsistent with development contribution schemes operating in Australia and in the United Kingdom. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) For these reasons financial contributions should remain outside the scope of the GST Act. The proposed amendment is therefore not a “clarification” of the current law but the imposition of a new tax. Comment Officials’ comments are as follows: • As noted by Local Government New Zealand and Society of Local Government Managers, the GST treatment of financial contributions is not clear. • The proposed new section 5(7B) confirms the policy principle, as expressed in the White Paper on Goods and Services Tax that local authorities provide goods and services paid for by way of rates, fees and other charges. To ensure that no distortions arise between the treatment of goods and services supplied by local authorities and private sector providers of those same goods and services, GST should apply to local authority charges. • The New Zealand Refining Company Limited and Chatham Islands cases concerned the treatment of payments by the Crown to taxpayers and naturally reflected the current law, rather than necessarily the appropriate policy outcome. • Even if submissions are correct in viewing financial contributions as a form of tax, the application of GST is not unique when the tax relates to the provision of goods and services. For example, GST applies on goods and services which have been subject to duties, excises, levies (such as ACC), and statutory licence fees. The only tax in relation to which GST does not apply to is income tax. As noted by the Advisory Panel on Goods and Services Tax in its 1985 report, GST could apply to income tax but doing so would not have any practical meaning as the additional revenue would, in principle, be used to reduce the amount of income tax payable. • Inland Revenue’s current view is that GST applies; the view noted by submissions was expressed in a subsequent draft public ruling. This draft statement does not reflect Inland Revenue’s view of how the GST Act should be applied in practice. Officials note it is not proposed to finalise the ruling because it would be superseded by the amendment in the bill. However, the ruling would have introduced further complications for local authorities and property developers as outlined in the Society of Local Government Managers and Local Government New Zealand submissions. • While the proposed amendment may be inconsistent with practices adopted in the United Kingdom and Australia, officials note that New Zealand’s GST is not directly comparable. Unlike the VAT/GST systems operated in the United Kingdom and Australia, New Zealand does not exclude local authority activities from the GST base, as is the case in the United Kingdom, or exclude state and local body taxes, as is the case in Australia. 107 Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Retroactive application and revenue risk Submission (31 – Society of Local Government Managers and Local Government New Zealand) It is not necessary to make the proposed amendment retroactive. As far as the submissioner is aware, no local authority has sought a refund of GST previously returned on a financial contribution. In any event, if the local authority did receive a refund it is very unlikely that it would receive any financial benefit as it would have to pay the overpaid GST to the property developer. If fiscal risk is a concern, the government should legislate to confirm the status quo for events that occurred prior to the current bill only, as it is not necessary for financial contributions to be subject to GST on a go-forward basis. Comment Officials note that the GST Act does not require registered persons, as the submission suggests, to pass back GST refunds when GST has been incorrectly paid. Under these circumstances officials consider that there is a fiscal risk. This arises from the fact that currently taxpayers may seek refunds of overpaid GST for periods of up to eight years. While it is expected that most payments of GST on financial contributions have been made by property developers that are registered for GST, local authorities are not required to pass on to the property developer (or other registered person that made a financial contribution) any GST refunds that could be sought. Inland Revenue could seek a corresponding GST adjustment from the developer or other registered person. However, a potential revenue risk would still arise because Inland Revenue may not in some cases be able to enforce an increase to an assessment – for example, if the property developer was facing financial difficulties or had ceased operating. In addition, Inland Revenue is able to reassess back year returns for four years only rather than the eight years allowed to taxpayers. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 108 Issue: Application date Submission (12W – PricewaterhouseCoopers on behalf of the Auckland City Council, 33 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) There is an inconsistency between the application dates of proposed section 5(7B) in respect of contributions made under the Research Management Act because the amendment will apply to financial contributions made from the date of Royal assent of the bill, when GST has not been accounted for by the local authority but retrospectively from the date of application of the Research Management Act, when a local authority has accounted for GST on contributions. By contrast, section 5(7B) will apply to development contributions made under the Local Government Act from 1 July 2003. This is contrary to Inland Revenue’s view of the application of GST to such contributions and will impose a GST liability when there is no statutory requirement to do so between 1 July 2003 and the date of Royal assent. Comment The intention of setting the application date in relation to the development contributions received under the Local Government Act on and from 1 July 2003 is to align the GST treatment of such contributions from the commencement of the Local Government Act. Officials recognise that redressing the tax treatment of development contributions received between 1 July 2003 and the date that this proposed amendment is enacted could give rise to compliance and administrative costs for minimal potential gain. Officials therefore consider that it is appropriate that the commencement date of the proposed amendment in relation to development contributions received under the Local Government Act be change to the date of Royal assent. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted and the application date of new section 5(7B) in relation to development contributions made under the Local Government Act be changed from 1 July 2003 to the date of Royal assent. 109 Issue: Definition of “contribution” – inconsistent treatment and impact on unregistered developers and local authorities Submission (12W – PricewaterhouseCoopers on behalf of the Auckland City Council, 33 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposed amendment provides that a “contribution” required as a condition of resource consent or development contribution is treated as a supply. However, there is a lack of clarification as to what a “contribution” is in the context of the Research Management Act and Local Government Act. It is not a defined term in either Act. While the scope of a contribution is limited by the definition of “development contribution”, the range of conditions that can be imposed under the Research Management Act are extensive. This will create problems for local authorities in terms of how non-monetary contributions in the form of covenants, undertakings, and information disclosures should be valued. It is likely that GST will not be collected from contributions of this nature and this will mean that local authorities will incur a liability to account for GST without the practical ability to collect that amount. Comment The proposed amendment is directed at financial and development contributions that are made in the form of money, land or both. The proposed amendment is not intended to be directed at other conditions that can be imposed under the Research Management Act, such as disclosure of information or provision of works because of the valuation difficulties raised by submissioners. While these conditions could be treated as zero-rated to the extent that they constitute a supply, as is proposed for contributions in the form of land, it is questionable whether they will have any market value. Officials therefore recommend that new section 5(7B) be redrafted so that its application is clearly directed to contributions made in the form of money, land or both. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 110 Issue: Inconsistent treatment and impact on unregistered developers and local authorities Submission (12W – PricewaterhouseCoopers on behalf of the Auckland City Council, 33 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposed amendment creates fundamental problems in relation to developers that are not registered for GST. While many developers will be registered for GST, there are a significant number that do not need to, and choose not to, register for GST. Auckland City Council has a reasonable proportion of contributions resulting from developments where the developer is not registered for GST. In addition, in the case of a contribution comprising of works that vest in the council the unregistered developer could effectively bear a GST impost of 26.56 percent on the contribution – this is the aggregate of GST paid in undertaking the required works plus GST imposed by the local authority under the proposed amendment. This could have the effect of: • fettering local council discretion when seeking contributions; • forcing developers to register for GST; • imposing a significant financial burden on unregistered developers; and • increasing the cost of sub-dividing properties. A further consequence of this is that the GST could become embedded in the sale price when works that vest in a council are subsequently sold by the council to a third party (such as a utilities company). These adverse effects could not have been intended by officials. Comment Officials acknowledge that if GST were to apply in addition to works provided by an unregistered person it is possible that the GST would compound. As noted in the response to the previous submission, the proposed amendment should not include works and other conditions that are imposed for the purposes of a resource consent. A liability for GST would arise, however, if works were required to be performed on land owned by the unregistered property developer that later vests in the local authority. In this situation, officials note that if the consent required a contribution in the form of land, the local authority would generally be able to claim a second-hand goods input tax credit equal to one-ninth of the value of the land. The second-hand goods input tax credit would, in principle, offset the GST cost incurred by the unregistered property developer, including the GST cost of providing certain works required under the consent. 111 As officials have recommended that the proposed amendment not apply to works, this, combined with the ability to claim a second-hand goods input tax credit, should address submissioners’ concerns. Recommendation That the submission be noted as being addressed in part by the previous officials’ recommendation. Issue: Remission Submission (33 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Section 209 of the Local Government Act requires local authorities to refund development contributions when the development does not proceed. This view is based on a recent Inland Revenue view that the remission of rates does not reverse the original GST liability attaching to rates when assessed. If the current proposal is to proceed there will need to be a mechanism that reverses a local authority’s GST liability under new section 5(7B) when a development contribution is refunded. Comment The submission refers to a matter concerning Inland Revenue’s initial view in respect of the GST treatment of rates remission. This matter has since been resolved at an operational level in favour of the local authorities. Recommendation That the submission be declined on the basis that the issue has been resolved with Inland Revenue. Issue: Alternative proposal – zero-rating Submission (31 – Society of Local Government Managers and Local Government New Zealand) The proposed amendment will introduce problems concerning: • determining the appropriate market value for non-cash contributions; • the time of supply of non-cash contributions; and • the availability of input tax credits for property developers. 112 The submission argues that, to the extent that a local authority treats a financial or development contribution under the Research Management Act and Local Government Act as a barter transaction or as two supplies (where the contribution is in the form of land and the local authority supplies goods and services), the two supplies should be zero-rated. This would simplify compliance for both local authorities and property developers. Comment Officials consider that the submission has identified a valid problem with proposed section 5(7B) in respect of ascertaining the value of goods and services supplied by the local authority when they are made in relation to a non-monetary contribution. It is suggested that zero-rating will address this problem and resolve difficulties that might otherwise arise if local authorities and property developers were required to follow the draft Inland Revenue ruling. The submission notes that there are problems with applying the open market value provisions when a non-monetary contribution is made to a local authority. The open market value rule in the GST Act requires a determination of what another person in the position of the property developer (or other registered person) would be prepared to pay for the supply of goods and services deemed to be made by the local authority under the proposed section 5(7B). This can be difficult as illustrated in the example below: Example – contribution in the form of land As part of a development, a local authority requires a property developer to provide a section that can be used as a playground. The value of the contribution could be based on one of the following: • the price that the property developer could have sold the section for, if it had remained as a residential lot; or • the value of the land once it has been zoned as a park. Once land is zoned as a park it has a very low value as it requires a Ministerial consent for that land to be rezoned for another purpose. Under proposed section 5(7B), treating the two supplies (the supply of goods and services by the local authority and the supply of the non-monetary contribution by the property developer) as a barter transaction will be revenue neutral because any GST charged by the local authority and property developer will be met with a corresponding input tax credit to each party. Achieving this outcome, however, imposes compliance costs and, as the submission notes, creates tensions between local authorities and property developers in respect of which value should be applied. While the valuation applied to the example could be based on the value placed on the land by the local authority, this may not be acceptable to the property developer. If the deemed supplies were instead treated as zero-rated the problem is removed as it is not necessary for the local authority and developer to have an agreed value for GST purposes and revenue neutrality is preserved. 113 The submission also raises a concern as to the consequences if new section 5(7B) does not proceed and local authorities and property developers are required to follow the draft Inland Revenue ruling. The concern relates to the ability of GST-registered property developers to claim input tax credits in respect of work performed on land that later vests in the local authority. Under the draft ruling, it is arguable that the property developer will be unable to claim input tax credits in respect of GST incurred in purchasing land which is transferred to a local authority as a development contribution. This is because, under the draft ruling, the contributions would be non-taxable, so the property developer would not be in a position to establish that these costs were incurred for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. If the supply created under new section 5(7B) were zero-rated this problem would be resolved as the costs incurred by the property developer would be for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies (being those received under the new section 5(7B)). Officials further note that zero-rating would address other problems raised by submissions concerning the cash flow impact of the proposed amendment and determining the time of supply. For example, if GST at the standard rate of 12.5 percent were applied to non-cash contributions the local authority would suffer cash flow problems as it would be obliged to return GST equal to one-ninth, or the tax fraction, of the agreed value of the contribution. The local authority would not, however, have the available cash to meet the liability as the non-cash contribution is not-liquid and may vest to the local authority at a later date. If the rate of GST were zero this cash flow problem would not arise. Officials agree that the submission’s proposal is an effective means of addressing the various compliance cost problems raised in the submission while at the same time preserving revenue neutrality. Officials note, however, that the same issue does not arise when contributions are made in the form of cash. This is because there is only one supply from the local authority to the property developer – being the supply of goods and services deemed to be made under new section 5(7B). The property developer does not make a supply in return as money is excluded from the definition of goods and services. Officials therefore consider that the submission’s proposal should be accepted only in part. Officials therefore recommend that goods and services supplied by a local authority under proposed section 5(7B) be zero-rated only to the extent that they are supplied for a contribution in the form of land. The supply of the land should be correspondingly zero-rated. 114 Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part. Officials recommend that contributions in the form of land and the corresponding supply of goods and services by local authorities be treated as consideration for zero-rated supplies from date of Royal assent. 115 REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS Issue: GST – postponed rates Submission (Matter raised by officials, 31 – Society of Local Government Managers and Local Government New Zealand) An amendment to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act) is required to ensure that finance costs recovered by local authorities on postponed rates by way of postponement fees are not subject to GST. Comment Section 88 of the Local Government (Rating) Act 2002 allows local authorities to charge a fee when rates are postponed. This fee is meant to recover any administrative and financial costs associated with postponing rates. The current wording of section 88(3) of the Local Government (Rating) Act provides that for all purposes postponement fees, including finance costs, relating to the postponement of rates must be treated as part of the rates on the affected rating unit. This wording, in conjunction with section 5(7) of the GST Act, which treats local authority rates as consideration for the supply of public goods and services to the community, means that GST applies to postponement fees. While it is appropriate that GST continues to apply to postponement fees generally, officials consider that any finance costs should be treated as “financial services” as postponement arrangements created by local authorities are similar to the creation of a debt security as defined in section 3 of the GST Act. The proposed treatment would apply as follows: • any administrative charge that forms part of the rates deferment payment would be subject to GST; and • any financing costs would be treated as exempt from GST. Local Government New Zealand and the Society of Local Government Managers have indicated their support for the proposed amendment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 116 Issue: Penalties on overdue rates Submissions (3W – Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, 31 – Society of Local Government Managers and Local Government New Zealand, 33 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Submissions support the proposed amendment. Comment The amendment confirms that from 1 July 2003 late payment charges on overdue rates imposed by a local authority should be exempt from GST. The Taxation (Relief, Refunds and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002 amended the GST Act to allow penalty interest imposed under statute to be treated as an exempt supply. The amendment was made retrospective to 10 October 2000 to align the treatment of penalty interest imposed under statute with interest penalties imposed under contract. As a result of consultation during the passage of the Act, local authorities were excluded from the retrospective amendment owing to their concerns about compliance costs. It was expected that local authorities would be able to treat penalties imposed on overdue rates as consideration for an exempt supply from 1 July 2003. Inland Revenue subsequently interpreted the amendment as not applying to penalties on overdue rates as the penalty was not regarded as in the nature of interest. Section 5(7) of the GST Act specifically treats the payment of rates as consideration for the supply of goods and services provided by a local authority to the wider community. This section, in conjunction with the definition of the term “rates” in the Local Government (Rating) Act 2002, means that local authorities are required to return GST on penalties imposed on overdue rates. This interpretation is contrary to the policy intent of the 2002 amendment. An amendment is therefore required to section 14(3) of the GST Act to ensure that penalties on overdue rates are treated as consideration for exempt supplies. As local authorities expected that penalties on overdue rates would be treated as an exempt supply from 1 July 2003, the proposed amendment has retrospective effect from that date. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 117 Issue: Scope of proposed amendment Submissions (3W – Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, 33 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposed amendment should go further and clarify the GST principle at issue – that late payment penalties imposed by entities other than local authorities should be exempt from GST. If a strict interpretation of the terms “interest” and “a charge in the nature of interest” is adopted the amendment will not achieve its purpose. The amendment should therefore be changed so that any penalty for late payment authorised and imposed under statute should be treated as an exempt supply. Alternatively, penalties under the Fire Services Act 1975 should be specifically clarified as being exempt. (Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu) There is uncertainty concerning the current GST treatment of late payment charges imposed by organisations other than local authorities. This is particularly so when “flat” late payment fees are imposed rather than “interest” charges. Consideration should be given as to whether flat late payment charges should be subject to GST as they are not meant to be consideration for the supply of goods and services. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment Officials’ comments are: • The situation that makes the current amendment to section 14(3) necessary is unique to local authorities as entities other than local authorities are not specifically treated as making supplies of goods and services (as is the case with rates penalties that are deemed to be part of the rates) when imposing penalties for late payment. • Officials are not aware of any circumstances where Inland Revenue has required GST to be returned on interest (or charges in the nature of interest) imposed on overdue accounts by a public authority. • In most cases, as outlined in the government discussion document GST: A Review (March 1999) and as enacted in the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000, penalty interest is equivalent to the payment of interest on the outstanding balance of the purchase price. The charge therefore compensates for the time value of money, and is comparable to supplies included in the section 3 definition of “financial services”. Officials consider that the same argument does not necessarily apply in respect of all “flat fee” charges for late payment. Rather, each case needs to be considered on its facts. • To include “flat fee” late payments within the scope of the amendment would therefore widen the scope of the amendment beyond the original policy intent – for example, to situations where the fee is a means of recovering accounting and collection costs associated with truculent debtors or for charging debtors for the ongoing use of the goods and services supplied until payment is received. Including flat fee charges within the ambit of section 14(3) would not necessarily be welcomed by taxpayers as it would mean that such taxpayers 118 would be treated as making exempt supplies and would be required to apportion input tax when previously they were not required to do so. • In the case of “flat fee” late payment charges imposed under contract, officials consider that ordinary principles should determine whether GST applies. This means that there needs to be a nexus between the “flat fee” and a taxable supply of goods and services for GST to apply. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Officials will, however, continue to review the application of the GST Act to late payment penalties and discuss any issues with interested parties. 119 Other policy matters 123 COMMUNITY TRUSTS Issue: Unwinding of charitable trusts and companies Clauses 5, 17 and 66(5) Submissions (10 – Combined Community Trusts, 15 – Bay of Plenty Community Trust, 16 – The Community Trust of Wellington, 8 – The Community Trust of Otago, 41 – The Community Trust of Southland, 28 – Trust Waikato, 36 – Whanganui Community Foundation, 37 – The Community Trust (of Canterbury), 40 – West Coast Community trust Inc, 5 – Eastern and Central Community Trust) The twelve community trusts strongly support the enactment of the proposed income tax exemption for community trusts because it will remove unnecessary compliance costs at the level of the community trusts. The community trusts support the proposal that is contained in clauses 5, 17 and 66(5). The community trusts seek an additional provision relating to the unwinding of the charitable trusts and companies that they established in recent years. Under this provision, the charitable trusts and companies would be able to transfer their funds back to the community trusts without tax consequences. (Combined Community Trusts) Comment We appreciate that in a number of cases community trusts have established charitable subsidiary companies or sub-trusts. This has specifically added to the compliance costs for these community trusts. Under current law the practice has been that any income that a community trust is unable to distribute as trustee income can be distributed as beneficiary income to its subsidiary charitable entity. In future years, distributions can be made to charitable beneficiaries out of the community trust’s charitable entity. This ensures the beneficiary income paid to tax-exempt charitable entities is not subject to tax. Under the proposed tax exemption it will no longer be necessary to distribute to a charitable subsidiary in order to ensure distributions are not taxable to charitable beneficiaries. Therefore we agree with the submissions. Community trusts should be given an opportunity for a transitional period to wind up their subsidiaries without tax consequences. This will assist in reducing their compliance costs in the future. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 124 Issue: Income received and distributed by a community trust should be tax-free to all recipients Clause 17 Submission (10 – Combined Community Trusts) The inherently charitable nature of the income received and distributed by a community trust means that it ought to be able to be distributed on a tax-free basis to all recipients. The treatment of small, non-profit bodies is deserving of attention by government. Comment We agree that there is a need to review the tax treatment of non-profit organisations, and the government has indicated that it will consider this as part of the prioritisation exercise for the 2004/05 tax policy work programme. However, we do not agree that distributions to all tax paying not-for-profit organisations should be tax free. This would, in effect, extend the tax exemption for charitable status. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Community trusts should be deemed to be charities Clause 17 Submissions (17 – AMP Henderson Global Investments (New Zealand) Limited (AMP), 42 – KPMG) Clause 5 should be replaced with a provision that deems a community trust to be a charity for the purposes of the income it derives. Fund managers will then be able to pool the funds of community trusts with those of other charities. Community trusts have no pooling mechanism to manage their funds. (AMP) Community trusts should be deemed to be charities for the purposes of the income they derive. This will give the community trusts the benefits of the efficiencies of investing in pooled investment vehicles. (KPMG) 125 Comment We do not consider this treatment to be appropriate as the purposes of community trusts are wider than those of charities. This would allow an exemption from tax to organisations that are not charitable. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Tax-exempt status should be elective Clause 17 Submission (42 – KPMG) Tax-exempt status may reduce the income of some community trusts, and shall depend on an irrevocable election. Comment This proposal would add to or at least not reduce the compliance costs of community trusts under a proposal that is being introduced to reduce these costs. Community trusts have been closely consulted and support the proposals. They have not sought that their future exempt status should depend on an election. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Compliance costs for community trusts and beneficiary organisations Clause 17 Submissions (17 – AMP Henderson Global Investments (New Zealand) Limited, 30 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand Inc, 20 – New Zealand Federation of Voluntary Welfare Organisations Inc, 9 – Russell Investment Group) The proposal may constrain the investment options available to community trusts, creating inefficiencies and distortions in investment decisions. (AMP) 126 This “closely targeted exemption” is an “ad hoc” law change. (Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand) Compliance costs will be transferred to beneficiary organisations. Added administrative costs will reduce the funds available for community work and services. This problem may be partially solved by increasing the amount of the deduction available to not-for-profit organisations from the existing $1000 to at least $10,000. (New Zealand Federation of Voluntary Welfare Organisations Inc) The bill will not simplify the financial management of the Trusts as far as intended. There is a case for removing the distinction between pre-1 April 2004 and post-1 April 2004 earnings retained by the Trusts as capital. (Russell Investment Group) Comment In response to the submissions that the tax exemption may constrain the investment options available to community trusts and that the changes are “ad hoc”, the proposal was developed in consultation with community trusts to meet concerns over compliance costs. The community trusts support the proposals. In response to the submission that the proposals will transfer compliance costs to beneficiary organisations, we accept that, in some cases, the tax liability will shift to recipients of community trust donations. This is the intention of the proposal so that there is no alteration to the current tax treatment of beneficiary organisations. As noted above, the government has agreed to consider the treatment of not for profit organisations as part of the prioritisation exercise of for the 2004/2005 tax policy work programme. The amount of the deduction available to not-for-profit organisations could be increased to cover costs and will be considered as part of this review. We disagree with the submission that the distinction between pre-1 April 2004 and post-1 April 2004 earnings retained by the Trusts should be removed. This is a transitional measure that ensures that trustee income that has had tax paid on it is not taxed again on the distribution to a taxable beneficiary. Removing this distinction would effectively exempt from tax distributions to entities that do not qualify for an income tax exemption. We acknowledge that this may leave a compliance cost with the community trust in determining the tax status of the beneficiary to decide whether capital or income is to be distributed to the beneficiary. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 127 Issue: Withholding tax Clause 17 Submissions (20 – New Zealand Federation of Voluntary Welfare Organisations Inc, 39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Grants from community trusts are generally treated as “restricted income”, which by definition is available only for the specified purpose. If tax must be paid on the gross amount of the grant, there might be insufficient money left to complete the relevant project. It is recommended community trusts are required to deduct withholding tax from any grants made to a tax-paying entity. (New Zealand Federation of Voluntary Welfare Organisations Inc) Beneficiaries of grants from community trusts should be able to elect to have their grants subject to RWT deducted by the Trust. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Comment We understand that community trusts will be able to pay grossed-up grants to tax- paying beneficiaries, so that the grants cover their main purpose and the associated tax charge. Requiring community trusts to withhold tax would be contrary to the purpose of the proposal. The proposal is the result of community trusts seeking an income tax exemption to reduce compliance costs currently incurred by them in order to make tax-free distributions to mostly tax exempt entities. Additionally, community trust representatives have indicated that distributions of capital could be made to taxable beneficiaries in order to remove the potential tax liability for the taxable beneficiary. Distributions of capital could be made out of the corpus of the trust – that is, the capital sums that are settled on the trust. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 128 Issue: Imputation credits should be available to community trusts Clauses 5 and 17 Submission (20 – New Zealand Federation of Voluntary Welfare Organisations Inc, 39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Cash credits should be made available to the community trusts. This will ensure that the return from investments in companies is maximised and the total amount available for grants is enhanced. Comment Cash credits would, in effect, enable community trusts to pass the financial benefit of imputation credits to charitable beneficiaries and to taxable beneficiaries. The government has said it will review the imputation credit treatment of charities in the future. Such a review will need to consider the position of charities that receive imposed income via community trusts. Community trusts were consulted on the issue of allowing imputation credits to pass through to taxable beneficiaries. The community trusts did not see this as a significant issue and felt that it was better not to complicate the reforms. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 129 REPEAL OF INCOME TAX EXEMPTION FOR SICK, ACCIDENT OR DEATH BENEFIT FUNDS Issue: Deferring repeal until wider review of non-profit sector undertaken Clauses 6, 10, 11 and 62(2) Submission (39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The removal of the tax exemption for sick, accident or death benefit (SAD) funds should be delayed pending completion of Inland Revenue’s wider review of the tax regime for the non-profit sector. Abuse of this exemption should be able to be dealt with under existing law. Comment The current income tax exemption for SAD funds raises tax base maintenance concerns. In particular, schemes with aggressive features which exploit the income tax exemption have been marketed to high-income individuals to reduce the tax they pay. The tax base maintenance concerns with the current SAD fund income tax exemption need to be addressed now and cannot wait until any wider tax review of the non-profit sector. The submission argues that any aggressive tax schemes should be able to be targeted under the avoidance rules in the current tax legislation, and the repeal of the SAD fund income tax exemption is not necessary simply to serve this purpose. Officials do not consider that it is sufficient to rely on existing tax rules to counter aggressive tax schemes exploiting the SAD fund income tax exemption. Because of the open-ended nature of the current exemption, there are few effective barriers preventing high-income individuals exploiting the exemption. The definition of a SAD fund simply refers to any fund established for the benefit of the employees of any employer, or the members of an incorporated society, and the surviving spouses and dependants of any such employees and members. There is no explicit requirement that a SAD fund be established only for protection against sickness, accident or death. Although Inland Revenue can seek to apply the general anti-avoidance rules in the income tax legislation against aggressive tax schemes, the outcome is not certain. The best way of closing such schemes down with certainty is to address the real cause of the problem, which is the SAD fund income tax exemption itself. 130 The exemption is also being removed because it is anomalous in terms of current tax policy. The exemption is inconsistent with the current policy for the taxation of savings because it can be used effectively to allow earnings on personal savings to be exempt from income tax. The exemption therefore provides concessionary treatment that is not available to other forms of savings. The current income tax exemption for SAD funds is also inconsistent with the treatment of insurance policies entered into for protection against sickness, accident or death. The earnings on contributions or premiums paid on such policies are generally taxable. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Inserting anti-avoidance rules in current exemption Clauses 6, 10, 11 and 62(2) Submission (42W – KPMG) With some appropriate safeguards incorporated in the provisions defining a SAD fund, such funds as are used for their intended purpose should be allowed to continue. Examples of the types of safeguards that could be used to overcome the current problems are: • Eliminating transactions with the employer entity and associated persons. For example, if a SAD fund owns the employer’s premises and rent is paid, the rent will be taxable. Thus only income derived from genuine arm’s length investments will be tax free. • That no benefit, other than a benefit paid under the terms of the scheme, may be paid to any shareholder or director or associated person. • That the scheme submits annual returns that disclose details of the benefits paid and to whom. • That the scheme be required to have a trustee oversee its investments and that it requires an auditor’s certificate verifying that all of the requirements have been met. Comment The current SAD fund income tax exemption raises tax base maintenance concerns. In particular, schemes with aggressive features which exploit this exemption have been marketed to high-income individuals to reduce the tax they pay. 131 The tax base maintenance concerns with the current SAD fund income tax exemption arise because of the open-ended nature of the exemption. A SAD fund is defined very widely in the Income Tax Act 1994 as a fund established for the benefit of the employees of any employer, or the members of an incorporated society, and the surviving spouses and dependants of any such employees and members. There is no explicit requirement that a SAD fund be established only for protection against sickness, accident or death. The specific anti-avoidance rules suggested by the submissioner do not address the main cause of the base maintenance problem of the SAD fund income tax exemption which is its open-ended nature. Officials consider it unlikely that specific anti- avoidance rules could be devised to counter the aggressive tax planning schemes which cannot themselves be circumvented. The best way of closing such schemes down with certainty is to address the real cause of the problem, which is the open- ended SAD fund income tax exemption itself. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Deferring application date Clause 6(2) Submission (42W – KPMG) If the repeal of the income tax exemption for SAD funds proceeds, a period of time should be allowed of at least one full income year to give SAD funds time to wind up their affairs and distribute their assets or to incorporate in another form. It is appropriate that time be given to allow SAD funds, and employers with SAD funds, to reconsider their future. Comment The bill currently provides that the repeal of the SAD fund income tax exemption will apply to income derived after the date of enactment. The repeal of the income tax exemption for SAD funds has been signalled for some time. The Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance in 1998 considered that the income tax exemption for SAD funds was anomalous in terms of current tax policy and that there was no public policy justification for its continuance. Accordingly, the Committee recommended the repeal of the tax exemption. 132 It is common for tax measures to apply from the date of enactment. The current bill was introduced on 23 June 2003 and is not expected to be enacted until late November this year. Officials consider that this gives SAD funds sufficient time to consider their situations and either wind up their affairs or reorganise themselves. Further time is also not necessary when the nature of SAD funds is taken into account. The current income tax exemption for SAD funds applies only to passive income such as interest and dividends, and not to business income. SAD funds therefore do not carry on businesses which would require a longer time to reorganise than passive investments. If the application date was deferred as suggested by the submission, the exemption would continue in force for another year following the enactment of the legislation. Given the tax base maintenance concerns with the current exemption such an extension of this exemption does not seem to be justified. The current exemption is also anomalous in terms of current tax policy as it is inconsistent with the current policy for both the taxation of savings and insurance policies. Prolonging such an anomaly again does not seem to be justified. The repeal of the exemption should, therefore, not be deferred. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Closely targeted exemption for SAD funds resembling friendly societies Clauses 6, 10, 11 and 62(2) Submission (22 – Police Welfare Fund Limited, 23 – Health Service Welfare Society Limited, 24 – Educational Benevolent Society Inc, 25 – Union Medical Benefits Society Limited, 19 – Business New Zealand, 21 – New Zealand Council of Trade Unions) A new, tightly-targeted provision should be inserted into the bill to give certain SAD funds which are similar to friendly societies the same tax exemption as that which is currently available to friendly societies. Such an amendment would maintain the status quo for such bodies. There is a strong element of mutuality and collective self-help in such entities. Accordingly, they are more akin to friendly societies in nature but, for a number of reasons, are structured differently from friendly societies. Such entities are not used as savings vehicles and are not comparable with commercial insurance providers. No dividends are payable by these entities. 133 Because of the way they are currently organised these entities would incur significant compliance costs if they were forced to restructure formally as friendly societies. One of the requirements of the Friendly Societies and Credit Unions Act 1982 is that membership and subscription must be concomitant. Because of the way they are organised this is not the case with these bodies. Business New Zealand supports the submission from the Police Welfare Fund Limited, Health Services Welfare Society Limited, Union Medical Benefits Society Limited and Educational Benevolent Society Inc that these organisations be provided with the same tax exemption as available to friendly societies. The New Zealand Council of Trade Unions is concerned that the repeal of the SAD income tax exemption will have a damaging effect on some genuine schemes which employees have been contributing to solely, or almost completely, to ensure there is a payment to them in the event of sickness or accident preventing ongoing employment, or death. Comment Officials agree with the submissions that there are a number of SAD insurers that share the mutuality characteristics of friendly societies, which are exempt from income tax under section CB 4(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1994. The friendly society income tax exemption covers the majority of the health insurance market. Although certain SAD funds have the requisite mutuality characteristics, they would incur significant compliance costs if they had to restructure formally as friendly societies. These costs would mostly arise because the Friendly Societies and Credit Unions Act 1982 requires the members of and the subscribers to a friendly society to be the same persons. However, some of the insurers which have SAD funds status are currently organised as subsidiaries in a group structure, with the individual subscribers to the insurer being members of the entity which owns the insurer instead of being members of the insurer itself. Significant restructuring costs would have to be incurred by these insurers in order to qualify for registration as friendly societies. Officials agree that as a compliance cost savings measure a separate exemption should be provided to those SAD funds which have the required mutual characteristics of friendly societies. (Entities that are established in the future that wish to enjoy the friendly society income tax exemption should be organised as such from the outset.) In particular, the exemption should apply to an entity that satisfies the following requirements: • Provides health insurance, accident insurance, life insurance or other health and welfare benefits to members. • Has limitations on distributions made to members. • Has previously been approved by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue as a SAD fund. • Is separately approved by the Commissioner for the purposes of this exemption within six months of the date of enactment of this bill. 134 The new exemption would have the same ambit as the exemption applying to friendly societies and, in particular, would not apply to an amount derived by an entity from a business carried on beyond the circle of its membership. The exemption would apply to income derived after the date of enactment of the bill. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Narrow ambit of proposed exemption for funeral expense funds Clause 6 Submission (39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 47W – CMC Superannuation Benevolent Fund) The Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand disagrees that the current use of SAD funds should be narrowed to apply only to funeral expenses. The trustee of the CMC Superannuation Benevolent Fund submits that the wording of the proposed exemption for funeral expense funds should be amended so that the exemption also applies to funds established for the purpose of paying for surgical, medical or dental costs. Comment The bill contains a new, closely targeted income tax exemption for the investment earnings of funds established solely for the purpose of paying for the funeral expenses of employees and their spouses and dependants. The government has agreed to the current ambit only of this proposed exemption. It is possible that the concerns of the CMC Superannuation Benevolent Fund may be addressed by the proposed separate exemption for existing SAD funds that exhibit the mutuality characteristics of friendly societies. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 135 Issue: Tax treatment of distributions from funeral expense funds Clause 6 Submission (42W – KPMG) The broad definition of a “unit trust” in the Income Tax Act could apply to the proposed funeral expense funds. For the sake of completeness, the definition of a unit trust in section OB 1 should list these funds in the list of exclusions. Comment Officials consider that distributions made by any funeral expense funds for the purpose of the payment of expenses associated with funerals would not be subject to tax. For the avoidance of doubt, officials agree that funeral expense funds should be included in the list of exclusions in the definition of a “unit trust” in the Income Tax Act 1994 to ensure that the dividend rules do not apply to any distributions from funeral expense funds. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Requirement that “potential beneficiaries” of a funeral expense fund be equally eligible for benefits Clause 6 Submission (44 – MinterEllisonRuddWatts) The reference to “potential beneficiaries” in proposed new section CB 5(1)(ib)(iii) – referring to one of the conditions for the proposed new income tax exemption for funeral expense funds – should be replaced with “beneficiaries” as it is unclear as to who is a “potential beneficiary”. A settlor of the trust will specify who the beneficiaries of the trust are to be. Comment The bill contains a closely targeted exemption for the investment earnings of funds established solely for the purpose of paying for the funeral expenses of employees and their spouses and dependants. One of the requirements of the exemption is that all “potential beneficiaries” of the trust must be equally eligible for benefits from the fund. Officials consider that this requirement could be equally achieved by the legislation referring to “persons eligible to benefit from the fund” instead of “potential beneficiaries”. 136 Recommendation That the submission be accepted to the extent of replacing the reference to “potential beneficiaries” with a reference to persons eligible to benefit from the fund. 137 FAMILY ASSISTANCE Issue: Adjusting marginal tax rate thresholds for inflation Clauses 23 and 25 Submission (42W – KPMG) The submission supports the proposal to increase income thresholds for family support, child tax credit and parental tax credit, to provide an adjustment for inflation for the year ended September 2003. Marginal tax rate thresholds should be similarly adjusted for inflation, by way of a predetermined formula. Comment Adjusting thresholds for inflation is a spending proposal to be considered alongside other priorities. Thresholds and tax and tax credit rates are adjusted occasionally in the normal course of events to reflect circumstances and policy changes. Policy changes are designed to take future inflation into account. In a low inflation environment, the effects are not large, especially for low-income earners. Indexation of thresholds does not take these factors into account. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Adjusting income-related rebates to allow for additional paydays Clauses 23, 24 and 26 Submission (42W – KPMG) An extra pay rebate should be re-introduced. This rebate would compensate recipients of any income-related rebates for the reduction in entitlement attributable to the extra income received in years with additional paydays. 138 Comment The extra pay rebate was repealed in 1999. Until this time, tax deduction certificates had been used by employers to record the number of pays employees received during an income year, and their abolition removed this avenue of communication with Inland Revenue. Re-instating the rebate would require the collection of this information by some other means, imposing compliance costs on employers and administrative costs on Inland Revenue. During income years with additional paydays, recipients receive more income than they would in a normal year, and their entitlement for some income-related rebates may be reduced on this basis. However, this reduction is justified as income-related rebates are, by their very definition, contingent upon a taxpayer’s income during the year from any source. These considerations argue against the re-instatement of an extra pay rebate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 139 TAX POOLING Clauses 32-34, 40-42, 46-49, 60 and 66(21) Issue: Notice from intermediaries to depositers Submission (30 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 33 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 46 – Tax Management) The proposed change to the notification requirements in section MBB 4(3) should not proceed. Instead, the section should be amended to allow a period of time following each deposit (say 60 or 90 days) in which an intermediary can notify a taxpayer that payment to an intermediary does not satisfy any obligation of the taxpayer to make a payment to the Commissioner. Comment Section MBB 4(3) provides that an intermediary who accepts a payment from a taxpayer for deposit in a tax pooling account must, at the time of the payment, give notice to the taxpayer that the payment to the intermediary does not satisfy any obligation of the taxpayer to make a payment to the Commissioner. The bill proposes that this be changed so that an intermediary is required to notify a taxpayer only once, before or at the time of the first payment ICANZ and PricewaterhouseCoopers consider that it is important that taxpayers receive a notice in relation to each deposit. They state that, in its absence, the awareness that the taxpayer may be obliged to pay provisional tax again to the Commissioner may be lost. Tax Management, a pooling intermediary, supports the amendment in its submission, noting that it keeps compliance costs down. It compares the situation of depositers to those who give tax payment cheques to their accountants for passing on to the Inland Revenue where there is no statutory obligation for the person receiving the cheque to give advice to the taxpayer that the payment to the accountant does not satisfy any obligation of the taxpayer to make a payment to the Commissioner. Officials consider that, on balance, it is sufficient for an intermediary to notify a taxpayer once before or at the time of the first deposit. To require the intermediary to notify the taxpayer in relation to each deposit imposes excessive regulatory requirements. We recommend that the provision in the bill remain. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 140 Submission (46 – Tax Management) The wording of the notice from the intermediary to a depositer should be changed to: “subject to section MBB 6 a payment to an intermediary will satisfy an obligation of the taxpayer to make a payment to the Commissioner when the amount is transferred from the pool account to the taxpayer’s account”. Comment The current provision requires the intermediary to give notice to the taxpayer that the payment to the intermediary does not satisfy any obligation of the taxpayer to make a payment to the Commissioner. The submission argues that the wording of the notice should be changed to emphasise that the taxpayer has taken a positive step in complying and to make clear the remaining step to complete the compliance process. Officials consider that the current wording makes the point more directly and clearly that payment to an intermediary does not constitute tax paid to the Commissioner. We recommend that the current wording be retained. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Imputation: Breach of continuity and pooling credit recorder mechanism Submission (30 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 46 – Tax Management) The provisions introduce a “pooling credit recorder” mechanism to prevent companies that deposit an amount into a pool losing excessive imputation credits when there is a significant change in shareholding following the deposit. This mechanism works but requires additional record keeping. Instead, a provision should be introduced based on the existing section MD 2(4), which achieves a similar purpose in relation to tax payments made direct to the Commissioner. Tax Management proposes wording for such a provision. Comment Officials agree that the objective of the pooling credit recorder mechanism is more easily achieved by adopting a rule similar to that in section MD 2(4). The type of rule proposed in the Tax Management submission appears to work. 141 Submissions from ICANZ and PricewaterhouseCoopers that propose minor drafting or technical changes to the pooling credit recorder mechanism are therefore no longer relevant. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Debits arising to imputation credit account on transfers or refunds from tax pooling account Submission (30 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand Inc, 33 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Proposed new sections ME 5(2)(eb) and ME 5(2B)(a) are not required and should not proceed. They state that where a refund or transfer exceeds the credit balance in the imputation credit account as at the date of the refund/transfer and at the previous imputation balance date, a debit will arise at the previous balance date equal to the entire amount of the refund. This will trigger penalties and is unfair relative to the existing rules in section MD 2(1) which the proposed new sections are intended to replicate. Section MD 2(1) would be sufficient to prevent any perceived mischief. If necessary that section could be clarified to ensure it applies to the pooling provisions. Comment Section MD 2(1), which authorises the Commissioner to withhold refunds of income tax owing to a company where there is an insufficient balance in the company’s imputation credit account, cannot apply to refunds from a pooling account to a taxpayer. This is because the Commissioner will not know who is entitled to the funds in the pooling account and therefore on whose behalf the refund is being sought. However, the proposal in the next submission below addresses the concerns of PricewaterhouseCoopers and ISI about the unfairness of the provision in the bill relative to the existing section MD 2(1). Recommendation That the submission be declined. 142 Submission (30 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 46 – Tax Management) The proposed new sections ME 5(2)(e) and ME 5(2B) and the equivalent provisions applying to consolidated companies should be replaced. A fairer rule is that an imputation debit arising from the refund or transfer of funds in a tax pooling account be debited to the ICA in the following order: • First, against any credit balance at the previous 31 March • Second, against any credit balance at the time of the refund or transfer, and • Third, on the previous 31 March – triggering an imputation penalty on this balance. An updated imputation return for 31 March could be filed at the next 31 March unless the account was in debit, in which case the taxpayer should have to file an interim return. Comment Officials agree that the mechanism proposed is fairer than the equivalent provisions in the bill. If an imputation return for the year ending on the previous 31 March has been filed, we agree that a revised return be filed if the transaction has resulted in the imputation account being in debit. A revised return should also be required if the taxpayer becomes entitled to a refund of income tax that would be withheld by the Commissioner under section MD 2. We expect that this requirement will affect a small number of taxpayers. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and that taxpayers be required to file a revised return for the year ending on the previous 31 March if the transaction has resulted in the imputation account going in debit at that date or if the taxpayer becomes entitled to a refund of income tax that would be withheld by the Commissioner because of insufficient funds in the taxpayer’s imputation credit account. Issue: Timing of imputation credit arising where taxpayer purchases funds in pooling account Submission (Matter raised by officials) When a taxpayer purchases funds in a pooling account from an intermediary, imputation credits should arise in relation to that purchase as at the effective date at which the funds are transferred to the taxpayer’s tax account with the Commissioner, or the date on which the funds are refunded to the taxpayer or transferred to the intermediary for on-sale to another taxpayer. 143 Comment The bill provides that, when a taxpayer purchases funds in a pool from an intermediary, an imputation credit arises for the funds purchased. The credit arises on the date of the transfer to the taxpayer in the intermediary’s books of account. The timing of the credit enables a taxpayer to avoid the imputation shareholder continuity rules which provide that imputation credits are lost when a company is sold. For example, a company (A Co) that was to be sold on, say, 31 March 2004 could arrange for an associated company (B Co) to pay sufficient funds into the pool on provisional tax dates for the 2003-2004 year to cover A Co’s provisional tax liability for that year. On 1 April 2004, after the sale of A Co’s shares, entitlement to the funds deposited by B Co would be transferred to A Co. Under the timing rule in the bill, an imputation credit for those funds would arise to A Co’s ICA on 1 April 2004. The imputation credits would thereby be preserved because they arise after the sale. To avoid this, the imputation credit for funds purchased from the pool should arise on the effective date of transfer of the tax from the pool to the individual taxpayer’s account with the Commissioner. For example, if A Co purchased funds from B Co on 1 April 2004, and the funds were transferred from the pool to the Commissioner to meet A Co’s provisional tax liability due on 7 March 2004, the credit would arise on 7 March 2004. There would be no requirement to refile an imputation return that had already been filed, although taxpayers could choose to do so. In the unlikely event that the funds were not transferred by the taxpayer to its tax account with the Commissioner, but were refunded from the pool to the taxpayer or transferred to another taxpayer, the credit would arise on the date of the refund or transfer. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 144 FURTHER INCOME TAX (FIT) Issue: Time period for requesting adjustments Clauses 43(1) and 99 Submission (33 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 34 – Jeff Owens & Company Ltd, 39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand)) In any circumstances where Inland Revenue issues an assessment for FIT, the taxpayer involved should be allowed a period of two months from the date the assessment is issued, in order to be able to apply for relief from double taxation and extra penalties. Comment The proposed legislation provides relief from double taxation and extra penalties in relation to FIT liabilities. The amendments are treated as coming into effect on 1 April 1998 (see references to sections 43(1) and 99 in clause 2 of the bill, which contains the commencement provisions). However, this general application date is limited by provisions within clauses 43(1) and 99, which restrict applications for adjustments relating to the imputation years beginning between 1 April 1998 and 1 April 2002 to a period of two calendar months from the date of enactment. Submissions point out that the proposed legislation will not afford taxpayers relief from double taxation where the taxpayer has not been notified of tax liabilities or extra penalties within two months of enactment, and the liabilities or penalties relate to imputation years commencing between 1 April 1998 and 1 April 2002. Officials acknowledge that this situation could occur, say, for example, as the result of a tax audit. This was not the policy intention. Officials support the submission. A two-month period is consistent with the time frame in which a taxpayer must issue a notice of proposed adjustment if an assessment is being disputed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 145 Issue: Imputation credit account debit balances unchanged in successive years Clause 43(1) Submission (33 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 34 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Relief should be provided in situations where a FIT liability obligation is triggered more than once as a result of an imputation credit account (ICA) debit balance straddling more than one income year. Comment FIT is charged when a company has a debit balance in its imputation credit account at 31 March in any year. The amount charged is equal to the debit balance in the ICA. The rationale for FIT is that a debit balance in the ICA indicates that imputation credits allocated to dividends paid are greater than the tax payments made by the company. As the shareholders can use imputation credits to satisfy their own income tax liabilities, shareholders gain a tax advantage when imputation credits exceed the tax paid by the company. The same ICA debit balance that exists at the end of one year (year one) can be carried over and remain in existence at the end of the next year (year two). In these circumstances, FIT is correctly charged for the first year. However, the Income Tax Act also inappropriately requires a FIT assessment to be issued for year two. This is considered to be unfair where the actions which caused the ICA debit balance occurred in year one and no further “offending” occurred in year two. Officials agree that this issue should be addressed. We suggest that relief should be allowed, upon application by the taxpayer, only if the ICA debit balance at the end of year one is greater than payments made during year two. Where this criteria is satisfied, the FIT liability for year two should be reduced by the difference between the ICA balance at the end of year one and the total payments made during year two. Example A company pays tax of $1,000 in year one and allocates imputation credits of $2,000. At the end of year one, therefore, the ICA has a debit balance of $1,000. In year two a payment of $700 is made. At the end of year two, the ICA has a debit balance of $300. 146 ICA Description Dr Cr Tax paid during year: $1,000 Credits allocated to dividend $2,000 Debit balance at 31 March Y1 is $1,000 Tax paid during year $700 Debit balance at 31 March Y2 is $300 Under current law, the company would incur a FIT liability of $1,000 for year one and another FIT liability of $300 for year two. This is unfair because the ICA debit balance at the end of year two is the residue left from the debit balance in the ICA at the end of year one. There was no further “offending” in year two. Under the proposal, relief is justified because payments made during year two ($700) are less than the ICA debit balance at the end of year one ($1,000). The FIT liability for year two would therefore be reduced by $300 (the ICA balance at the end of year one less payments made during year two). In this example, the same result would have occurred if the maximum relief available had been the lesser of the year one and year two ICA debit balances. However, allowing relief on that basis in all instances is not appropriate because it could lead to a permanent deferral of the payment of income tax in some circumstances. The proposed approach is consistent with the relief provisions already in this bill. Under those provisions, companies will be able to elect to have payments made during year two credited to a FIT liability for year one. Therefore it is not appropriate for those payments to be used to reduce the FIT liability for year two. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 147 Issue: Reversal of dividends Clause 43(1) Submission (34 – Jeff Owens and Company Ltd, 39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) A company should be able to reverse dividends if they were “paid” accidentally. Comment The bill allows companies which pay FIT to offset those payments against income tax liabilities. Situations occur where an ICA falls into debit when a company pays an imputed dividend but has an insufficient balance in its ICA, and then the company is unable to offset the FIT payment against an income tax liability because it is no longer trading. Submissions argue that in these circumstances, dividends should be able to be reversed, so that a FIT liability no longer exists. The reversal would be for tax purposes, but not for financial reporting or Companies Act purposes. The treatment proposed by the submission is not appropriate. A dividend formally approved and paid should stand (subject to it not being ultra vires the Companies Act). The shareholder has received the dividend as a dividend. Tax of some sort is rightly payable in respect of the dividend. If the company has inappropriately attached imputation credits then the answer is that the company pays the tax, rather than the dividend being “cancelled” for tax purposes. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Overdrawn dividend withholding payment accounts Clauses 43(1) and 99 Submission (33 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 42W – KPMG) Amendments should also apply to overdrawn dividend withholding payment accounts. 148 Comment A company that is resident in New Zealand and receives dividends from a non- resident company is required to deduct dividend withholding payment from the dividend and pay it to Inland Revenue. Dividend withholding payment credits can be attached to dividends paid by the New Zealand resident company in the same way as imputation credits. Companies may elect to maintain a dividend withholding payment account separately from an imputation credit account. Where a dividend withholding payment account has a debit balance at 31 March in any year, the company incurs a further dividend withholding payment liability. Under current law, the payment that satisfies the further withholding payment liability may also be credited in satisfaction of any dividend withholding payment for which the company becomes liable after the date the further dividend withholding payment was made. It would be appropriate to mirror the further income tax amendments for the purposes of further dividend withholding payments. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Drafting Clause 43(1) Submission (42W – KPMG) New section ME 9(5D) should be amended to read “... Commissioner must treat the payment as being a credit against the specified liability on the date on which the payment was received, and make all such adjustments to use of money interest charges and penalties necessary to give effect to the meaning and intention of the subsection”. Comment The purpose of the FIT changes is to provide that FIT payments can be credited to income tax and vice versa. Such actions will affect the calculation of use-of-money interest and penalties where an income tax or FIT liability was outstanding before an amount was credited. The part of the provision which the submission considers should be replaced currently reads “the Commissioner must treat the payment as being a credit against the specified liability on the date on which the payment was received”. The effect of the submission, therefore, would be to make explicit that adjustments to use-of-money interest and penalties need to be made. 149 Officials consider that the amendment is unnecessary. Treating the payment as a credit on the date it is received will automatically have the effect of requiring a recalculation of use-of-money interest and penalties, and providing explicitly for this is not necessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 150 BRANCH EQUIVALENT TAX ACCOUNTS AND FOREIGN LOSSES Clauses 51-54 Submissions (29, 29A – Russell McVeagh, 39A – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 26A – New Zealand Law Society) The proposed amendments do not fully address situations where branch equivalent tax account credits can be created from foreign losses, and the current branch equivalent tax account rules do not work appropriately with current year domestic losses. The application date for the current proposed amendments should also apply to these amendments. Comment Officials agree with the submissions. With regard to the application date, however, the existing amendments in the bill, for revenue protective purposes, apply from 1 April 1995 unless a taxpayer has filed a return based on existing law. This involves amendments to the law before the reform to core provisions. As the amendments proposed in this submission are only partly for revenue protection, officials prefer that they be retrospective only to the 1997-98 income year, from when the core provisions reform came into effect. Recommendation That the submission be accepted but only from the 1997-1998 income year, unless a taxpayer has filed on the basis of the existing law, when it would apply from the date of the introduction of the bill. Issue: Dividend withholding payment issues (42W – KPMG) Submission • Dividend withholding payment should be able to be reduced or offset by attributed foreign net losses and foreign investment fund net losses from the same jurisdiction of the foreign company that paid the dividend • A refund of dividend withholding payment, when a company has net losses available to carry forward, should be available when dividend withholding payment has been paid, regardless of whether the company maintains a dividend withholding payment account. 151 Comment Because this issue is outside the scope of the bill, officials have not been able to consider it. We recommend, however, that it be considered for inclusion in the work programme. Recommendation That the submissions be declined but that the matter be considered for inclusion in the work programme. 152 PROGRESSIVE SPECIFIED SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTION WITHHOLDING TAX Issue: Extending the 6 percent concession Clause 58 Submission (21 – Council of Trade Unions, 42 – KPMG) The Council of Trade Unions supports Clauses 57, 58 and 59 but submits that the SSCWT rate should be the marginal tax rate less 6 cents. They and KPMG, who make a similar proposal, argue that employees earning over $60,000 receive a benefit in being able to save for their retirement out of savings taxed at 33%, a saving of 6% on their top personal income tax rate. The same policy should apply to income earners earning less than $60,000. (Council of Trade Unions, KPMG) CTU also submit that the incidence of employment-based retirement savings is in decline and should be encouraged by the 6% concession. (Council of Trade Unions) Comment Both the Council of Trade Unions and KPMG submitted that the SSCWT rate should be the marginal tax rate less 6 cents. Our response is that a general 6% concession would have a high fiscal cost (of $77 million per annum) and is unlikely to contribute substantially to reversing the decline in these employment-based schemes or increase savings. In particular, this is not the type of incentive that appears to change the behaviour of low and middle income earners. Recent evidence from the US supports this assertion. We do not agree that arguments based on equity support a proposal to introduce a 6% concession across the board. Those benefiting from the 6% concession as it stands only do so because they are paying tax at a higher rate in the first place. The 39% tax rate is part of a progressive scale, and to that extent it is equitable. But there is a certain inevitable arbitrariness about any tax scale, and it cannot be argued that a limited relief from the top tax rate is necessarily unfair to other taxpayers. Furthermore, many taxpayers on lower rates do already obtain a significant relief from their effective marginal tax rates in respect of specified superannuation contributions. In some cases this is because the contributions are not taken into account in determining income-contingent entitlements such as family assistance and accommodation supplement. In other cases it is because the contributions are not added to total income and do not push other income up into the next rate band. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 153 Issue: Additional compliance costs for employers Clause 58 Submission (27 – The Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand Inc, 33 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 39 - Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The regime as proposed may impose additional compliance costs on employers, and this further layer of compliance cost may enhance the rate of decline of employer participation in superannuation savings. (Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand) The applicable rate will be determined for each employee on 1 April. The progressive rate will apply for the full year, and no adjustment will be required if salary or wages and/or contributions change during the year to which the rate applies. This provision may create an additional compliance cost burden for employers. The application dates require more flexibility given that changes in employee salaries will not necessarily be aligned with the standard year. Allowing a change in the applicable rate of SSCWT at the same time as PAYE is not only the most equitable approach but will mirror the timing of the other compliance obligations for employers. (PricewaterhouseCoopers). The proposal does not accord with the Institute’s target that the government should be adopting a broad-base, low rate tax policy, thereby restricting the conditions that make tax avoidance attractive. The new rules require additional compliance costs in determining which rate of deduction to apply by ascertaining which bracket of income tax an employee falls into. In respect of employees with a large element of commissions, bonuses, etc this might prove particularly burdensome (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand). Comment Different employers will no doubt find themselves in different positions with respect to the costs and benefits of this proposal. For some, the benefits to their employees will outweigh the compliance costs for the employer. Other employers may find that the compliance cost burden is too high to offer the progressive rates to their employees. This is why the proposed changes are voluntary for employers. The proposed amendments are intended to address the current inequity between different savers in employment-based superannuation schemes. This is caused by the overtaxation of employers’ contributions on behalf of low-income savers. However, addressing this inequity has to be balanced with the additional compliance costs on employers of determining a rate of SSCWT that more closely reflects the employee’s marginal tax rate. This is a trade-off between the competing factors of equity and efficiency in the tax system. Concerns were expressed during consultation that progressive SSCWT would impose further compliance costs on employers and possibly lead to a further reduction in schemes. Because there may be compliance costs involved with the lower rate, officials worked with those consulted on reducing the compliance costs of the proposed progressive SSCWT. 154 The sector representatives strongly supported an optional progressive SSCWT. Similarly, those consulted also supported basing an employee’s progressive SSCWT rate on previous standard tax year salary and contribution information and that no adjustment be required if salary or wages and/or contributions change during the year to which the rate applies. We note the majority of those consulted represented employers. We view the proposal as representing a sensible balance between removing the inequity and minimising compliance costs. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Overtaxation of retirement savings of low-income earners Clause 58 Submission (33 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 30 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand Inc) The commentary on the bill states that the proposed amendment is “intended to reduce the overtaxation of the retirement savings of low-income people”. The bill does not achieve this as, under current legislation, a superannuation fund’s earnings are taxed at 33% and therefore taxpayers subject to the lower marginal rate are overtaxed. Although the amendment reduces the overtaxation of employer contributions, it only partially removes a disincentive for low-income earners to save through employment based schemes. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Changes to the tax treatment of retirement savings should be made within the context of a comprehensive framework for savings. In addition, the proposed change does not address the overtaxation of fund investment income, which is another area of inequity for low and medium-income savers, largely hidden, but with a substantial cumulative effect on the savings accumulated at retirement. The proposed changes also do not contain an incentive for employers to start new superannuation schemes and will, in fact, increase their compliance costs. (Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand) Comment We agree that the progressive SSCWT proposals will not address all the issues affecting savings. The proposed section NE 2AB deals only with the overtaxation of employer contributions and does not deal with the taxation on returns to savings in superannuation funds. Currently, all returns are taxed at a flat rate of 33%. Taxing savings returns at that rate penalises low-income earners through overtaxation. 155 Past work in this area demonstrates that other approaches may result in increasing compliance costs associated with managing superannuation schemes. This may in turn lead to a reduction of such employer-based superannuation schemes if employers find the costs of offering them to be too high. While the government is continuing to work on the retirement savings area, any possible changes would need to be balanced against costs. There are a number of disincentive effects in relation to employment-based superannuation schemes, and the government plans to undertake further work in relation to these. This work will include looking at removing the disincentives for employers to offer schemes and addressing the inequity of the current tax law in overtaxing funds’ earnings in relation to low-income savers. With respect to employer compliance costs, our consultations were primarily with those affected by these costs, and this policy has endeavoured to minimise those costs wherever possible. The voluntary nature of the proposal underscores this point. The government will continue to work with the savings industry to ensure that future proposals are feasible, and will also endeavour to align its proposals with any recommendations made by the Periodic Review Group on Retirement Income Policy. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Truly progressive rates Clause 58 Submission (33 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposed amendments are deficient as they do not introduce a truly progressive rate. The current drafting of section NE 2AB does not provide for a truly progressive rate. For example, if an employee earns a salary of $36,000 and has employer contributions of $3,000, SSCWT on the employer contributions will be withheld at 33% (a tax cost to the employee of $990). A truly progressive rate would tax the $2,000 at the 21% rate and the remaining $1,000 at the 33% rate (a tax cost to the employee of $750). Comment Representatives of employer-based superannuation are concerned about the compliance costs associated with the proposal, while acknowledging this needed to be balanced against the equity issues of delivering more correct SSCWT to employees. 156 The majority of those consulted were representing employers. We consulted on an option that would base SSCWT on the average tax rate that applies to the employer’s contribution. This option involved Inland Revenue preparing and supplying tables that would provide the average rate calculated with reference to an employee’s combined annual salary or wages and superannuation contributions. This option was not favoured by the majority of those consulted. While it was acknowledged that it produced a more accurate and, therefore, more equitable result, it had the most significant compliance cost for employers. Concerns were expressed during consultation that imposing further compliance costs on employers would possibly lead to a further reduction in employment-based schemes. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Defined benefit schemes Clause 58 Submission (11 – New Zealand Society of Actuaries, 27 – The Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand Inc) • It is clear that section NE 2AB applies to defined contribution schemes. It is not clear that it applies to defined benefit schemes. The wording can be applied to defined benefit schemes in a satisfactory manner, provided the employer contribution rate is expressed as a percentage of employees’ salaries. Accordingly, “the amount of specified superannuation contribution that is contributed by the employer on behalf of the employee” can be readily identified for each active member as the current employer contribution rate multiplied by the member’s salary. The rules for determining salary as set out in section NE 2AB1 are perfectly adequate for defined benefit members as well as defined contribution members. Pensioner-only schemes have no active members, so the employer contribution cannot be expressed as a percentage of salaries. However, since there are no active members, there are no SSCWT overtaxation “anomalies” to address, and clearly the normal 33% rate is appropriate. (New Zealand Society of Actuaries) • It is imperative that employers sponsoring defined benefit schemes are able to take advantage of the progressive rates. The New Zealand Society of Actuaries has been working in this area to recommend appropriate mechanisms for this to occur. (Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand) 157 Comment We agree that the rules for determining salary as set out in section NE 2AB(1) are perfectly adequate for defined benefit members as well as defined contribution members. It is clear the proposal extends to defined benefit schemes where an employer’s contribution is expressed as a percentage of the employee’s salary. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted to provide for defined benefit schemes where the employer contribution rate is expressed as a percentage of employees’ salaries. Issue: Salary re-characterisation Clause 58 Submission (19 – Business New Zealand) Business New Zealand remains unconvinced that “income re-characterisation” would be a significant problem in practice – in particular, it seriously doubts whether employees would agree to forgo significant amounts of income that could otherwise be consumed immediately. In any event, the motivation to re-characterise income is exacerbated by high tax rates faced by those earning over $38,000. Ultimately the best way to deal with the problem would be to reduce and “flatten” tax rates. The provisions for a progressive rate of SSCWT should proceed, but in circumstances where wages and salaries are under $38,000, the 21% rate should still apply to the total. Comment The private sector was consulted on three options including that proposed by Business New Zealand (option 1). Option 1 proposed to base the SSCWT rate for each employee on the annual salary or wages of the employee. Where salary/wages are under $38,000, the 21% rate would apply to superannuation contributions. Business New Zealand is correct in stating that while private sector parties preferred option one, those consulted agreed that there was not a significant difference between option one and option two (the option preferred by officials). Option two bases the SSCWT rate for each employee on the annual salary/wages and superannuation contributions of the employee. Where salary/wages and superannuation contributions are under $38,000, the 21% rate would apply to the contributions. The preference for option two is that it will provide a calculation that is less likely to be manipulated. Although Business New Zealand is unconvinced “income re- characterisation” would be a significant problem in practice, there is some evidence to suggest that salary/wages are being re-characterised as superannuation contributions 158 by employees earning over $60,000 in order to access the 33% rate, or to reduce child support assessments. The fund withdrawal tax is applicable to these employees. This early withdrawal tax applies where employees take out superannuation contributions from their employment based superannuation funds within two years of the contribution. There is some evidence that this may not be deterring recharacterisations. Therefore, if implemented, option one would create a risk that employees may take superannuation contributions instead of additional salary and subsequently withdraw those contributions from the fund. It is perhaps less likely those employees on incomes less than $60,000 will be in a financial position to organise their affairs so that their salary/wages can be re-characterised as superannuation contributions. It is not, however, proposed to extend the fund withdrawal tax to the proposed progressive SSCWT proposal. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Trust deed calculation Clause 58 Submission (27 – The Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand Inc) In crafting the final legislation, drafters need to be aware that the trust deeds schemes vary in relation to the way in which employer contributions are expressed. These differences will result in different outcomes for members and employers. Comment We appreciate that in the case of net contributions there will be a saving to employers. However, a change to trust deeds would be required to ensure all savings are passed to employees, and this would create additional compliance costs. The particular wording of trust deeds is a matter to be negotiated between the parties concerned. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 159 Issue: Seasonal employees Clause 58 Submission (27 – The Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand Inc) Section NE 2AB(1) provides for employer “estimates” of salary and wages and specified superannuation contributions to be made in respect of employees who have been employed for less than a year. Subsection (2) then prescribes how these “estimates” must be made. The wording of subsection (2) is too prescriptive and does not adequately take into account the seasonal nature of some people’s employment and the variability that can occur in employer contribution rates over time. ASFONZ would like to see an option for an employer to use best estimates if it is considered, on reasonable grounds, that the prescriptive formulae will produce a poor “estimate”. Comment We agree with the submission. We consider that the new section should be reworded to enable the most accurate estimates in all circumstances. Recommendation That the recommendation be accepted. Issue: Rebate proposal Clause 58 Submission (42 – KPMG) Employees should be able to claim an income tax rebate for the difference between their income tax paid on their salary and wages (including their employer contributions) and the SSCWT deducted from their superannuation contributions. There are three key reasons that support a rebate approach over current proposals: • Current proposals impose yet more compliance costs on employers. • The degree of accuracy a rebate approach gives over the proposals • A lower rate of SSCWT allows taxpayers more cash in their hand to be disposed of as they see fit. 160 Comment The submission argues that the equity that the proposed amendments are designed to achieve could also be achieved by better aligning the rates of SSCWT with employees’ marginal tax rates and allowing lower-income earners a tax rebate on their contributions. A rebate mechanism was considered when the proposals (consulted on) were being developed. The conclusion reached was that a rebate mechanism would have some benefits but would also present a number of difficulties, such as increased compliance costs for employers and employees and administration impacts for Inland Revenue. The rebate mechanism would effectively re-introduce an annual interaction with Inland Revenue for significant numbers of taxpayers who have only recently been freed from the requirement to file an annual tax return. Employers would still face compliance costs in having to issue certificates to qualifying employees, and employees would also face increased compliance costs in having to obtain certificates and send claims to Inland Revenue. The administrative impact would include an increase in taxpayer contacts that would require resourcing. Initially, Inland Revenue would not know who would be likely to be eligible for a rebate, so it would not know who should be sent rebate claim forms and explanatory material. Also, rebate refunds to superannuation funds would be administratively complex for Inland Revenue. When these factors were considered, it was decided that the rebate mechanism would be too cumbersome and would undermine the recent moves towards simplification of the tax system. Another consideration is that the approach adopted in the bill ensures that the benefit of the lower tax rate supports saving, rather than being cashed out. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Drafting error Clause 58 Submission (33 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 30 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand Inc) Proposed section NE 2AB (2)(a) provides that, when estimating the level of employer contributions and the salary or wages of the employee for a particular year, the employee’s salary or wages from all sources is included. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) 161 There appears to be a drafting error in section NE 2AB (1)(a). When estimating the level of employer contributions and the salary or wages of the employee, salary or wages from all sources is included whereas only salary or wages from the employer making the estimate should be included. (Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand) Comment We agree with the submissions. Clause 58 should be clarified to ensure that only salary or wages from the employer making the estimate are included. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Clarification of intention of clause 58 Clause 58 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The current use of the word “otherwise” in clause 58 may confuse employers and cause them to think they may use income from the previous year or make an estimate when calculating the appropriate rate. Comment The wording the new section NE 2AB (1), relating to the calculation of the rate, should be clarified to reflect the intention that employer may use an estimate only if the employee did not work for that employer the previous year. Officials recommend that it be made clear that if an employer has employed the employee for all of the year immediately proceeding the year to which the specified superannuation contribution relates, this is the income figure that must be used when calculating the appropriate rate. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 162 Issue: Clarification is needed to show that SSCWT is not payable when employee not resident in New Zealand Clause 58 Submission (42 – KPMG) The law should be clarified to confirm that SSCWT is not payable on employer contributions when an employee is not resident in New Zealand and the income does not have a source in New Zealand. This amendment should apply retrospectively for the reason that, while there is unlikely to be any argument about the correct policy, IRD investigators understandably apply the rules as written. Comment We consider that KPMG has raised a valid point. However, this issue should be considered for inclusion in the tax policy work programme to ensure that any legislative solution is appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be declined but that the matter be considered for inclusion in the work programme. 163 CONFIRMATION OF ANNUAL INCOME TAX RATES Clause 3 Issue: Reduction in the tax-to-GDP ratio and in overall tax rates Submission (1W – New Zealand Business Roundtable, 19 – Business New Zealand) The tax-to-GDP ratio and tax rates overall should be reduced, requiring lower government expenditure relative to GDP. Current tax rates constrain New Zealand’s international competitiveness, appeal to investors, and sustainable economic growth rate. Business New Zealand submitted that the “headline” company tax rate should be reduced over time to 20%. This would increase New Zealand’s international competitiveness in the face of lower and declining average corporate tax rates in the OECD, the EU, and particularly Asia-Pacific. The resulting larger revenue base would over time offset much of the revenue cost. Revenue leakage would only occur where imputation credits are not being utilised (for example, by non-resident shareholders). Comment It has been a long-standing practice of Parliament to confirm the tax rates annually. The bill confirms that the annual income tax rates for the 2003-04 income year will be the same as the rates that applied for the 2002-03 income year. The rates being confirmed reflect the government’s current policy as to the rates of income tax it wishes to levy on businesses and other taxpayers. The government’s main concern in setting rates has been to generate sufficient revenue to meet its policy commitments. Alignment of the “headline” corporate tax rate with the middle personal tax rate has revenue, administration and compliance benefits. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 164 Issue: New Zealand should study tax and economic growth rates internationally to ensure that New Zealand’s tax rates are not discouraging investment or high-income residents Submission (42W – KPMG) New Zealand should study income tax and economic growth rates in comparable foreign jurisdictions to ensure that New Zealand’s rates are not discouraging further investment in productive capacity in New Zealand or the retention or immigration of high-income earners. KPMG’s international survey released in January this year indicates average rates of 30.79% in the OECD, 30.36% in Asia Pacific, 31.68% in the European Union and 30.55% in Latin America. Comment Treasury and the Ministry of Economic Development are researching the many influences on growth rates internationally, including the impact of tax systems. Adding research into the impact of income tax rates on economic growth to the tax policy work programme would displace other work. Many of the projects on the programme are expected to contribute to economic growth, for example by reducing compliance costs. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 165 HOME-BASED SERVICES Issue: Extending scope to all low-income activities Clauses 7, 20, 66(26), 66(28), 74, 79 and 86 Submission (42 – KPMG) The services to which the proposals to apply should be extended in scope to all activities when small amounts of income are paid, not just home-based services. Comment The purpose of the proposed measure is to address the relatively high compliance costs associated with industries where taxpayer income is relatively low. The proposed amendment allows the Commissioner to trade off the benefits of reducing taxpayer compliance costs against the costs of effecting that reduction, specifically the loss of tax revenue, administrative costs and any risk of inaccuracy. A broad provision giving the Commissioner a wide discretion has been used so that various industries can be considered in the future. However, home-based services are the most appropriate activity to be covered by the legislation at this stage because they are the most widespread. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Reflecting different costs within New Zealand Clauses 7, 20, 66(26), 66(28), 74, 79 and 86 Submission (48 – National Council of Women of New Zealand) The Commissioner determines standard costs that reflect the different costs within New Zealand. Comment The provisions as drafted do give the Commissioner the power to determine standard costs that differ between areas. Whether this occurs depends on several factors, including a balancing of the accuracy of the standard costs against the demands on the resources of the Commissioner. 166 Officials note that standard costs are approximations and as such will not be perfectly accurate for all taxpayers. Any inaccuracy will be limited as the Commissioner can only determine standard costs for industries where they will be sufficiently accurate. However, to increase accuracy beyond such a level would result in increased administration and compliance costs, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the provisions. Consultation with the home-based childcare industry has suggested that while major costs such as rental and heating may vary between areas, they tend to even out overall. For example, rental is more expensive in Auckland than in Invercargill, although heating is less expensive. Recommendation That it be noted that the provisions do give the Commissioner the power to determine standard costs that differ between areas. 167 SHORTFALL PENALTIES – LOSS ATTRIBUTING QUALIFYING COMPANIES Issue: Who should bear the penalty? Clause 95 Submission (38W – Data Analysis International Partnership, 39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Only the shareholders should be subject to a shortfall penalty. (Data Analysis International Partnership) An exemption should apply to the loss attributing qualifying company (LAQC), to the extent that the shortfall results in a reduction in tax losses attributed to shareholders. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Comment The bill provides for the removal of the double incidence of shortfall penalties when loss attributing qualifying companies and their shareholders are penalised for what is effectively the same underlying offence. If the LAQC pays its penalty in full, the shareholder will receive an offset of his or her penalty. Both submissions argue that the LAQC/shareholder should be treated in the same way as a partnership/partner relationship. Only the partners are subject to shortfall penalties if partnership income is overstated because the partnership is not a taxpayer. However, an LAQC is not a partnership. Although the qualifying company rules aim to treat shareholders and partners in similar ways for tax purposes, the tax treatment are not exactly the same. Where an LAQC earns income it will pay tax on that income, in the same way that an ordinary company does. If the submissions were to be accepted, one offence that converted an LAQC income to loss would cause two penalties, one to the shareholders in respect of the loss and one to the LAQC in respect of the profit. Further, such a change would cut across a related court case that is currently under appeal and would therefore be inappropriate at this stage. Accordingly, officials consider that no change should be made at this stage. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 168 Issue: Shareholder guarantee Clause 95 Submissions (44 – MinterEllisonRuddWatts, 49W – NSA Ltd) A better approach to this issue might be to impose shortfall penalties only on the LAQC, with the shareholder guaranteeing payment of the penalty, just as it guarantees other tax payments. (MinterEllisonRuddWatts) The definition of “income tax” for the purposes of the LAQC provisions should be amended to include shortfall penalties. This would effectively create a liability for the shareholders of the LAQC for the penalties of the company and overcome the issue of double penalties. (NSA Ltd) Comment For a company to be eligible for the status of an LAQC, the shareholders must agree to be liable for any income tax payments due by the company. For this purpose, the definition of “income tax” excludes civil penalties (including shortfall penalties) and interest. The effect of both submissions would be that there would be no need to impose shortfall penalties on shareholders of LAQCs. One penalty would be imposed on the LAQC, and if the LAQC did not pay the penalty, shareholders would become proportionally liable for the penalty. The shareholder would not be separately penalised for accepting any LAQC loss. Such a change would cut across a Court case on the point that is currently under appeal and would therefore be inappropriate at this stage. These submissions have merit, and may well offer better solutions for future impositions of penalties. However, further consultation is required on the issue. Recommendation That the submissions not be accepted at this stage. 169 Issue: Pro rata apportionment Clause 95 Submissions (39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 26 – New Zealand Law Society, 44A – MinterEllisonRuddWatts) • The offset mechanism should contain an exemption for the pro rata proportion relating to the period of ownership. The shareholding period qualification should be amended to apply from the start of the year of offence to the end of the year of offence. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) • There should be no shareholder continuity requirement. (New Zealand Law Society, MinterEllisonRuddWatts) Comment Under the proposed legislation, if the LAQC pays its penalty in full, the shareholder will receive an offset to his or her penalty. However, for the shareholder to receive the offset, he or she must have held the shares for the whole of the period from the start of the income year when the tax shortfall occurred to the date the penalty was imposed. Officials consider that the requirement for the shareholder to hold the shares for the whole period should be abandoned because a better policy outcome is achieved without the restriction – that is, only one penalty is imposed for one offence. However, abandoning the restriction presents a difficulty for taxpayer confidentiality: Inland Revenue would be unable to advise an ex-shareholder who applied for a remission why the application was declined, if the reason was that the LAQC had not paid its penalty. ICANZ has verbally suggested that the solution to this problem is that shareholders should be required to show that the LAQC penalty had been paid. Officials agree with this suggestion. Recommendation That the proposed shareholder continuity rule for offsets of penalty be abandoned and that shareholders who apply for remission be required to show that a LAQC penalty has been paid. 170 Issue: The Chapman case Clause 95 Submission (26 – New Zealand Law Society) It should be made clear that the enactment of section 141FC should not be read as supporting the interpretation of the Commissioner in Chapman v CIR, which is under appeal. Comment The Law Society points out that at issue in the Chapman case is whether the double incidence of shortfall penalties is in fact possible under current law. The enactment of clause 95 should not be read to confirm that the double incidence can apply under current law. That is a question for the court to decide at this stage. Officials confirm, as stated in the commentary on the bill, that clause 95 does not cut across the technical arguments in the Chapman case. Other solutions have been suggested that could impinge on that decision. These solutions will be reconsidered, if necessary, once the Chapman appeal has been decided. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Written application for relief Clause 95 Submission (26 – New Zealand Law Society) The protection offered by section 141FC should be automatic, rather than applying only if a taxpayer elects in writing. Comment This is a practical matter. The penalties for a LAQC and the shareholder might be imposed by different Inland Revenue officers or offices in different years. The shareholder can be presumed to have knowledge of double penalties and resultant payments and can therefore make application. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 171 Issue: Credits Clause 95 Submission (39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The legislation should be amended to allow for the amount the individual has actually paid (on behalf of the company) as a credit against his shortfall. Comment This submission is conditional on ICANZ’s primary submission on who should bear the penalty, which officials do not agree with for the reasons given above. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 172 APPLICATION OF INCOME TAX OR DIVIDEND WITHHOLDING PAYMENTS NOT REFUNDED Issue: Drafting Clause 38 Submission (39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The wording of the proposed section MD 5(1)(a) should be amended to “transfers of tax paid in excess that is not refunded and to which section MD 2(5) applies”. The wording of the proposed section MD 5(1)(b) should be amended by replacing the words “refunds” with the word “amounts”. Comment Section MD 5 is being redrafted to improve its clarity. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Remedial and other changes 175 CONTROLLED FOREIGN COMPANIES – EXEMPTION FOR INTERESTS IN CERTAIN LISTED COMPANIES Clauses 9B to 9D contain provisions that provide a limited exemption from the requirement to attribute income from controlled foreign companies (CFCs). These clauses were not in the bill when it was introduced. Instead, they were introduced at the Committee stage of the bill at the request of the government. The CFC rules in sections CG 4 to CG 13 of the Income Tax Act 1994 tax New Zealand residents on their interests in foreign companies that they control. For countries outside the “grey list” (the grey list comprises Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, United Kingdom, United States and Norway), the CFC rules attribute to the New Zealand owner their share of the foreign company’s income. Generally there is no attribution from grey list countries. However, income will be attributed when the grey list company (first tier CFC) has interests in a company in a non-grey list country (second tier company). In these cases, the income from the second tier company must be attributed directly to the New Zealand resident. To do this, the New Zealand resident must generally obtain detailed financial information about the second tier company from the first tier CFC. In the vast majority of cases this will be possible because the first tier CFC will not be listed and the New Zealand resident shareholder will have effective control over the CFC. This amendment concerns the rare situations where the first tier CFC is a listed company. The fact that the CFC is listed can mean that the shareholder cannot receive the requisite information from the CFC about second tier interests in non-grey list countries. This is because the country in which the CFC is resident is likely to have stock exchange listing rules that mean that, if the CFC provides the requisite financial information to the New Zealand shareholder, it must also provide the information to the market. The CFC will be likely to refuse a New Zealand resident shareholder’s request for such information on the basis that the information is commercially sensitive and its release to the market would be harmful to the commercial interests of the CFC. The amendment addresses this issue for New Zealand residents that have an interest in a CFC that is resident in a grey list country and the CFC is listed on recognised stock exchange (eligible CFC). Broadly, the rules provide that the attributed foreign income or loss, or foreign investment fund income or loss, of the New Zealand resident is nil if the interest arises as a result of an interest in an eligible CFC, provided that the laws of the country in which the eligible CFC is resident, or rules of the stock exchange, effectively prevent the disclosure of the requisite information to the New Zealand resident shareholder. The rules apply for the 2001-02 to 2005-06 income years. The amendment is temporary to provide officials with the opportunity to ascertain whether a more appropriate proposal can be developed to address the issue on a permanent basis. 176 The Committee called for submissions on the amendments but none were received. However, two minor amendments have been suggested by officials. These are discussed below. Issue: Application date Clause 9D Submission (Matter raised by officials) The application date for the provision should be amended so that the exemption is available to people that have filed a return of income on or after 31 March 2003. Comment Clause 9D(1) contains the substantive amendment that would provide a limited exemption from the attribution of income from a controlled foreign company (CFC). Clause 9D(2) provides that the exemption apply from the 2001-02 to 2005-06 income years. Clause 9D(3) further provides that the exemption does not apply to a person that files a return of income before 13 August 2003. Clause 9D(3) was inserted to prevent people who had applied the CFC rules to attribute income for past income years to claim the exemption in respect of these income years. The date of 13 August 2003 was chosen because this is the date that the proposed amendment could, conceivably, have become public. The limited CFC exemption is being proposed because a taxpayer approached the Minister of Finance and Revenue outlining that their unusual situation of owning a listed CFC in a grey list country meant that they could not apply the CFC rules to attribute income. Officials have learnt recently that the taxpayer in question has filed a nil return of income in relation to the CFC for the 2001 income year. We understand that a nil return was filed on the basis that insufficient information could be gained to attribute income under the CFC rules. The limited exemption is being proposed precisely to deal with the rare cases where taxpayers cannot attribute income under the CFC rules because the controlling interest is in a listed CFC. Therefore we consider that it is appropriate that the one case that we are aware of where this is causing a problem in practice should be catered for by the exemption. In order to achieve this for the 2001 income year, it is necessary to amend clause 9D(3) to cover people that have filed returns of income on or before 31 March 2003. Aside from the taxpayer in question, we are not aware of any other people that would qualify for the proposed exemption. 177 Recommendation That clause 9D(3) is amended so that it does not apply to people who have filed a return of income before 31 March 2003. Issue: Drafting clarification Clause 9D Submission (Matter raised by officials) The effect of clause 9D(1)(c) is to require a person seeking to apply the exemption, to satisfy the Commissioner that, owing to the circumstances outlined by paragraph (b), they are unable to obtain the information necessary to calculate their attributed foreign income. While the wording contained in the current clause 9D(1)(c) achieves this result, we consider that the clause should be amended to make its wording clearer Recommendation That the words beginning clause 9D(1)(c) which currently read: “the person satisfies the Commissioner that an effect of the aspects of the person’s situation that satisfy paragraph (b) is that...” be replaced with the words: “the person satisfies the Commissioner that an effect of the laws or rules that satisfy paragraph (b) is that...”. 178 GROSS CARELESSNESS Issue: Amendment not required Clause 94 Submission (26 – New Zealand Law Society, 33 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) “Gross carelessness” is defined in section 141C(3) as “doing or not doing something in a way that, in all circumstances, suggests or implies complete or a high level of disregard for the consequences”. It is difficult to see how making a mistake could ever suggest or imply a complete or high disregard for the consequences of the mistake. Logically, if a person was aware of the consequences of an action, that action could not be characterised as a “mistake”. (New Zealand Law Society) Creating the potential for a taxpayer who has made a calculation or recording error to be subject to the shortfall penalty for gross carelessness is a disproportionate and unnecessary extension of the penalties regime. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) This amendment is not necessary. The existing rules on what constitutes gross carelessness should be sufficient to determine whether the penalty should be imposed and will be determined on the facts of the case. The inclusion of all processing errors into the gross carelessness penalty is unnecessary. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Comment Officials accept the issues raised in submissions and agree that the amendment should be withdrawn. Current section 141A(4) adequately addresses the issue of a taxpayer making a mistake in the calculation or recording of numbers in a return by providing that such a taxpayer is not excluded from being liable for a penalty for not taking reasonable care. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Amend the definition of “gross carelessness” Submission (26 – New Zealand Law Society) The amendment to section 141C can be read to enlarge the gross carelessness net to catch taxpayers who make mistakes. This is objectionable and opposed by the 179 Society. However, if it is the desired outcome, Parliament should take the straightforward and upfront route and change the definition of “gross carelessness” in section 141C(3). Comment It was never the intention of this amendment to enlarge the gross carelessness net to catch taxpayers who make simple mistakes. As noted in the commentary on the bill the mistake would need to be of such a magnitude that the taxpayer breaches the gross carelessness standard. As noted above, officials are recommending that this amendment not proceed. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: No need to amend legislation to refer to unacceptable tax position Submission (39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) As stated in ICANZ’s submission on the Taxation (Annual Rates, Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2002, filed 16 August 2002, there is no need to change the shortfall penalty imposed under section 141A from unacceptable interpretation to unacceptable tax position. Comment The amendment the submission refers to was made in the Taxation (Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003. Because this issue is outside of the scope of this bill officials have not been able to consider it. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Penalties in excess of underlying shortfall Submission (34 – Jeff Owens and Company Limited) While it is outside the scope of the present bill, other tax legislation can give raise to penalties far in excess of any underlying shortfall, and these should be addressed as a matter of urgency. 180 Comment Because the issue raised in the submission is outside the scope of the current bill officials have not been able to consider them. Mr Owens has indicated that he will raise this matter in the future. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 181 PAYE BY INTERMEDIARIES Datacom Employer Services Ltd (Datacom) has made a submission on the bill about the recently introduced “PAYE by intermediaries” rules (principally on section NBB of the Income Tax Act 1994), which apply from 1 April 2004. The rules allow accredited intermediaries to largely assume an employer’s obligations under the PAYE rules – calculating PAYE, paying it and filing returns. Employers’ obligations under the rules are limited to paying their employees’ gross salary and wages to the PAYE intermediary (to be held in trust prior to disbursement to Inland Revenue and employees) and providing basic payroll information. While Datacom’s submission is not directly related to those aspects of the “PAYE by intermediaries” rules covered by the present bill, officials consider that it raises some valid concerns that should be addressed prior to the commencement of the rules. Issue: Scope of tax payments handled by PAYE intermediaries Submission Datacom has submitted that PAYE intermediaries should be able to assume responsibility for an employer’s obligations in relation to Specified Superannuation Contribution Withholding Tax (SSCWT), in addition to PAYE. Consequently, employers should be able to deposit deductions of SSCWT into a PAYE intermediary’s trust account prior to on-payment by the intermediary to Inland Revenue. Comment Datacom has commented that if the services provided by a PAYE intermediary were less than comprehensive, thereby leaving employers with significant compliance or other administrative tasks (for example, payment of SSCWT to Inland Revenue), employers will be less inclined to use a PAYE intermediary. Officials consider that if PAYE intermediaries wish to extend the services offered to include deduction and payment of SSCWT to Inland Revenue, on behalf of an employer, they should have the legislative authority to do so. A key aspect of the “PAYE by intermediaries” rules is shifting the tax compliance obligation from employers to payroll specialists, thereby reducing the costs to employers and improving the level of compliance. The extension of the rules to include SSCWT should reduce compliance costs for employers and increase the efficiency of the tax system. Recommendation That the “PAYE by intermediaries” rules be extended to give PAYE intermediaries the option to assume employers’ obligations to deduct and pay SSCWT. 182 Issue: Inland Revenue’s ability to refund overpayments of tax Submission The “PAYE by intermediaries” rules prevent overpayments of PAYE by an intermediary to Inland Revenue from being refunded if the overpayment is the result of an error. This creates a significant and unnecessary risk for PAYE intermediaries. Comment Officials agree that the legislative scope for refunding overpayments of PAYE to PAYE intermediaries needs to be widened to include overpayments that are a result of an external error (for example, a bank error). Currently, the rules in section NBB 7 of the Income Tax Act 1994 allow payments of tax to be refunded to PAYE intermediaries only if an intermediary has paid PAYE to Inland Revenue but the underlying payment by the employer has been dishonoured. Recommendation That section NBB 7 of the Income Tax Act 1994 be amended to widen the scope for Inland Revenue to refund overpayments of PAYE to PAYE intermediaries. Issue: Use of PAYE intermediaries’ trust accounts Submission The requirement for the net salary and wages of employees to be transacted through a PAYE intermediary’s trust account is unworkable. Net salary and wages should be able to be credited to employees’ bank accounts at the same time tax and other disbursements are paid into a PAYE intermediary’s trust account. Further, there may be instances when an employer will need to pay employees in cash, outside their normal pay run. These payments will be outside the “PAYE intermediary rules” because net pay will not be able to be transacted through the trust account. Comment The reason for requiring PAYE intermediaries to use the trust account in respect of both tax and net salary and wages (gross salary and wages) is to safeguard against the risk that if insufficient funds are available to meet both obligations employers are likely to authorise payment of the latter at the expense of the former, as the net pay of employees will be their earliest liability. If an employer is required to deposit gross salary or wages into a PAYE intermediary’s trust account, the risk that tax will bear the brunt of any shortfall is mitigated to the extent that even if insufficient funds are available, the PAYE intermediary will be responsible for ensuring that at least a portion of those funds are paid to Inland Revenue. While Datacom has commented that the processes they would employ would ensure that both net salary and wages and tax are transacted at the same time (to different accounts), thereby offering the 183 required protection to the revenue, the “PAYE by intermediaries” rules are expected to be applied by a number of other entities as well, who may have different processes. The rules, and therefore the associated safeguards, need to be viewed in that wider context. Datacom has, however, raised valid concerns in relation to instances when an employer pays employees in cash (for example, in the case of a dismissal or if an employee is granted an advance on pay), but requests the intermediary to handle the PAYE. These payments are outside the scope of the current rules as they violate the requirement that an employer must deposit the net pay of employees (along with PAYE) into a PAYE intermediary’s trust account. Equally, officials are aware that certain third party deductions may relate to amounts owing to the employer (such as social club fees and repayments for purchases made from the employer). Employers may wish to retain the right to make these deductions from their employees’ gross pay before transferring funds to a PAYE intermediary. Currently, the “PAYE by intermediaries” rules require these deductions to be deposited in a PAYE intermediary’s trust account prior to remittance back to employers. This will impose transaction costs on employers and their PAYE intermediaries. Officials recommend that a legislative exemption from the trust account requirements (in section NBB 6 of the Income Tax Act 1994) be allowed in respect of payments made by an employer to an employee that are outside the normal payment date for salary and wages of the employee (but still represent payment of salary and wages) and in the form of cash or a cheque. Equally, if employers wish to retain certain specified deductions from employees’ gross salary and wages, these deductions should also be exempt from the trust account requirements. In these instances, an employer will only be required to deposit the PAYE component (and any third party deductions not retained by the employer) into a PAYE intermediary’s trust account. Recommendation We recommend that: • the submission to remove the requirement that net salary and wages be deposited into a PAYE intermediary’s trust account be declined; and • an exemption from use of a PAYE intermediary’s trust account be allowed (in section NBB 6 of the Income Tax Act 1994) for net salary or wages paid by an employer to an employee in cash or cheque outside the normal payment date for salary and wages and for specified deductions retained by the employer. 184 Issue: Numbering of section 167 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Submission (Matter raised by officials) That sections 167(3) and 167(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, introduced in the Taxation (Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003, be repealed and re-inserted as sections 167(2B) and 167(2C), respectively. Comment There is a numbering error in section 167 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 with section numbers 167(3) and 167(4) being used twice. An amendment is needed to correct this error. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Drafting error in section NC 20(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994 Submission (Matter raised by officials) A drafting error in section NC 20(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994 should be corrected. Comment Section NC 20(1) was amended by the Taxation (Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003, with the addition of “PAYE intermediary,” after the words “any employer”. That insertion should be repealed and replaced by “, PAYE intermediary”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 185 CHILD SUPPORT AND THE PERSONAL PROPERTY SECURITIES ACT 1999 Clause 134 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The Child Support Act 1991 should be amended so that it reflects the policy outcome intended when the Personal Property Securities Act 1999 was enacted, that is, Inland Revenue should be able to register charges over the property of persons who default in the payment of child support. Comment The bill contains amendments to the Tax Administration Act (clause 98) and the Personal Property Securities Act (clauses 132 and 133) to ensure that charges created under the Tax Administration Act for unpaid tax may be registered on the Personal Property Securities register. As the Child Support Act contains a similar provision to that in the Tax Administration Act in relation to unpaid child support, similar amendments are required to the Child Support Act and the Personal Property Securities Act to ensure that such charges over property for unpaid child support can be registered and are valid. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 186 GST AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES – INITIATOR TEST Submission (4W – Telecom, Matter raised by officials) The GST treatment of telecommunications services should be clarified by removing the phrase “...to a person outside New Zealand...” from section 11AB(b), and amending the definition of “initiator” in section 8(9) to make the application of the place of supply and zero-rating rules for supplies of telecommunications services more certain. These amendments should apply from 1 July 2003, which is the date from which sections 11AB(b) and 8(9) applied. Comment The Taxation (Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003 contained provisions that clarified the GST treatment of cross- border supplies of telecommunications services by inserting a new place of supply rule, zero-rating provisions and definitions. These changes were arrived at after extensive consultation with the telecommunications industry. Fundamental to the operation of the new place of supply and zero-rating rules is determining which party has initiated a supply. In general, when a person in New Zealand initiates a supply of services those services will be subject to GST in New Zealand, and when a person outside New Zealand initiates a supply of services those services will be zero-rated and, therefore, not be subject to GST in New Zealand. Section 8(9) sets out factors to help determine which party to a supply of telecommunications services has initiated the supply. The initiator test lists the following factors: • Who pays for the services. • Who commences the supply. • Who terminates the supply. • Who contracts for the supply. As section 8(9) does not have a formal hierarchy of factors, or a “tie breaker” if two different persons fulfil the factors, officials had planned to clarify the application of the section through a Tax Information Bulletin article. 14 14 As noted in Taxation (Annual Rates, Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill: Officials' Report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on Submissions on the Bill, page 71. 187 New issues Officials have been in discussions with telecommunications suppliers relating to issues with the zero-rating and place of supply rules. Concern was raised with the wording of one of the zero-rating provisions, section 11AB(b), specifically the phrase “...to a person outside New Zealand...”, and the likely interpretation of this phrase as meaning to a person outside New Zealand in a contractual sense. This would in effect negate the initiator test limb of section 11AB(b), which is intended to focus on who “uses” the telecommunications services. In particular, when a New Zealand company has a cellular roaming agreement with a New Zealand telecommunications supplier and an employee of the New Zealand company uses a cellular phone outside New Zealand (as shown in the diagram below) the supply may be subject to GST, because of the contract with the New Zealand company. As the New Zealand employee who is outside New Zealand is making the phone call, and therefore “using” the services, officials consider that the employee should be considered the initiator of the supply of telecommunications services and the supply should therefore be zero-rated, as the initiator is outside New Zealand. The initiator test is intended to be the pivotal test for the new place of supply rules for telecommunications service, and, therefore, the location of the initiator of the supply of services should be determinative of zero-rating under section 11AB(b). The phrase “...to a person outside New Zealand...” should therefore be removed from section 11AB(b). New Zealand Telco Foreign Telco New Zealand Resident Company Foreign Resident Company $ Mobile Roaming Supply Contract Interconnection Agreement Employee of New Zealand Resident Company Mobile Phone Call 188 In the course of discussions with telecommunications suppliers, concerns were also raised more generally about the operation of the initiator test, specifically the relative weight of each of the factors, the ability to apply the test to achieve the most tax efficient outcome, and the suitability of a Tax Information Bulletin article to provide certainty in the application of the test. The initiator test, while providing a pragmatic proxy for consumption in most situations, is difficult to apply when there are two possible initiators of a supply – for example, where one party contracts and pays for a supply of telecommunications services but another party “uses” the services. Officials consider that, rather than relying on a Tax Information Bulletin article, an amendment should be made to section 8(9) to clarify the operation of the initiator test in relation to the relative importance of the factors, particularly which party contracts for a supply of services. We consider that an ordering rule (similar to section CI 3(10) of the Income Tax Act 1994) ranking the factors would provide the requisite certainty and limit the scope to apply the initiator test in a manner that would create inappropriate tax advantages. This would mean that if more than one person satisfied the factors in the initiator test, the initiator would be the person who satisfies the factor which appears highest on the list of factors in the test. The order of factors should be: 1. The person who controls the commencement of the supply. 2. The person who pays for the services. 3. The person who contracts for the supply. In discussions with telecommunications suppliers the necessity of the “termination” factor in the initiator test was raised, with concerns that it was confusing and unnecessary. Officials therefore recommend removing the “termination” factor from the initiator test in section 8(9). We recommend that these amendments apply from 1 July 2003, the date from which the amendments in the Taxation (Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003 apply. Officials note that Telecom New Zealand Limited (submission 4W) supports these changes, and that other telecommunications suppliers consulted have expressed general support for the changes. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 189 REGULATORY IMPACT AND BUSINESS COMPLIANCE COST STATEMENTS Submission (19 – Business NZ) Officials should be asked to provide best quantitative estimates on the financial and economic impacts of the changes contained in the bill. Comment Business NZ has commented that compliance cost reduction rates as among the top priorities for the business community, particularly for small businesses, and while it welcomes many of the government’s initiatives to reduce these costs it says that there is much room for improvement. In particular, Business New Zealand has expressed concern in relation to the analysis of compliance cost implications of proposed legislation contained in Regulatory Impact and Business Compliance Cost Statements attached to bills. It has commented that there is often very little quantitative analysis in Regulatory Impact and Business Compliance Cost Statements (for example, the degree to which compliance costs are expected to change) and, equally, a lack of analysis of the wider economic impacts, thereby making it difficult for submitters to assess the financial and economic impact on compliance costs, either individually or in aggregate. It is often quite difficult to quantify the compliance impacts of proposed changes, as the impact can vary across the population according to factors such as taxpayer size and behaviour. While high-level estimates of compliance costs impacts are provided where possible, more often the impacts can only be qualitatively analysed. Inland Revenue is, however, planning to improve its capacity to analyse the compliance cost impacts from proposed changes to the tax system, to better comply with Regulatory Impact and Business Compliance Cost Statement requirements. For example, the department has recently commissioned research into businesses’ tax compliance costs, which should, among other things, allow the compliance impacts of proposed tax policy initiatives to be tested in an experimental way and therefore be known before they are implemented. Preliminary results from the research are expected to be available by end-2004. It is also worth noting that the Generic Tax Policy Process ensures that proposed changes to the tax system are publicly consulted on at a very early stage, a fact acknowledged by Business NZ, which has commented that it finds Inland Revenue to be one of the better agencies for consulting the business community. This process allows affected parties the opportunity to raise concerns they may have in relation to the compliance cost impacts of proposed tax changes prior to the legislative stage. Recommendation Note that officials are doing further work to improve the analysis of compliance cost impacts in Regulatory Impact and Business Compliance Cost Statements. 190 REQUISITION OF OFFSHORE INFORMATION Clause 76 Issue: Inability to comply with information-gathering provisions Submissions (39 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 42W – KPMG) Section 17(1B) fails to recognise the reality that although a New Zealand resident may control a foreign entity, it is not always possible to access records and information as if the foreign entity were resident in New Zealand. The proposed amendment linking this section to the relevant offence provisions will only compound this problem and as such should not proceed. Both submissions note that their organisations had made submissions against the introduction of section 17(1B) in the previous Act. Comment Section 17(1B) was introduced to ensure that Inland Revenue can requisition from New Zealand residents information on documents held by offshore entities controlled by New Zealand residents. The proposed amendment ensures that the relevant offence provisions can apply if a taxpayer fails to comply with section 17(1B). Failure to make the proposed amendment would allow those who are in effective control of an offshore entity to fail to provide information they are legally required to provide. These taxpayers would have no risk of penalty as the relevant penalty sections were not correctly updated to take account of the amendment to the definition of control made in the previous Act. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Consistency of terminology Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment should be made to the information-gathering provisions in section 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (and related penalty provisions in sections 143 and 143A) so they refer to information in the knowledge, possession or control of a non-resident. 191 Comment Section 17(1B) was recently enacted by the Taxation (Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003 to ensure that Inland Revenue can requisition from New Zealand residents information or documents held by offshore entities controlled by the New Zealand residents. This bill contains a clarifying amendment to ensure that the effect of section 17(1B) is carried through to the relevant offence provisions, which was always the legislative intention. Sections 143(2) and 143A(2) state that no person may be convicted of the offence of not providing information to the Commissioner if they prove that the information was not in their knowledge, possession or control. It would be desirable for the information-gathering provisions and related offence provisions to use consistent terminology, and therefore section 17(1B) should refer to information that is in the knowledge, possession or control of a non-resident. The use of consistent terminology would also improve the effectiveness of these provisions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 192 ELECTING THE APPROPRIATE TAX RATE ON EXTRA EMOLUMENTS Submission (42W – KPMG) The amendment to section NC 8(1A) of the Income Tax Act 1994 in clause 55(2) of the bill should not proceed. Comment The submission has commented that it is not until an employee’s income exceeds approximately $146,000 that their effective marginal tax rate starts to exceed 33%. For employees with incomes below this, taxing their extra emoluments at 39 percent is overtaxation. On an income of $146,000 a taxpayer’s average tax rate is approximately 33%, not their marginal tax rate (which is the amount payable on the next dollar earned). On this level of income the marginal tax rate is 39%. Section NC 8(1A) of the Income Tax Act 1994 deals with marginal, not average, tax rates. The amendment to that section clarifies that only employees with annual taxable income of $60,000 or less can apply to have any extra emoluments taxed at the 33 percent marginal tax rate. This is consistent with the rates of tax (and associated income thresholds) prescribed in schedule 1 to the Income Tax Act. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Other amendments proposed by officials 195 QUALIFYING TRUST STATUS Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment should be made to the definition of “qualifying trust” in the Income Tax Act 1994. It would allow a trust that is a non-qualifying trust because all of the trustee’s income tax obligations have not been satisfied to become a qualifying trust retrospectively if the trustee’s income tax obligations are satisfied, including the payment of use-of-money interest and any penalties. Comment Most trusts established in New Zealand by New Zealand resident settlors come within the Income Tax Act definition of a “qualifying trust”. This definition includes the requirement that all of the trustee’s income tax obligations have been satisfied since the beginning of the trust. The main benefit of a qualifying trust status is that all distributions from a qualifying trust of amounts other than beneficiary income (current year trust income distributed to beneficiaries) are not taxable to beneficiaries. A draft Inland Revenue statement has recently been issued for external consultation which addresses the issue of what is the tax treatment if the trustees of a qualifying trust have underpaid income tax in the past and subsequently make a distribution without rectifying the underpayment. The statement says that such a trust is not a qualifying trust for the period that the underpayment has not been rectified and any distributions made in the period will be taxable distributions taxed at the rate of 45%. A result of the draft Inland Revenue interpretation is that a small underpayment of income tax by a trustee of a trust can have disproportionately penal consequences for beneficiaries. For example, in the case where a home is owned by a family trust an underpayment of tax of $100 several years ago by the trust could result in the beneficiaries living in the home being taxed on the value of that accommodation when they normally would not be. Officials consider that such disproportionate consequences are not an appropriate policy result. Officials note that when the trust taxation rules were developed, in 1988, the current comprehensive use-of-money interest and penalty provisions were not in place. The requirement in the qualifying trust definition that all of the trustee’s income tax obligations must be satisfied was intended as an incentive to comply with the trust taxation rules. This incentive can now be more appropriately provided by the current use-of-money interest and penalty provisions. The policy underpinning the qualifying trust rules is that full New Zealand tax is paid on a current basis on the worldwide trustee income of trusts settled by New Zealand residents. This policy objective can be met by applying the use-of-money interest and penalty rules to any underpayment of tax by a trustee of a qualifying trust. It is not necessary for such a trust to lose its qualifying trust status so that beneficiaries are taxed at a 45% rate on certain distributions. 196 Under this proposed amendment a non-qualifying trust will be able to become a qualifying trust retrospectively if all of its income tax obligations are satisfied, including the payment of use of money interest and penalties. Any taxable distributions that were made by the trust during the period when there was an underpayment of tax on trustee income would be unwound. The tax treatment of foreign trusts, which are trusts settled by non-residents, will not be affected by this amendment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 197 GST DEREGISTRATION Issue: Allowing notification of GST deregistration to be made over the telephone Submission (Matter raised by officials) The requirement that notification of GST deregistrations be made in writing be relaxed to allow notification over the telephone. Comment This matter was raised by officials in consultation with small businesses. Officials agree that the “in writing” requirement is unnecessary. When taxpayers deregister for GST they are required to notify Inland Revenue in writing. Taxpayers already correspond via telephone with Inland Revenue requesting the form used for GST cessations. The entire cessation process can be completed in this one telephone call without need for the form to be sent, completed and returned. This will result in a significant reduction in both taxpayer compliance costs and administrative costs. Officials recommend that section 52 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 be amended to allow notification of GST deregistrations be made over the telephone. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 198 AN AMENDMENT TO THE SECRECY PROVISIONS TO PROVIDE FOR INFORMATION TO BE TRANSFERRED TO THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 81(4) of the Tax Administration Act should be amended to provide for information to the Ministry of Health. Comment Schedule 6 of the Gambling Act 2003 amends section 81(4) of the Tax Administration Act to enable gaming information to be disclosed by Inland Revenue to the Department of Internal Affairs so the latter can determine the problem gambling levy rate. The problem gambling levy is imposed on gaming operators to provide funding for provision of problem gambling services. Officials have recently become aware that gaming information will also need to be transferred to the Ministry of Health to enable the Ministry to determine the problem gambling levy rate in conjunction with the Department of Internal Affairs. Officials recommend that: • section 81(4) of the Tax Administration Act be amended to provide that information can be transferred from Inland Revenue to both the Department of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Health for the purposes of determining the problem gambling levy rate; and • this proposed amendment apply from the date the bill is assented to. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 199 MINOR DRAFTING CHANGES Issue: Redundant provision Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 141FB(2)(b)(i) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be repealed. Comment Section 141FB was inserted by the Taxation (Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003 and provides for the reduction of shortfall penalties where the taxpayer has a previous history of good behaviour. Section 141FB(2)(b)(i) refers to reducing the shortfall penalty for “evasion or similar act” which is already dealt with in section 141FB(1). Section 141FB(2)(b)(i) is therefore redundant. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: GST – domestic transportation services supplied to non-residents Clause 109 Submission (35W – KPMG on behalf of the New Zealand Overseas Movers’ Association) The submission supports the amendment as drafted. Comment The proposed change was referred to the Finance and Expenditure Committee by the Minister of Finance and Revenue on 18 July 2003 for inclusion in this bill. Interested parties were then invited to make submissions on the proposals. The purpose of new section 11A(1)(cb) is to clarify that transportation services supplied under contract to a non-resident international removals company in relation to the movement of household goods in New Zealand are treated as zero-rated supplies. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 200 Issue: GST Act drafting improvement Clause 109 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The drafting of the GST Act provision allowing the zero-rating of services supplied in relation to exported goods should be improved. Comment Section 11A(1)(m) of the GST Act was enacted in 2000 and zero-rates services supplied directly in connection with exported goods if the services are supplied to a non-resident who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. Officials consider that the drafting of this zero-rating provision should be improved to make it completely clear that the relevant services must be supplied to a non-resident. This drafting improvement does not result in a policy change. Recommendation That the submission be accepted.
Taking a Fixed Tax Position in a Changing World – a personal perspective Robin Oliver General Manager, Policy Inland Revenue Department, New Zealand October 2003 2 1. Introduction Since the early 1990s the fundamentals of our tax law have remained relatively stable. We continue to have a tax system reliant on GST and income tax. Over this period, individual income tax has remained moderately progressive, compared with the pre- 1984 tax scale. Capital gains remain untaxed and the corporate rate and imputation remain the same. There was a period of very radical tax reform from 1984 through to the early 1990s and since then a period of consolidation. Nevertheless, we continue to have, on average, two substantial taxation bills introduced into Parliament each year. While the changes involved tend to be at a detailed level, they are nevertheless considerable. This means that tax practitioners operate in a world with ever changing rules, which is difficult for them. It is certainly easier to base tax advice on a known quantity such as the law. Practitioners are trained in the interpretation of the law and various tax rules. This is their area of comfort. Consideration of how the rules might change and what impact that may have is speculation. It is outside the normal area of training for an accountant or a lawyer and draws more from the disciplines of politics and economics than from law or accountancy. The issue posed by this paper is whether tax advice that does not take into account the prospect of legislative change is in fact adequate. My view is that it is not adequate and that advisors need to anticipate change. This might reduce the surprise some people seem to have when the law is changed and their transactions are affected by that change. If practitioners should be conscious of, and anticipate, legislative change, the second question is how to do so in a sensible and professional manner. As previously noted, this requires skills beyond those acquired through a study of accountancy and law. This paper aims to provide some thoughts and guidance on this point. 3 I offer my own personal perspective on this issue. I do so as a senior tax policy advisor to the New Zealand government. However, on issues such as retrospectivity and grandparenting the views expressed are my own, and may not in particular instances necessarily be those of the government or indeed officials. Nevertheless, as the examples given demonstrate, the views provided here do seem to be reflected in practice. The paper first of all considers the case for certainty of tax law and whether certainty is always desirable. That section concludes that certainty in the tax area, as elsewhere, has benefits, but certainty can incur a considerable cost. As a result, one should not assume that tax law will be fixed. That being the case, the paper considers the various ways a client may be affected by tax law change. The first case is where the law changes prospectively but this affects the future tax position of a transaction already entered into. This, usually adverse, result can be offset by grandparenting provisions. But in what circumstances are grandparenting provisions likely and in what circumstances are they less likely? The impact on a client is greatest when a law change is retrospective. While the general position of governments has been to avoid retrospectivity, it can arise. When is this most likely? What protections are often given and in what circumstances? Finally, the paper considers the case of law changes being announced by Ministers with legislation to follow. In what circumstances is this most likely? 2. Certainty in tax law Certainty in tax law can be justified on jurisprudential grounds as well as economic or policy grounds. This paper focuses on the latter. The jurisprudential arguments over certainty and its relationship to the rule of law have been extensively covered by the literature, and those interested should refer to that. It is briefly canvassed in section 4 of this paper. From an economic or policy perspective, certainty is a benefit. Certainty reduces risk and risk is a cost. This can be illustrated by the example of an investor, who is interested in its after-tax rate of return. If the tax position is certain, an investment 4 will be undertaken up to the point that it meets the investor’s required rate of return. If the tax law and, therefore, tax position is uncertain, the expected after-tax rate of return falls. That is because the probability of an unfavourable tax change must be factored into the expected rate of return. Since that means that some investment will not meet the required rate of return, the level of investment in the economy is reduced. Another way of looking at this is that the evidence is overwhelming that a prerequisite for a highly performing economy is clear property rights. For example, it is difficult to gain the benefits of trade when it is unclear who owns tradeable items. A person’s tax position may be seen as a property right that should be as clearly defined as possible. While this seems clear, it does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that tax law should be certain and fixed for all time. Uncertainty incurs risk and thus costs, although the risk can itself be removed only at a cost. Take, for example, fluctuations in foreign currency pricing under our floating exchange rate. This imposes costs on business, being the costs of fully hedging positions, if indeed that is practical. Theoretically, the government could remove this cost by fixing the exchange rate, but that also has costs. A floating exchange rate absorbs the impact of external economic changes (such as changes in export and/or import prices). Under a fixed exchange rate that impact must be absorbed by wage and price levels or unemployment. Thus, various governments have concluded that although a floating exchange rate imposes costs on business, those costs are justified. In the same way, a tax law that is not fixed imposes costs by way of risks and uncertainty. However, a fixed tax law would impose costs. It would, for example, place all the burden for maintenance of the government’s fiscal position on expenditure. It would also leave the government unable to alter the law to reflect changing views of equity, and it would provide no mechanism for countering the degradation of the tax base resulting from the activity of tax advisors or, for that matter, for correcting mistakes harmful to taxpayers. 5 There is no instance that I know of where tax law is fixed. We need to accept that tax law is forever changing, although we also need to bear in mind that any change needs to be justified because each change incurs a cost. 3. Prospective tax law changes and grandparenting Given that tax law will change, it is important to consider how that will affect clients. I look first at the ‘base case’, where the law has changed, but prospectively. This means that the new law comes into place only for income derived or expenses incurred after date of enactment or some later date. I call this the base case because it seems to be consistent with the view that laws should generally be prospective. In the sphere of criminal law, the principal that underlies non-retrospectively is relatively easy to describe. A prime purpose of criminal law is to modify behaviour. If I act in a way that is lawful but, retrospectively, and contrary to my expectations, the law is changed to make my actions unlawful, then I am subject to criminal sanctions, and the law cannot be said to be achieving its objective of modifying my behaviour. The law is then being misused. The costs of uncertainty are not outweighed by the benefits of the law change. Arguably there are exceptions to this, such as the Nuremburg Trials, but it is a useful guiding rule. We use the same guiding rule in the tax area, but in the area of economic regulation (including tax) the issues are not as clear as in the criminal area. Where actions are motivated by economic costs and benefits, the law change alters the economic cost/benefit calculus. The mere fact that the law change takes effect prospectively does not protect people from the impact of that change. Take the hypothetical example of the government taxing the capital gains of rentiers of housing accommodation. Even if the law took effect after enactment, an existing rentier would still face a tax on their capital gain, reducing the expected after-tax return from the transaction. 6 One approach to provide for this is grandparenting – not applying the law to transactions entered into before the proposal to change the law is announced. This will still not necessarily leave past actions unaffected by the change in the law. That is because the change in law can be capitalised into asset prices affecting all existing asset holders, including those who are grandparented. Take again the example of a capital gains tax on rentiers. The immediate affect of such a tax is likely to be a reduction in the return on rental accommodation as an investment (assuming there is an expectation of capital gain built into the rental return). The reduction in the return from rental accommodation in the first instance could be expected to reduce the value of all rental accommodation assets. This, in turn, is likely to reduce investment in the rental area, leading to the reduction in the supply of rental accommodation. That reduction in the supply over time should result in an increase in rentals, assuming demand for accommodation is unchanged. The value of rental assets should then increase again but only back to its original level if the full burden of the tax is borne by those who are renting. The point is that even those who are grandparented and not taxed on the capital gain may be subjected to the effects of the tax through changes in asset prices. They still receive the benefit of a tax-free capital gain, but the capital gain may be lower. Grandparenting is not therefore seen as appropriate with respect to broadly based tax changes affecting sectors of the economy where relative asset prices are changed. If sectors are to lose or gain tax concessions, the policy intent is to alter relative after-tax rates of return and thus asset prices. Grandparenting does not make sense in this context. Nor is grandparenting generally seen as appropriate where the protection afforded is likely to apply for long periods of time. While that can add certainty for protected taxpayers, the cost is ongoing inequities with a different tax treatment being applied to people undertaking the same activity. It is for that reason that officials did not recommend to the government that existing transactions be grandparented in the case of the proposed deferred deduction rules. Instead, grandparenting is generally limited to transactions of a specific nature that can be expected to be completed in a relatively short time. In that case there is a close similarity with the transaction that has been completed before enactment and that 7 would thus not be affected by prospective legislation. In that case, the benefits of greater certainty in allowing contracts to be completed as contemplated by the parties, seems to outweigh the cost (mostly fiscal) of grandparenting. A case in point was the change to the petroleum mining rules in the Taxation (Relief, Refunds and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill enacted in 2002. The amendment prevented the disposal of a petroleum mining entity giving rise to what amounted to double deductions. The fiscal implications were significant, and it was proposed that the measure apply to transactions entered into after the date of announcement. Given the fiscal risks, it would not have been feasible to propose such a measure with effect from a future date. Making it apply from announcement allowed for consultation through the select committee process. This proved worthwhile since it was at this stage that it became clear that an uncompleted transaction might be affected. The select committee agreed to make the measure effective from announcement but grandparented binding contracts entered into before the date of announcement. The distinction between a completed transaction and a binding contract entered into did not justify a different tax treatment. The benefit of people being able to enter specific transactions and being able to rely upon existing law governing those transactions justified grandparenting. Grandparenting provisions are not always taxpayer-friendly. On some occasions it has been seen as justified to grandparent existing transactions and not give them the more favourable tax treatment open to new transactions. The argument is that the more favourable treatment incurs a fiscal cost in order to encourage a particular activity such as increased investment. Providing this to past transactions incurs the fiscal cost but, because the transactions have already taken place, there is no corresponding benefit. One example of this is the McLeod Review proposal to provide a lower tax rate for foreign direct investment after date of implementation but retain a higher rate for existing investment. Another example of grandparenting that can be unfavourable to taxpayers is the depreciation rates. Our depreciation rates are set out in the table below. 8 DATE OF ASSET PURCHASED DEPRECIATION RATES 1995/1996 and later Generally economic rates plus 20 % uplift 1 April 1993 – 1994/5 Old schedule rates plus 25% uplift or economic rates and no uplift 16 December 1991 – 31 March 1993 Old schedule rates plus 25% uplift 15 December 1991 and earlier Old schedule rates This enormously complex grandparenting aimed to minimise the fiscal cost of more generous depreciation rates while being as fair as possible to different taxpayers in different positions. 4. Retrospective law changes As previously noted, New Zealand governments have adopted a general policy of not enacting retrospective tax legislation. This is in accordance with long-standing constitutional and jurisprudential principles that retrospective legislation is unjust, and contrary to the rule of law and proper legislation. This general doctrine can be traced back to the statement by Thomas Hobbes in 1671: “No law made after a fact done, can make it a crime because a positive law cannot be taken notice of, before it be made, and therefore cannot be obligatory,” 1 These views were echoed by Blackshore in his Commentaries on the Laws of England. This aversion to retrospectivity is expressed in many forms. The following are examples: 1 T Hobbes Leviathan, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1904 at 212 9 (a) The common law presumption against interpreting statutes to have retrospective effect. An example is the following observation by Gault J in the New Zealand Court of Appeal. “The principle against retrospective criminal liability and retrospective increased penalties is well established. The reasons for the principle in terms of prior direction or deterrence and the consequent possibility of knowing compliance, and justice, in not being subject to unknowable penalties are long established and impregnable.” 2 This common law presumption is reflected in section 7 of the Interpretation Act 1999, which states: “An enactment does not have retrospective effect.” (b) International instruments such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 3 (c) Constitutional instruments such as the Constitution of the United States of America. Article 1 (a) (3) of that Constitution states: “No bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed.” (d) New Zealand statutes. Section 10A of the Crimes Act 1961 states that: “No person shall be liable in any criminal proceedings in respect of an act or omission by him, if at the time of the act or omission, the act or omission did not constitute an offence.” Section 26 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 provides the same protection as the Crimes Act and section 25 (g) of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act protects people from penalty increases prior to sentencing. Section 7 of the Act requires the Attorney General to report to Parliament any provision of a Bill that appears to be inconsistent with that Act. 4 2 R v. Poumako \[2000\] 2 NZLR 695 3 Article 11 (2) 4 Standing Order 260 requires the Attorney General to report before the second reading is passed 10 The jurisprudential aversion to retrospectivity is thus entrenched in international and New Zealand law. It is to be noted, however, that with the exception of the general presumption against retrospectivty in the common law and the Interpretation Act 1999, this is normally limited to the area of retrospective criminal sanctions. For example, although the United States Constitution may have been open to a wider interpretation, the US Supreme Court has limited the prohibition on “ex post facto law” to criminal law. 5 The general presumption against retrospectivity is nevertheless reflected in the general policy approach in the tax area because of its foundation in ideas of fairness, justice and the economic benefits flowing from operating under certain law. It needs to be appreciated, however, that whereas the concept of criminal retrospectivity is relatively easy to define as set out by Hobbes in the seventeenth century, what is meant by retrospectivty in the tax and civil areas generally is not such a clear concept. For example, in a letter to the Finance and Expenditure Committee, dated 31 July 2001, on the Taxation (Annual Rates, Taxpayer Assessment and Miscellaneous Matters) Bill 2001 6 officials identified three views on retrospectivity in jurisprudential literature. Retrospective legislation can be seen as: (a) any change in the law, or (b) any law that affects a prior action of a person, or (c) any law that defeats the rational and legitimate expectation of those to whom the law applies. This means that it is difficult to base tax policy on the simple rule that tax legislation should never be retrospective. Even if the formulistic notion of retrospectivity is adopted so that no legislation should come into effect until after enactment, in practice this if often found not to be a guide to good policy. 5 Calder v Bul (1798) 3 US 385 6 See Annex A 11 This is illustrated by the Taxation (Annual Rates, GST, Trans-Tasman Imputation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2003, currently before Parliament. The Bill has 133 clauses. Of these, 27 (mainly GST) commence after date of introduction. Another 27 (mainly relating trans-Tasman imputation) commence on 1 April 2003. The remaining 87 clauses apply from various dates back to 1 July 1994. There does seem to be a lot of retrospective change and the Bill does not seem to be highly out of line with what can be expected in a tax bill. A closer examination of the bill reveals that what at first sight may seen highly retrospective is not in fact unreasonable. The trans-Tasman measures are retrospective to 1 April 2003 so as to align implementation dates to the imputation year and to similar measures enacted in Australia. Making the measures effective from 1 April 2004 might improve “purity” but at a cost of a year’s deferral of the advantage to taxpayers of wider crediting for New Zealand tax paid by trans-Tasman companies. The most retrospective measure in the Bill is clause 103. That clause is retrospective back to 1 July 1994. However, the change it effects seems innocuous. In defining “flat-owning or office-owning company” in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 the present Act refers to the Companies Amendment Act 1964. However, that Act was repealed in 1993 and the definition is now in the Land Transfer Act 1952. Clause 103 fixes up these cross-references so that sense can be made of the Act. Two clauses in the Bill illustrate how retrospective changes can be either favourable or unfavourable to taxpayers. Clause 75 is retrospective back to 1 April 1995. The clause clarifies that the Commissioner can give a valid notice to a taxpayer or agent by posting the notice to an address nominated by that taxpayer or agent rather than the person’s physical address. The history of the proposal is to be found in the High Court case of Hieber v CIR. 7 That case and its background made it uncertain whether Inland Revenue notices can be posted to post boxes. If anything this provision is taxpayer-unfriendly and retrospective but it seems reasonable. 7 (2002) 20 NZLR 17, 774 12 Clause 95 is retrospective back to 1 April 1998, but is taxpayer-friendly. It deals with the situation where, as a consequence of the attribution of a net loss by a loss attributing qualifying company and the subsequent disallowance of deductions to the company and, therefore, the shareholders as well, shortfall penalties are charged to both the company and the shareholders. The clause will allow the shareholder to apply for a reduction in the penalty when the shortfall penalty charged to the company has been paid in full. I think these examples illustrate that, at least in the tax area, retrospective legislation (defined as legislation that comes into effect prior to enactment) can produce a fairer, more just and more economically efficient result than blind adherence to a principle on non-retrospectivity. Whether any particular measure or not should be retrospective needs to be determined after a careful consideration of the costs and benefits of alternative implementation dates. Some concern has been expressed about this approach to retrospectivty. Jan James and Nick Bland of Simpson Grierson, Auckland have written: “This retreat to a cost-benefit assessment creates a risk that retrospective legislation will become a tool of fiscal management, ultimately undermining the integrity of the tax system and the legal system as a whole.” 8 However, as outlined in officials’ letter to FEC of 31 July 2001 (Annex A), officials’ approach to retrospectivity is more sophisticated than a simply fiscal calculus. In that letter it is stated that officials agree that retrospective legislation can undermine our constitution and economic structure. However, officials interpret retrospectivity not narrowly, simply as legislation with a pre-enactment effect, but more broadly, as legislation that is contrary to the national and legitimate expectations of people. Such an interpretation allows for the complex economic environment in which tax law operates. 8 New Zealand Law Journal, October 2001 James , J and Blank, N – “Tax Update” – at 363. 13 It is legislated changes in expectations that really matter, not just changes in the legal words. Protecting expectations is seen as the best way of balancing the social and economic benefits of legal certainty with the social and economic costs of living with fixed tax law. To be protected, however expectations must be rational and legitimate. A person may honestly believe that tax rates should never be increased and may act on that basis. However, in our society that is not a reasonable or legitimate expectation. Business must operate in an environment of risk. This includes the risk of changing markets, price levels, foreign exchange rates and so on. Certain tax changes are within this ambit of risk that should be expected. Among these are changes in tax rates. The current tax bill illustrates the application of these guiding principles. It hardly seems a rational and legitimate expectation that you can avoid your tax liabilities by having notices sent to the address you nominated rather than your physical address. Clause 75 recognises this and is technically retrospective in effect. On the other hand, a person who invests in a loss attributing qualifying company can reasonably expect penalties if they take, say, an aggressive tax position. It is, however, reasonable to conclude that they would not expect a double layer of penalties. Clause 95 recognised this and proposes retrospectively to remove one level of penalty. If it is accepted that it can be justified to have legislation with pre-enactment effect, the issue arises as to whether in such cases, other protections can be justified. The position adopted by officials is that this can be the case. Such protections may be termed carve-outs from pre-enactment effect. Two forms of such carve-outs can be found in our tax legislation. The minimalistic form is a carve-out for judicial proceedings that have been instigated prior to introduction of the legislation. An example of this was the 1998 Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Bill. In that case a taxpayer entered into a waiver of the time bar. The taxpayer later argued that the time bar waiver was invalid and any assessment was time barred. Clause 91 of the Bill clarified that time bar waivers were not invalid. However, prior to the legislation being introduced the taxpayer instigated judicial proceedings. In these circumstances the Select Committee 14 amended the Bill so as to carve-out from clause 91 proceedings that had been instigated. This was seen as reflecting the spirit of section 27 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. This provides that litigation against the Crown will be dealt with according to the law in the same way as civil proceedings between individuals. One difficulty with this approach is that judicial proceedings are merely one part of the tax disputes process and it could be argued that similar protection should be given to all phases of that disputes process. Such protection is achieved by the more common form of carve-out, which is to exclude from legislation with pre-enactment effect those taxpayers who have previously adopted the position that the legislation overturns. This is usually evidenced by the fact that the taxpayer has filed a return on the basis of an interpretation of the law that is being overturned or issued a notice of proposed adjustment on that basis. The rationale here is that taxpayers who enter a transaction and file a return on the basis of a certain interpretation of the law can be reasonably concluded to have acted on the rational and legitimate expectation that the law will not change. It has proved more difficult to apply this principle in the case of GST. That is because a refund for GST input credits can arguably be claimed up to eight years after the transaction has taken place. In other words the transaction can take place with the taxpayer having one expectation but being later able to claim refunds on the basis of a different interpretation of the law. This situation arose with the Taxation (Annual Rates, Taxpayer Assessment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2001. That bill retrospectively blocked GST refunds affecting inbound tour operators and educational institutes. For the reasons given above, the legislation did not change the law for those who had already received refunds but did so for others, including taxpayers who had lodged claims with Inland Revenue. This is a limitation of the carve-out approach. Another limitation is that it can be seen as protecting those who take the most aggressive interpretation of the law. On the other hand it can be useful in differentiating between those who had a rational and 15 legitimate expectation of the law from those who stood to gain a windfall from a change in the generally accepted interpretation of the law. 5. Ministerial announcements In some jurisdictions it is common for tax policy initiatives to be announced with legislative proposals following, sometimes years later. The eventual legislation can then be backdated to the date of announcement. As a result tax advisors are required to advise clients on the basis of Ministerial press statements. Obviously such statements are not written by legislative drafters and are aimed at the general rather than a technical audience. It must therefore be a daunting task to proffer technical advice on complex transactions on the basis of law conveyed through press statements. New Zealand has not adopted this approach to tax policy. Under the generic tax policy process most policy measures advance through an extensive consultation phase before final Ministerial decisions are made. Further consultation on the form of the legislation is carried out through the parliamentary select committee process. Inevitably there are times when a more rapid response is required than the normal generic tax policy process allows. For example, an avoidance opportunity is identified that cannot be the subject of consultation without alerting everyone to the opportunity and exposing the tax base to unacceptable risk. In such cases the normal response is to announce a proposed response quickly, followed by legislative details that are effective from date of announcement (with any appropriate grandparenting provisions). An example as the petroleum mining measures mentioned in section 3 above. There have been two recent variations from this approach. The first of these was the statement by the Minister of Finance and Revenue, Hon Dr Michael Cullen, of 26 May 2003, that the law would be amended so that masthead transactions as contemplated by Fairfax would not have the beneficial tax effects they have under existing law. The second was the Minister’s statement, of 6 August 2003, that the law 16 will be amended to ensure that tax is levied on New Zealanders investing in Australian unit trusts in a manner that might allow them to derive, in effect, tax-free New Zealand sourced income. These instances should not be seen as a fundamental change in the way New Zealand tax policy is developed. They are in fact a product of the government’s adherence to that process. In both cases the government faced a significant and growing, widely publicised degradation of the tax base by transactions that were clearly contrary to policy intent. In dealing with this situation in a responsible way the government faced the options of: - an announcement followed by consultation leading to legislation, or - early legislation without the opportunity for consultation, or - consultations followed by retrospective legislation. Any other options exposed the tax base to an unacceptable risk. The government chose the first of these options. In the future officials are likely to advise a similar course of action in similar circumstances. It is not expected, however, that this will result in a general move to legislation by press statement. The responses in these cases were specific to their circumstances. 6. The tax advisor as soothsayer The life of a tax advisor would be easier if tax law never changed. Given the need for tax law to be adapted to changes in the economy and practice, that is not the case and is never likely to be. Moreover, for the reasons outlined above, an advisor cannot assume that all tax laws will be effective only from after date of enactment. Even if law changes have a post-enactment effect they can still impact on prior transactions. Managing change and risks is an inherent part of operating any business. Along with changes in markets, prices, foreign exchange, regulations and so on, business do have to consider and manager the risk of tax law changes. It thus seems to be a key role of the professional tax advisor to assist business in this area. 17 The first issue that needs to be considered is whether aspects of the law affecting a client are likely to change. Overall, New Zealand has a very open tax policy process. Part of that is having a publicised and transparent work programme. The consultative process should ensure that the rationale for and direction of policy changes are known and understood. This gives a good basis for anticipating tax policy change. Not all tax policy changes can be clearly signalled in advance. For some measures early signalling would defeat their objective of maintaining the tax base. An astute advisor should nevertheless be able to gauge the potential for legislative change by considering the extent to which a particular opportunity provided by current legislation is clearly contrary to the policy intent and the extent of the fiscal risk it poses. The fiscal risk is measured not just by the one transaction but by the ability of the transaction to be replicated in other cases. Hence the extent to which the opportunity is widely known is relevant. The point here is that the tax policy work programme is full. New issues will be accorded high priority according to the extent to which measure support overall government policy (such as the growth and innovation framework) and the extent to which the measures are fiscally important. Any opportunity an advisor sees that is clearly contrary to policy intent and that has potential fiscal implications of more than, say, $50 million per annum is likely to be considered a very high priority by officials. Of course officials can only recommend remedial legislation when they themselves know of opportunities. Over the last half dozen years we have added considerably to our ability to gather information from other areas of Inland Revenue and from other sources. For example, you can assume that any ruling application has been carefully considered for policy implications. As a rule it seems reasonable to assume that what is generally known in the professional community is also known to tax policy advisors. If you consider that a law change is possible, the next issue is whether that change would be retrospective, grandparented and/or subject to a carve-out. 18 As a general rule the government will propose prospective legislation. Such legislation can, however, still affect existing transactions especially if there are no grandparenting provisions. Such provisions are normally proposed for short-term transactions where the distinction between an unaffected completed transaction and a transaction in the process of completion lacks substance. As experience has demonstrated, governments cannot rigidly maintain a rule of prospective legislation only without producing results that undermine the objectives of fairness and economic efficiency. Legislation that has pre-enactment effect has been , and will undoubtedly remain, part of our process. First, there is the case where quick action is required but consultation is desirable. In such a case the law will often be effective from date of announcement. Beyond that, officials will recommend legislation with pre-enactment effect, when this seems to be the best way to maintain the rational and legitimate expectations of the operation of the law. That is so whether the retrospective legislation is taxpayer friendly or unfriendly. A carve-out from retrospectivity can be justified where this best targets the rational and legitimate expectations of a sector of taxpayers. Finally, when considering grandparenting, retrospectivity or carve-outs, officials will be more inclined to recommend more generous treatment for taxpayers the less the change corrects something that is clearly contrary to policy intent. 19 ANNEX A Officials’ letter to FEC 31 July 2001 The Chair Finance and Expenditure Committee Parliament House WELLINGTON Taxation (Annual Rates, Taxpayer Assessment and Miscellaneous Matters) Bill – retrospectivity 1. At the Committee’s meeting on 25 July, official advisors were requested to produce an outline of our views on retrospectivity for discussion at the Committee’s meeting on 1 August. This is set out below. In short our views are that retrospective legislation is legally valid. However, retrospective legislation can undermine the rule of law and in doing so (especially in tax and commercial matters) can incur significant economic costs by undermining private property rights and thus creating investment uncertainty. Given these concerns it might be tempting to adopt a simplistic rule such as all retrospective legislation is repugnant. However, it can be shown that adopting such a rule can lead to inequities and the mischiefs such a rule aims to prevent. We agree that Parliament should only enact retrospective legislation with care and caution but as in many areas of public policy retrospective legislation can be justified where the benefits outweigh the costs. Parliament needs to consider whether the benefits of the proposed retrospective legislation outweigh the costs in this case. 2. This note first outlines what is being proposed in terms of retrospectivity. It then summarises what seem to be the key arguments of the Chen, Palmer and Partners’ opinion (attached to the Ernst Young submission) and considers those arguments in the context of the proposed legislation. 20 What is proposed 3. Since May 1999 the legislation has been clear that GST is levied on supplies to non-residents where the benefit of that supply will be enjoyed in New Zealand. Examples are supplies to a non-resident parent of education for a New Zealand student and supplies to a non-resident tourist operator for hotel and other services to a tourist in New Zealand. Background papers released to the Committee make it clear that this was always the policy intent of GST since its introduction in 1986. Evidence to the Committee suggests that this was generally accepted to be the position by tax advisors and the private sector with respect to foreign students and tourists. That is why GST was paid in those cases in most instances. However, in 1995 the Court of Appeal reached a decision on advertising expenditure and this was interpreted as creating doubt as to whether foreign students and tourists supplies were liable to GST. Refund applications for foreign tourist supplies were first known to be received by Inland Revenue in 1998 and for tourists in late 1999. 4. The proposed legislation applies the legislative amendment made in 1999 back to 1986 when GST was introduced for taxpayers seeking to change a position in an earlier return. This retrospective legislative change would not apply to those who have received refunds or those who may have previously not paid GST (zero-rated) on their supplies. Such taxpayers will be subject to the law as it already stands. Inland Revenue’s view of the law as applied to specific arrangements entered into by taxpayers is that this would mean that refunds paid on student fees would still be valid but that tourist operators who have received refunds or who have zero-rated supplies will still be required to pay GST. The latter issue may result in litigation whether or not the proposed legislation is enacted. The Chen, Palmer and Partners’ Opinion 5. The opinion defines retrospective legislation as “legislation which changes the law relating to a situation backwards in time from the time the legislation is enacted 21 by Parliament’ (para 1). It agrees that such legislation is lawful (para 5) but argues that it is “repugnant to the rule of law” (para 51) that requires “certainty, generality and equality”. Certainty means that the law should be “prospective, open and clear” (para 16) while generality and equality mean that the law should treat like people alike. The argument here may be summarised as contrasting two forms of state. Under the rule of law people cannot have their property or liberty challenged otherwise than in accordance with known rules. The alternative is arbitrary and capricious administration under which neither liberty nor property is secure. In New Zealand the rule of law is a fundamental aspect of our constitution. We would add that it underpins not only our constitution but also our economic structure since the certainty of property rights created by the rule of law is essential for investment and economic activity. 6. This leads Chen and Palmer to the conclusion that retrospective legislation is “seldom justified” – para 5 and 19. The use of the term “seldom justified” suggests that Chen and Palmer agree that retrospective legislation is sometimes justified although they do not expand on the circumstances where this might be the case. 7. Officials agree with the constitutional and economic importance of maintaining the rule of law as outlined by Chen and Palmer. We also agree that retrospective legislation can undermine this and thus requires careful consideration and justification. However, it is clear that retrospective legislation can be justified in some circumstances. The issue is whether this is such a case. What is retrospectivity and is it ever justified? 8. The need to examine proposed retrospective legislation according to its effects rather than condemn all legislation that can be labeled as retrospective is demonstrated by the jurisprudential debate as to what is meant by retrospective legislation. The literature points out considerable difficulties with the Chen and Palmer definition that turns on whether the legislation operates before enacted. It has been pointed out that in a sense no legislation is backward looking in this way in that all legislation operates prospectively. It will be applied by a court (or a punishment 22 given) at a future date, not a past date. On the other hand, if retrospective legislation is seen as legislation that affects or varies any extant right or obligation, then most legislation will be retrospective in that the variation of rights and obligations is what legislation is about. This leads to the view that the rule of law requires clear and unambiguous laws, that are known to everyone, that are uniformly applied and that never change. While this may be a rule of law ideal, it is clearly impractical and profoundly undemocratic. For one thing it requires that no new laws ever be enacted. Interestingly, this is the view of G de Q Walker who is quoted with approval by Chen and Palmer. 9. Even a less strict form of the definition of retrospective legislation has difficulties. For example, any law that affects a prior action of a person may be said to be retrospective. Retrospective legislation is then seen as legislation that alters the future legal consequences of past events. However, this would mean that tax rates could never change (up or down) because people are likely to have made decisions (such as how much education to invest in) based on existing tax rates. People are also likely to have entered transactions giving rise to future profits based on extant tax law and rates. It would under this definition be retrospective to ever change those. 10. A third definition of retrospectivity that attempts to avoid the above problems is that retrospective legislation is legislation that defeats the rational and legitimate expectations of those to whom the law applies. The analysis is that under the rule of law people should be able to rely upon the law (and not official whim) to guide them in their actions. The problem with such a definition is that it is not clear-cut. It relies upon a judgement as to what is a rational and legitimate expectation. It is difficult to argue that an expectation that tax rates will never alter falls into this category, although some people may base decisions on such an expectation. There is debate as to whether retrospective anti-avoidance law falls into this area. It is argued that changes to bring anti-avoidance activity into the tax net can guide people not to push the boundaries of tax law too far and that there should be no legitimate expectation that such activity should be protected. 11. While the last definition does suffer from this defect it does force the analysis to turn away from labels to the key issue which is whether what is being proposed is 23 good or bad policy. Officials agree that for constitutional and economic reasons the rational and legitimate expectations of people should not be overturned by new legislation lightly. However, there are cases where that can be justified in policy terms by wider benefits. 12. In this bill submitters have argued in favour of legislation retrospectively allowing corporate interest deductions and transfers of tax credits. It is argued that this is favourable to taxpayers and therefore an appropriate retrospective change. However, to the extent to which such a change would be of practical effect by way of relieving a tax liability that would otherwise exist, it would be favourable to the taxpayers receiving such a benefit but unfavourable to all other taxpayers who would have to make up any shortfall in tax revenue. Application to the Bill 13. In our view all legislation that can be seen as having retrospective effect should be enacted only with caution. Not overturning the rational and legitimate expectations of those who have entered transactions at the time the transactions were entered into seems a useful guide. The principles were set out in one of our previous reports to the Committee that read as follows: “In general, retrospective tax legislation is and should be avoided. Retrospective changes to tax rules undermine perceptions of fairness of the tax system, and thus voluntary compliance, and have economic costs in that the effect of investment and other decisions become more uncertain. Nevertheless, it is recognised by the Legislative Advisory Council and others that in the tax area, as in other areas, these considerations need to be balanced against other policy concerns on a case by case basis. In some cases it can be fairer and add certainty for legislation to be retrospective. The classic example is the correction of an incorrect cross-reference. “Considering concerns in this balanced way can sometimes lead to the conclusion that significant changes to the law should be retrospective. For 24 example correcting major base maintenance concerns is often achieved by making remedial legislation effective from the date of announcement, which is generally the date of introduction of the bill. In such cases the reasoning is that people are given notice of the change and, therefore, should not rely on the law that it is proposed to change. “On more rare occasions greater retrospectivity seems justified. This is where the policy intent of the legislation is seen as being clear but the legislation does not achieve it, and the result is a significant hole in the tax base or a significant unintended tax impost on taxpayers. A recent example was the retrospective repeal of duty on credit card transactions enacted as part of the Taxation (Remedial Provisions) Act 1998 (No 7). The rationale is that there is in such cases greater unfairness and uncertainty in not changing the law retrospectively than in doing so prospectively. When legislation has an adverse effect on taxpayers, the general practice has been to protect those who have relied on the law that is being retrospectively changed. The change in law is not applied to those who have demonstrated that they have relied on the old law by taking some action such as filing a return on that basis.” 14. In most cases schools and tourist operators when they entered into supply transactions expected GST to be payable. This is clear from the Ernst Young submission. GST was paid and returns filed on that basis. The best evidence that people entered into transactions on the basis that no GST would be charged on supplies is that they filed GST returns on such a basis. In terms of the PricewaterhouseCoopers submission these are those that “acted bona fide on the basis that the supply was zero-rated”. The proposal is to not change the law in those cases. Those who have zero-rated their supplies will be able to rely upon unchanged law in any dispute with IRD. In addition, any taxpayer that has already received a refund (whether or not IRD considers that they remain entitled to it) will be able to continue to rely on existing law. 15. The proposal thus seeks to protect from legislative change those that can be said to have a rational and legitimate expectation as to the law while still protecting 25 the revenue base from a potential cost of $150 million to $200 million of lost revenue should the proposal not proceed.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Govt to consult on tax regime for fruit trees & vines

The government will consult widely with the fruit growing industry over a proposal to make the tax treatment of replacement plantings of fruit trees and vines more flexible, Revenue Minister Michael Cullen said today.

"The government proposes to introduce legislation to allow a limited proportion of replacement planting to be tax deductible in a current income year," Dr Cullen said. "At present, a current year deduction is possible only for a tree or vine of the same species and variety that has died or been destroyed.

"Under the new system, some replacement planting expenditure would be treated as repairs and maintenance. On average, expenditure in relation to 5 per cent of the area of an orchard would be deductible in a single income year, and growers could replace plants when they wanted to, using different varieties if they wished.

"This would give more flexibility in the tax treatment of replanting activities and encourage the planting of the most commercially desirable varieties.

"The government has already had discussions with the Fruitgrowers Federation and wants to extend the consultation over the next few weeks to include other industry bodies," Dr Cullen said.

SPEECH NOTES

### Address to Pipfruit Industry Conference

**Mission Estate, Napier**

According to the Chinese astrological calendar, we have just entered the Year of the Monkey. As one would expect, the monkey symbolizes a zest for life, abundant energy, a quick intelligence and a capricious temper. Those born in the Year of the Monkey are said to be productive, methodical, caring and vivacious. But they can also be restless, calculating, strong-minded, and at the lowest end of the scale, troublemakers and tricksters.

While I can assure you that Chinese astrology is not one of the tools used by the Treasury to forecast the economic trends for the year ahead, several aspects of the monkey character seem apposite to New Zealand exporters, both in terms of the conditions they are likely to face and the attitude needed to thrive.

As for the New Zealand pipfruit industry itself, I am sure you can all think of ways in which the current situation calls for energy, intelligence and strong-mindedness.

Looking first at the external situation, the outlook is for growth in export volumes, but downwards pressure on prices. As last year MAF's "Situation and Outlook for New Zealand's Agriculture and Forestry" noted, apple export volumes for 2003/04 are forecast to increase 7 percent to 19.2 million cartons, due to a combination of favourable weather conditions and relaxed grade standards. Barring adverse weather conditions, this figure is forecast to increase further to 19.3 million cartons and 19.6 million cartons in the ensuring two years.

This positive growth makes it all the more important that we make progress in market access for New Zealand apples. We have been trying to export our apples to Australia for eighty years, but this trade has been blocked on the grounds that New Zealand apples may be a vector of fire blight. The Government was therefore delighted with the strong decision out of the World Trade Organisation last year that apples in commercial trade are not a vector of fire blight.

The rulings were made in the context of a complaint by the United States against measures imposed by Japan, but given our substantial interest in the issue of principle, New Zealand participated as a Third Party, asserting that Japan's controls on apples were unjustified by science and in violation of the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures. In light of these recent WTO rulings New Zealand looks forward to working with both Japan and Australia to ensure that early progress is made on improved access for our apples.

Progress on this front would be welcome, but we cannot forget the large picture. Forecast growth in exports worldwide is expected to depress prices for all apple varieties, while competitors on premium varieties continue to catch up with New Zealand producers on quality and marketing.

Further complicating the story is the high exchange rate, to which I will return in a moment.

These external factors are matched by the ongoing process within the pipfruit industry of adjustment to a deregulated environment. As expected, the initial period after the abolition of the 'single-desk' approach to exporting pipfruit saw a proliferation of new export companies springing up alongside ENZA, who continue to have a large share of the market.

This process was undoubtedly aided by high export returns during the first season after the deregulation which took effect in October 2001, and the perception is that this incoming tide has, as it were, nurtured more export companies than can be expected to survive over the long term. It may well be that the next couple of years sees some winnowing out of those companies who do not have a secure future.

It seems likely then that the long term shape of the pipfruit industry will not emerge for several more years. Of particular concern — and this is something which I hope will be debated both formally and informally at this Conference — is the question of the industry wide roles that used to be played by ENZA prior to October 2001, the full range and magnitude of which is only now becoming apparent.

This is where Pipfruit Growers of New Zealand has a vital role to play. To remain competitive, growers need a reliable supply of technical, economic and marketing information, and need a forum for organising industry-good functions and for representing their collective interests. Activities such as crop estimation and price forecasting were once carried out by ENZA as a matter of course; but they now require new mechanisms for cooperation within the industry, based on voluntary compliance instead of the mandate of law.

So the industry faces challenges that are both external and internal, and I trust that the developing role of Pipfruit Growers of New Zealand will move some way towards meeting them.

I would like to focus my remarks today on three issues relevant to the pipfruit industry in which the government has a role:

*   Firstly, the foreign exchange trends, where government's role is severely constrained, although not the extent some would have us believe;
*   Secondly, government investment in science, where we are seeking to develop partnerships with industries; and
*   Thirdly, the management of compliance costs and taxation, where the government is seeking to balance the interests of business and those of the community at large.

First, the exchange rate. Clearly the high dollar has an impact in the short term on the revenue that New Zealand exporters earn.

Media commentaries have tended to focus on the substantial appreciation of the Kiwi against the US dollar, some 25 percent during 2003. What receives less attention is the fact that the New Zealand dollar has actually depreciated against the Australian dollar and appreciated more modestly against currencies such as the British pound and the euro.

Nevertheless, the trade-weighted exchange rate has appreciated by 13.5 percent since the start of 2003 and is currently around 44.4 percent higher than its 2000 low. Overall the TWI is currently around 12.9 percent higher than its post-float average.

The two key factors driving this appreciation are the generalised weakness in the US dollar and the out-performance of the New Zealand economy in world terms. Although exchange rates are notoriously difficult to forecast, there are few signs of these fundamental drivers reversing in the near term.

Much as I might wish otherwise, there is nothing I can do to alter international perceptions around the US economy and fiscal position. And, on the other hand, the recent strength of the New Zealand economy is something to be celebrated, especially as it has been achieved without significant inflation, has been accompanied by rates of employment that have not been seen since the early 1980s, and by increases in household incomes and wealth.

So the means by which a government of a trading nation can influence the value of its currency are limited and carry with them significant risks. I should make the point, however, that the stance advocated by Dr Brash — a stance which renounces in advance any possibility of intervention under any circumstances — is also a risky one, although one in which a government can always wash its hands of the outcome, claiming that it was the inexorable will of the markets.

Pragmatism suggests a careful balancing of options and risks, rather than a slavish commitment to some orthodoxy. Governments need to be seen to be alert and responsible, rather than sleepily dogmatic.

What I would urge New Zealand's exporters to do, however, is to maintain a focus on the broader set of forces which impact upon our international competitiveness, of which the exchange rate is only one, albeit one that can behave in a very volatile manner over the short term.

My next two issues &mdsash; science and the management of compliance costs — are things which have a long term impact upon productivity and competitiveness, beyond the temporary (albeit potentially harmful) effects of fluctuations in the exchange rate.

In the area of scientific research, the Government is working increasing closely with industry in support of the goal of lifting New Zealand's overall productivity. Our Growth and Innovation Framework has highlighted the importance of innovation to lifting our growth, including the contribution to innovation from our scientists.

This commitment has gone beyond mere words. Over the past four years ongoing annual funding has risen by around $120 million.

We have aimed not only to increase support for science but also to ensure that is relevant to industry needs and that where new ideas are generated the means is available to support their development.

The "Research for Industry" Output Class, managed by the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology, continues to contribute significantly to our core export industries.

For example, New Zealand's $420 million of apple exports and $618 million of kiwifruit exports are supported by approximately $12 million of RFI funding, undertaken mainly in CRIs, and about $3 million of industry research funding per year.

This on-going stream of research funding has provided such successes as the Jazz apple and Zespri Gold kiwifruit.

However, research in vacuum, or remote from the realities of the market, is not good enough. Research contributes best to industry where there are good linkages between researchers and users. There needs to be rapid transfer of learning in both directions, and a capacity for firms and users to take up and apply the science.

That is why we have put a lot of effort into improving the connection between the research sector and industry over the past four years.

Research Consortia is one example. These are jointly funded research projects in a range of scientific areas. Research providers, end-users and the government jointly decide the direction of research. The resulting stronger linkages between research providers and end-users are designed to:

1.  address concerns that new knowledge is not passing fast enough from researchers' heads to entrepreneurs' heads; and
2.  ensure that research agendas have a sufficiently commercial focus by developing them through collaboration between providers and users.

Technology New Zealand is a key tool for the government to support innovative projects that are industry developed and led. The key aspects of this programme include:

*   Technology for Business Growth - supporting firms' R&D projects by providing 50 per cent of funding for projects that meet the criteria for the fund. During 2002/03 a total value of $50.8 million of grants were approved, compared with grants valued at $39.7 million in 2001/02.
*   Grants for Private Sector Research and Development, which also assist businesses in funding research projects but are aimed at an earlier stage than the Technology for Business Growth programme. The value of these grants was $14.8 million in 2002/03.
*   Technology Industry Fellowships: These support the placement of researchers or technologists in firms to build understanding of technological innovation in firms and researchers appreciation of commercial R&D environment.
*   Finally, Techink is aimed at stimulating awareness of new technology by providing technological guidance and planning.

It has also been important to foster links between science and industry at a regional level, rather than through national bodies. After all, research into how innovation occurs shows that localised business clusters are the best crucible for both making and adopting technological innovations.

The government's Regional Partnerships programme supports a number of major regional initiatives that have a strong focus on fostering links between science and industry. For example:

*   Food Hawke's Bay is developing food industry clusters and a Centre of Innovation based at Eastern Institute of Technology (EIT). The focus is on the transfer of production capacity from existing companies to local small to medium businesses, adding value and growing export volumes in the food industry throughout the region, stimulating new product development and improving food industry training and education.
*   The Wine Research Centre of Excellence in Blenheim is an initiative of the Marlborough Economic Development Trust and the Marlborough District Council. The Centre will open up more opportunities to pursue graduate studies and post-graduate research. The knowledge gained will go back into the region's wine industry.

This is a start, but we know we can do more. We need to encourage more industry-led or industry-influenced research. Our RS&T policies need to reflect 'market pull', as well as 'science push'. Again that is a challenge to be met by both government and industry working together.

I want to say a few words about the related issues of compliance costs, regulation and taxation. Understandably, any discussion of these is guaranteed to cast a pall of gloom over any gathering of New Zealand businesspeople. That is inevitable; and it is inevitable also that governments do not always see eye to eye with business on these matters. Government is, of course, responsible for maintaining order and promoting the public good; and in the course of doing this the rights and freedoms of individuals and businesses need to be balanced against one another, and revenues need to be raised to fund essential public services from which we all benefit, whether we realise it or not.

There are two points I want to stress, however. The first is that New Zealand businesses are in fact well-served in comparison to their competitors in many other countries. International studies show that the burden of government weighs lighter upon New Zealand businesses.

The burden of regulation and compliance costs on business in New Zealand is light relative to other developed countries. In its 2003 Economic Survey, the OECD commented that "in New Zealand, government regulation is generally of good quality, and compliance costs are not high by international standards. Nevertheless, compliance costs have been for some time a source of concern for small businesses, for which they represent a proportionately much larger burden than for larger firms."

The 2003 Index of Economic Freedom, published by the Heritage Foundation and the Wall St Journal, noted that "it is easy to establish a business in New Zealand", and described the regulatory regime as "relatively light" and "transparent".

The second point is that this government, far from being insensitive to the needs of business, has worked hard to reduce that burden further in the context of building stronger communities and a more resilient, more globally competitive economy.

Improvement of the regulatory framework for business remains a key focus for this government. An analysis of the compliance costs of meeting regulatory requirements is one of the important costs factored into government decisions about whether to regulate or whether to alter regulation.

Government departments are required to prepare Regulatory Impact Statements (RIS) and Business Compliance Cost Statements (BCCS) where advice supporting regulatory change will have compliance cost implications for business. Even when regulation is seen as the best available option, the government still seeks to ensure compliance costs are minimised.

In addition, we have undertaken several initiatives focused specifically on reducing compliance costs for business. These include:

_The Ministerial Panel on Business Compliance Costs Review_ — A report-back to the government in June 2003 confirmed implementation of many of the wide-ranging 162 recommendations submitted by the Panel.

_The Tax Simplification Programme_ — the government's ongoing programme to make tax compliance easier for SMEs. A discussion document released in September suggested initiatives including subsidising the costs of using a payroll agent. Officials are further developing these proposals in light of submissions received and it is intended that final proposals will be included in tax legislation later this year.

_Business Law Reform Bill_ — an omnibus Bill that makes amendments to a wide range of commercial law statutes with a focus on compliance cost reduction.

_The Electronic Transactions Act_ — By providing improved and clarified legal status for electronic information, this will reduce compliance and transaction costs for business.

Other initiatives are aimed at increasing the efficiency of regulatory systems. These include:

*   The development by the Department of Labour of best practice employment information, directed at the needs of SMEs;
*   The introduction of a training and accreditation scheme for councillors and commissioners involved in Resource Management Act decision-making;
*   Increasing funding for the Environment Court, so as to substantially reduce the time take to hear appeals;
*   A web-based one-stop-shop for business, to be launched later this month, containing all relevant government information and services.

The Immigration Service is also working to streamline the procedures for granting work permits for those on visitors visas. This issue has emerged in recent years around harvest time, where pipfruit growers have sought permission to employ workers who, for whatever reason, did not enter the country under the working holiday scheme, or other provisions allowing them to undertake temporary work. Clearly we cannot simply dispense with the requirements of our immigration law, particularly in the current international climate. However, we can undertake to provide a faster turnaround of applications, so as to assist growers find the workers they need at a particularly pressured time.

On the tax front, through its Industry Partnership activities in the horticultural sector, Inland Revenue is holding discussions with groups representing subcontract workers to look at ways of dealing with the non-compliance with tax laws that has been highlighted in recent court cases. The government appreciates your industry's willingness to cooperate with this initiative.

Finally, still in the area of taxation, some of you will be aware that the government has recently approved a proposal to allow a limited proportion of replacement plantings to be deducted in a tax year. The current law limits the extent to which expenditure on replacement trees can be deducted as current year expenditure. Discussions with the Fruitgrowers Federation led to agreement on an upper limit based on replacement planting expenditure in respect of 5 percent of the area of an orchard, in effect treating that expenditure as repairs and maintenance. This will provide more flexibility in the tax treatment of replanting activities, and should ensure the most commercially desirable varieties are planted.

I trust that what these examples show is that my government is not content to rest on the laurels that international commentators have bestowed upon us in terms of low comparable compliance costs and regulatory burdens. Doing business in this country is simpler than most other developed countries in the world; but given our disadvantages of geographical isolation and a small domestic market that makes good sense.

There are those who call for grand gestures — reductions in the marginal tax rate, privatisation of ACC, slashing of health expenditure and social welfare, and so on. The evidence suggests that these options are much less effective than the promises that are made for them. And what is worse they run the risk of undermining the well-being of communities and tearing the social fabric from which businesses draw their workforce and, in many cases, seek their customers.

We believe that healthy communities making for healthier businesses, and vice versa. We cannot afford, in the words of an ancient Chinese proverb, to 'take bricks from the West wall to fix a hole in the East wall'.

As with most of our export industries, growth in the pipfruit industry is driven by small advances — in productivity, in technology, and in market access. The government is committed to assisting those advances through a stable economic platform, a broadly based approach to science, and commitment to keeping the costs of doing business in this country to the minimum required to maintain a healthy society.

Thank you.

Cullen and Costello on trans-Tasman co-operation
================================================

The Australian and New Zealand governments have agreed to further co-operation on banking and competition regulation, establish a Trans-Tasman Accounting Standards Advisory Group, and jointly negotiate tax information exchange agreements with third countries when practicable. For more information on issues covered in discussions today in Melbourne between NZ Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Australian Treasurer Peter Costello, see their joint [media statement](/news/2004/2004-01-30-cullen-and-costello-trans-tasman-co-operation#statement)

New Zealand Minister for Finance

JOINT MEDIA STATEMENT

### Ministers enhance the Trans-Tasman business environment

An agreement to progress cooperation on banking and competition regulation and the establishment of a Trans-Tasman Accounting Standards Advisory Group were among the many issues discussed today by Treasurer Peter Costello and New Zealand Finance Minister Michael Cullen during their annual bilateral meeting.

Today's discussions made significant progress toward trans-Tasman business integration with the aim of building on the CER (Closer Economic Relations) agreement towards a single economic market based on common regulatory frameworks.

"We have agreed on the importance of working closely together in the development of our competition regimes as a means of improving the conditions for business on both sides of the Tasman. Already, our policy and enforcement agencies are working together to improve cooperation and coordination within our regimes in a number of key respects (eg improved information sharing and exploration of the potential for cross appointments between competition authorities)."

"We have also agreed to conduct research to explore ways of improving the integration of our competition regimes. Issues that may be considered include improved co ordination of authorisation processes, joint decision making on trans-Tasman issues by competition authorities and co-ordinated/combined institutional frameworks. We will shortly finalise terms of reference."

Mr Costello and Dr Cullen announced a plan to reduce transaction costs for businesses through the development of common trans-Tasman accounting standards.

A Trans-Tasman Accounting Standards Advisory Group was announced to advise the respective Governments and accounting standard setters on ways to reduce costs and improve efficiency by aiming for a single set of standards.

"As well as its work towards developing common standards, the Group will foster co-operation in relation to the broader debate on the development of international standards. In doing so, it will seek to promote links with other accounting standard setters in the region."

The group was foreshadowed at the CER Ministerial Forum last August and includes representatives from Australian and New Zealand standard setters, and Australia's Financial Reporting Council.

Following ANZ's acquisition of the National Bank of New Zealand, Australian banks now occupy over 80 per cent of the New Zealand banking market, and Australia's four major banks are also New Zealand's four major banks.

"In the light of these developments, we agreed that closer integration of the two markets is welcome, subject to the need to maintain the safety and stability of both financial systems. We have agreed to work to mutual recognition and harmonisation in prudential regulation," the Ministers said.

Mr Costello and Dr Cullen have agreed that Australia and New Zealand will jointly negotiate tax information exchange agreements wherever practicable. Joint negotiation of these agreements reflects our two countries' common interests in the principles of transparency and effective exchange of information, which underlie the OECD's Harmful Tax Practices Initiative and work on Bank Secrecy.

These agreements will facilitate the exchange of tax information between countries, enabling Australia and New Zealand to obtain tax information which will help protect the integrity of our tax systems, protect businesses from unfair competition and contribute to efforts to counter drug trafficking, money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Australia and New Zealand intend to negotiate a network of such agreements including in the Pacific region.

Mr Costello and Dr Cullen, also announced the commencement of information exchange negotiations with the Caribbean state of Antigua and Barbuda. These are the first information exchange negotiations for both Australia and New Zealand.

Mr Costello and Dr Cullen discussed the success of joint efforts in the region, most notably the substantial progress made by the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI).

Under the leadership of Australia and supported strongly by New Zealand and many other Pacific Island Countries, RAMSI is restoring law, order and good economic management to the Solomon Islands.

Mr Costello and Dr Cullen discussed their mutual concern at the current lack of progress in multilateral trade talks.

"Progress in multilateral trade negotiations is vital if the gains from trade are to be shared by all, in particular, those from the world's poorest countries." Ministers said. "For Australia and New Zealand, the multilateral trading system is the bedrock for our participation in the global economy. Supporting and advancing this system is amongst our highest economic priorities. Australia and New Zealand stand ready to work toward a successful round."

If we imagine the taxation and spending policies of government as a large (some might say vast) algorithm, the objective is to reduce the number of variables and simplify the relationships between them so as to provide sufficient certainty for businesses and individuals and those who advise them to plan for the future with the minimum quantum of policy-related risk. While that may seem like a tall order, it is something I believe we have achieved in large part. The major uncertainties on the horizon relate to the New Zealand economy, and in turn the global economy. As a government, we have set and maintained a clear fiscal approach. And we are engaged in a programme of tax policy work which we are happy to signal in advance, so that those likely to be affected can be informed and involved. I want to address each of these in turn. The Government's long-term fiscal objectives and short-term fiscal intentions are clearly set out in the 2004 budget policy statement. The general fiscal approach is to run operating surpluses on average across the cycle sufficient to meet NZ Superannuation Fund contributions, while meeting capital pressures and priorities, and managing debt at prudent levels. In terms of core Crown revenue and expenses, that will require: Maintaining tax-to-GDP around current levels; Core Crown expenses (plus the net payment to the NZS Fund) averaging around 35 percent of GDP over the forty year horizon used to calculate NZS Fund contributions; Maintaining a robust, broad-based tax system that raises revenue in a fair and efficient way; and State Owned Enterprises and Crown entities contributing to surpluses, consistent with their enabling legislation and Government policy. Over time this approach will increase the Crown�s net worth consistent with the operating balance objective. There will be a focus on quality investment in assets needed to support government functions. Within this framework, we have determined as a priority for the next Budget a family assistance package aimed at increasing the incomes of low to middle income New Zealanders and assisting the transition from welfare to employment. Alongside our investment in education and health care, this package will support our aim of an inclusive economy based on a skilled workforce. These expenditure plans take account of the outlook for the New Zealand economy. As we know, New Zealand has been bucking the global trend in the last three years: Our GDP growth rate was 3.9 percent over the year ended September, which was considerably faster than in the United States, the UK, Europe, Japan or Australia. Steady economic growth has brought jobs. The unemployment rate has fallen from a peak of 7.7 percent in 1998 to 4.6 percent in December 2003, in spite of rapid working-age population growth. Government debt, at 28 percent of GDP, is the lowest it has been since the mid 1970s. Short-term interest rates are low compared to the historical average, although higher than global rates. The Reserve Bank has not reduced interest rates by as much as central banks in other countries because of the strong domestic demand growth New Zealand has experienced. Most recently, the Reserve Bank actually increased the official short-term interest rate by 25 points, to ensure that the inflation rate remains stable and low over the medium term. The concern, however, is the imbalance between the domestic and external economies. Consumer and business spending, and investment in housing in particular, have grown strongly and are expected to remain strong in the short term. But while export volumes have increased steadily over the last year, and export incomes remain high compared to the historical average, the rising exchange rate and falling international prices for some commodities led to a reduction in nominal export earnings by 6.4 percent over the year to September. The New Zealand dollar has rightly come in for a lot of attention. Standing back and seeing the bigger picture, we should note that it underwent a protracted decline between 1997 and 2000, and therefore a significant appreciation against the currencies of our major trading partners was inevitable given the stronger than average performance of our economy. Even so, as I have said on several occasions recently, I believe the New Zealand dollar is currently over-valued given the strength of the New Zealand economy relative to our major trading partners, especially Australia, and given the rising current account deficit. This is my judgement, based on the facts of the case. Unfortunately, the money markets beg to differ and are valuing the currency accordingly. My major concern is that a continued high dollar may lead to lasting damage to our export sector by discouraging investment in future capacity. We do not want a situation where our ability to take advantage of a global upturn and a lower dollar is impaired. By mid 2004 the impact of declining export incomes should be felt more widely than just the export sector. Currency hedges will have worn off by then, and exporters are likely to cut back their domestic spending. Also a lower number of immigrants is expected to reduce economic growth. It is important to note that the growth rate is not expected to slow much. Growth is forecast to �bottom out� at 2 � percent over the next year or so. By 2005/06, it is predicted to return to an average of 3-3� percent per annum, thanks to a recovering global economy, and some assumed exchange rate depreciation, which will revive export earnings. Along with the slower rate of GDP growth, the rate of job creation will ease. Nevertheless, employment growth will still be above zero, and the unemployment rate is expected to remain in the 4�-5 percent range. What we should see is that our strong �economic fundamentals� and flexible economy allow us to adjust to a changing international environment and fluctuating prices without getting caught in a large economic cycle. To turn to the detail of tax and revenue matters, I am pleased to announce that the government�s tax policy work programme has been updated, and I am releasing it this morning for public information. The tax policy work programme is a fundamental part of the government�s generic tax policy process. Its publication ensures that tax professionals, businesses and other interested taxpayers are informed about what is likely to emerge in tax policy over the coming months. I say �what is likely to emerge� because the work programme cannot be set in stone, of course. Priorities change over time, and new issues emerge that sometime demand attention sooner than others. And, for obvious reasons, measures designed to protect the revenue base cannot always be announced ahead of time. The latest work programme is an update of the one announced in October 2002 and covers the period to December next year. The two main areas of the previous work programme were tax measures to support the government�s Growth and Innovation Framework, and social cohesion. These priorities were supported by some base maintenance and a number of other matters. The updated work programme continues with the two main themes as priorities but gives more emphasis to revenue base maintenance. Extra resources have been allocated in both the policy and operational areas of Inland Revenue for base maintenance. That is because maintaining the tax base, by ensuring that all pay their fair share of tax, is essential to the government�s achieving its broader economic and social objectives. New matters on the work programme include the taxation of venture capital, depreciation issues and increased emphasis on social assistance. As a whole, the work programme includes issues that are important to both the government and to you, the private sector. Tax-related growth and innovation measures are those that will aid good business outcomes. They include reducing the extent to which tax is a barrier to New Zealanders doing business with the rest of the world, and simplifying the tax system. In the international arena, late last year the government published a discussion document setting out proposals aimed at reducing tax barriers to overseas recruitment, designed to benefit New Zealand businesses that recruit overseas. As you may know, the idea is to introduce a temporary exemption from New Zealand income tax on overseas income of people who come here to work as employees, whether they are foreigners or expatriates who have been non-resident for tax purposes for ten years. I had hoped that it would be possible to include the proposal into the first taxation bill of the year, but submissions on the proposal as set out in the discussion document indicated that more policy development is needed � for example, on whether the proposal should be extended beyond employees. For this reason, legislation will be postponed until later in the year. Extending and maintaining New Zealand�s network of double tax agreements with other countries remains a priority. We currently have 27 such agreements, which are designed to reduce tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment. This year will see significant progress. Our double tax agreement with South Africa is close to conclusion: all that remains to be done for the agreement to take effect is for a New Zealand Order in Council to be made, and I expect that to occur within the next few months. At the same time, we will be giving legal effect in New Zealand to our double tax agreements with Chile, our first with a Latin American country, and with the United Arab Emirates, our first with a Middle Eastern jurisdiction. Protocols to agreements with the Netherlands, United Kingdom and Philippines are also expected to be updated in the same group of Orders in Council. We will also begin negotiations this year with Austria, and are exploring the possibility of doing so with one or two other countries. I now turn to the vexed issue of the taxation of offshore portfolio investment. As you will no doubt be aware, my officials released an issues paper at the end of last year outlining two options to reform the tax rules in this area. One was the standard return approach � based broadly on the Tax Review�s risk-free rate of return method. The other was the offshore portfolio investment rules � essentially, a modified version of the current foreign investment fund rules. Under both options, the so-called �grey list� would be removed. It is fair to say that the proposals have generated significant interest and, among some commentators, a little concern. This is not surprising � there are no easy answers in this area. As an experienced politician, I should not have been surprised at some comments made that this is a devious attempt to introduce a capital gains tax or an across-the- board wealth tax. Let me assure you that I have no such agenda. My position is very simple. I cannot see sense in rules that, for example, tax an individual on accrued capital gains on investments in most countries of the world but impose almost no tax on such investments in a few selected countries � and, as a result, expose the tax base to Australian unit trust-type structures. I cannot see any sense in that. Nor can I see sense in rules that penalise investors using savings intermediaries, especially if the funds are actively managed and based in New Zealand rather than offshore. The issues paper raised options to try to bring a little more sense to this area. That is my objective. The options set out in the issues paper are not perfect. On the other hand, current rules seem to me to be far from perfect. If there are better options please raise them. But remember that viable options must continue to raise tax revenue and must not penalise investment in our own country. With your help I think we can have a process to work through these issues. Officials continue to receive submissions on the proposals and will report to me once these have been considered. I hope then to be in a position to make a final decision on the direction for reform. Meanwhile, as signalled in the issues paper, the savings industry is keen to consider whether a version of the risk-free rate of return method could be developed to tax the investments of domestic savings entities. Such an approach is worth exploring because it has the potential to provide improved consistency to the taxation of savings. There are a number of very complex issues that would need to be addressed before this approach could be implemented. I would like to work closely with industry representatives in the coming year to see if these issues can be addressed and an appropriate solution developed. This work has a greater chance of success if the taxation of offshore investment is considered along with domestic investment. This inevitably means that any offshore solution cannot be applied from the 2005-06 year. I am prepared to accept this delay on the basis that an interim solution is enacted to deal with the Australian unit trust issue. I am advised that a significant and growing amount of investment is now flowing into these structures, giving rise to a serious base maintenance concern. If officials can develop an interim solution to plug this leak, the government will be recommending it for enactment as soon as practicable. The use of a risk-free rate of return method to tax the investments of domestic savings entities also provides an opportunity to consider approaches to removing some of the disincentives to invest in retirement savings vehicles such as superannuation funds. By taxing the investor under a risk-free rate of return method, it is possible to tax that income at the marginal tax rate of the investor, thereby removing the current over-taxation or under-taxation of members of superannuation funds. That has appeal but is, of course, dependent on where we get to on the wider issue of the viability of the risk-free rate of return method generally. I am also keen to develop policy options that would increase work-based retirement savings schemes. The Periodic Report Group, in its December report, noted that there was value in promoting greater use of work-based savings schemes as a way for new Zealanders to save for retirement � the reasons being that as such schemes provide deduction at source, economies of scale and an avenue to reach a high proportion of the population. The report group recommended that the government establish a work-based savings group to develop an agreed approach to promote work-based savings. This recommendation has merit and I am in the process of developing terms of reference for a group to be established to look at the design of a work-based savings product. It is my intention to announce the membership of this group and its terms of reference before this year�s budget. The whole issue of saving for retirement � and New Zealand�s lack of it � has been a long-standing concern of mine. Some progress has been made in areas such as the superannuation fund. The Saving New Zealand forum last year provided a platform to move forward. One of the main areas of reform under the growth and innovation banner is the proposal to remove tax barriers to international venture capital. The proposal attempts to increase international venture capital by providing a tax exemption for the venture capital profits that certain non-residents derive from New Zealand. My officials have now consulted on this broad proposal with interested parties from the private sector � including the venture capital industry. As a result of the very useful feedback gained during consultation, the package has been enhanced in a number of areas. One of the more significant of these improvements is widening the scope of �eligible investor� to include certain �foreign funds of funds�. The venture capital changes will be included in the next taxation bill and will apply from 1 April 2004. The government is also undertaking work in relation to capital investment in New Zealand, specifically to identify whether there is a problem with capital adequacy. This work will look at the drivers of New Zealand capital investment and identify specific problem areas and their policy implications. The impact of the tax system, particularly the depreciation rules, on the cost of capital and whether there are any tax policy options to address cost of capital issues will be considered as part of that work. Although this wider work is important in terms of identifying potential obstacles to capital investment, the government is also looking at the tax depreciation rules more generally, to see whether there are further enhancements that can be made. As part of that work, in the near future officials will be releasing an issues paper outlining potential enhancements. The issues paper will also provide an opportunity for further public consultation on a number of concerns about the tax depreciation rules that have been brought to the government�s and officials� attention. The government is also working through the recommendations of the Private Sector Liaison Group on Research and Development. A number of the recommendations have implications for the tax depreciation rules, as they deal with capital expenditure that cannot be depreciated � so called �black hole� expenditure. As a starting point, the government has agreed to allow deductibility for costs associated with patent and resource management consent applications that are not granted or are withdrawn. This change will be included in the next taxation bill. The issue of how to deal with �black hole� expenditure, generally, is more complex and the government hopes that officials and the liaison group can work together to find appropriate solutions. The closing date for submissions on the recent discussion document setting out proposals for streamlining the taxation of fringe benefits is near. There has been a lot of interest in the proposals and � in particular � on those related to car parks, reduced rates for motor vehicles, and raising the de minimis thresholds. Officials are working through the details of submissions received so far. I look forward to discussing the suggestions made in the submissions with officials in the near future. Our aim remains to achieve a workable package that is fairer and easier for businesses to apply. Plans are for two taxation bills to be introduced this year. The early one, planned for late March or early April, would include � for example, the masthead issue, changes arising from the review of tax dispute resolution procedures, and simplification measures, in addition to matters I indicated earlier. The later bill, perhaps in November, could include issues such as changes to fringe benefit tax amendments, reform of legal professional privilege and simplification measures resulting from the discussion document �Making tax easier for small businesses�. The bill bringing into being the new Charities Commission is expected to be introduced into Parliament this month. The commission will oversee the registration of charities that seek tax-exempt status, which will introduce greater accountability and transparency into the process. Finally, the bill that rewrites the first five parts of the Income Tax Act is expected to be passed on 8 April this year, which will be a milestone for the project, which began back in the early 1990s. To turn briefly to the floods that ravaged parts of the lower North Island last month, the government is aware that their economic effect will have to be accounted for � both in the short and medium terms. A very preliminary estimate of the damage across the dairy, sheep, beef, deer, crops and forestry sectors is up to $180 million, a figure that may increase. The response to flood victims across government departments has been significant. Departments have been working together to provide a co-ordinated service that deals with matters ranging from income support, housing and health issues, through to child support and tax�related issues. Operationally, Inland Revenue has been at the front line in places like Bulls and Marton, and doing great work. Inland Revenue�s policy people have been working alongside the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Institute of Chartered Accountants, and they will be advising the government on any areas of the law that may not adequately accommodate the extreme circumstances of the situation. I would like to conclude today by thanking you � the individuals and the organisations you may represent � for your repeated efforts in responding to calls for consultation on proposed tax policy � whether it is a matter of proposals set out in a government discussion document, proposed tax legislation that is before a select committee, or informal requests from policy officials for your views on specific issues. I am aware that this consultation takes a lot of time and resources on your part, as it does on the government�s part. However, your contributions are an essential part of the development of good tax policy and law, and they are valued. I wish you a very successful conference. Thank you. PAGE  PAGE 6   PAGE 6 Hon Dr Michael Cullen Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Finance, Minister of Revenue, Leader of the House  PAGE 1 

Hon Dr Michael Cullen Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Finance, Minister of Revenue, Leader of the House 1 5 March 2004 Speech Notes International Fiscal Association Annual Conference Crowne Plaza, Christchurch One of the central tensions in setting and administering fiscal policy is the need both to create certainty and stability and yet to respond to changing conditions, in particular changing economic conditions. If we imagine the taxation and spending policies of government as a large (some might say vast) algorithm, the objective is to reduce the number of variables and simplify the relationships between them so as to provide sufficient certainty for businesses and individuals and those who advise them to plan for the future with the minimum quantum of policy-related risk. While that may seem like a tall order, it is something I believe we have achieved in large part. The major uncertainties on the horizon relate to the New Zealand economy, and in turn the global economy. As a government, we have set and maintained a clear fiscal approach. And we are engaged in a programme of tax policy work which we are happy to signal in advance, so that those likely to be affected can be informed and involved. I want to address each of these in turn. The Government's long-term fiscal objectives and short-term fiscal intentions are clearly set out in the 2004 budget policy statement. The general fiscal approach is to run operating surpluses on average across the cycle sufficient to meet NZ Superannuation Fund contributions, while meeting capital pressures and priorities, and managing debt at prudent levels. In terms of core Crown revenue and expenses, that will require:  Maintaining tax-to-GDP around current levels;  Core Crown expenses (plus the net payment to the NZS Fund) averaging around 35 percent of GDP over the forty year horizon used to calculate NZS Fund contributions;  Maintaining a robust, broad-based tax system that raises revenue in a fair and efficient way; and  State Owned Enterprises and Crown entities contributing to surpluses, consistent with their enabling legislation and Government policy. 2 2 Over time this approach will increase the Crown’s net worth consistent with the operating balance objective. There will be a focus on quality investment in assets needed to support government functions. Within this framework, we have determined as a priority for the next Budget a family assistance package aimed at increasing the incomes of low to middle income New Zealanders and assisting the transition from welfare to employment. Alongside our investment in education and health care, this package will support our aim of an inclusive economy based on a skilled workforce. These expenditure plans take account of the outlook for the New Zealand economy. As we know, New Zealand has been bucking the global trend in the last three years:  Our GDP growth rate was 3.9 percent over the year ended September, which was considerably faster than in the United States, the UK, Europe, Japan or Australia.  Steady economic growth has brought jobs. The unemployment rate has fallen from a peak of 7.7 percent in 1998 to 4.6 percent in December 2003, in spite of rapid working-age population growth.  Government debt, at 28 percent of GDP, is the lowest it has been since the mid 1970s.  Short-term interest rates are low compared to the historical average, although higher than global rates. The Reserve Bank has not reduced interest rates by as much as central banks in other countries because of the strong domestic demand growth New Zealand has experienced. Most recently, the Reserve Bank actually increased the official short-term interest rate by 25 points, to ensure that the inflation rate remains stable and low over the medium term. The concern, however, is the imbalance between the domestic and external economies. Consumer and business spending, and investment in housing in particular, have grown strongly and are expected to remain strong in the short term. But while export volumes have increased steadily over the last year, and export incomes remain high compared to the historical average, the rising exchange rate and falling international prices for some commodities led to a reduction in nominal export earnings by 6.4 percent over the year to September. The New Zealand dollar has rightly come in for a lot of attention. Standing back and seeing the bigger picture, we should note that it underwent a protracted decline between 1997 and 2000, and therefore a significant appreciation against the currencies of our major trading partners was inevitable given the stronger than average performance of our economy. Even so, as I have said on several occasions recently, I believe the New Zealand dollar is currently over-valued given the strength of the New Zealand economy relative to our major trading partners, especially Australia, and given the 3 3 rising current account deficit. This is my judgement, based on the facts of the case. Unfortunately, the money markets beg to differ and are valuing the currency accordingly. My major concern is that a continued high dollar may lead to lasting damage to our export sector by discouraging investment in future capacity. We do not want a situation where our ability to take advantage of a global upturn and a lower dollar is impaired. By mid 2004 the impact of declining export incomes should be felt more widely than just the export sector. Currency hedges will have worn off by then, and exporters are likely to cut back their domestic spending. Also a lower number of immigrants is expected to reduce economic growth. It is important to note that the growth rate is not expected to slow much. Growth is forecast to “bottom out” at 2 ½ percent over the next year or so. By 2005/06, it is predicted to return to an average of 3-3½ percent per annum, thanks to a recovering global economy, and some assumed exchange rate depreciation, which will revive export earnings. Along with the slower rate of GDP growth, the rate of job creation will ease. Nevertheless, employment growth will still be above zero, and the unemployment rate is expected to remain in the 4½-5 percent range. What we should see is that our strong “economic fundamentals” and flexible economy allow us to adjust to a changing international environment and fluctuating prices without getting caught in a large economic cycle. To turn to the detail of tax and revenue matters, I am pleased to announce that the government’s tax policy work programme has been updated, and I am releasing it this morning for public information. The tax policy work programme is a fundamental part of the government’s generic tax policy process. Its publication ensures that tax professionals, businesses and other interested taxpayers are informed about what is likely to emerge in tax policy over the coming months. I say “what is likely to emerge” because the work programme cannot be set in stone, of course. Priorities change over time, and new issues emerge that sometime demand attention sooner than others. And, for obvious reasons, measures designed to protect the revenue base cannot always be announced ahead of time. The latest work programme is an update of the one announced in October 2002 and covers the period to December next year. The two main areas of the previous work programme were tax measures to support the government’s Growth and Innovation Framework, and social cohesion. These priorities were supported by some base maintenance and a number of other matters. 4 4 The updated work programme continues with the two main themes as priorities but gives more emphasis to revenue base maintenance. Extra resources have been allocated in both the policy and operational areas of Inland Revenue for base maintenance. That is because maintaining the tax base, by ensuring that all pay their fair share of tax, is essential to the government’s achieving its broader economic and social objectives. New matters on the work programme include the taxation of venture capital, depreciation issues and increased emphasis on social assistance. As a whole, the work programme includes issues that are important to both the government and to you, the private sector. Tax-related growth and innovation measures are those that will aid good business outcomes. They include reducing the extent to which tax is a barrier to New Zealanders doing business with the rest of the world, and simplifying the tax system. In the international arena, late last year the government published a discussion document setting out proposals aimed at reducing tax barriers to overseas recruitment, designed to benefit New Zealand businesses that recruit overseas. As you may know, the idea is to introduce a temporary exemption from New Zealand income tax on overseas income of people who come here to work as employees, whether they are foreigners or expatriates who have been non- resident for tax purposes for ten years. I had hoped that it would be possible to include the proposal into the first taxation bill of the year, but submissions on the proposal as set out in the discussion document indicated that more policy development is needed – for example, on whether the proposal should be extended beyond employees. For this reason, legislation will be postponed until later in the year. Extending and maintaining New Zealand’s network of double tax agreements with other countries remains a priority. We currently have 27 such agreements, which are designed to reduce tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment. This year will see significant progress. Our double tax agreement with South Africa is close to conclusion: all that remains to be done for the agreement to take effect is for a New Zealand Order in Council to be made, and I expect that to occur within the next few months. At the same time, we will be giving legal effect in New Zealand to our double tax agreements with Chile, our first with a Latin American country, and with the United Arab Emirates, our first with a Middle Eastern jurisdiction. Protocols to agreements with the Netherlands, United Kingdom and Philippines are also expected to be updated in the same group of Orders in Council. We will also begin negotiations this year with Austria, and are exploring the possibility of doing so with one or two other countries. 5 5 I now turn to the vexed issue of the taxation of offshore portfolio investment. As you will no doubt be aware, my officials released an issues paper at the end of last year outlining two options to reform the tax rules in this area. One was the standard return approach – based broadly on the Tax Review’s risk- free rate of return method. The other was the offshore portfolio investment rules – essentially, a modified version of the current foreign investment fund rules. Under both options, the so-called “grey list” would be removed. It is fair to say that the proposals have generated significant interest and, among some commentators, a little concern. This is not surprising – there are no easy answers in this area. As an experienced politician, I should not have been surprised at some comments made that this is a devious attempt to introduce a capital gains tax or an across-the- board wealth tax. Let me assure you that I have no such agenda. My position is very simple. I cannot see sense in rules that, for example, tax an individual on accrued capital gains on investments in most countries of the world but impose almost no tax on such investments in a few selected countries – and, as a result, expose the tax base to Australian unit trust-type structures. I cannot see any sense in that. Nor can I see sense in rules that penalise investors using savings intermediaries, especially if the funds are actively managed and based in New Zealand rather than offshore. The issues paper raised options to try to bring a little more sense to this area. That is my objective. The options set out in the issues paper are not perfect. On the other hand, current rules seem to me to be far from perfect. If there are better options please raise them. But remember that viable options must continue to raise tax revenue and must not penalise investment in our own country. With your help I think we can have a process to work through these issues. Officials continue to receive submissions on the proposals and will report to me once these have been considered. I hope then to be in a position to make a final decision on the direction for reform. Meanwhile, as signalled in the issues paper, the savings industry is keen to consider whether a version of the risk-free rate of return method could be developed to tax the investments of domestic savings entities. Such an approach is worth exploring because it has the potential to provide improved consistency to the taxation of savings. There are a number of very complex issues that would need to be addressed before this approach could be implemented. I would like to work closely with industry representatives in the coming year to see if these issues can be addressed and an appropriate solution developed. 6 6 This work has a greater chance of success if the taxation of offshore investment is considered along with domestic investment. This inevitably means that any offshore solution cannot be applied from the 2005-06 year. I am prepared to accept this delay on the basis that an interim solution is enacted to deal with the Australian unit trust issue. I am advised that a significant and growing amount of investment is now flowing into these structures, giving rise to a serious base maintenance concern. If officials can develop an interim solution to plug this leak, the government will be recommending it for enactment as soon as practicable. The use of a risk-free rate of return method to tax the investments of domestic savings entities also provides an opportunity to consider approaches to removing some of the disincentives to invest in retirement savings vehicles such as superannuation funds. By taxing the investor under a risk-free rate of return method, it is possible to tax that income at the marginal tax rate of the investor, thereby removing the current over-taxation or under-taxation of members of superannuation funds. That has appeal but is, of course, dependent on where we get to on the wider issue of the viability of the risk-free rate of return method generally. I am also keen to develop policy options that would increase work-based retirement savings schemes. The Periodic Report Group, in its December report, noted that there was value in promoting greater use of work-based savings schemes as a way for new Zealanders to save for retirement – the reasons being that as such schemes provide deduction at source, economies of scale and an avenue to reach a high proportion of the population. The report group recommended that the government establish a work-based savings group to develop an agreed approach to promote work-based savings. This recommendation has merit and I am in the process of developing terms of reference for a group to be established to look at the design of a work-based savings product. It is my intention to announce the membership of this group and its terms of reference before this year’s budget. The whole issue of saving for retirement – and New Zealand’s lack of it – has been a long-standing concern of mine. Some progress has been made in areas such as the superannuation fund. The Saving New Zealand forum last year provided a platform to move forward. One of the main areas of reform under the growth and innovation banner is the proposal to remove tax barriers to international venture capital. The proposal attempts to increase international venture capital by providing a tax exemption for the venture capital profits that certain non-residents derive from New Zealand. My officials have now consulted on this broad proposal with interested parties from the private sector – including the venture capital industry. As a result of the very useful feedback gained during consultation, the package has been enhanced in a number of areas. One of the more significant of these improvements is widening the scope of “eligible investor” to include certain “foreign funds of funds”. 7 7 The venture capital changes will be included in the next taxation bill and will apply from 1 April 2004. The government is also undertaking work in relation to capital investment in New Zealand, specifically to identify whether there is a problem with capital adequacy. This work will look at the drivers of New Zealand capital investment and identify specific problem areas and their policy implications. The impact of the tax system, particularly the depreciation rules, on the cost of capital and whether there are any tax policy options to address cost of capital issues will be considered as part of that work. Although this wider work is important in terms of identifying potential obstacles to capital investment, the government is also looking at the tax depreciation rules more generally, to see whether there are further enhancements that can be made. As part of that work, in the near future officials will be releasing an issues paper outlining potential enhancements. The issues paper will also provide an opportunity for further public consultation on a number of concerns about the tax depreciation rules that have been brought to the government’s and officials’ attention. The government is also working through the recommendations of the Private Sector Liaison Group on Research and Development. A number of the recommendations have implications for the tax depreciation rules, as they deal with capital expenditure that cannot be depreciated – so called “black hole” expenditure. As a starting point, the government has agreed to allow deductibility for costs associated with patent and resource management consent applications that are not granted or are withdrawn. This change will be included in the next taxation bill. The issue of how to deal with “black hole” expenditure, generally, is more complex and the government hopes that officials and the liaison group can work together to find appropriate solutions. The closing date for submissions on the recent discussion document setting out proposals for streamlining the taxation of fringe benefits is near. There has been a lot of interest in the proposals and – in particular – on those related to car parks, reduced rates for motor vehicles, and raising the de minimis thresholds. Officials are working through the details of submissions received so far. I look forward to discussing the suggestions made in the submissions with officials in the near future. Our aim remains to achieve a workable package that is fairer and easier for businesses to apply. Plans are for two taxation bills to be introduced this year. The early one, planned for late March or early April, would include – for example, the masthead issue, changes arising from the review of tax dispute resolution procedures, and simplification measures, in addition to matters I indicated earlier. The later bill, perhaps in November, could include issues such as changes to fringe benefit tax amendments, reform of legal professional privilege and simplification measures resulting from the discussion document “Making tax easier for small businesses”. 8 8 The bill bringing into being the new Charities Commission is expected to be introduced into Parliament this month. The commission will oversee the registration of charities that seek tax-exempt status, which will introduce greater accountability and transparency into the process. Finally, the bill that rewrites the first five parts of the Income Tax Act is expected to be passed on 8 April this year, which will be a milestone for the project, which began back in the early 1990s. To turn briefly to the floods that ravaged parts of the lower North Island last month, the government is aware that their economic effect will have to be accounted for – both in the short and medium terms. A very preliminary estimate of the damage across the dairy, sheep, beef, deer, crops and forestry sectors is up to $180 million, a figure that may increase. The response to flood victims across government departments has been significant. Departments have been working together to provide a co-ordinated service that deals with matters ranging from income support, housing and health issues, through to child support and tax–related issues. Operationally, Inland Revenue has been at the front line in places like Bulls and Marton, and doing great work. Inland Revenue’s policy people have been working alongside the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Institute of Chartered Accountants, and they will be advising the government on any areas of the law that may not adequately accommodate the extreme circumstances of the situation. I would like to conclude today by thanking you – the individuals and the organisations you may represent – for your repeated efforts in responding to calls for consultation on proposed tax policy – whether it is a matter of proposals set out in a government discussion document, proposed tax legislation that is before a select committee, or informal requests from policy officials for your views on specific issues. I am aware that this consultation takes a lot of time and resources on your part, as it does on the government’s part. However, your contributions are an essential part of the development of good tax policy and law, and they are valued. I wish you a very successful conference. Thank you.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Government tax policy programme to December 05

Policies to support growth and innovation, assist low to middle income families and maintain the revenue base were on the government's tax policy work programme to December next year, Revenue Minister Michael Cullen told the International Fiscal Association conference today.

Dr Cullen reaffirmed the government's determination to deal with the "vexed" question of the taxation of offshore portfolio investment as the current rules did not make a lot of sense and produced some perverse outcomes.

He acknowledged that the options set out in the officials paper issued late last year were "not perfect" and said he was open to suggestions from the private sector provided these continued to raise revenue and did not penalise investment in New Zealand.

"With your help, I think we can have a process to work through these issues," he said.

The government would explore, at the suggestion of the savings industry, whether a version of the risk-free rate of return method could be developed to tax the investments of domestic savings entities as this had the potential to bring more consistency to the taxation of savings.

Because it was sensible to consider offshore and domestic investment together, this would mean delaying new rules for offshore investment.

"I am prepared to accept this delay on the basis that an interim solution is enacted to deal with the Australian unit trust issue as I am advised that a significant and growing amount of money is flowing into these structures.

"If officials can come up with an answer to plug this leak, the government will recommend it for enactment as soon as practicable."

Dr Cullen said the government was keen to increase work-based retirement savings and had picked up the Periodic Report Group's recommendation that a working group be established to design an appropriate savings product. The membership and terms of reference would be made public before this year's budget.

A review of the tax depreciation rules was also a priority with an issues paper outlining possible improvements due out soon.

Legislation to give a tax holiday on overseas income to foreigners and expatriates who had been away ten years and were coming to New Zealand to work as employees would be postponed until later in the year while the government considered whether the proposal might be extended beyond employees.

"The government will also begin negotiations with Austria this year on a double tax agreement, conclude the agreement with South Africa and give legal effect in New Zealand to the agreements with Chile and the United Arab Emirates," Dr Cullen said.

Tax bill introduced
===================

The year's first major taxation bill was introduced into Parliament today. The omnibus bill removes a tax barrier to unlisted New Zealand companies gaining access to foreign venture capital, amends the legislative framework of the disputes resolution process, introduces a 6.7% rebate for payment of tax on self-employment and partnership income in the first year of business, and closes a loophole involving the sale and leaseback of intangibles such as trademarks. These and other changes are detailed in the [commentary](/publications/2004/2004-commentary-arvcmp)

### Tax change aids venture capital investment

A tax bill aligning New Zealand’s venture capital tax rules more closely with those of Australia was introduced to Parliament today.

Revenue Minister Michael Cullen said the change should help New Zealand compete more effectively with Australia for venture capital.

"The amendments target foreign investors who are tax-exempt in their own countries and therefore cannot claim or make use of credits for any tax they pay in New Zealand.

"They will be exempted from New Zealand income tax on the sale of shares in certain unlisted New Zealand companies. The change will apply to foreign investors who are resident in most of the countries with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement and who are tax-exempt at home.

"The exemption will also apply to foreign funds from countries representing our main investment partners that invest on behalf of foreign venture capital investors who are generally tax-exempt in their own countries.

"Other important changes in the bill include amendments to the legislative framework governing the resolution of disputes between taxpayers and Inland Revenue, to improve the process for both parties.

"The bill also introduces a 6.7 per cent rebate, or 'discount', to encourage people who begin receiving self-employed or partnership income to make voluntary payments of income tax in their first year of business, rather than wait to pay tax on year-one income in year two. The change is designed to reduce the financial strain that individuals in business face in their first three years of business," Dr Cullen said.

### Loophole closed on sale and lease of trademarks

A loophole involving the sale and leaseback of intangibles such as trademarks and newspaper mastheads will be closed through provisions in the taxation bill introduced in Parliament today.

Revenue Minister Michael Cullen announced last year to legislate to prevent a potential and significant revenue loss through use of this mechanism.

"The proposed changes do not affect normal sale and leaseback transactions that are entered into for commercial reasons - only those that could result in participants claiming tax deductions for what are, in substance, repayments of loan principal.

"The finance lease rules in the Income Tax Act are being amended to prevent this happening. The amendments will not apply to transactions entered into before the introduction of the bill.

"The government is aware of only one relevant transaction that was entered into before today. The new rules will not apply to that because the particular circumstances of the taxpayer involved mean that there would be no revenue advantage to the government from doing so," Dr Cullen said.

Further information on the proposed legislation can be found in the commentary on the Taxation (Annual Rates, Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, available at [www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz](https://www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz)

Savings product group members appointed
=======================================

Membership of the new Savings Product Working Group was announced today. The working group will advise the government on the design and implementation of work-based savings products for retirement, which may involve identifying tax barriers to participation.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Savings Product Working Group appointees

The government has appointed members to a special Savings Product Working Group to advise on the design and implementation of work-based savings products for retirement.

"Work-based savings schemes are an excellent way for New Zealanders to save because they provide deductions for savings at source, benefit from economies of scale and have the potential to reach a high proportion of the working population," Dr Cullen said.

"A few employers already offer their employees access to superannuation schemes, but they are in the minority, and employees lucky enough to have access to such schemes usually have to terminate their membership if they change jobs.

"The working group will look at New Zealanders' ease of access to work-based superannuation schemes and their ability to maintain access to them. It will then advise the government on the design and implementation of guidelines for generic work-based savings schemes that could be widely adopted by employers," Dr Cullen said.

The members of the Savings Product Working Group are:

*   Peter Harris, self-employed contractor (chair)
*   Diana Crossan, Retirement Commissioner
*   Mike Woodbury, senior associate of Chapman Tripp
*   Bernard Reid, actuarial consultant
*   Ross Kent, managing director of AMP
*   Andrew Leys, general manager of Southland Credit Union

"The collective background of the working group includes marketing, investment, actuarial, superannuation management, law and accounting and regulatory expertise, and I am very pleased to have been able to assemble such a depth and breadth of experience for the working group," Dr Cullen said.

The working group is to report to the government by the end of August 2004.

### Terms of Reference  
Savings Product Working Group

The Savings Product Working Group ("the Working Group") is appointed to provide advice to the Government on the detailed design and implementation issues to be resolved in delivering widely adopted generic work-based savings products. The term "work-based" refers to the employer's role in providing a direct deduction facility for contributions, providing access to savings schemes and providing education on retirement saving to employees through the work place, rather than actually managing a superannuation scheme. The Government considers that work-based savings schemes are a good way for New Zealanders to save for their retirement as such schemes provide for deductions towards savings to occur at source, benefit from economies of scale, and provide an avenue to reach a high proportion of the population.

While a number of employers do offer their employees access to superannuation schemes, the coverage in the New Zealand context is not significant and if an employee ceases to be employed by such an employer, the employee usually has to terminate their membership of the scheme. The problem to be addressed by the working group is the ease of access to superannuation schemes for New Zealanders and the ability to maintain that access until retirement. The Government considers that the availability of generic products that every employee can access and the ability to maintain a similar scheme if he or she changes employment has merit and may lead to increased savings for retirement. The Government further considers that the broad adoption of generic work-based savings schemes of this sort is unlikely to develop without Government action.

The Government proposes to provide some degree of funding to assist with the uptake of work-based savings products by removing some of the current tax disincentives such as the over-taxation of low-income earners saving through superannuation products. It may be that any such relief provided will only apply to a certain category of savings products. The task of the Working Group will include the design of a work-based savings product, or guidelines for current products that could be offered by several providers and further to resolve barriers to widespread offer of such products by employers. With respect to tax policy, the Working Group may also identify where the current tax system discourages participation in work-based savings products.

The issue of any tax incentive or subsidy for such a class of savings products will be considered separately by the Government as part of its consideration of the appropriate tax treatment of savings vehicles.

The Government considers that the Working Group's proposals should address the following key features, including them unless they are shown to conflict with core aspects of a solution:

*   access for all employees (including part-time and casual) in a scheme as a result of their employment, including a salary or wage deduction facility for employee contributions;
*   automatic enrolment of employees to such a product, unless an employee declines such enrolment;
*   a method to generate long term savings that contribute to well being in retirement, such as lock-in of contributions until retirement except in limited circumstances; and
*   portability of contributions between approved products.

In this regard, the Government seeks advice from the Working Group on the detailed design and implementation of guidelines for generic work-based savings products or solutions. In particular, the Government requires the following questions and issues to be addressed:

*   what design features will be necessary to take into account the needs of low-and middle-income employees and how will any proposed product would facilitate the retirement saving of this group?
*   what design features will be necessary to ensure that all employers offer access to such a product? For example, one design feature to achieve this could be mandatory offering.
*   what design features will be necessary to allow for on going contributions to such a product or maintenance without contributions during periods of non-employment?
*   what group of employees should the automatic enrolment rules apply to? Should there be any period between commencing employment and automatic enrolment to deal with employee turnover issues? For example, should automatic enrolment apply to all employees including part-time and casual?
*   if early withdrawal of contributions is allowed, what circumstances would apply to allow for such earlier withdrawal of contributions?
*   what limitations, if any, should be placed on the management of approved schemes? For example, level of administrative fees chargeable, the investment profiles of such products, the acceptance of small regular contributions, and allowance for periods of non-contribution.
*   how can the compliance costs for employers, fund providers and employees associated with implementation and on-going provision of such a product be minimised?
*   what is the best way to implement a generic work-based savings product and what are the lead-in times required by employers and fund providers?

The Working Group is to report back to the Minister of Finance and Revenue by the end of August 2004. That report will provide advice to the Government on how to resolve the detailed design and implementation issues associated limiting the broad adoption of generic work-based savings products

Measures to boost gas exploration
=================================

The government today announced plans to encourage exploration for new gas reserves. Proposed measures include royalty-based changes, plans to review the tax treatment of non-resident rig operators and the amortisation rate applied to exploration activities, and clarification of the GST rules relating to exploration permits.

### Government boost for gas exploration

Exploration for new gas reserves will be encouraged through a suite of proposed measures announced today.

Energy Minister Pete Hodgson said with the depletion of Maui gas reserves, new fields were critical to meet future energy needs.

The proposals include:

*   reducing the ad valorem royalty \[AVR\] rate from 5 per cent to 1 per cent for gas (oil will remain at 5 per cent) for the period;
*   allowing a deduction in relation to the accounting profit royalty \[APR\] on production from discoveries, within the period, of exploration and prospecting costs incurred in New Zealand and allowing such costs to be carried forward with interest;
*   reducing the accounting profit royalty (APR) from 20 per cent to 15 per cent on the first $750 million \[cumulative\] gross sales of petroleum offshore and the first $250 million \[cumulative\] onshore on discoveries within the period.

Associate Energy Minister Harry Duynhoven will lead consultations with industry on these proposals. Any changes arising from the consultation will apply to production from fields discovered within the 30 June 2004 and 31 December 2009 period and will be integrated into the Minerals Programme for Petroleum to have effect from next year.

Revenue Minister Michael Cullen said the government was keen to ensure the tax treatment of oil and gas exploration did not create unnecessary barriers and would review the tax rules applying to non-resident drilling rig operators; aspects of the capital treatment of development expenditure; and the application of certain GST rules to the oil and gas industry.

In addition, the package proposes $15 million over three years for seismic mapping and increased resources to Crown Minerals to promote New Zealand overseas as a petroleum prospecting destination.

### Background information

#### Royalty charges

_Ad valorem royalty (AVR)_  
Currently applied at five per cent, a royalty paid to the Crown against gross revenue from the sale of petroleum.

_Accounting profit royalty (APR)_  
Currently applied at 20 per cent, a royalty paid to the crown on net revenues from the sale of petroleum after deducting related expenses.

Permit holders are required to pay the higher of the two royalties in any year. Typically, AVR is paid in the early years of production as prior costs are netted against revenue and at the end of the field's life as production falls. Also the predominant paying of AVR can apply across the life of marginal fields. APR is typically paid during the peak years of production of non-marginal fields.

Carrying forward of deduction of exploration costs against APR  
The proposal is for deductible costs incurred between 30 June 2004 and 31 December 2009 to be carried forward with annual interest at a rate equal to the 10-year government bond rate plus one percentage point.

### Tax Measures

The Government is concerned that the tax treatment does not raise undue barriers to exploration, in particular during the proposed period of the royalty reductions. Thus a number of tax measures have been identified for consideration in the tax policy work programme, in the following priority:

*   Reviewing the tax treatment of non-resident drilling rig operators;
*   Clarifying the GST treatment of the sale of an interest in a permit by a person who is part of a joint venture, and also the GST treatment of site restoration costs; and
*   Reviewing the amortisation treatment of development expenditure, ensuring the duration and profile of deductions reflects the economic life of the assets, and reviewing the differential treatment of offshore and onshore developments.

### Marketing initiatives

The proposals include a range of initiatives to proactively encourage exploration and production companies to New Zealand, and to facilitate more efficient and effective drilling programmes. These include:

*   funding pre-competitive data acquisition;
*   facilitation/coodination of multi-party work programmes;
*   information provision to facilitate exploration.

_The provision of pre-competitive bidding data (including seismic data)_  
The government proposes funding a programme, to be managed by Crown Minerals, to increase understanding of the prospectivity of New Zealand's petroleum basins, spending up to $15 million over two to three years. This will be developed in consultation with the industry and other interested parties and will be used to increase the knowledge base available to explorers, thereby increasing the attractiveness of New Zealand as an exploration destination.

_More active programme facilitation by Crown Minerals_  
All permit holders provide Crown Minerals with a detailed work programme that provides dates when specific activities such as seismic surveying and drilling are planned. The proposal is for Crown Minerals to increase the level at which it facilitates the use of this information to assist with the coordination of these activities to ensure progress is not delayed due to shortages of technicians and equipment.

_Facilitation of exploration activities_  
Crown Minerals is currently developing a strategy to promote new investment, targeting a range of explorers that have a profile that is appropriate for New Zealand. Activities to attract these explorers include providing appropriate information and working with market analysts equity investors and explorers.  
This work requires preparing and presenting promotional material to explorers, market analysts and investors, managing appropriately structured block offers, and augmenting geotechnical information systems. Four key areas of work are:

1.  Establishment and promotion of a new investment strategy
2.  Geo-technical data analysis and customisation
3.  Technical analysis of users’ needs from information technology systems
4.  Review and strengthening of the data compliance regime.

Death and distribution rules to be clarified
============================================

The income tax rules on the consequences of the death of a taxpayer, 'in kind' distributions from trusts and estates, and gifts of all kinds are to be clarified. The changes, which will apply only to assets and liabilities that are in the tax base, will be included in the taxation bill scheduled for late this year.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Tax of death and asset distributions to be clarified

The government will clarify the income tax rules on transfers of assets at death and liabilities to beneficiaries, Revenue Minister Michael Cullen announced today.

"The changes, to be effective from enactment and included in the taxation bill planned for this year, will apply only to assets and liabilities that are in the tax base such as buildings for which depreciation is being claimed, for example rental properties, and land or shares for which the gain is taxable.

"The vast majority of estates will not be affected as their assets are not in the tax base."

"The current tax law is unclear and over the years there have been repeated calls for reform," Dr Cullen said. "There is uncertainty about the tax treatment of 'in kind' distributions of assets from trusts and estates, as well as gifts of all kinds regardless of the circumstances.

"To add greater certainty and consistency, the government will introduce comprehensive rules that provide a uniform income tax treatment of these asset transfers," Dr Cullen said.

The three main proposals are:

*   A disposal and acquisition of a taxpayer's assets and liabilities will be deemed to occur at market value, on the day of his or her death.
*   'In kind' distributions of assets by companies and trusts (including estates) will be treated as dispositions and acquisitions at market value.
*   Gifts will be treated in the same way as 'in kind' distributions.

"Exclusions will relate to estates left to spouses who are the only beneficiaries, to forestry assets on the owner's death, and to simple estates when the assets are left to charity or to close relations," Dr Cullen said.

ATTACHMENT

PROPOSED CHANGES APPROVED BY CABINET

1\. The three key proposals are that:

*   A disposal and acquisition of a taxpayer's assets and liabilities will be deemed to occur at market value, on the day of the taxpayer's death.
*   "In kind" distributions of assets by companies and trusts (including estates) will be treated as dispositions and acquisitions at market value.
*   Gifts will be treated in the same way as "in kind" distributions.

2\. The effect of the proposals is that there will be two valuation points in respect of each deceased individual's estate: one on the day of death, and another when the estate is distributed. However, the following exceptions will apply:

*   When the only beneficiary of an estate is the spouse of the deceased, roll-over relief will be available both on the taxpayer's death and on any subsequent distribution of the estate to the spouse. \[Roll-over relief occurs when the disposer's tax values transfer to the person who acquires the asset or liability. Therefore no tax liability arises to the person who disposes of the assets or liabilities.\
*   There will be only one valuation point (the day of death) when the estate is distributable immediately after probate, and the following circumstances apply:\
    *   the deceased's estate (aside from specific legacies of cash or assets that are not in the tax base) is left to charity; or\
    *   the deceased's estate is left to close relations only; and\
    *   the net income of the estate while it is under administration is distributed; and\
    *   the estate is transferred to the beneficiaries as soon as is reasonably practicable after the taxpayer's death.\
*   Roll-over relief will be available in relation to forestry assets of a taxpayer, both on the taxpayer's death and on any subsequent distribution of the estate to beneficiaries, where the beneficiaries are close relatives of the deceased.\
\
3\. These exceptions will continue to apply where there are also specific legacies to third persons of assets that are not in the tax base.\
\
4\. Close relatives in these circumstances include relatives who are related to the second degree – for example, siblings, parents, children, grandchildren, grandparents, aunts and uncles.\
\
5\. A considerable number of consequential amendments to the Income Tax Act's present treatment of death and distributions will be needed.\
\
6\. A number of specific proposals that address more technical issues will also be adopted:\
\
*   The tax treatment of past deaths and distributions from trust and estates will be grandparented where:\
    *   The tax base is protected by the position that was taken, either because the tax book values of the assets and liabilities were rolled over, or because a market value exercise was done.\
    *   The beneficiaries of the trust or estate are limited to persons that are New Zealand resident for taxation purposes who are not exempt from income tax.\
*   A special rule will be introduced to ensure that a taxpayer's death does not in itself lead to an asset being brought into the tax base, merely because the ten-year period for land held on capital account has not elapsed. Ordinarily, land owned by certain people (such as land developers) is deemed to be on revenue account if it is disposed of within ten years of acquisition. Tax will not be payable if such land passes to the deceased's estate and on to an associated person of the deceased, where the land is held for the total of the ten years by the deceased, the estate and the beneficiary combined.\
*   A variation from the requirement to use market value will apply to unexpired accrual expenditure, which will instead be valued at cost less any amount amortised. These assets are typically not held for resale, and valuing at cost should reduce taxpayers' compliance costs.\
*   No use-of-money interest will be imposed in relation to a deceased individual's tax liability in the year of death, so long as all tax due is paid by the due dates.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Chair to consult on taxation of investment income

Craig Stobo has been appointed to co-ordinate consultation on issues with the taxation of investment income, both onshore and offshore, and to develop options for reform.

"Mr Stobo is eminently suited to the role," Revenue Minister Michael Cullen said today. "He has an extensive background in the New Zealand savings industry and is a highly respected expert in his field.

"The current rules are potentially unfair since the tax treatment of an investment can vary depending on a number of factors, including whether it is made directly or via an intermediary and whether it is held onshore or offshore.

"These problems can also give rise to economic inefficiencies and distort the way people invest. The government's view is that, as far as possible, the tax rules should not influence investors’ decisions.

"Mr Stobo will consult widely with the industry and other interested parties, in developing proposals for change and will report back to the government by the end of October," Dr Cullen said.

Technical inquiries to Helen Mackenzie \[tax advisor, Dr Cullen's office\] 471-9728

The terms of reference for the appointment are attached.

### Terms of Reference

### Taxation of investment - consultation

The government will appoint an independent chair to ascertain whether a consensus is emerging on how to address the current problems with the taxation of investment income, both domestically and offshore. The chair would be responsible for consultation on options that are consistent with developing such a consensus. The chair would consult widely with the New Zealand savings industry and other interested stakeholders.

The mandate of the chair will be to resolve issues and inconsistencies in the tax law, (primarily as they apply to New Zealand portfolio investors - those with under 10 percent ownership interests in companies or other entities), whether those investments occur directly in companies, other entities, or indirectly via intermediaries. It should be assumed that the basic structure of tax laws outside the area of investment will not be altered and will therefore be outside the terms of reference for this work. An across-the-board capital gains tax, taxation of owner-occupied housing and the basic treatment of debt instruments under the accrual rules are not within the terms of reference.

It would be outside the scope of the work for the chair to consider alternatives to the tax treatment of savings that are not consistent with the TTE (tax/tax/exempt) model applied in New Zealand or to consider savings-related concessions. Some related specialist areas, such as the tax rules for life insurance, may be impacted by any options put forward. While it would be useful to note these impacts, in the time available it would not be feasible for the chair to consider the many detailed issues that changes to the tax treatment of savings might involve.

In its broadest terms, the chair should consider options for making the tax law more consistent between direct and indirect investment so as to improve the efficiency and fairness of the taxation of savings and in particular to reduce any tax impediments to the ability of ordinary New Zealanders to save for their retirement.

The objective of this work is to develop options for change that would minimise the extent to which the tax system distorts the way New Zealanders invest (direct versus via an intermediary or via different intermediaries). As far as possible New Zealand resident intermediaries should not face tax penalties compared to direct investment and similar offshore entities New Zealanders might invest in.

In meeting the above objective, any option for change should, as far as possible:

1.  Protect the New Zealand tax base from erosion. Examples include investment in low or no tax jurisdictions, or investment in no or low tax entities in high tax jurisdictions.
2.  Minimise compliance costs for New Zealand investors and the New Zealand savings industry. For example, any requirement for individual investors who are currently not required to file tax returns to start filing such returns would increase compliance costs. Similarly the New Zealand savings industry has expressed concerns regarding compliance costs imposed on them under certain current tax rules.
3.  Minimise the extent to which the tax system penalises lower income savers who may not have the means or the skills to invest directly and for whom employment superannuation is likely to be significant for retirement savings. For example, it would be desirable that those on a low rate of tax are not taxed at a higher rate on their superannuation savings.

It should be noted that the points above may, at times, be contradictory in practice, which is why there is likely to be several options proposed along with their advantages and disadvantages.

Revenue neutrality is not an objective of this work. The government would like to consider the most viable options (having regard to the objective and points (1) to (3) above) identified by the chair, irrespective of their revenue implications. Revenue implications should however, to the extent possible, be identified since these would need to be taken into account in any final decision.

The government considers that the chair should be charged with:

*   Establishing if there is general agreement on whether the objective and points (1) to (3) above are the principal issues in the area of taxation of investment income.
*   Identifying the boundaries that exist in the area of the current taxation of investment income, both domestically and offshore.
*   Ascertaining whether a consensus can be achieved on how to resolve problems associated with these boundaries, in consultation with the New Zealand savings industry and other interested stakeholders.
*   Developing options for reform that are consistent with such a consensus.
*   Identifying the advantages and disadvantages of the options considered.
*   Reporting to the Minister of Finance and Revenue on viable options by the end of October 2004

The Taxation (GST, Trans-Tasman Imputation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003 amended the Goods & Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act) to allow supplies of financial services by a GST-registered person to another GST-registered person to be zero-rated. The changes integrate the supply of financial services more fully into the GST system by taxing (at the rate of 0%) such supplies and allowing financial service providers to deduct input tax in respect of those supplies. 1 This is in contrast to the current “exempt” treatment of financial services, whereby GST is not charged and financial service providers cannot deduct input tax for GST paid on goods and services used in supplying financial services. 2. From 1 January 2005 the zero-rating rules 2 allow providers to elect to zero-rate supplies of financial services to customers that: • are registered for GST if the level of taxable supplies 3 made by the customer, in a given 12-month period (including the taxable period in which the supply is made), is equal to or exceeds 75 percent of their total supplies for the period; • may not meet the 75 percent threshold but are part of a group that does meet the threshold in a given 12-month period (including the taxable period in which the supply is made) – for example, the treasury or finance function of a group of companies that receives financial services. Note: The treatment of financial services supplied to final consumers remains unchanged. Supplies to final consumers in New Zealand are still exempt from GST and cannot be zero- rated under these guidelines. 3. From 1 January 2005 the GST Act also provides an additional deduction from output tax for supplies of financial services made to another financial service provider, which in turn makes supplies to businesses that qualify to receive zero-rated financial services. 4 The amount that can be deducted will be determined by the ratio of taxable to non-taxable supplies made by the recipient financial service provider. 5 The formula for calculating the value of the deduction is set out in these guidelines, but is generally based on the recipients’ relative proportions of business and non-business customers. 1 Refer Tax Information Bulletin Vol. 16 No. 1 February 2004 pp 23 to 31 for a discussion on the legislative amendments contained in the Taxation (GST, Trans-Tasman Imputation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003. 2 Refer sections 11A(1)(q) and (r). 3 Excluding supplies of financial services zero-rated under sections 11A(1)(q) and/or (r). 4 Refer section 20(3)(h). 5 Refer section 20C. 2 4. These guidelines set out Inland Revenue’s generally approved method for zero-rating supplies of financial services under the zero-rating rules. 6 5. The guidelines also set out the application of the various deductions allowed as input tax under the GST Act for financial service providers. 7 What is a “financial service”? 6. While many activities may be thought of as a “financial service”, for the purposes of the GST Act the term “financial services”, as defined in the GST Act, generally applies to the following types of transaction: 8 • dealings with money; • certain dealings with securities; • the provision of credit and loans; • the provision of life insurance (including superannuation); • the provision of non-deliverable futures contracts and financial options; • the payment and collection of interest, principal, dividends and amounts relating to transactions involving securities; and • intermediation and brokerage services relating to the supply of debt, equity and life insurance. 7. Services which are not treated as financial services include debt collection, equipment leasing, credit control, sales ledger and accounting services, provision of advice, investment guidance, and fire and general insurance. Examples of financial services include: • paying or collecting any amount of interest; • providing mortgages and other loans; • issuing securities such as stocks and shares; • providing credit under a credit contract; • exchanging currency (for example, changing US$ into NZ$); • issuing financial options or non-deliverable futures contracts; and • arranging or agreeing to do any of the above (for example mortgage brokering). 6 The authority for these guidelines is provided in section 20E of the GST Act. 7 Refer section 20(3). 8 Refer section 3. 3 Scope and purpose of the guidelines 8. These guidelines apply to financial service providers that are GST-registered, or liable to be registered for GST, who supply financial intermediation services. Financial intermediation services are those that bring together suppliers and consumers of financial services. Examples include deposit-taking intermediation, which involves bringing together suppliers and users of financial capital, and brokerage services involving the buying and selling of financial instruments and currencies. 9. The guidelines do not apply to persons that do not supply financial services as part of a taxable activity for GST purposes – for example, the mere provision of a loan, activities that involve only holding securities belonging to another entity or the issue of capital in a company or trust. These activities are generally not considered on their own to constitute a taxable activity. However, whether or not a particular financial service constitutes part of a taxable activity needs to be determined on a case-by-case basis. Any questions regarding whether or not a financial activity is a taxable activity should be directed to Inland Revenue or a tax advisor. 10. The application of the zero-rating rules requires providers to know, at a minimum, whether their customer is registered for GST and the ratio of taxable supplies to total supplies made by the customer. Under the GST Act, these tests must, in the first instance be applied on a transaction-by-transaction basis. However, to recognise the costs that could arise in meeting these requirements, the GST Act allows providers to apply an alternative method approved by Inland Revenue, either generally or by specific agreement. 11. Providers have the following choices if they elect to use the zero-rating rules and deduct input tax for GST paid on making those supplies. Options Topic Relevant sections in the GST Act Option 1 Use these guidelines Option 2 Not use the guidelines Option 3 Obtain a specific method Zero-rating Sections 3 and 11A(1)(q) and (r) Refer paragraphs 21 to 51 Zero-rate on a transaction-by- transaction basis Apply in writing to Inland Revenue to use an alternative method Principal purpose / change-in-use adjustments Sections 20(3)(e) and 21 to 21G Refer paragraphs 60 and 63 to 75 Use the principal purpose test or direct attribution to deduct input tax Apply in writing to Inland Revenue to use an alternative method Deductions from output tax Deduction for supplies between financial service providers Sections 20(3)(h) and 20C Refer paragraphs 76 to 87 Note: Financial services that are supplied to non-residents that are outside New Zealand are outside the scope of these guidelines because such supplies are already zero-rated. 4 Alternative approaches 12. Providers may seek approval from Inland Revenue to use an alternative method for zero-rating supplies of financial services provided that the alternative method produces a fair and reasonable result compared to identifying eligible customers on a transaction-by- transaction basis. 9 Otherwise, providers may either apply these guidelines or zero-rate supplies of financial services on a transaction-by-transaction basis as required by the GST Act. 13. Inland Revenue may also agree to an alternative method for determining the extent to which goods and services are applied for making taxable and non-taxable supplies for the purpose of adjusting deductions of input tax. Approval will always require that the alternative produces a fair and reasonable result. 10 References 14. Unless otherwise specified, all section references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Election into the new GST rules 15. The GST Act requires providers to give written notice to Inland Revenue if they wish to zero-rate supplies of financial services and/or be eligible to deduct input tax for supplies of financial services made to other financial service providers. 16. This means if the compliance costs of zero-rating outweigh the benefits providers can choose not to elect into the new provisions. 17. Elections will take effect from the first day of the taxable period in which Inland Revenue receives the written notice. 18. An election will cease from the end of the taxable period: • in which the provider cease to carry on a taxable activity; or • that is nominated by the provider in a written notice, if the date nominated is after the taxable period in which Inland Revenue receives notice; or • in which Inland Revenue receives written notice if the provider does not nominate a taxable period. 9 Refer section 20E. 10 Refer section 21A. 5 19. Elections should be addressed to: Inland Revenue Corporates Financial Sector Private Bag 39984 Wellington Fax (04) 802-6192 Who to contact 20. Any questions in relation to these guidelines should be directed to Inland Revenue on 0800 377 776. Corporates customers should contact their account manager or call Inland Revenue on 0800 443 773. (Generally, Corporates customers are companies or groups of companies with an annual turnover in excess of $100 million or whose industry is governed by specific tax legislation). Zero-rating Paragraphs 21 to 51 set out Inland Revenue’s approved method for applying the zero-rating rules in relation to supplies of financial services. Financial service providers that have elected to zero-rate supplies using the guidelines must comply with these paragraphs. General application 21. The zero-rating rules allow providers to: • Zero-rate supplies of financial services to customers that are registered for GST if the level of taxable supplies made by the customer, 11 in a given 12-month period (including the taxable period in which the supply is made), is equal to or exceeds 75 percent of their total supplies for the period. • Zero-rate supplies of financial services to customers that may not meet the 75 percent threshold but are part of a group that does meet the threshold in a given 12-month period (including the taxable period in which the supply is made) – for example, the treasury or finance function of a group of companies that receive financial services. 11 Excluding supplies of financial services zero-rated under sections 11A(1)(q) and/or (r). 6 22. Supplies of financial services cannot be zero-rated if: • the financial services are supplied to businesses that have more than an incidental activity of making exempt supplies of financial services and other non-financial exempt supplies, that is, exempt supplies exceed 25 percent of total supplies; or • the financial services are supplied to non-registered persons (or final consumers). 23. When making a decision on whether or not a supply of financial services should be zero-rated all necessary steps must be undertaken to ensure that the decision is correct. Evidential requirements 24. It is important to keep adequate books and records to substantiate any decisions to zero- rate financial services to customers, undertake regular reviews of any systems and procedures used to categorise customers and generally comply with the tax law. It also necessary to have a process which reviews every year those decisions to zero-rate. Records that Inland Revenue expects to be maintained in relation to this part of the guidelines include notes relating to any dealing with the customer such as, client relationship notes, interview notes and application forms. Identifying eligible customers 25. Unlike the usual operation of GST, the zero-rating rules impose a requirement that providers obtain information about their customers. This is intended to ensure that the deductions of input tax that result from applying the zero-rating rules relate only to supplies made to qualifying businesses. Supplies to non-business customers – households and other final consumers – remain treated as exempt supplies. Input tax cannot be recovered in respect of supplies to these customers. 26. It is expected that the determination of the taxable status of a customer will be made by the provider supplying the financial services. The reason for this is that the difference between the supply of zero-rated financial services and exempt financial services is the respective ability or inability to deduct input tax in respect of those supplies. The deduction of input tax is therefore a matter for the provider to determine – not the recipient. 27. Figure 1 illustrates the questions that should be considered when determining whether a supply of financial services should be zero-rated. 7 F IGURE 1: Applying the zero-rating rules \* The test of reasonable expectation applies if providers adopt the Inland Revenue approved method of using ANZSIC codes as described at paragraphs 35 to 47. Zero-rating supplies of financial services 28. The zero-rating rules therefore require that providers consider two questions in relation to their customers’ activities: • The registration test: Is the customer registered for GST? • The 75 percent test: Has the customer made, or is likely to make, in the relevant taxable period supplies of goods and services that are taxable supplies which represent 75 percent or more of total supplies? Note: When establishing whether or not a customer qualifies under the 75 percent test all taxable supplies made by the customer should be considered except for supplies of financial services that are zero-rated under the new rules. 29. Assessing whether the customer qualifies under both limbs must occur in the taxable period in which the supply of financial services is made. Is the supply a supply of financial services as defined in section 3 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985? Zero-rating does not apply Yes Yes No Is the recipient a registered person? Is the recipient a person who makes, or is reasonably expected to make, taxable supplies that represent 75% or more of their total supplies?\* Zero-rating applies Yes No No 8 30. If the customer is part of a group, the tests should be applied by reference to the group of which the customer is a member. 12 31. Two options may be adopted in relation to the application of the new zero-rating rules – a transaction-based approach or a customer account approach. The option selected should best suit the customer and the type of financial service supplied. 32. Both options require providers to enquire directly whether or not the customer is registered for GST. Whether the customer meets the 75 percent test must be determined either on the basis of information held by the provider on the customer or by using the Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification codes (ANZSIC codes). A full list of ANZSIC codes may be found on the Statistics New Zealand website. 13 Option A Determine eligibility per transaction Option B Determine eligibility per customer account The registration test Direct enquiry Direct enquiry The 75 percent test Direct enquiry or ANZSIC codes Direct enquiry or ANZSIC codes Determining eligibility per transaction 33. If the supply is in relation to a one-off transaction, hire-purchase or lease, the assessment of whether the customer qualifies to receive zero-rated financial services should be established at the time agreement is reached on the contractual terms of the financial service. As GST is a tax on transactions involving the supply of goods and services any future cash flows arising from the contract should be ignored because the supply of money is excluded from the GST base. 14 An exception to this rule applies when there is a change in the terms and conditions under which those cash flows arise. 12 In section 11A(1)(r) the term “group” is defined by reference to section IG 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. A group is defined as two or more persons that have an aggregate common voting interest greater than or equal to 66 percent. 13 Refer: http://www.stats.govt.nz/domino/external/web/carsweb.nsf/94772cd5918085044c2567e6007eec2c/5b3e1b99a0d 86615cc256cec007e6b14?OpenDocument 14 An exception applies to finance lease contracts. See GST and finance leases – classification, method of accounting and treatment of residual value clause, Tax Information Bulletin Volume Eight, No. 1 July 1996. 9 Determining eligibility per customer account 34. If a number of financial services are likely to be supplied to the same customer and/or the cash flows arising under the financial transaction are uncertain, such as an account facility – for example a revolving credit facility or regular transactions involving financial instruments/assets, applying the zero-rating rules on a transaction-by-transaction basis is likely to be difficult. To address this, the customer’s initial eligibility to receive zero-rated financial services must be established at the time the account is created and may be used going forward, provided that the customer’s eligibility is reviewed every year. Zero-rating using ANZSIC codes 35. Acknowledging the difficulties that may arise when seeking information from customers in relation to their level of taxable supplies, Inland Revenue will accept the following as complying with the second limb (the 75 percent test) of the zero-rating rules. This should mean that it is not necessary, in all cases, to seek any information from customers directly in respect of their level of taxable supplies. Providers are still expected to enquire as to whether their customers are registered for GST. 36. For the purposes of the 75 percent test, customers that can be allocated an ANZSIC code, other than those listed in tables A and B, 15 may be treated as making taxable supplies that exceed the threshold. If a customer cannot be allocated an ANZSIC code providers can either seek information from the customer directly or treat any supplies of financial services to that customer as an exempt supply. 37. If the customer cannot be identified or allocated an ANZSIC code any supplies of financial services to that customer must not be zero-rated. This allows providers to assess, in less straightforward situations, the trade-off between the benefits of zero-rating and the compliance costs associated with identifying and determining the mix of taxable and exempt supplies made by the customer. 38. Any system or procedure used to allocate an ANZSIC code must provide the necessary accuracy and be subject to yearly internal audit and review. Note: In recognition that businesses change it is important that providers review the classification given to their customers on a yearly basis. 39. If the customer is part of a group, the ANZSIC code applied should be representative of the predominant activity undertaken by the group of which the customer is a member. 15 Refer paragraph 44. 10 ANZSIC codes – an explanation 40. ANZSIC codes are used in New Zealand and Australia for the production and analysis of industry statistics. The objective of the codes is to identify groupings of businesses which carry out similar economic activities. Each code defines an industry and the similar economic activities which characterise the businesses involved in that industry by reference to the primary activity undertaken. In principle, any individual business can be assigned an appropriate industry category on the basis of its predominant activity. 41. When applying the ANZSIC codes for the purposes of the zero-rating rules the term “business” includes companies, partnerships, trusts, non-profit organisations and government departments. 42. ANZSIC codes are structured according to divisions (the broadest level), subdivision, groups and classes (the finest level). At the division level there are 17 divisions that are identified by an alphabetical character. A Agriculture, forestry and fishing B Mining C Manufacturing D Electricity, gas and water supply E Construction F Wholesale trade G Retail trade H Accommodation, cafes and restaurants I Transport and storage J Communication services K Finance and insurance L Property and business services M Government administration and defence N Education O Health and community services P Cultural and recreational services Q Personal and other services 43. The subdivision, group and class levels provide increasingly detailed classification of the broad categories. For example, in the case of fire and general insurance, any business that is involved in this activity would be allocated ANZSIC code K7422, which is derived from the following: Division K Subdivision 74 Group 742 Class 7422 11 Using ANZSIC codes 44. When using ANZSIC codes to determine whether a customer meets the 75 percent test providers should refer to the class level, represented by a four-digit code, that is relevant to the customer’s predominant activity. It is possible that that some class codes will have more than four digits – if this occurs refer only to the first four. The codes will also sometimes appear with or without the alphabetical character. For the purposes of these guidelines, read the class code as including the alphabetical character. 45. If a customer’s activity is represented by a code that appears on either tables A or B (subject to paragraph 46) providers will not be able to zero-rate supplies of financial services to that customer. For conciseness, certain activities listed on tables A and B are referred to only by the first two or three digits (representing the subdivision or group classification). Any customer that is allocated a code that starts with those digits cannot receive zero-rated financial services. Note: Providers that have knowledge concerning the actual activity of a customer must use this information instead of relying on ANZSIC codes. 46. Customers that are allocated a code that is listed on table B will be treated as not having an activity that will comply with the 75 percent test unless information is received from the customer that clearly demonstrates otherwise. If the customer provides written evidence of having an activity of making taxable supplies of goods and services exceeding 75 percent or more of total supplies providers may zero-rate any supplies of financial services to that customer. 47. Codes that are not contained in tables A or B may be treated as complying with the 75 percent test.

The company conducts a review of its business clients that are involved in a number of activities and categorizes them as follows: Client Registered for GST? ANZSIC code Zero-rate? Bakery Y G5124 Y Builder Y E4111 Y Butcher Y G5121 Y Café Y H5730 Y Cash loan business Y K7330 N Cattery ? Q9529 ? Charity Y Q9629 ? Dairy Y G5110 Y Florist Y G5254 Y Fruiter Y G5122 Y Hairdresser N Q9526 N Health food shop Y G5129 Y Independent bookseller Y G5243 Y Lawyer Y L7834 Y Pharmacist Y G5251 Y Second-hand goods dealer Y G5252 Y Sports club Y P9319 Y Toymaker Y C2329 Y Watchmaker Y G5255 or G5269 ? 13 Making further inquiries: From the review, the finance company decides that it needs to gather more information from the cattery, charity and watchmaker in order to work out whether or not they can receive zero-rated supplies of financial services. The cattery The finance company has some doubt about whether or not the cattery is registered for GST. It telephones the cattery owner to establish whether it is registered for GST and the nature of the supplies made. The cattery owner confirms that the business is registered for GST and has a taxable activity. The finance company makes the assessment, that the cattery qualifies to receive zero-rated financial supplies. The charity The charity has an activity that largely involves the provision of emergency housing and supplying donated goods. It does not charge for the provision of emergency housing and receives a small revenue stream from the sale of donated goods. The charity is very dependent on donations to maintain its operations. As most of the supplies made by the charity are exempt, the finance company decides that the charity cannot receive zero-rated financial services. The watchmaker The watchmaker sells and restores watches and clocks, including repairing and servicing personal watches and selling watch accessories. The watchmaker holds some fine gold as stock for restoration purposes but does not sell it separately. The watchmaker also sells a number of restored pieces on credit and estimates that 15 percent of his annual income is from interest on those accounts. The watchmaker makes input tax adjustments in respect of those supplies. The finance company seeks further confirmation of the level of exempt supplies made by the watchmaker and, on the basis of that information, decides that the business is eligible to receive zero-rated financial services as the level of exempt supplies does not exceed 25 percent. The 12-month period and start-up businesses 48. The zero-rating rules require providers to give consideration to the registration status and activities of their customer over a 12-month period, including the taxable period in which the supply of financial services is made. 49. This 12-month period could be problematic for those customers that have recently started business, been restructured or merged with another organisation. To assist in the application of the zero-rating rules to these customers, providers may make an initial assessment based on information supplied to them by the customer provided that the customer’s business is reasonably expected to make its first taxable supplies of goods and services within 28 days from the date when the financial services were supplied. The initial assessment may then be applied for the next 12-month period, provided that it is reviewed at the end of that period to ensure that the customer has been correctly treated. 50. If the customer is unlikely to be making taxable supplies of goods and services within 28 days, any supplies of financial services to that customer should be treated as exempt. 14 Example – new bridal store The finance company provides a cash advance to a new client that is just starting up. The client is not yet registered for GST, and the owner is still completing feasibility studies as to whether the local community and surrounding population can support a new bridal store. The finance company treats the advance as an exempt supply because the bridal store owner noted on the finance application form that it was not registered for GST. The finance company advises the owner to contact it once they register for GST. Three months later, after outfitting a new premises and purchasing stock, the bridal store owner advises the finance company that it is registered for GST and is likely to be opening in two weeks’ time. The finance company may zero-rate the interest accruing on the advance from the date that it receives notice from the bridal store that it is registered for GST, as it reasonably expected that it will be making taxable supplies within the next 28 days. Households and unregistered persons 51. Supplies of financial services to households or unregistered persons (final consumers) cannot be zero-rated. In some instances, however, final consumers may be provided with financial products and services as part their association, either as the owner of a business or other relationship such as a client of a business customer. In these circumstances care must be taken that supplies of financial services to final consumers are not zero-rated and continue to be treated as exempt supplies. Example – loan for private purposes The local builder approaches the finance company to secure a loan to renovate and modify the family home. On the application form the builder gives her business bank account as the account into which the funds should be deposited. As the reasons specified for the loan relate to the private assets of the builder, the finance company cannot zero-rate the interest in respect of the loan. Deductions from output tax Paragraphs 63 to 75 set out Inland Revenue’s approved method for claiming input tax in relation to any taxable supplies made. Financial service providers that have elected to zero- rate supplies of financial services using the guidelines must comply with those paragraphs. Paragraphs 76 to 87 provide guidance on the application of section 20C. Overview 52. The effect of the zero-rating rules is to increase the extent to which providers are able to deduct input tax. This is in contrast to the previous broad exempt treatment of financial services that has applied since 1 October 1986, when GST first applied to goods and services supplied in New Zealand. Exemption means that GST is not charged, and providers are unable to claim input tax credits. 15 53. Under the GST Act the deduction of input tax depends on whether the goods and services on which GST was paid were acquired either principally or in part for making taxable supplies. Taxable supplies include zero-rated supplies. 54. Providers are generally able to claim a full input tax credit for GST paid on purchases provided it can be established that the purchased goods and services have been acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. If the purchase is not for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies some of the GST paid can be recovered using the change- in-use provisions to the extent that the purchase is applied for a purpose of making taxable supplies. 55. A further special deduction is allowed in respect of supplies of financial services made to other financial service providers (direct suppliers). This deduction is calculated using the formula in paragraph 76. 16 Evidential requirements 56. In the context of deducting input tax under these guidelines, providers must exercise reasonable diligence to determine the correctness of a GST return. Inland Revenue expects providers to hold tax invoices and any necessary calculations, samples and ratios that are used to support the deduction of input tax when apportioning input tax between taxable and non- taxable supplies. Principal purpose test 57. If the majority of a provider’s supplies are to qualifying GST-registered customers (over 50 percent) it will be able to deduct input tax on the basis that its principal purpose is that of making taxable supplies. The principal purpose test allows providers to claim 100 percent of the GST paid as an input tax credit on goods and services acquired in making those taxable supplies. Adjustments to input tax may still be required to the extent that there are non- taxable supplies. 58. If the provider’s principal purpose remains that of making exempt supplies, it will not be able to claim 100 percent of the GST paid as an input tax credit but may, instead, recover a proportion of the GST paid using the rules concerning adjustments for change in use. 16 Refer section 20C. 16 Adjustments for change in use 59. If a provider cannot deduct input tax using the principal purpose test, an adjustment may be permitted using the change-in-use provisions. 17 These provisions allow a deduction when goods and services acquired for the purpose of making non-taxable supplies are applied to making taxable supplies. The deduction allowed under these sections is proportionate to the use to which those goods and services are put. There are a number of adjustment methods by which input tax is allocated between taxable and non-taxable (including exempt) supplies 60. The methods of allocating input tax are: • Actual use: This method of allocation requires the taxpayer to attribute the use of the goods and services directly to the extent that they are used for a purpose of making taxable supplies. This method should be used in preference to others whenever possible. • Turnover method: This method is used in cases where the actual use method is too difficult to apply – for example, in the case of overhead expenses. The formula, as shown in the legislation, is: Total value of exempt supplies for taxable period Total value of all supplies for taxable period • An alternative (or special) method: This method is available, provided that the Commissioner approves it, if its use results in allocated amounts that are fair and reasonable in comparison with actual use. If providers are unable to allocate input tax on the basis of actual use they should use the special method described in paragraphs 63 to 75 rather than the turnover method. If a provider has been using a method that is approved by Inland Revenue and it produces a fair and reasonable result it may continue to use that method instead of the one recommended in these guidelines. 61. In all cases the method of allocation used must result in a fair and reasonable allocation of input tax between taxable and other supplies. 18 Note: Adjustments for change in use are not required if, in the next 12 months, the value of exempt financial services is the lesser of $90,000 or 5 percent of the total consideration of all supplies made for the period. 19 62. The amount of input tax that can be deducted in respect of any GST paid on goods and services used in making supplies of financial services is therefore determined by the following tests. 17 Refer sections 21E to 21G. 18 Refer section 21A(3). 19 Refer section 21(4). 17 Test Input tax that can be claimed Further adjustment required? The goods and services were acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies 100 percent of the GST paid. Yes, if those goods and services are applied for a purpose of making supplies of non-taxable goods and services The goods and services were directly attributed to specific taxable and non-taxable supplies The GST paid should be split according to actual use. Yes, if providers have made a one-off adjustment and the use of those goods and services changes by more than 20 percent. The goods and services were applied to many different taxable and non-taxable supplies The GST paid should be apportioned using the method specified in paragraphs 63 to 75. Yes, if the goods and services are capital items Valuing supplies of financial services and adjusting for changes in use 63. Providers that do not allocate input tax according to actual use will have to value their supplies of financial services for the purposes of allocating input tax between taxable and exempt supplies. These supplies will need to be valued every time an adjustment for any change in use is made. 64. Under the GST Act, providers may choose to calculate any adjustments for change in use either on the basis of every taxable period or each year. If the adjustment relates to goods that cost less than $18,000 providers may make a single one-off adjustment in the taxable period in which the goods are applied for making taxable supplies. 20 The objective – valuing financial intermediation services 65. The objective of valuing the supplies of financial services when adjusting for changes in use is to identify charges for financial intermediation rather than valuing the underlying financial instruments involved in the transaction. 21 This is because it is the value of the services that is being measured for GST purposes, not the value of the financial products. 66. It is therefore important when valuing financial intermediation services that providers do not include amounts received as a result of non-financial transactions and non-financial asset sales such as land, buildings, vehicles and equipment. A non-financial transaction is a supply of goods and services that is not included within the scope of the definition of “financial services” for GST purposes. 20 Refer section 21G. 21 Also see Case C-172/96, Commissioners of Customs and Excise v First National Bank of Chicago \[1998\], European Court of Justice, 14 July 1998. 18 67. Financial service providers price their intermediation services either by setting a specific, explicit fee or by setting a margin based on a proportion of a set figure, such as an interest rate or commission percentage (for example, 10% of funds managed) or a difference between rates or percentages (for example, a 2% charge, the difference between a lending rate of 6% and a borrowing rate of 4%). The value of any financial intermediation services supplied should be either the explicit fee charged or the net margin received. 68. If the turnover method is used to measure the value of intermediation services supplied over the period providers will need to value continually any debt or equity instruments supplied over the period. It may not be appropriate to use the turnover method to value intermediation services because it will increase the time required to calculate any necessary change-in-use adjustments. As an alternative, providers should use the method explained in paragraphs 69 to 75. This method is still based on a turnover methodology but uses the ratio of net income from taxable supplies to net income from total supplies to measure the value of any intermediation services made over the period. Special adjustment method using net margins and gross fees to value financial intermediation services 69. Inland Revenue will accept calculations using net margins and gross fees to value financial intermediation services when making adjustments for changes in use for GST paid on goods and services that are not otherwise directly attributed to taxable or exempt supplies. Example – value of supplies as a net margin Trust account 70. This special method of valuation requires providers to value the margin derived from interest income, net proceeds from transactions in securities and gross fees. It is not necessary to review loan balances continually or periodically value holdings in securities. 71. Services that are directly charged by way of transaction fees and commissions should be valued at their invoiced price or the gross amount recognised as income for financial reporting purposes. Interest received from advances $10,000 Interest paid to account holder $8,000 Net interest margin $2,000 19 Formula for valuing change-in-use adjustments using net margins and gross fees Total value of taxable supplies Total value of all supplies The total value of taxable supplies is calculated using: • net interest from transactions to businesses • net margins from exchange and derivatives transactions to businesses • gross fees and commissions from businesses that have been zero-rated • other net/margin revenue from businesses • standard-rated gross fees and commissions (supplies that are subject to GST at the rate of 12.5%) The total value of all supplies is calculated using: • all net interest • all net margins from exchange and derivative transactions • all gross fees and commissions • all other net/margin income • all standard-rated gross fees and commissions (supplies that are subject to GST at the rate of 12.5%) The information required to apply the formula should be able to be sourced from financial statements. Determining the margins from treasury transactions such as foreign exchange and derivative transactions to businesses may require sampling. Any sampling period will need to include the last day of a financial quarter (such as 31 March, 30 June, 30 September and 31 December), as this day is typically busier than others. Providers should contact Inland Revenue to ascertain whether sampling is appropriate to their circumstances. The reference to “business” means those registered persons that qualify to receive zero-rated supplies – meaning the business does not have more than an incidental activity of making exempt supplies (less than 25 percent of total turnover in a given 12-month period). Special transactions 72. When valuing supplies of financial services using net margins and gross fees some transactions may present special difficulties. Transactions with associated persons 73. For the majority of transactions, the value of any intermediation activity will be determined by the gross fee charged or the difference between the price paid for borrowing (otherwise known as “cost of funds”) and the price charged for lending. Special valuation rules 22 apply to financial services supplied to an “associated person”. 23 22 Refer to sections 10(3), 10(3A) and 10(3B). 23 Refer section 2A. = Input tax recovery ratio 20 Transaction Agreed value of supply under contract Must be valued at Supply to associated financial institutions Agreed value is less than market Agreed value Supply to associated financial institutions Agreed value is more than market Market value Supply to associated business customer Agreed value is less than market Agreed value Supply to associated business customer Agreed value is more than market Market value Supply to associated final consumer Agreed value is less than market Market value Supply to associated final consumer Agreed value is more than market Agreed value Net loss margin 74. At times, the net margin from a financial instrument will be a net loss – for example, when a financial instrument is realised at a loss or a movement in foreign exchange gives rise to a loss under a foreign exchange hedging contract. If this occurs, the margin should be treated as zero for the purposes of the valuation formula. Net treasury income 75. Most financial service providers will engage in transactions using reserves to derive income in addition to that received from any core intermediation activity. This is done as a means of reducing exposures to risk that may arise in respect of transactions with customers that are undertaken as part of that core activity. These transactions will involve other parties such as other financial service providers, businesses, and the government. The tax treatment of these transactions will depend on the status of the counterparty in terms of whether or it should be treated as a zero-rated or exempt supply of financial services. Such transaction should be valued for the purposes of the formula when financial contracts are closed or financial instruments are realised. The net realised amount is the value that should be included in the valuation formula. 21 Example of making change-in-use adjustments under these guidelines Adjusting for changes in use The finance company makes adjustments for changes in use every year in the taxable period after its end of financial year. The adjustments are based on the accounting reports prepared by the company for the financial year. Adjustments are required for both revenue and capital expenditure. Adjustment worksheet for the period 1/1/2006 to 31/12/2006 Income % taxable $’000 $’000 Interest received (exempt) 14,500 Less interest expense (exempt) 8,700 Net interest (exempt) 5,800 Interest received (taxable) 13,800 Less interest expense(taxable) 11,600 Net interest (taxable) 100% 2,200 Treasury income 7,100 Less Treasury expense 5,100 Net treasury income 80% 2,000 Commissions and fees (exempt) 5,400 Commissions and fees from advisory service 100% 2,820 Total income 18,220 Less provision for doubtful debts 220 Income after provisions 18,000 Operating expenses % taxable use Wages and salaries 7,850 Insurance 2,600 Rental 570 Consultants 100% 1,700 Phone 30 Travel 100% 44 Power 560 Depreciation 240 Agents’ commissions 40% 2,580 Total operating expenses 16,174 Operating surplus before taxation 1,826 Example – direct attribution Travel All travel expenses were incurred in relation to the finance company’s business clients and were acquired for the principal purpose of making zero-rated financial services. As the travel expenses could be directly attributed to making taxable supplies, the finance company deducted input tax in the taxable period in which those expenses were incurred. Consultants As part of providing an advisory service to its clients, the finance company contracted consultants when required. The cost of these consultants could be directly attributed to providing standard-rated advisory services, so the finance company deducted input tax on the consultants’ fees in the taxable period in which those expenses were incurred. Agents’ commissions The finance company directly attributes 40 percent of its agents’ commissions in respect of supplies of zero- rating financial services to its business clients. 22 Example – revenue adjustment The finance company is adjusting office overheads for the taxable supplies made over the year. Over the year the finance company has not deducted input tax in respect of overhead items because these costs have been acquired for the principal purpose of making non-taxable supplies. The company works out whether it is required to make an adjustment. • Exempt supplies for 12 months $11.6 million ($5.8 + $5.4 + 0.4 million) • Taxable supplies for 12 months $6.62 million ($2.2 + $2.82 + 1.6 million) • Total supplies for 12 months $18.22 million • 5 percent of total supplies $911,000 The value of the exempt supplies is more than 5 percent of total supplies and $90,000, so an adjustment is needed. Step 1 Work out the percentage of taxable use for the year. Total value of taxable supplies for period Total value of all supplies for period =% of total supplies that are taxable $6.62 million = 36 percent $18.22 million This is the percentage of taxable supplies Step 2 Add up expenses over the year on which GST has been paid. Call this amount E. The overheads to be adjusted for the year are: Insurance $2.6 million Rental $0.57 million Phone $0.03 million Power $0.56 million Total $3.76 million Step 3 Multiply E by the taxable percentage from step 1. $3.76 million x 36 percent is $1.3536 million Step 4 Divide this amount from step 3 by nine. This is the adjustment to show on the IR372 calculation sheet under “Goods and services used in making exempt supplies for annual or period-by-period adjustments”. Transfer the totals to Box 9 of the GST return. The adjustment the finance company shows on the IR372 calculation sheet is $150,400 ($1.3536 million/9). Example – capital adjustment In the same year, the finance company purchases a new office building to cater for new business. The cost of the new building is $8 million including GST. The building is reinforced concrete. As it is required to make adjustments in respect of its exempt supplies, the finance company will also have to make an adjustment for the new office building. Step 1 Work out the percentage of taxable use for the year. Total value of taxable supplies for period Total value of all supplies for period =% of total supplies that are taxable $6.62 million = 36 percent $18.22 million This is the percentage of taxable supplies Step 2 For the taxable period in question, take the lower of the cost or current market value of the goods to be adjustment for taxable supplies. Call this L. The lesser of the cost or open market value is $8,000,000. Step 3 Find out the straight-line depreciation rate for the asset. Call this S. The general straight line depreciation rate for reinforced concrete buildings is 3 percent. Step 4 LxS x percentage of taxable use from step 1 N N is the number of taxable periods each year. $8 million x 3 percent x 36 percent = 86,400 1 Step 5 Divide the amount from step 4 by nine. This is the adjustment to show on the IR372 calculation sheet under “Goods and services used in making exempt supplies for annual or period-by-period adjustments”. Transfer the total to box 9 of the GST return The adjustment the finance company shows on the IR372 calculation sheet is $9,600 ($86,400/9). 23 Effect on operating profit The adjustments for change in use, made in the first taxable period after 31 December 2006, have the following effect on the finance company’s operating surplus. Income after provisions 18,000 GST content Deductible input tax Revised expenses Operating expenses Wages and salaries - - 7,850 Insurance 288.9 104.0 2,496 Rental 63.3 22.8 547.2 Consultants 212.5 212.5 1,700 Phone 3.3 1.2 28.8 Travel 5.5 5.5 44 Power 62.2 22.4 537.6 Depreciation 26.6 9.6 230.4 Agents’ commissions 300.0 120.0 2,580 Total operating expenses 16,014 Operating surplus before taxation 1,986 Supplies between financial service providers Application 76. Financial services supplied to another financial service provider generally cannot be zero-rated under the zero-rating rules because most financial service providers will not satisfy the requirement that 75 percent of their supplies are taxable supplies. Instead, the GST Act provides a further deduction from output tax in relation to supplies of financial services made to another financial service provider (the direct supplier). The deduction relates only to exempt supplies of financial services made to the direct supplier and is limited to the extent that the direct supplier makes taxable supplies, including supplies of zero-rated financial services. The deduction is calculated according to a formula.24 Formula for calculating the deduction for supplies of exempt financial services to other financial service providers a x b x d c e Where: a is total GST that would be recoverable under section 20(3), other than under section 20(3)(h), in respect of the taxable period if all financial services supplied by the financial service provider were taxable supplies: b is the total value of exempt supplies of financial services made to the direct supplier in respect of the taxable period: c is the total value of supplies made in respect of the taxable period: d is the total value of taxable supplies made by the direct supplier in respect of the taxable period as determined under section 20D: e is the total value of supplies made by the direct supplier in respect of the taxable period as determined under section 20D. 24 Refer section 20C. 24 77. This proportional deduction from output tax is in addition to that which can be recovered as a deduction from output tax using the principal purpose test or by way of a change-in-use adjustment. 78. The proportion is found by multiplying two fractions. The first fraction is the proportion of the total value of supplies made by the provider that consists of exempt supplies of financial services to a recipient financial services provider (the direct supplier). The second fraction is the proportion of the total value of supplies made by the direct supplier that consists of taxable supplies (including zero-rated supplies of financial services). 79. The formula is limited to the activities of the direct supplier. Further supplies of financial services – for example, by the direct supplier to a third or subsequent financial services provider are not included in the formula. Information required from the direct supplier 80. The method used to determine the deduction is based on statistical information that is provided by the direct supplier in relation to its ratio of taxable supplies to total supplies (items d and e of the formula). 25 The presentation of this statistical information can be in the form of a percentage or fraction. 81. Providers must obtain the ratio from the direct supplier before making the deduction. If a ratio is not provided, the deduction cannot be claimed. Note: The GST Act does not require the direct supplier to provide this ratio. 82. If the direct supplier agrees to provide the necessary statistical information, the GST Act requires that the ratio must be current to each taxable period in which supplies of financial services are made. 26 This will require communication between the provider and the recipient of the financial service regarding the correct ratio to be applied to that taxable period. 83. If the direct supplier provides statistical information which, in the direct supplier’s opinion, represents its activities over the last 12 months, that ratio may be applied by the provider for a further 12 months. Accompanying the ratio must be a written statement from the direct supplier that the ratio is a fair reflection of its activities over the last 12 months, including the taxable period in which the ratio is first sought. A new ratio from the direct supplier must be sought at the end of those 12 months. 84. If providers receive notice from the direct supplier that its ratio is no longer considered appropriate providers must immediately cease using that ratio and seek an updated one. 25 Refer section 20D. 26 Refer section 20C. 25 Evidential requirements 85. In respect of claiming the deduction, it is expected that providers have written notice, or other permanent records, of the direct supplier’s ratio of taxable to total supplies. 27 This written notice can be in the form of an e-mail or letter. If the information is given by telephone, it must be followed up in writing for evidential purposes. The direct supplier must also state the period of time to which the ratio applies. Disclosing a direct supplier ratio 86. If providers choose to disclose their ratio of taxable to total supplies to other financial service providers, Inland Revenue expects, in addition to providing the ratio in writing, the provider to maintain a regularly updated database of those persons that have received that ratio. The database should also detail the date that ratio was disclosed and the period to which it applies. 87. If providers become aware that the disclosed ratio is materially incorrect they must notify those financial service providers on their database advising them to cease using the ratio until a new correct ratio is provided. Other matters Tax invoices 88. The GST Act requires that registered persons issue a tax invoice in relation to any taxable supplies made to another registered person, if requested. This obligation also applies in relation to zero-rated supplies. In the context of zero-rated financial services there is no practical purpose in requiring that tax invoices be issued in respect of such supplies. A tax invoice does not, therefore, need to be issued in relation to zero-rated financial services. 27 Refer items d/e as set out in section 20C.

The Taxation (GST, Trans-Tasman Imputation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003 amended the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act) to introduce a �reverse charge� mechanism to tax certain imports of services � for example, management, legal and accounting services, a new software installation (and after sales service) or products downloaded via the internet. 2. From 1 January 2005 GST-registered recipients of supplies of imported services are required to add GST to the price of the services and include the tax in the normal GST return and pay it to Inland Revenue if: the services would be subject to GST if supplied in New Zealand; and the recipient makes more than a minimal level of exempt or other non-taxable supplies. 3. The purpose of these guidelines is to explain how the reverse charge affects these supplies of imported services. New definitions 4. The following definitions have been included in the Act as part of the introduction of the reverse charge: �Goods� means all kinds of personal or real property, but does not include choses in action, money or a product that is transmitted by a non-resident to a resident by means of a wire, cable, radio, optical or other electromagnetic system or by means of a similar technical system. �Non-resident� means a person to the extent that the person is not resident in New Zealand. Application 5. These guidelines apply to a deemed supplier required to self-assess GST on the value of a supply of imported services. For the purposes of GST, a service is anything which is not goods or money. Any business which receives a supply of imported services, or any other person who receives a substantial supply of imported services, is potentially liable to pay GST on the supply. Supply of imported services 6. There is a supply of imported services in New Zealand if: the services are supplied by a non-resident supplier to a recipient who is a New Zealand resident; the services are acquired by a person who: � has not, in the 12-month period that ends with the month in which the supply is made, made supplies of which at least 95 percent in total are taxable supplies; and � does not, at the time of the supply, have reasonable grounds for believing that they will, in the 12-month period that begins with the month in which the supply is made, make supplies of which at least 95 percent in total are taxable supplies. the supply of the services would be a taxable supply if it were made in New Zealand by a registered person in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity; The 95 percent threshold is consistent with the 5 percent threshold over which change-in-use adjustments are required. Therefore any person who is not currently required to make change-in-use adjustments is not affected by the reverse charge. 7. Therefore supplies of services that would be exempt supplies if made in New Zealand, such as certain financial services, are not subject to the reverse charge. Also, services that would otherwise be subject to GST at 12.5% under the reverse charge can generally be zero-rated under section 11A if they would have been zero-rated had they been supplied in New Zealand. 8. A person required to pay GST under the reverse charge is treated as the supplier of the services for the following purposes: registration; payment of output tax; record keeping; and avoidance. 9. For all other GST purposes the person is the recipient of services.  Figure 1: Application of the reverse charge   Figure 2: Example of the operation of the reverse charge  Example 1: The operation of the reverse charge An offshore computer company makes a supply of programming services to a New Zealand life insurance company (see figure 1). The life insurance company makes solely exempt supplies of services. It is charged $1 million for the programming services, which it pays on receipt of the services. An invoice is provided after payment is made. The two companies are not associated persons. In this situation: The services are supplied by a non-resident supplier to a resident recipient. The services are acquired by a person who has not in the last 12 months made (and does not expect in the next 12 months to make) supplies of which at least 95 percent in total are taxable supplies. The supply of the services would be a taxable supply if it were made in New Zealand by a registered person in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity. The New Zealand insurer is required to register for GST, if it is not already registered. The New Zealand life insurer is required to account for GST on the value of the supply. The value of the supply is $1 million (the consideration for the supply), so the output tax is $125,000.  Figure 3: Example of when the reverse charge does not apply  Example 2: When the reverse charge does not apply An offshore computer company makes a supply of programming services to a GST-registered New Zealand retail company (see figure 2). The retail company makes a mix of 98 percent taxable supplies of goods and services and 2 percent exempt supplies of financial services, such as hire purchase, to non-registered consumers. It is charged $1 million for the programming services, which it pays on receipt of the services. An invoice is provided after payment is made. The two companies are not associated persons. In this situation: The services are supplied by a non-resident supplier to a resident recipient. The services are acquired by a person who has, in the last 12 months made (and does expect in the next 12 months to make) supplies of which at least 95 percent in total are taxable supplies. Therefore the supply is not subject to the reverse charge because the New Zealand retailer makes taxable supplies in excess of the 95 percent threshold. Registration requirements 10. Because imported services are treated as having been supplied by the recipient in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by the recipient, the value of imported services supplied to that person is included in the total value of supplies made by that person for the purposes of determining liability to register for GST under section 51. Although many businesses making supplies in New Zealand are currently registered for GST, the reverse charge may require others to register � in particular, any person importing services as a private consumer. 11. A person must register for GST if: the total value of supplies made in any month and the 11 preceding months exceeds $40,000, or the total value of supplies made in any month and the 11 following months exceeds $40,000. 12. Therefore a person who makes no other taxable supplies in New Zealand may be required to register as a result of importing in excess of $40,000 of services in any 12-month period. Persons who do make other taxable supplies but fall below the $40,000 threshold may be required to register if they import services which, together with other taxable supplies, exceed the threshold. Example 3: Requirement to register for GST � importing significant amount of services A wealthy retired businesswoman has commissioned the building of a substantial property on the outskirts of Auckland. She contracts Italian architects, designers and landscapers for the project. Plans and drawings are sent to her electronically. She is required to register for GST and pay output tax on the value of those services if they exceed $40,000. Example 4: Requirement to register for GST � registration threshold exceeded An unregistered business makes $39,000 of supplies that would be taxable if the business were GST-registered. It purchases an international franchise licence for $10,000. As the value of the supplies made by the business is now $49,000 the business is required to register for GST. 13. Further details on registration requirements are in the Inland Revenue booklet �GST � do you need to register� (IR 365), which can be obtained by phoning 0800 377 776. Related party transactions 14. Charges for services from an associated overseas business can relate to a specific service or be incorporated into a larger sum. This may be the case, for example, within a group of companies or single multi-national company, when the parent company or head office may allocate a proportion of its costs to the various parts of the enterprise or charge a management fee (referred to as �internal charges�). 15. The reverse charge applies to internal charges by treating them in the first instance as consideration for the supply of services. However, the reverse charge does not apply to any part of an internal charge that relates to salary or wages, interest and other exempt supplies. For the purposes of the reverse charge, the ordinary meaning of salary applies. In the Concise Oxford Dictionary �salary� means a �fixed regular payment made � by an employer to an employee�. 16. For the purposes of the reverse charge a New Zealand entity or presence must be treated as separate from its offshore presence in relation to the �imported services�. This means that: a New Zealand branch of a non-resident company must be treated as a separate entity; and supplies within a group of companies cannot be disregarded by applying the grouping rules. Example 5: Separate entities UK Co, a manufacturer/wholesale company, engages in an international advertising campaign. The campaign is developed and produced in the USA by a third party. The campaign, including advertising time around the world, costs $72 million. Nine million dollars of the cost is allocated and charged to New Zealand.       The subsidiary in New Zealand records the cost allocation as an imported service in its GST return and pays GST of $1.125 million to Inland Revenue. Example 6: Intra-group supplies Aus Co, a large retail operation with outlets throughout Australia and New Zealand, maintains a branch in New Zealand (in respect of the consumer finance operations of Aus Co�s operations in New Zealand). To reflect accurately the costs incurred in Australia in respect of providing backroom support, including the overall management of Aus Co�s financial division, to the New Zealand branch, Aus Co imposes an annual charge of $6 million on the New Zealand branch. Previously, this charge had been ignored for GST purposes. However, the New Zealand division is now required to record the amount of the annual charge as an imported service in its GST return. The GST that the New Zealand branch is required to pay to Inland Revenue is $75,000. Taxable value of related party services 17. The value of related party services subject to the reverse charge is reduced by the value of any salary or interest charges from any member of a non-resident company�s wholly owned group, or separate branches or divisions of the same company, that form part of an internal charge. Example 7: Related party transaction E is the offshore head office of a multinational company. F is the New Zealand branch of the multinational company. The companies supply financial services. E provides administrative, accounting and management services to F and to other branches in other countries. E recovers the cost of providing these services by making a cost allocation to each branch every year. F is debited with a cost allocation of $10 million. This covers administrative and management costs but, owing to the minor nature of the accounting costs for the New Zealand branch, F is not allocated any accounting costs, even though it is provided accounting services. Within the $10 million of administrative and management costs, there are the following cost components: Staff salaries: $5 million Financing (interest) costs: $1 million Administration costs: $1.5 million Management costs: $2.5 million Total cost allocation $10 million A cost allocation is treated as a supply of services by a non-resident to a resident that would be taxable in New Zealand. F acquired the services other than for the sole purpose of making taxable supplies. E and F are treated as separate entities carrying on activities. Components of a cost allocation that are attributable to salaries and interest incurred by E are excluded from the value of the cost allocation subject to the reverse charge. Therefore only $4 million of the cost allocation is subject to the reverse charge. The accounting services provided to F at no cost are a taxable supply acquired for non-taxable purposes. However, there is no uplift to market value, as the cost of the accounting services would have been allowed as a deduction for F under the Income Tax Act 1994 if it was a separate legal entity for the purposes of that Act. (See discussion of value of supply and example 13.) Therefore the amount subject to the reverse charge is: Staff salaries: 0 excluded Financing (interest) costs: 0 excluded Administration costs: $1.5 million Management costs: $2.5 million Accounting: 0 no market value uplift required Total subject to reverse charge: $4 million GST at 12.5% Total GST to be returned: $500,000 Mixed-use acquisitions 18. A recipient of services subject to the reverse charge may be able to claim under the general change-in-use adjustment rules either an input tax credit or change-in-use adjustments to reflect any taxable use of the imported services. 19. A person who has acquired imported services for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies is entitled to claim an input tax credit for the GST paid under the reverse charge. That person, however, is required to make a change-in-use adjustment and return additional output tax to the extent that the services were not acquired for the purpose of making taxable supplies. 20. A person who has not acquired imported services for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies is not entitled to an input tax credit for the GST paid under the reverse charge. That person may, however, under the change-in-use adjustment provisions, claim back the GST paid to the extent that the services were acquired for the purpose of making taxable supplies. 21. In either instance when input tax credits are available, a tax invoice is not required if the output tax on the relevant supply has been accounted for.  Figure 4: Application of the adjustment provisions  Example 8: Mixed-use acquisition � principally exempt An offshore computer company provides computer programming services to a GST-registered New Zealand life insurance company for $1 million (see figure 3). Using a turnover approach, the services are used 70 percent for making exempt supplies of life insurance, and 30 percent for making taxable supplies of general insurance. Under the reverse charge, the life insurance company is required, therefore, to add GST to the $1 million, giving a figure of $1.125 million, and include the GST of $125,000 imposed under the reverse charge in its GST return. The life insurance company is not entitled to an input tax credit in relation to the supply of the computer programming services because it has not acquired the services for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Because the life insurance company uses the services 30 percent for making taxable supplies, it is entitled to a change-in-use adjustment, and is able to make a period-by-period deduction during the term of the asset from its output tax liability. The life insurance company does not, however, include the $1.125 million as a supply it has made for the purposes of making the adjustment based on turnover. Example 9: Mixed-use acquisition � principally (but not 95 percent) taxable An offshore computer company provides computer programming services to a GST-registered New Zealand life insurance company for $1 million (see figure 3). Using a turnover approach, the services are used 70 percent for making taxable supplies and 30 percent for making exempt supplies. The reverse charge applies, as the services are acquired by a company which makes taxable supplies of less than 95 percent of total supplies. Under the reverse charge, the life insurance company is required to add GST to the $1 million, giving a figure of $1.125 million, and include the GST of $125,000 in its GST return. The company is, however, entitled to an input tax credit of $125,000 on the importation of the services, as they are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. It is then required to make an adjustment on a period-by-period basis for exempt supplies made using the services. Example 10: Mixed-use acquisition � principally (but not 95 percent) taxable A multinational company supplies a software package to its GST-registered New Zealand subsidiary for $1 million. Using a turnover approach, the services are used 70 percent for making taxable supplies and 30 percent for making exempt supplies. The reverse charge applies, as the services are acquired by a company which makes taxable supplies of less than 95 percent of total supplies. Under the reverse charge, the subsidiary is required to add GST to the $1 million, giving a figure of $1.125 million, and include the GST of $125,000 in its GST return. The subsidiary is, however, entitled to an input tax credit of $125,000, as the software was acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. It has the option to make a one-off or period-by-period adjustment to reflect the extent of the exempt use of the software. Zero-rating services consumed wholly outside New Zealand 22. The reverse charge applies only to services that cannot be regarded as being wholly consumed outside New Zealand. Services can be zero-rated if they are physically performed outside New Zealand and they can be physically received only at the time and place at which they are physically performed. However, services which are intangible in nature, such as the provision of a legal opinion or feasibility study offshore, cannot be zero-rated because such services cannot be regarded as necessarily wholly consumed offshore. Example 11: Zero-rating under the reverse charge A GST-registered New Zealand life insurance company sends an employee to Sydney to obtain a legal opinion from an Australian law firm in relation to a proposed transaction and pays for the employee�s accommodation in a Sydney hotel. The life insurance company makes predominantly exempt supplies of services. The life insurance company is charged $1 million for the legal services, which it pays on receipt of the services. An invoice is provided after payment is made. The life insurance company is charged $500 for the accommodation services, which the employee pays for using a business credit card. The life insurance company is not an associated person of either the law firm or hotel. In this situation: The legal and the hotel services are supplied by a non-resident supplier to a resident recipient. The legal and hotel services are acquired by a person who makes predominantly (more than 95 percent) exempt supplies. The supply of the legal and hotel services would be a taxable supply if it were made in New Zealand by a registered person in the course or furtherance of the person�s taxable activity. The supplies are subject to the reverse charge. However, the supply of imported services may be zero-rated if the services are physically performed outside New Zealand and the nature of those services is such that they can be physically received only at the time and place at which the services are physically performed. Although it is arguable whether the supply of legal services is �physically received� when the employee receives the opinion, the nature of the legal services means that they could be physically received other than at the time and place at which they are physically performed. The New Zealand life insurer can receive the opinion at any time and place (including New Zealand). The supply of legal services cannot, therefore, be zero-rated and is subject to GST at 12.5% under the reverse charge, requiring the New Zealand life insurer to return $125,000. The hotel accommodation services, on the other hand, can only ever be physically received where they are performed. Therefore these services can be zero-rated and the New Zealand life insurer is not required to return GST on the supply. Time of supply rules 23. The normal time of supply rules generally apply for the purposes of the reverse charge. This means that the time of supply for the reverse charge is the earlier of when an invoice is issued or payment is made in respect of the supply. If the supply is between associated persons, there may be supplies for which no invoice is issued, or payment is made only at, say, year end (for example, head office charges). To cater for these circumstances, the time of supply test for supplies between associated persons has been amended to allow the test not to be applied until the end of the taxable period that includes the date which is two months after the recipient�s balance date for the year in which the services were performed. 24. The time of supply for a supply of services between associated parties subject to the reverse charge is, therefore, the earliest of: when an invoice is issued; when payment is made in respect of the supply; or the end of the taxable period that includes the date which is two months after the recipient�s balance date for the year in which the services were performed. 25. In the case of services supplied under an agreement which provides for periodic payments, the services are treated as being successively supplied, with each supply taking place when a payment becomes due or is received, whichever is the earlier. Example 12: Time of supply A (offshore parent company) and B (New Zealand subsidiary) are parts of a multinational group. Throughout a year (monthly) A supplies B with administrative and accounting services. B is registered for GST, accounts for GST on a two-monthly taxable period basis and makes solely exempt supplies. B is not charged for these services until after the end of each year, when a lump sum is charged for administrative and accounting services provided by the parent company to all members of the multinational group. The supply of services is subject to the reverse charge as it is a supply that would be taxable in New Zealand and it is acquired by a business which makes taxable supplies amounting to less than 95 percent of total supplies. B�s balance date is 30 June, and the end of the taxable period that includes the date that is two months after B�s balance date is 31 August. The time of supply for the services is either: Invoice: If A provides B with invoices/an invoice for the services provided before either payment is made or 31 August, the time of supply for the service/services is when the invoice is issued. Payment: If B makes payment for the services before either the issue of invoices/an invoice for the supply/supplies or 31 August, the time of supply is when the payment/payments are made. Taxable period following balance date: If neither an invoice is issued, nor payment made, before 31 August, then the time of supply is 31 August. The supply is therefore required to be included in B�s GST return, due on 30 September. Transitional provisions 26. Special time of supply rules apply when a supply of imported services spans the introduction of the reverse charge. They are based on the transitional provision which applied on the introduction of GST to address situations when tax would be either chargeable on supplies received before the introduction date of GST, or would not be chargeable on supplies received after the introduction date of GST. 27. The new rules provide that a supply of services occurs at the time the services are performed and they are treated as being performed continuously and uniformly during the whole of that period or those periods over which the services are performed. 28. To the extent that services are treated as being supplied before the reverse charge came into effect, the services are not subject to GST. To the extent that services are treated as being supplied on or after the reverse charge came into effect, they are subject to GST, even if they were invoiced or paid for before the reverse charge came into effect. Value of supply 29. The value of a supply subject to the reverse charge is equal to the consideration for the supply. This ensures that the supply is GST-exclusive in the same way as for imported goods. 30. Applying the normal rules for supplies between associated persons would mean that the value of the supply would be either the actual consideration or the open market value of the supply. 31. To minimise compliance costs, however, the cost basis for valuing supplies between associated parties applies in the following circumstances: if the payment for those services is allowed as a deduction to the recipient; or if the supply is between separate branches or divisions of the same company and the payment for those services would be an allowable deduction to the recipient if it was a separate entity for income tax purposes. Example 13: Value of supply of services As part of an international advertising campaign for a multinational group C (an offshore parent company) supplies D (a GST-registered New Zealand subsidiary that makes predominantly exempt supplies) with advertising services. As the advertising services are for a multinational group and most of the costs are absorbed and incurred in other countries in which the company operates, the New Zealand branch is not charged for the services, either explicitly or by way of a cost allocation from the head office. The supply of services is subject to the reverse charge as it is a supply that would be taxable in New Zealand and it is acquired other than for solely taxable purposes. Prima facie, as C and D are associated persons, D would have to calculate the market value of the services it has received. However, an uplift in the value of supply to market value is not required, as the cost of the advertising services would have been a deduction for company D under the Income Tax Act 1994. The value of the supply is therefore zero, and GST at 12.5% on this results in a zero amount. Example 14: Value of supply of intangible property C electronically supplies a software licence to D for $200,000. The licence is treated as a supply of services, and the supply is subject to the reverse charge as it would be taxable in New Zealand and is acquired other than for solely taxable purposes. Prima facie, as C and D are associated persons, D would have to calculate the market value of the services it has received. However, an uplift in the value of supply to market value is not required, as the cost of the software licence would have been allowed as a depreciation deduction for D under the Income Tax Act 1994. The value of the supply is therefore $200,000, and GST at 12.5% on this is $25,000. Documentation requirements 32. A recipient of a supply of imported services subject to the reverse charge is required to maintain sufficient records to establish the correct value on which GST should be charged. The following information is required for this purpose: the name and address of the supplier; the date on which, or the period during which, the supply was received; a description of the services supplied; the consideration for the supply; the time by which payment of the consideration for the supply is due; and the amount of the consideration for a supply that the taxpayer has treated as not affecting the value of the supply under section 10(15C)(a) and (b) (that is, salary and interest). 33. An invoice or other supporting documentation, such as a supply contract or record of payments made, may substantiate the valuations adopted for the purposes of the reverse charge. 34. An invoice is not required in order to claim input tax credits for output tax paid on the supply of imported services. 35. Specific information from the related head office or related entity is needed to ascertain the correct value of staff salaries and interest to be excluded from internal charges subject to the reverse charge. Internal charges between associated persons 36. Charges for services supplied between associated persons are valued at cost if payment is allowed as a deduction. In other circumstances, the value of the supply is its market value. In determining market value, the Commissioner will accept charges calculated and evaluated in accordance with the income tax transfer pricing guidelines. 37. There is no explicit statutory requirement to prepare and maintain transfer pricing documentation, but it should be adequate to ensure that a person is able to demonstrate readily to Inland Revenue that its transfer prices are consistent with the arm�s length principle in section GD 13 of the Income Tax Act. The arm�s length charge is one that is consistent with what would have been charged and accepted in a transaction between independent enterprises in comparable circumstances. 38. Even so, taxpayers are not expected to prepare levels of documentation that are disproportionate to the amount of tax revenue at risk in their transfer pricing transactions. The cost of preparing documentation should be weighed against the risk that Inland Revenue will make a transfer pricing adjustment. 39. Inland Revenue would expect to see, at a minimum, the following documentation: an identification of the cross-border transactions for which the taxpayer has a transfer pricing exposure; a broad functional analysis of the taxpayer�s operations, to identify the critical functions being performed; an estimation of the business risk of not undertaking and documenting a more detailed transfer pricing analysis; an estimation of the costs of complying with the transfer pricing rules. 40. A taxpayer should also, as far as practicable, seek to collect and retain documentation that is: existing at the time the taxpayer was developing or implementing any arrangement that might raise transfer pricing issues, or brought into existence close to the time the transaction occurs. 41. Such documentation might include books, records, studies, analyses, conclusions and any other written or electronic material recording information that may be relevant in the determination of transfer prices. 42. The transfer pricing guidelines are appended to Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 10 (October 2000). This document is also available on the internet.

Draft GST guidelines for recipients of imported services August 2004 Prepared by the Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department for consultation with affected taxpayers First published in August 2004 by the Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department, P O Box 2198, Wellington. Draft GST guidelines for recipients of imported services. ISBN 0-478-27116-6 Foreword These draft guidelines on the operation of the new legislation have been prepared for purposes of consultation with affected taxpayers. Comments on the general application and practicality of the guidelines are particularly welcome. Final guidelines are expected to be available in October 2004. Submissions should be made by 3 September 2004 and should contain a brief summary of the main points and recommendations. Submissions received by the due date will be acknowledged. Submissions may be made in electronic form to: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz Please put “GST guidelines” in the subject line for electronic submissions. Alternatively, submissions may be addressed to: GST guidelines C/- General Manager Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON Please note that submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. If you consider that there is any part of your submission that could be properly withheld under the Act, please indicate this clearly in your submission. Contents Purpose of the guidelines 1 New definitions 1 Application 1 Supply of imported services 2 Registration requirements 5 Related party transactions 6 Taxable value of related party services 7 Mixed-use acquisitions 8 Zero-rating services consumed wholly outside New Zealand 10 Time of supply rules 11 Transitional provisions 12 Value of supply 12 Documentation requirements 13 Internal charges between associated persons 14 1 Purpose of the guidelines 1. The Taxation (GST, Trans-Tasman Imputation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003 amended the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act) to introduce a “reverse charge” mechanism to tax certain imports of services – for example, management, legal and accounting services, a new software installation (and after sales service) or products downloaded via the internet. 2. From 1 January 2005 GST-registered recipients of supplies of imported services are required to add GST to the price of the services and include the tax in the normal GST return and pay it to Inland Revenue if: • the services would be subject to GST if supplied in New Zealand; and • the recipient makes more than a minimal level of exempt or other non-taxable supplies. 3. The purpose of these guidelines is to explain how the reverse charge affects these supplies of imported services. New definitions 4. The following definitions have been included in the Act as part of the introduction of the reverse charge: • “Goods” means all kinds of personal or real property, but does not include choses in action, money or a product that is transmitted by a non-resident to a resident by means of a wire, cable, radio, optical or other electromagnetic system or by means of a similar technical system. • “Non-resident” means a person to the extent that the person is not resident in New Zealand. Application 5. These guidelines apply to a deemed supplier required to self-assess GST on the value of a supply of imported services. For the purposes of GST, a service is anything which is not goods or money. Any business which receives a supply of imported services, or any other person who receives a substantial supply of imported services, is potentially liable to pay GST on the supply. 2 Supply of imported services 6. There is a supply of imported services in New Zealand if: • the services are supplied by a non-resident supplier to a recipient who is a New Zealand resident; • the services are acquired by a person who: – has not, in the 12-month period that ends with the month in which the supply is made, made supplies of which at least 95 percent in total are taxable supplies; and – does not, at the time of the supply, have reasonable grounds for believing that they will, in the 12-month period that begins with the month in which the supply is made, make supplies of which at least 95 percent in total are taxable supplies. • the supply of the services would be a taxable supply if it were made in New Zealand by a registered person in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity; 1 The 95 percent threshold is consistent with the 5 percent threshold over which change- in-use adjustments are required. Therefore any person who is not currently required to make change-in-use adjustments is not affected by the reverse charge. 7. Therefore supplies of services that would be exempt supplies if made in New Zealand, such as certain financial services, are not subject to the reverse charge. Also, services that would otherwise be subject to GST at 12.5% under the reverse charge can generally be zero- rated under section 11A if they would have been zero-rated had they been supplied in New Zealand. 8. A person required to pay GST under the reverse charge is treated as the supplier of the services for the following purposes: • registration; • payment of output tax; • record keeping; and • avoidance. 9. For all other GST purposes the person is the recipient of services. 1 See section 8(4B) of the Act. 3 F IGURE 1: Application of the reverse charge Supply from non- resident to resident?

The life insurance company makes solely exempt supplies of services. It is charged $1 million for the programming services, which it pays on receipt of the services. An invoice is provided after payment is made. The two companies are not associated persons. In this situation: • The services are supplied by a non-resident supplier to a resident recipient. • The services are acquired by a person who has not in the last 12 months made (and does not expect in the next 12 months to make) supplies of which at least 95 percent in total are taxable supplies. • The supply of the services would be a taxable supply if it were made in New Zealand by a registered person in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity. The New Zealand insurer is required to register for GST, if it is not already registered. The New Zealand life insurer is required to account for GST on the value of the supply. The value of the supply is $1 million (the consideration for the supply), so the output tax is $125,000. FIGURE 3: Example of when the reverse charge does not apply Offshore Computer Company NZ Retail Company NZ$1 million Computer Programming Services New ZealandOffshore Supplies of goods and services - taxable Supplies to non- businesses of financial services - exempt Example 2: When the reverse charge does not apply An offshore computer company makes a supply of programming services to a GST-registered New Zealand retail company (see figure 2). The retail company makes a mix of 98 percent taxable supplies of goods and services and 2 percent exempt supplies of financial services, such as hire purchase, to non-registered consumers. It is charged $1 million for the programming services, which it pays on receipt of the services. An invoice is provided after payment is made. The two companies are not associated persons. In this situation: • The services are supplied by a non-resident supplier to a resident recipient. • The services are acquired by a person who has, in the last 12 months made (and does expect in the next 12 months to make) supplies of which at least 95 percent in total are taxable supplies. Therefore the supply is not subject to the reverse charge because the New Zealand retailer makes taxable supplies in excess of the 95 percent threshold. 5 Registration requirements 10. Because imported services are treated as having been supplied by the recipient in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by the recipient, the value of imported services supplied to that person is included in the total value of supplies made by that person for the purposes of determining liability to register for GST under section 51. Although many businesses making supplies in New Zealand are currently registered for GST, the reverse charge may require others to register – in particular, any person importing services as a private consumer. 11. A person must register for GST if: • the total value of supplies made in any month and the 11 preceding months exceeds $40,000, or • the total value of supplies made in any month and the 11 following months exceeds $40,000. 12. Therefore a person who makes no other taxable supplies in New Zealand may be required to register as a result of importing in excess of $40,000 of services in any 12-month period. Persons who do make other taxable supplies but fall below the $40,000 threshold may be required to register if they import services which, together with other taxable supplies, exceed the threshold. Example 3: Requirement to register for GST – importing significant amount of services A wealthy retired businesswoman has commissioned the building of a substantial property on the outskirts of Auckland. She contracts Italian architects, designers and landscapers for the project. Plans and drawings are sent to her electronically. She is required to register for GST and pay output tax on the value of those services if they exceed $40,000. Example 4: Requirement to register for GST – registration threshold exceeded An unregistered business makes $39,000 of supplies that would be taxable if the business were GST-registered. It purchases an international franchise licence for $10,000. As the value of the supplies made by the business is now $49,000 the business is required to register for GST. 13. Further details on registration requirements are in the Inland Revenue booklet “GST – do you need to register” (IR 365), which can be obtained by phoning 0800 377 776. 6 Related party transactions 14. Charges for services from an associated overseas business can relate to a specific service or be incorporated into a larger sum. This may be the case, for example, within a group of companies or single multi-national company, when the parent company or head office may allocate a proportion of its costs to the various parts of the enterprise or charge a management fee (referred to as “internal charges”). 15. The reverse charge applies to internal charges by treating them in the first instance as consideration for the supply of services. 2 However, the reverse charge does not apply to any part of an internal charge that relates to salary or wages, interest 3 and other exempt supplies. 4 For the purposes of the reverse charge, the ordinary meaning of salary applies. In the Concise Oxford Dictionary “salary” means a “fixed regular payment made ... by an employer to an employee”. 16. For the purposes of the reverse charge a New Zealand entity or presence must be treated as separate from its offshore presence in relation to the “imported services”. This means that: a New Zealand branch of a non-resident company must be treated as a separate entity; and supplies within a group of companies cannot be disregarded by applying the grouping rules. Example 5: Separate entities UK Co, a manufacturer/wholesale company, engages in an international advertising campaign. The campaign is developed and produced in the USA by a third party. The campaign, including advertising time around the world, costs $72 million. Nine million dollars of the cost is allocated and charged to New Zealand. The subsidiary in New Zealand records the cost allocation as an imported service in its GST return and pays GST of $1.125 million to Inland Revenue. 2 See section 8(4C). 3 See section 10(15C). 4 See section 8(4B)(c). US PR COMPANY UK Co (Parent) UK(NZ) Co (Wholly owned Sub.) Services £ 7 Example 6: Intra-group supplies Aus Co, a large retail operation with outlets throughout Australia and New Zealand, maintains a branch in New Zealand (in respect of the consumer finance operations of Aus Co’s operations in New Zealand). To reflect accurately the costs incurred in Australia in respect of providing backroom support, including the overall management of Aus Co’s financial division, to the New Zealand branch, Aus Co imposes an annual charge of $6 million on the New Zealand branch. Previously, this charge had been ignored for GST purposes. However, the New Zealand division is now required to record the amount of the annual charge as an imported service in its GST return. The GST that the New Zealand branch is required to pay to Inland Revenue is $75,000. Taxable value of related party services 17. The value of related party services subject to the reverse charge is reduced by the value of any salary or interest charges from any member of a non-resident company’s wholly owned group, 5 or separate branches or divisions of the same company, that form part of an internal charge. Example 7: Related party transaction E is the offshore head office of a multinational company. F is the New Zealand branch of the multinational company. The companies supply financial services. E provides administrative, accounting and management services to F and to other branches in other countries. E recovers the cost of providing these services by making a cost allocation to each branch every year. F is debited with a cost allocation of $10 million. This covers administrative and management costs but, owing to the minor nature of the accounting costs for the New Zealand branch, F is not allocated any accounting costs, even though it is provided accounting services. Within the $10 million of administrative and management costs, there are the following cost components: Staff salaries: $5 million Financing (interest) costs: $1 million Administration costs: $1.5 million Management costs: $2.5 million Total cost allocation $10 million A cost allocation is treated as a supply of services by a non-resident to a resident that would be taxable in New Zealand. F acquired the services other than for the sole purpose of making taxable supplies. E and F are treated as separate entities carrying on activities. Components of a cost allocation that are attributable to salaries and interest incurred by E are excluded from the value of the cost allocation subject to the reverse charge. Therefore only $4 million of the cost allocation is subject to the reverse charge. The accounting services provided to F at no cost are a taxable supply acquired for non-taxable purposes. However, there is no uplift to market value, as the cost of the accounting services would have been allowed as a deduction for F under the Income Tax Act 1994 if it was a separate legal entity for the purposes of that Act. (See discussion of value of supply and example 13.) 5 See section IG 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. 8 Therefore the amount subject to the reverse charge is: Staff salaries: 0 excluded Financing (interest) costs: 0 excluded Administration costs: $1.5 million Management costs: $2.5 million Accounting: 0 no market value uplift required Total subject to reverse charge: $4 million GST at 12.5% Total GST to be returned: $500,000 Mixed-use acquisitions 18. A recipient of services subject to the reverse charge may be able to claim under the general change-in-use adjustment rules either an input tax credit or change-in-use adjustments 6 to reflect any taxable use of the imported services. 19. A person who has acquired imported services for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies is entitled to claim an input tax credit for the GST paid under the reverse charge. That person, however, is required to make a change-in-use adjustment and return additional output tax to the extent that the services were not acquired for the purpose of making taxable supplies. 20. A person who has not acquired imported services for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies is not entitled to an input tax credit for the GST paid under the reverse charge. That person may, however, under the change-in-use adjustment provisions, claim back the GST paid to the extent that the services were acquired for the purpose of making taxable supplies. 21. In either instance when input tax credits are available, a tax invoice is not required if the output tax on the relevant supply has been accounted for. F IGURE 4: Application of the adjustment provisions Offshore Computer Company NZ Insurance Company NZ$1 million NZ Inland Revenue Computer Programming Services New ZealandOffshore NZ$125,000 GST Supplies of general insurance - taxable Supplies to non- businesses of life insurance - exempt 6 Either one off or on-going. 9 Example 8: Mixed-use acquisition – principally exempt An offshore computer company provides computer programming services to a GST-registered New Zealand life insurance company for $1 million (see figure 3). Using a turnover approach, the services are used 70 percent for making exempt supplies of life insurance, and 30 percent for making taxable supplies of general insurance. Under the reverse charge, the life insurance company is required, therefore, to add GST to the $1 million, giving a figure of $1.125 million, and include the GST of $125,000 imposed under the reverse charge in its GST return. The life insurance company is not entitled to an input tax credit in relation to the supply of the computer programming services because it has not acquired the services for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Because the life insurance company uses the services 30 percent for making taxable supplies, it is entitled to a change-in-use adjustment, and is able to make a period-by-period deduction during the term of the asset from its output tax liability. The life insurance company does not, however, include the $1.125 million as a supply it has made for the purposes of making the adjustment based on turnover. Example 9: Mixed-use acquisition – principally (but not 95 percent) taxable An offshore computer company provides computer programming services to a GST-registered New Zealand life insurance company for $1 million (see figure 3). Using a turnover approach, the services are used 70 percent for making taxable supplies and 30 percent for making exempt supplies. The reverse charge applies, as the services are acquired by a company which makes taxable supplies of less than 95 percent of total supplies. Under the reverse charge, the life insurance company is required to add GST to the $1 million, giving a figure of $1.125 million, and include the GST of $125,000 in its GST return. The company is, however, entitled to an input tax credit of $125,000 on the importation of the services, as they are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. It is then required to make an adjustment on a period-by-period basis for exempt supplies made using the services. Example 10: Mixed-use acquisition – principally (but not 95 percent) taxable A multinational company supplies a software package to its GST-registered New Zealand subsidiary for $1 million. Using a turnover approach, the services are used 70 percent for making taxable supplies and 30 percent for making exempt supplies. The reverse charge applies, as the services are acquired by a company which makes taxable supplies of less than 95 percent of total supplies. Under the reverse charge, the subsidiary is required to add GST to the $1 million, giving a figure of $1.125 million, and include the GST of $125,000 in its GST return. The subsidiary is, however, entitled to an input tax credit of $125,000, as the software was acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. It has the option to make a one-off or period-by-period adjustment to reflect the extent of the exempt use of the software. 10 Zero-rating services consumed wholly outside New Zealand 22. The reverse charge applies only to services that cannot be regarded as being wholly consumed outside New Zealand. Services can be zero-rated if they are physically performed outside New Zealand and they can be physically received only at the time and place at which they are physically performed. However, services which are intangible in nature, such as the provision of a legal opinion or feasibility study offshore, cannot be zero-rated because such services cannot be regarded as necessarily wholly consumed offshore. Example 11: Zero-rating under the reverse charge A GST-registered New Zealand life insurance company sends an employee to Sydney to obtain a legal opinion from an Australian law firm in relation to a proposed transaction and pays for the employee’s accommodation in a Sydney hotel. The life insurance company makes predominantly exempt supplies of services. The life insurance company is charged $1 million for the legal services, which it pays on receipt of the services. An invoice is provided after payment is made. The life insurance company is charged $500 for the accommodation services, which the employee pays for using a business credit card. The life insurance company is not an associated person of either the law firm or hotel. In this situation: • The legal and the hotel services are supplied by a non-resident supplier to a resident recipient. • The legal and hotel services are acquired by a person who makes predominantly (more than 95 percent) exempt supplies. • The supply of the legal and hotel services would be a taxable supply if it were made in New Zealand by a registered person in the course or furtherance of the person’s taxable activity. The supplies are subject to the reverse charge. However, the supply of imported services may be zero-rated if the services are physically performed outside New Zealand and the nature of those services is such that they can be physically received only at the time and place at which the services are physically performed. Although it is arguable whether the supply of legal services is “physically received” when the employee receives the opinion, the nature of the legal services means that they could be physically received other than at the time and place at which they are physically performed. The New Zealand life insurer can receive the opinion at any time and place (including New Zealand). The supply of legal services cannot, therefore, be zero-rated and is subject to GST at 12.5% under the reverse charge, requiring the New Zealand life insurer to return $125,000. The hotel accommodation services, on the other hand, can only ever be physically received where they are performed. Therefore these services can be zero-rated and the New Zealand life insurer is not required to return GST on the supply. 11 Time of supply rules 23. The normal time of supply rules generally apply for the purposes of the reverse charge. This means that the time of supply for the reverse charge is the earlier of when an invoice is issued or payment is made in respect of the supply. If the supply is between associated persons, there may be supplies for which no invoice is issued, or payment is made only at, say, year end (for example, head office charges). To cater for these circumstances, the time of supply test for supplies between associated persons has been amended to allow the test not to be applied until the end of the taxable period that includes the date which is two months after the recipient’s balance date for the year in which the services were performed. 24. The time of supply for a supply of services between associated parties subject to the reverse charge is, therefore, the earliest of: • when an invoice is issued; • when payment is made in respect of the supply; or • the end of the taxable period that includes the date which is two months after the recipient’s balance date for the year in which the services were performed. 25. In the case of services supplied under an agreement which provides for periodic payments, the services are treated as being successively supplied, with each supply taking place when a payment becomes due or is received, whichever is the earlier. Example 12: Time of supply A (offshore parent company) and B (New Zealand subsidiary) are parts of a multinational group. Throughout a year (monthly) A supplies B with administrative and accounting services. B is registered for GST, accounts for GST on a two-monthly taxable period basis and makes solely exempt supplies. B is not charged for these services until after the end of each year, when a lump sum is charged for administrative and accounting services provided by the parent company to all members of the multinational group. The supply of services is subject to the reverse charge as it is a supply that would be taxable in New Zealand and it is acquired by a business which makes taxable supplies amounting to less than 95 percent of total supplies. B’s balance date is 30 June, and the end of the taxable period that includes the date that is two months after B’s balance date is 31 August. The time of supply for the services is either: Invoice: If A provides B with invoices/an invoice for the services provided before either payment is made or 31 August, the time of supply for the service/services is when the invoice is issued. Payment: If B makes payment for the services before either the issue of invoices/an invoice for the supply/supplies or 31 August, the time of supply is when the payment/payments are made. Taxable period following balance date: If neither an invoice is issued, nor payment made, before 31 August, then the time of supply is 31 August. The supply is therefore required to be included in B’s GST return, due on 30 September. 12 Transitional provisions 26. Special time of supply rules 7 apply when a supply of imported services spans the introduction of the reverse charge. They are based on the transitional provision which applied on the introduction of GST to address situations when tax would be either chargeable on supplies received before the introduction date of GST, or would not be chargeable on supplies received after the introduction date of GST. 27. The new rules provide that a supply of services occurs at the time the services are performed and they are treated as being performed continuously and uniformly during the whole of that period or those periods over which the services are performed. 28. To the extent that services are treated as being supplied before the reverse charge came into effect, the services are not subject to GST. To the extent that services are treated as being supplied on or after the reverse charge came into effect, they are subject to GST, even if they were invoiced or paid for before the reverse charge came into effect. Value of supply 29. The value of a supply subject to the reverse charge is equal to the consideration for the supply. This ensures that the supply is GST-exclusive in the same way as for imported goods. 30. Applying the normal rules for supplies between associated persons would mean that the value of the supply would be either the actual consideration or the open market value of the supply. 31. To minimise compliance costs, however, the cost basis for valuing supplies between associated parties applies in the following circumstances: • if the payment for those services is allowed as a deduction to the recipient; or • if the supply is between separate branches or divisions of the same company and the payment for those services would be an allowable deduction to the recipient if it was a separate entity for income tax purposes. 7 See section 84B. 13 Example 13: Value of supply of services As part of an international advertising campaign for a multinational group C (an offshore parent company) supplies D (a GST-registered New Zealand subsidiary that makes predominantly exempt supplies) with advertising services. As the advertising services are for a multinational group and most of the costs are absorbed and incurred in other countries in which the company operates, the New Zealand branch is not charged for the services, either explicitly or by way of a cost allocation from the head office. The supply of services is subject to the reverse charge as it is a supply that would be taxable in New Zealand and it is acquired other than for solely taxable purposes. Prima facie, as C and D are associated persons, D would have to calculate the market value of the services it has received. However, an uplift in the value of supply to market value is not required, as the cost of the advertising services would have been a deduction for company D under the Income Tax Act 1994. The value of the supply is therefore zero, and GST at 12.5% on this results in a zero amount. Example 14: Value of supply of intangible property C electronically supplies a software licence to D for $200,000. The licence is treated as a supply of services, and the supply is subject to the reverse charge as it would be taxable in New Zealand and is acquired other than for solely taxable purposes. Prima facie, as C and D are associated persons, D would have to calculate the market value of the services it has received. However, an uplift in the value of supply to market value is not required, as the cost of the software licence would have been allowed as a depreciation deduction for D under the Income Tax Act 1994. The value of the supply is therefore $200,000, and GST at 12.5% on this is $25,000. Documentation requirements 32. A recipient of a supply of imported services subject to the reverse charge is required to maintain sufficient records to establish the correct value on which GST should be charged. The following information is required for this purpose: • the name and address of the supplier; • the date on which, or the period during which, the supply was received; • a description of the services supplied; • the consideration for the supply; • the time by which payment of the consideration for the supply is due; and • the amount of the consideration for a supply that the taxpayer has treated as not affecting the value of the supply under section 10(15C)(a) and (b) (that is, salary and interest). 8 33. An invoice or other supporting documentation, such as a supply contract or record of payments made, may substantiate the valuations adopted for the purposes of the reverse charge. 8 See section 24B. 14 34. An invoice is not required in order to claim input tax credits for output tax paid on the supply of imported services. 9 35. Specific information from the related head office or related entity is needed to ascertain the correct value of staff salaries and interest to be excluded from internal charges subject to the reverse charge. Internal charges between associated persons 36. Charges for services supplied between associated persons are valued at cost if payment is allowed as a deduction. In other circumstances, the value of the supply is its market value. In determining market value, the Commissioner will accept charges calculated and evaluated in accordance with the income tax transfer pricing guidelines. 37. There is no explicit statutory requirement to prepare and maintain transfer pricing documentation, but it should be adequate to ensure that a person is able to demonstrate readily to Inland Revenue that its transfer prices are consistent with the arm’s length principle in section GD 13 of the Income Tax Act. The arm’s length charge is one that is consistent with what would have been charged and accepted in a transaction between independent enterprises in comparable circumstances. 38. Even so, taxpayers are not expected to prepare levels of documentation that are disproportionate to the amount of tax revenue at risk in their transfer pricing transactions. The cost of preparing documentation should be weighed against the risk that Inland Revenue will make a transfer pricing adjustment. 39. Inland Revenue would expect to see, at a minimum, the following documentation: • an identification of the cross-border transactions for which the taxpayer has a transfer pricing exposure; • a broad functional analysis of the taxpayer’s operations, to identify the critical functions being performed; • an estimation of the business risk of not undertaking and documenting a more detailed transfer pricing analysis; • an estimation of the costs of complying with the transfer pricing rules. 40. A taxpayer should also, as far as practicable, seek to collect and retain documentation that is: • existing at the time the taxpayer was developing or implementing any arrangement that might raise transfer pricing issues, or • brought into existence close to the time the transaction occurs. 9 See section 20(2)(d). 15 41. Such documentation might include books, records, studies, analyses, conclusions and any other written or electronic material recording information that may be relevant in the determination of transfer prices. 42. The transfer pricing guidelines are appended to Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 10 (October 2000). This document is also available on the internet.

SPEECH NOTES

### Speech to Property Council of New Zealand

Thank you for your invitation to speak to you today on possible changes to the rules on property depreciation for tax purposes.

I am sure by now many of you will all have read the recent issues paper on the topic, "Repairs and maintenance to the tax depreciation rules".

While these are early days yet in the consultation process, there has been some public comment on the issues paper which I feel merits comment.

One of the more common responses has been that it is good the government is favouring investment in 'productive' activity such as electronics or machinery over 'non-productive' investment in buildings and other structures.

I personally doubt whether it makes sense to make too strong a distinction between productive and unproductive assets. When a firm purchases a machine to make shoes and this is seen to be productive, it still needs someone to build a roof and walls to provide shelter for the machine and its operators.

Those who argue that commercial and industrial buildings are unproductive have probably never tried producing goods and services in the rain, unless they are farmers, of course!

A better way to think about things, and the approach taken by the issues paper, is to ensure that our tax system neither encourages nor discourages particular types of investment, but instead allows investment to flow to where it gives the highest pre-tax return.

The underlying idea is that in the absence of taxes, there would be incentives for investment to take place in the most profitable areas. It is undesirable for taxes to drive investment decisions. This approach should provide confidence to those investing because it provides more certain ground on which to make investment decisions.

Another common response has been to refer to the complexity of the issues paper. I can respond that one of the problems with tax is simply the incredible complexity of the issues that can arise when you look at them in detail – particularly when you start with a first principles approach, as my tax policy officials are wont to do.

The issues paper on depreciation was prepared by tax policy officials, rather than the government, so does take a very high-level, first principles approach. This has led to some mild criticism as to the proposals not having much detail. The reason is that the document does not make detailed proposals but simply suggests possible ways of reducing possible tax biases in the rules and resolving some of the practical problems with their application.

The paper is a first step in the policy-making process. Once submissions have been received, officials will report to me with their detailed recommendations, and at that point the government will consider how it will consult further to ensure the detailed design of any change is also open to scrutiny.

The goal of the writers of the issues paper is modest – they want to avoid having depreciation rates which are too badly wrong. We know is not possible to get tax depreciation rates absolutely right. We know that assets do not decline predictably in nice smooth curves till the last day of their economic lives, at which point they helpfully implode into a neat pile. But we have identified some areas where the rules may be able to be improved.

Officials have argued that the starting point for neutral depreciation provisions is getting depreciation rates as close as possible to measuring how assets would depreciate in the absence of any inflation. The problem is getting as close as possible to this outcome when there is lack of data on how assets actually depreciate.

Take the case of buildings, a topic which I suspect is dear to your heart. At present, depreciation provisions are set assuming that buildings depreciate smoothly to 13.5 per cent of their acquisition cost over their economic life. This converts to a 4 per cent diminishing value rate of depreciation for most buildings. Is this too high or too low?

Some would argue it is much too high. Most properties appreciate rather than depreciate, and of course this is a key reason why many choose to invest in property.

The fact that properties rise in value would not be grounds for denying depreciation deductions on property if appreciation were due to rises in land values, with the value of structures falling over time. But it is difficult to identify changes in value that are attributable to land and those that are attributable to buildings.

If one looks at the specific example of residential accommodation and examines rateable valuations, it appears that in recent years not only has land risen in value, but the average value of structures has increased. Moreover, this increase has been considerably faster than the rate of inflation as measured by the Consumers Price Index.

Looking at these figures, one might question whether buildings would fall in value in the absence of inflation. On the other hand, it is clear that, on occasion, buildings are destroyed to be replaced with newer buildings. Clearly, by this time, the buildings have fully depreciated.  
One problem with rateable valuations data is that, over time, fancier new houses or additions and extensions to existing houses boost the average value of buildings.

In the absence of good available data on New Zealand property, one approach is to examine overseas studies. The United States Treasury, in a study carried out four years ago, suggests diminishing value rates for buildings in the range of 2 to 4 per cent.

Allowing buildings to be written off in a straight-line fashion over their economic life (currently estimated to be 50 years) would lead to straight-line depreciation of 2 per cent a year. The diminishing value equivalent would be 3 per cent a year.

Of course, there are always problems in relying on overseas studies. Officials are currently examining whether it is possible to examine rateable valuations data on buildings which have not had approvals for structural improvements – to test whether a 3 per cent rate would be the best possible rate.

The paper also considers the effects of inflation. In my view, the most surprising issue in the paper is the impact of even small rates of inflation on incentives to invest. With 2 per cent inflation and a 5 per cent cost of borrowing, an investment that depreciates at 50 per cent a year has to make a 4.95 per cent return to be a break-even investment. An asset that depreciates at 2 per cent a year needs to earn only a 4.16 per cent return.

Explaining this fact, and reducing the impact of inflation on investment decisions, drives much of the analysis in the paper. The outcome is interesting in that the 20 per cent economic loading, previously seen as a concession, is now seen as a tool in addressing inflation.

The issues paper suggests increasing the loading for shorter-lived assets and reducing it for longer-lived assets, to equalise the returns required from assets that have different economic lives.

The paper looks at a number of specific issues relating to the operation of the current depreciation rules. They include the powers of the Inland Revenue to make special tax depreciation rate rules, and the tax treatment of losses on disposal of buildings and other structures.

On this last point, the paper suggests allowing a loss on destruction of buildings when the destruction is 'involuntary' – say, as the result of a natural disaster such as a flood. It also sets out the arguments for and against allowing a loss on destruction of buildings when the destruction is voluntary. In principle, there is scope to do this, though there are concerns about the potential for tax abuse. Your organisation may have some very worthwhile views on the matter.

The paper examines the growing practice on the part of property owners to break buildings into sub-components for depreciation purposes. The focus is on rental housing, rather than commercial property, since the internal layout of a commercial building is often tailored to the specific requirements of the occupant.

Increasing numbers of owners are apparently separating out from the building components like electrical wiring, internal walls and plumbing. They are then depreciating these components at specified rates, which are higher, and using the building depreciation rate for the remaining shell.

This boosts the average depreciation rate. In principle, the more assets that are broken out and depreciated separately, the lower the depreciation rate should be on the remaining shell.

The issues paper suggests two possible ways of dealing with the practice of separating out the components of rental housing. Both include listing certain structural components – such as wiring, ducting, plumbing and internal walls – and treating them as part of the building. This would limit owners' abilities to boost their buildings' depreciation rates.

The first option is similar to Australian measures for rental housing. It would allow separate depreciation of non-core chattels and fixtures when they are separately identifiable assets and are listed and separately accounted for.

It would allow equipment such as hot water cylinders and air conditioning units to be depreciated separately, as well as items that are not part of the internal structure and can readily be replaced – such as carpets, curtains and light fittings.

A cost to taxpayers of this option is that they would need to have private valuations of such assets when they bought or sold properties.

The second option would involve fewer compliance costs. Owners could choose to depreciate non-core assets such as hot water cylinders and carpets at the building rate. Everything – building and non-core assets – would be treated as one big, composite asset.

This would remove any need for private valuations of assets when rental properties are bought or sold. Another advantage is that replacements of small items such as hot water cylinders could reasonably be thought of as repairs to the large composite asset, with there being greater scope for deducting expenses as repairs and maintenance.

These, then, are the main points covered in the issues paper, as they affect property owners.

The paper is part of the government's Generic Tax Policy Process, which builds consultation with affected taxpayers into the key stages of policy-making – long before any changes are legislated for. The reason for doing this is to achieve better, more effective tax policy. We try to get it as right as possible in what is a very complex area.

The government is not proposing changes to the depreciation rules just yet – instead we are soliciting feed-back on suggested directions of change. When submissions on the issues paper are analysed, officials will make detailed recommendations to the government.

The decisions that emerge from the process will be important ones that will probably affect everyone here today. For this reason, it is vital that your organisation and other interested parties tell us their views on the suggestions put forward in the issues paper – whether or not they are workable, practical, achievable or even sensible.

I understand that submissions have started to roll in, well before the closing date, so there is obviously a lot of interest in the subject and in the issues paper.

I look forward to reading your considered views on the matter.

Thank you.

More on environmental expenditure changes
=========================================

Forthcoming changes to the rules on tax deductibility for business environmental expenditure were announced by the government on [4 August](/news/2004/2004-08-04-changes-treatment-environmental-costs)
. The changes will ensure that business costs, including those for dealing with environmental problems, are taken into consideration in calculating taxable income, and that deductions for restoration and monitoring expenditure are available after businesses have ceased operation. For details on how the proposed legislation will work, see our [special report](/news/2004/2004-08-16-more-environmental-expenditure-changes#specialreport)
.

A special report by the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue

16 August 2004

### Business environmental expenditure - more on the proposed changes

The government announced in a statement on 4 August 2004 that it would introduce legislation to clarify and amend the tax treatment of environmental expenditure. The changes would ensure that all business costs, including those for dealing with environmental problems, are taken into consideration in calculating taxable income, and that the timing of such deductions is appropriate. Since the announcement, there have been several requests for details on how the new legislation would work. This special report details the proposed changes.

At present, there is a great deal of uncertainty in law regarding the existing scope of tax deductions available for environmental expenditure (such as expenditure to prevent, remedy or mitigate the discharge of contaminants). It appears that some environmental costs are not deductible. This results in the incorrect calculation and taxation of income from business activities, and thus can penalise socially and economically desirable types of expenditure.

Tax policy officials have reviewed the tax treatment of environmental costs and undertaken targeted consultation with interested parties in order to develop proposals for clarifying and improving the rules. The parties consulted have been supportive of changes to clarify the scope of deductions for environmental expenditure and to provide a matching mechanism for restoration costs.

The government subsequently announced that the rules for environmental expenditure will be clarified and expanded by:

*   specifying categories of qualifying environmental expenditure (including restoration) and default amortisation rates;
*   giving the Commissioner of the Inland Revenue the power to issue special amortisation rates for certain categories of environmental expenditure;
*   removing the current distinction between industrial and non-industrial waste; and
*   introducing a matching mechanism so that site restoration and monitoring costs can be matched against prior business income.

The changes will be included in the taxation bill scheduled for introduction in November 2004.

### Background to the current treatment

Business taxpayers are currently able to claim a tax deduction for environmental expenditure in three ways:[\[1\]](#footnote1)

*   a deduction for normal operating (revenue) expenditure;
*   a deduction under the depreciation rules [\[2\]](#footnote2)
     for certain types of capital expenditure, such as tanks, reservoirs, pipes, pumping machinery and screens; and
*   a deduction under section DJ 10 of the Income Tax Act 1994 for other capital environmental expenditure.

Section DJ 10 was introduced to permit business taxpayers a deduction for expenditure incurred for the purpose of treating industrial waste when no other allowance might otherwise be possible. It allows business taxpayers to claim a deduction for the cost of constructing, on land, any earthworks, ponds, settling tanks or similar, primarily for the purpose of treating industrial waste to prevent or combat pollution of the environment. When a deduction is available, it must be spread evenly over five years, beginning with the year in which the expenditure was incurred.

Despite the existence of a specific section to provide for deductions of this nature, there are certain environmental costs which are not currently deductible - such as costs incurred in dealing with non-industrial waste and restoration costs.

The wording of the current section appears to have resulted from the fact that, at the time of its introduction, landfills were operated by local councils, who were outside the tax net. Therefore no consideration was given to whether deductions should be allowed for the disposal of non-industrial waste. Similarly, the section also pre-dates the Resource Management Act 1991. Therefore section DJ 10 does not provide a deduction for costs incurred in complying with new health and environmental standards, such as site restoration. The inability to claim tax deductions for dealing with non-industrial waste and site restoration costs results in the incorrect calculation and taxation of income from business activities.

Because the current tax treatment of environmental expenditure results in the incorrect taxation of business income, there have been a number of calls for a change to the current rules. As a result, tax policy officials have reviewed the current tax treatment of environmental expenditure, an exercise which has included some targeted consultation. The review has resulted in a number of proposals for legislative change.

### The proposed changes

#### Clarifying the scope of deductions

To clarify the scope of deductions available for environmental expenditure, section DJ 10 of the Income Tax Act 1994 will be revised so that it sets out categories of deductible expenditure and the rate at which a deduction is available. Although policy officials are continuing to consult with interested parties on the proposed rates and categories, they are expected to be, broadly, as follows

| General description of expenditure | Amortisation rate |
| --- | --- |
| _Testing and feasibility expenditure_ - Expenditure incurred in testing and determining the feasibility of different options for preventing, remedying or mitigating the discharge of contaminants until the time the taxpayer commits to one particular option. | 100% |
| _Construction/improvement expenditure_ - Expenditure incurred in the construction on land in New Zealand of earthworks, ponds, settling tanks, or other similar improvements for preventing, remedying or mitigating the discharge of contaminants. This category of expenditure will also need to deal with environmental solutions such as riparian planting. | A default amortisation rate based on the lesser of 35 years (1/35) or the length of the applicable resource consent granted (1/life of resource consent). |
| _Restoration expenditure_ - Expenditure incurred in remedying the effects of contaminants. | 100% |
| _Monitoring expenditure_ - Expenditure incurred in monitoring the effects of contaminants or other environmental solutions. | 100% |

#### Inland Revenue power to issue rates

While, in general, the length of a consent is considered to be a good approximation of the economic life of environmental expenditure, there may be situations where this is not the case. It has therefore been agreed that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will be given the power to set amortisation rates for individual categories of environmental expenditure. In determining the appropriate amortisation rate, the Commissioner will have regard to the fact that for environmental expenditure, estimated useful life for tax purposes may be less than physical life. Estimated useful life may also be less than the life of the applicable resource consent.

#### Removing the distinction between industrial and non-industrial waste

In setting categories of expenditure and amortisation rates, the aim is to ensure tax deductions are available for all environmental expenditure, no matter what the source of the contaminant. The intention is not to create incentives for taxpayers to select one environmental solution over another.

Therefore, the current section DJ 10 will be amended to remove the word "industrial". This change is likely to be retrospective, to protect taxpayers who have taken a wide interpretation of the term "industrial waste".

#### Post-cessation restoration and monitoring costs

Even when site restoration and monitoring expenditure is deductible this is of little use when incurred after a company has ceased business. When a taxpayer ceases business, it may incur tax-deductible expenditure but have no income to offset that expenditure. In such a situation, no benefit is obtained for the resulting tax loss, even though the taxpayer may have paid significant amounts of tax in the past. Under existing law, taxpayers cannot match these deductions against income derived while carrying on the business.

Matching income and deductions could be achieved by allowing a tax deduction for accounting restoration provisions. However, allowing a deduction for an estimate of restoration and monitoring costs would open up the tax rules to manipulation and would contradict the established taxation treatment of provisions.

Other jurisdictions deal with this issue by allowing businesses to calculate a terminal loss on cessation of trade. The terminal loss may then be offset against earlier profits of that entity. The introduction of a loss carry-back is not supported because it is inconsistent with the general structure of New Zealand's tax system. It would also have significant operational issues for both taxpayers and Inland Revenue. For example, it would be necessary to amend and reassess earlier tax returns.

Instead, taxpayers will be allowed to establish a restoration fund with Inland Revenue. The establishment of a restoration fund would be voluntary. Over the life of a business (if the discharge of contaminants is resulting from operations) a cash deposit equivalent to the tax effect of the accounting restoration provision could be made into the fund. This deposit would give rise to a tax deduction so that the taxpayer's cash position is unchanged. Interest would also be paid on deposits at the same rate as that applying to income equalisation scheme deposits (3% per annum).

On cessation of business, the taxpayer would be entitled to a refund from the restoration fund. This refund would give rise to taxable income which would be offset by tax deductions for restoration and monitoring expenditure. The restoration fund would achieve matching of expenses and income but would provide controls around the level of deduction available.

To spread the cost of implementing the proposal, taxpayers will be required to spread initial deductions from establishing a restoration fund over at least five years. This recognises that the majority of these costs relate to deferred restoration deductions.

### Application dates

It is proposed that the amendments to section DJ 10 (including the establishment of a restoration fund) apply for income years beginning and environmental expenditure incurred after the date the amending legislation is enacted.

The removal of the distinction between industrial and non-industrial waste is likely to be retrospective, however, to protect taxpayers who have taken a wide interpretation of the term "industrial waste" (either in filing their tax returns or in raising a dispute with Inland Revenue). Taxpayers who have not taken a wide interpretation of the legislation should not be able to take advantage of the retrospective change.

\[1\] The review of environmental costs focused on the treatment of these costs generally and did not consider industry-specific provisions (such as for mineral and petroleum mining).

\[2\] A recent officials' issues paper, "Repairs and maintenance to the tax depreciation rules", looks at a number of depreciation issues, including the treatment of environmental expenditure, and suggests possible changes to the rules. Submissions on the paper close on 31 August.

Countering industry-wide evasion with limited amnesties
=======================================================

A government discussion document released today proposes limited amnesties for tax evaders who want to begin complying with the law but are operating in industries where tax evasion is ingrained. As an incentive, evaders who came forward under a limited amnesty would have to pay less back-tax than if they were detected. The amnesty would be backed up by intensified Inland Revenue audit of the target industry. For more information see the discussion document, '[Options for dealing with industry-wide tax evasion](/publications/2004/2004-dd-tax-evasion)

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Tackling industry-wide tax evasion

A discussion document released today sets out government proposals for cracking down on the hidden economy through targeted tax measures.

"Tax evasion can become ingrained in an industry, which often puts operators who pay tax at a competitive disadvantage," says Associate Revenue Minister David Cunliffe.

"Even if they don't want to, operators can become trapped in a spiral – they evade tax in order to compete, then are caught and put out of business because they can't pay their back-taxes.

"In the meantime, the rest of society has to make up the tax shortfalls that result from their evasion.

Under an idea being explored by the government, tax-evading operators within a problem industry would be given a last chance to break out of the spiral, clean up their act and begin complying with the law.

"Those who front up would be offered a limited amnesty in exchange for repaying a certain number of years of the back-taxes they owe, and they would have to comply fully with the law in the future.

"As part of the package, the target industry would be closely scrutinised by IRD auditors. Evaders caught in the process would face full back-taxes and penalties.

"In the long run, it's better to have tax evaders start to pay tax – and make a belated contribution to the public coffers, than to have them put of business and make no contribution, either now or in the future.

"If implemented, the system would be trialled to ensure it achieved the maximum benefit. Safeguards are proposed in the discussion paper to ensure the program would remain under close supervision.

"These are matters that affect us all. For this reason the government is seeking the public's views on the proposal – whether they think it's a good or bad idea, whether it would be fair to honest taxpayers, or whether there are better ways of tackling the problem," Mr Cunliffe said.

The discussion document, "Options for dealing with industry-wide tax evasion", is available at [www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz](https://www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz)

### Options for dealing with industry-wide tax evasion – Questions and Answers

#### Why is the government releasing this discussion document?

Some industries have entrenched tax evasion. This affects everyone as those who evade tax contribute less than their fair share to services such as education, healthcare and the police but they still use those services. It also disadvantages those in the industry who comply with the law as they bear costs that those not paying tax do not.

A barrier to cleaning up tax evasion is that those who have evaded tax in the past and who want to begin complying with the law can face back taxes and penalties that are so high they may be forced out of business.

The thinking behind this discussion document is that tax rules that focus solely on individuals may not deal most effectively with industry-wide evasion. Therefore, innovative ways of dealing with the problem are needed. There may be an overall benefit to New Zealand that industries can be cleaned up by offering limited amnesties to businesses to allow them to "clean up their acts" so they can continue trading and start contributing their fair share to society.

Given that it is innovative thinking, any action arising from the discussion document would be trialled and very closely monitored to ensure it was achieving its aims.

#### Why would some industries be targeted and not others?

We are concerned about the pressures being placed on honest, hard-working operators in some quarters because they have to compete with other, less scrupulous operators who do not pay tax and so can charge less – commonly done as a "cash" price. In some industries, we think this is making it hard for legitimate businesses to stay afloat without adopting the same practices – even though they might not want to.

#### What industries would be targeted?

This is just a proposal at this stage, but if it goes ahead, Inland Revenue would identify groups for whom amnesties would be effective as part of a broader strategy to clean up problem industries, from a tax compliance point of view. This strategy would include intensive follow-up audit and investigation in the targeted industry.

No potential candidate industries have been decided. The first word on any industry will be when a limited amnesty is offered. This is to prevent people changing their current taxpaying habits in anticipation of an amnesty in the future. And no industry could be certain it would be offered an amnesty, so it would be much wiser to continue paying taxes rather than gamble on perhaps having one.

#### How would the limited amnesties work?

Limited amnesties would allow tax evaders the opportunity to get back on track by coming forward and paying only a certain number of years of back-taxes. The discussion document canvasses options on how much back-tax they should pay, in terms of two, three, and four year options.

#### Wouldn't tax evaders just be let off the hook?

They will be assessed with penalties for whatever period is decided following the discussion document and policy process. They may not end up paying their full tax liability but this is also likely to be the case if they were bankrupted by a large tax assessment so it is a matter of finding a balance. The limits of the incentive to come forward talked about in the discussion document aim to prevent those arrears from being overwhelming, so they can be managed, say, by instalment arrangements, while the operator involved also has to meet future and current tax obligations.

It might look unfair in some respects but it might be more unfair not to try to do something about the evasion problem in some industries. This is also because we think there are groups of people who are not hard-core evaders but have been pressured into, and trapped in, dodgy tax practices by having to try and compete with hard-core evaders.

The law currently treats all evaders the same way. Pursuing this in a lot of cases could result in large numbers of bankruptcies, which could disrupt the industries involved, meaning that no-one will gain in the long run. The government is considering offering a concession now to improve the long-term picture for everyone.

#### Why wouldn't a limited amnesty be offered to everyone?

General amnesties normally do not provide any positive benefits and they risk encouraging future non-compliance, especially if people think another one is going to be offered in the future.

A key part of the proposal is the ability to ensure that follow-up investigations and audits can be conducted intensively. From a practical standpoint, there is no way a limited amnesty could be credibly proposed if spread too thinly over large numbers of people or the whole economy.

#### Wouldn't it be unfair to offer limited amnesties to some people and not others?

The aim of the government is to increase fairness by making sure that businesses are operating on a level playing field. This is an opportunity for industries with ingrained evasion to come clean and start to contribute their fair share to society. Limited amnesties may be a way to shift the aggregate behaviour of an industry in which evasion has become a deeply ingrained problem. The aim is to get a whole group of people back on track in the most manageable way, giving them a chance to come forward first, so Inland Revenue is able to focus its attention on those who choose not to. It's a last chance before the full force of the law is exercised.

#### How would things like child support be affected?

Social policy programmes like child support, student loans and family assistance will be affected to the extent that income is disclosed and assessed for tax when someone comes forward under an amnesty. In the case of child support this may have a flow on effect of providing more financial support for children.

SPEECH NOTES

### Address to Brookers Tax and Regulatory Seminar "Doing Business with Australia"  
Wellesley Boutique Hotel, Maginnity St, Wellington

It is my pleasure to open today's seminar. I have made it one of the goals of my tenure as finance minister to strengthen the trans-Tasman business relationship, which is of enormous significance to us in terms of trade and investment.

As a government we have been committed to enhancing cooperation on both sides of the Tasman with the aim of developing a seamless trans-Tasman business environment, or single economic market, by reducing compliance costs and other regulatory barriers.

That commitment has been matched by the Australian government, and I do not believe it would have changed had there been a change of government in last weekend's Federal election. However, the result does allow us to continue on our agreed programme of work without missing a beat.

The importance of the trans-Tasman economy and our stake in each others success should not be underestimated.

For example, in the year to August 2004, 21 per cent of New Zealand's exports, valued as free on board, were destined for Australia. Over the same period, New Zealand sourced 21.7 per cent of its imports, valued at cost, including insurance and freight, from Australia.

Australian total investment in New Zealand was $51.3 billion at 31 March 2004, up $9.1 billion on a year earlier. New Zealand total investment in Australia was $20.8 billion at 31 March 2004, up $3.6 billion on a year earlier.

The story goes deeper than these raw numbers suggest. As well as the direct trade and investment linkages, the relationship helps business on both sides to compete and expand globally.

Australian businesses are increasingly seeing New Zealand as a good place to fine tune their products and business models before expanding internationally. New Zealand businesses view the Australian market as a means of building up critical mass and as a key part of their global expansion strategy.

Hence the strategic importance of the agenda of work Peter Costello and I have been progressing in recent years. Of course, that work depends for its success upon New Zealand and Australian businesses such as those represented here today. We as ministers are levelling the playing field, providing clear boundary markings and getting clarity and consistency in the refereeing. But that means nothing unless you as business leaders field a team.

That may seem an obvious point to make. However, it has always been clear to me that the best incentive to make progress on integration issues is the example of businesses successfully taking advantage of new provisions and pushing their boundaries by finding new ways to add value to the trans-Tasman economy and hence raising new issues in harmonisation. Successful integration breeds more integration. Many of the challenging issues are hard to resolve in theory, and are best solved in the context of trans-Tasman business links that are expanding, deepening and becoming more sophisticated.

So what I would like to do this morning is to provide a quick update on the major issues that are under active consideration, and indicate how these will reshape the business environment for trans-Tasman businesses.

The work agenda covers five major issues:

*   Competition policy;
*   Accounting standards;
*   Securities offerings;
*   Banking regulations; and
*   Taxation.

Regarding the first of these, the Australian Productivity Commission is currently taking the lead on this, and is examining the potential for greater cooperation, coordination and integration of the general competition and consumer protection regimes in New Zealand and Australia. A draft report is to be released this month, with a final report to Ministers by the end of 2004. The Australian Productivity Commission will also hold public consultations with business and interested parties in both New Zealand and Australia in November.

For New Zealand businesses, a more harmonised competition and consumer regime should increase certainty for businesses seeking to expand their operations or to form strategic alliances across the Tasman and reduce compliance costs.

On a more practical day-to-day level, variances in accounting standards can impose a significant cost on businesses operating trans-Tasman. Under the best of circumstances, accounting standards and practices are in a state of constant evolution. Recent years have seen some spectacular failures in business ethics (the HIH case being the largest one in our part of the world) and this has cast an even stronger spotlight on the need for clear and unambiguous standards and scrupulous oversight of accounting practice.

In this context, a Trans-Tasman Accounting Standards Advisory Group has been established to look at ways of reducing costs and improving efficiency through proposing a single set of accounting standards in both countries.

The Group has met twice and made considerable progress, including identifying differences in standard setting frameworks and standards, which will be used to determine which differences matter, and determining the main priorities for maximising the leverage of Australia and New Zealand in the development of international accounting standards.

The ultimate aim would be for a trans-Tasman company to keep only one set of accounts which serve in both jurisdictions. This may take some time to achieve, but there is reason to be confident that we can make significant progress in the medium term.

Turning to trans-Tasman financing issues, a joint discussion paper on the trans-Tasman recognition of offers of securities and managed investment scheme interests was released in mid May. The proposals sought to allow issuers to offer securities in both Australia and New Zealand using the same offer documents and structure. The aim is to promote investment and reduce the costs of raising capital, while maintaining investor protection through appropriate disclosure.

Submissions on the document have been generally supportive of the proposed mutual recognition arrangement, but raised a number of technical and implementation issues which are currently being considered by Australian and New Zealand officials. These are not of a nature that would derail the basic concept; however, they need to be worked through carefully.

Finally, on banking regulation, in July, the Australian Treasurer and I received a report on a framework for assessing the options for closer integration in the regulation of trans-Tasman banking.

Banking regulation may seem a rather abstruse exercise, but it is important, given the increasing range and specialisation of financial services providers. An energetic and well-governed banking industry is an enormous asset to a business community.

Following on from the July report, Cabinet has invited the Reserve Bank to work on strengthening the existing home-host relationship between prudential regulation in Australia and New Zealand.

A review group has also been established to work through the trickier issues identified in the report. The group will report back to us early in 2005 on how well New Zealand's major financial institutions are performing and whether different institutional arrangements, including a trans-Tasman approach to regulation, would contribute to stronger growth and economic development in New Zealand.

To turn finally to tax, the key point I should make is that the two countries are not moving towards harmonisation. There will be no capital gains tax for New Zealand, and it would be very difficult for Australia, I suspect, to move to a relatively simple GST system such as ours.

The longstanding approach in the tax area is close co-operation. For example we are cooperating on a tax information exchange agreement, and last year both countries enacted legislation that made it possible for Australian companies to join New Zealand’s imputation credit rules, and New Zealand companies to join the Australian franking credit rules. In this way a longstanding tax obstacle to trans-Tasman investment was reduced.

The way we design tax rules can create unintended problems in Australia and vice versa. Problems have arisen in Australia from our rules on foreign trusts in New Zealand, and Australian unit trust rules have created similar problems for our tax system. This illustrates how our tax systems are closely related and why we need to co-operate.

Australian and New Zealand officials try to meet at least twice a year to discuss a range of tax issues, both policy and operational issues. These meetings provide a good opportunity to gather information and signal potential issues for meetings at ministerial level.

In the area of taxation of banks we have common issues but the perspectives are sometimes different. There is the tax issue, of course, and you will be aware that the government is introducing legislation to make the tax laws relating to foreign-owned banks more robust.

To sum up, and to rise above the detailed issues, my government is keenly aware of the importance of our economic relationship with Australia. We have firmly in our sights a regime of business regulation that places the minimum barriers to trans-Tasman business that is consistent with protecting and promoting our national interest. We have an extensive work agenda that is already well advanced, and are constantly working to identify further opportunities for closer cooperation, where these are beneficial and in the best interests of both countries.

As I said at the outset, however, New Zealand businesses are the energy source that will turn the efforts of both governments into a dynamic and integrated economy. I trust that today's seminar will provide further impetus towards that goal.

Thank you.

SPEECH NOTES

### Address to ICANZ 2004

**Christchurch Convention Centre, 63 Kilmore St, Christchurch**

Thank you for inviting me to speak at your annual conference. I would like to touch upon a number of issues that I think will be of interest to you all: the economic outlook, growth in revenue flows, recent base maintenance developments and, by way of examples across the tax arena, the way in which carefully thought-out tax policy can contribute to the government's overall goals.

The overall picture has been one of economic growth, with the first half of 2004 stronger than forecast by Treasury and others. Economic growth for the year to June was 4.4 per cent. The domestic economy, especially private consumption, continues to be the driver of growth and residential and business investment. Growth in private consumption eased in the June quarter, but consumption overall remained at a high level.

The momentum in the domestic sector of the economy is likely to maintain growth at a higher rate than forecast in the Budget Update over the remainder of 2004. However, activity is still likely to slow from its recent rate as a result of higher interest rates, increased oil prices and a slowdown in the housing market, with expected growth of 2.5 per cent in the year to March 2006. This would be only a mild slowdown and reflects the momentum in the domestic economy and the fact that the negative factors are expected to be relatively mild.

International oil prices have reached record levels in nominal terms recently as a result of strong demand and disruptions to supply. While prices may have increased to a higher underlying level, the recent spikes have been caused by temporary supply factors and so are not expected to persist. New Zealand has benefited from the strong world demand for a range of goods and services, even though this has boosted oil prices. But persistent higher oil prices will lead to lower world growth, lower export returns for New Zealand and higher import prices.  
These economic fundamentals mean that we are well placed to react to the changing world economy and fluctuating prices.

Taxation growth has reflected the strong performance of the New Zealand economy. In the year to June 2004, tax receipts grew by $2.8 billion, or 7.1 per cent. Most of this growth came from source deductions, company tax, and goods and services tax.

Source deductions receipts grew by $1.4 billion, or 8.9 per cent, reflecting a very strong labour market, with over 3 per cent growth in both employment and wages for the year to June. Net company tax receipts grew by nearly $900 million, or 17 per cent, well in excess of operating surplus, which at budget time was estimated to grow by 1.6 per cent for the March 2004 year. And goods and services tax grew by $700 million, or 8 per cent, driven by increased consumer spending and residential investment.

There has been much comment recently concerning fiscal outturns and the government's supposedly overflowing coffers. You would not expect me to let this opportunity pass without setting the record straight.

The Crown financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2004 recorded an operating balance surplus of $7.4 billion (5.3 per cent of GDP) and an OBERAC (Operating Balance Excluding Revaluations and Accounting Changes) of $6.6 billion (4.7 per cent of GDP).

Although this is an excellent result, it does not mean it is all cash that is just sitting around in a bank account, because:

*   $1.3 billion was used on capital purchases such as new machines for hospitals, building new roads and prisons;
*   $1.7 billion was used for loans – such as those made to students and District Health Boards;
*   $1.9 billion was put aside to save for future New Zealand Superannuation costs;
*   $1.2 billion represents the non-cash element of the OBERAC such as surpluses retained by SOEs and Crown entities which they can use for future investment.

Once these have all been accounted for, the Crown's cash surplus for the year was $520 million.

The solid performance on the revenue side for a number of years has enabled the government to fund increases in health, education and infrastructure spending, as well as the 'Working for Families' package announced in the last budget. This investment in our society is not only socially good but also necessary to keep us an attractive destination for highly skilled migration.

Healthy revenue has enabled us to make this investment while maintaining a sound fiscal position. That means we are better placed to withstand any external economic downturn because we can put aside funds to help cover the future costs of our aging population. Providing for known future pressures, investing in the country's infrastructure and building a sound fiscal position demonstrate the government's sound planning for the future.

Some commentators have suggested that the government should regard the non-cash element of the surplus as available for distribution to taxpayers. This simplistic analysis ignores the government's fiscal goals, notably our long-term fiscal objective of gross debt as a percentage of GDP slowly reducing over the longer term and passing through 20 per cent of GDP by 2015.

As an historian, I am bemused that some commentators seem to see responsible fiscal management as somehow inconsistent with a Labour government. However, responsible fiscal management coupled with responsible social investment was the hallmark of the First Labour Government from 1935 to 1949. New Zealand's was probably the only government whose financial position at the end of the Second World War was in better shape than at the beginning of the conflict.

The reason for this fiscal discipline was quite simple – members of that government had not only seen but had experienced how the most vulnerable suffered most from lack of fiscal prudence.

Our fiscal position does now give the government some room to manoeuvre on the tax policy programme. I am not prefiguring across-the-board tax cuts. This government will not put future New Zealanders into debt by chasing some illusory nirvanas on the Laffer Curve. But sensible reforms that have previously been ruled out because of their fiscal cost can now be considered. An example of that is the savings issue that I will come to shortly.

To maintain healthy revenue flows requires continuous application of base maintenance and protection measures, across the spectrum of business activity.

Recent months have seen announcements by banks about Inland Revenue reassessments associated with their offshore investments, the High Court cases concerning so-called "mass marketed schemes", and the Queenstown property audits. Obviously, I am not involved in any of these matters but I have ensured that Inland Revenue has been funded to enable it to police the tax system in a balanced way.

I have also encouraged tax policy officials to bring forward proposals to keep our tax laws robust. The ingenuity of some in this audience is truly astonishing, and it has required the normal stream of legislative responses. Recent examples have been:

*   enactment of the deferred deduction rule, which is targeted at mass-marketed schemes,
*   closing a loophole relating to the sale and leaseback of intangibles such as newspaper mastheads,
*   and closing another relating to the dividend tax rules that allowed investments in certain unit trusts to be tax-free.

A major item in the next month's taxation bill will be new thin capitalisation rules for banks. They are a response to the fact that, in recent years, bank profits have continued to increase, whereas the tax they have paid in New Zealand has not followed the same trend. A major reason for this, I am advised, is that foreign-owned banks have been entering into structured finance arrangements whose income is essentially not subject to tax in New Zealand, but involving large deductions for interest and associated expenses taken against New Zealand income.

The proposed thin capitalisation rules will require such investment to be funded by equity, or some of their interest will not be deductible. The estimated tax to be collected by these changes is $360 million a year, which is significant in anyone's terms.

At the other end of the scale are the problem industries, composed mainly of small operators, where "cash jobs" and tax evasion are ingrained. We have recently released a discussion document proposing limited amnesties as a targeted measure to bring those evaders who are willing back into the tax system. A limited amnesty in an industry would be accompanied by stepped up Inland Revenue audit of the industry.

When I first became Minister of Revenue I said that I intended to maintain the rational tax system that New Zealand enjoys. On the other hand, I also said that we would not be dogmatic in our tax policy. The primary purpose of tax policy is to raise revenue fairly and efficiently, but this still leaves room for flexibility in the interests of broader social, economic and environmental objectives. Tax-related growth and innovation measures to aid good business outcomes, social cohesion and base maintenance continue to be central themes in the government's tax policy work programme.

As you are all no doubt aware, encouraging private savings is an area high on the list of government priorities. Economically sound savings will occur only if the tax rules governing different kinds of investments are as neutral as possible. As you will probably know, however, the current tax rules for savings are far from neutral.

For onshore savings, very different tax rules and results apply, depending on whether someone saves directly or through a savings vehicle. And if the savings vehicle route is taken, different tax rules apply, depending on the vehicle.

For offshore savings, the situation is, if anything, more confusing. An investment in a 'grey list' country yields a particularly benign tax result and can provide tax planning opportunities, while the same investment in a 'non-grey list' country is taxed in full.

Needless to say, the tax rules for savings are in need of an overhaul, but it will need time, given the complexity created by the number of savings vehicles available and questions about the level at which taxation should occur – for example, whether at the fund or saver's level. For this reason, it is very important that officials work with the savings industry to see whether what is desirable is, in fact, achievable.

With this in mind, in August the government initiated a wide-ranging consultation process with stakeholders on problems with the taxation of investment income, both onshore and offshore. Craig Stobo has been consulting widely and will report his findings to me later this month, a report that I hope to release publicly early next month. I look forward to his report, as I imagine do many of you in the audience today, and I am hopeful that it can form the basis for comprehensive reform.

If we can get the rules relating to the taxation of savings right, some of the disincentives to saving will be removed, thereby creating a good platform to develop measures to increase work-based savings for retirement. Several ideas for increasing savings schemes in the workplace were put forward in the recent report to the government of the Savings Product Working Group, which recognised the importance of first getting the tax side right.

I intend bringing these various pieces of work together so that in the 2005 Budget I will be able to provide a clear outline of future reforms in the savings area. I said earlier that our fiscal position gives us some room to manoeuvre. This is a good example of that.

Contrary to the approach used in some past, failed attempts to address savings issues, I am prepared to consider options to solve these problems that are not fiscally neutral. This does not mean, however, that I support tax concessions for the savings industry. In my view, the international evidence is overwhelming that they do not work. I am attempting to reduce distortions in the area rather than to increase them. I also remain concerned that such incentives benefit those already saving rather than generate new savers.

I would be astonished, however, if sensible reform could be achieved without reducing the overall tax take, and I intend to promote sensible reform. It is obviously premature to speculate now on the detail of such reforms. However, from my discussions with Craig Stobo and with members of the savings industry, an imperative seems to be to remove the tax on capital gains levied on savings through actively managed unit trusts and super schemes when it is not levied on individual investors or passive funds. This seems both unfair and inefficient – unfair because in practice a harsher tax treatment is likely to apply to small investors and inefficient because it represents an implicit tax on the use of institutional savings.

I do not want to pre-empt Craig Stobo's report, but I would be very sympathetic to changes along these lines.

Another key objective for the government is keeping New Zealand an open, dynamic economy, one that does not hinder access to capital or misallocate it. Again, good tax policy can make a positive contribution here, by reducing the extent to which the tax system is a barrier to growth and innovation.

If firms are to thrive and grow to the optimal level they need access to capital. The government is looking at various measures, including tax-related measures, to reduce barriers to firms accessing finance.

We have already acted to remove a tax barrier to unlisted New Zealand companies accessing offshore equity finance, a measure that features in the taxation bill currently before Parliament.

Under the proposed legislation, offshore tax-exempt investors and foreign funds of funds from countries with which we have double tax agreements will be exempt from tax when they sell share in unlisted New Zealand companies. The change targets offshore institutional investors – such as US pension funds, which provide much of the world's venture capital. Once enacted, it will apply from 1 April this year.

To get capital investment right we also need to get the tax depreciation rules right. I have been concerned for some time that the rules may discourage investment in shorter lived assets, especially high tech assets for which obsolescence is a key problem, in favour of longer lived assets like buildings. The recent officials' issues paper on the rules looked at ways of reducing possible tax biases and resolving technical problems. It elicited a lot of submissions, which are being analysed at present.

The next step is for officials to complete their formal recommendations to me on how the rules should change in order to achieve better investment outcomes. Although these are early days in the process, I expect that we will eventually end up with faster depreciation rates on shorter lived equipment and slower rates on buildings. Any such rebalancing will not boost overall tax rates on investment income and will reduce artificial tax biases.

As part of a package of measures to boost gas exploration over the next five years, the government announced in August that it will introduce legislation to remove a tax obstacle to gas exploration and development. The '183-day-rule', which can create inefficiencies and detrimentally affect operations, will be lifted until late 2009 for non-resident, offshore rig operating companies, drilling rigs carrying out gas field development work, and seismic survey ships involved in exploration. The legislation will be part of the taxation bill to be introduced next month.

The government is also moving to reduce tax barriers to international recruitment to New Zealand of people whose skills are in demand throughout the world. A discussion document published late last year proposed benefiting businesses that recruit overseas workers by reducing some of the latter's tax costs – in this case, by introducing a temporary exemption on their overseas income. The policy development of the proposal has been completed, and it awaits Cabinet sign-off for inclusion in a bill next year.

Although possibly the least brilliant star in the tax firmament, tax simplification has a key role to play in growth and innovation, by freeing businesses to concentrate on what they are there to do. Simplification is not glamorous, perhaps, because it seems always to be with us – continuous but never finished, composed of series of small steps towards something that may never be completely achievable. No single solution can fit all, and each proposed change often has as many detractors as supporters.

The latest series of proposals for making tax easier for small business is working its way through the policy development process. The taxation bill now before Parliament introduces one of these, a 6.7 per cent discount for self-employed people who make voluntary payments of income tax at any point during their first year of business, to reduce the financial strain of paying two years' tax in their second year of business. This proposal has enjoyed a relatively wide measure of support, both in early consultation and in submissions on the bill.

The next round of changes will be introduced next year, and then the government will be consulting with you again for more ideas on further simplification initiatives.

To diverge slightly, although tax was not a factor in the survey, New Zealand cannot be doing too badly overall if the World Bank has rated us top of a list of 143 countries for 'ease of doing business' – ahead of the US, Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia.

If we want to keep our profile as a good place in which to do business and to invest, we need to keep abreast of international tax developments. Our closest relationship is and will continue to be with Australia. I have been pleased with the progress made in working with Australia on the tax front at both the ministerial and officials' level.

Although Australia is a close colleague, it is also a competitor for international investment and business. We need to ensure that we continue to implement sensible reforms and, if possible, maintain an edge. The changes to venture capital tax rules that are before Parliament way are an example of this focus, which will be maintained. I have, for example, directed officials to look at whether New Zealand should adopt limited liability company rules, along the line of those of the US, which allow companies with separate legal status to be treated as partnerships for tax purposes.

In fostering an innovative and productive New Zealand, economic and social objectives must also be balanced against environmental objectives.

Next month the government will be introducing legislation to clarify and improve the law relating to the tax treatment of environmental expenditure – such as costs for preventing, remedying or mitigating the discharge of contaminants. The proposed changes have so far been welcomed by business and environmentalists alike.

The proposed changes will allow costs for dealing with environmental problems to be taken into consideration when businesses calculate their taxable income. For example, a voluntary site restoration fund will be introduced so that business taxpayers can obtain tax deductions and refunds for restoring contaminated sites. Businesses will have the option of making contributions to the fund that will reduce their tax liability. Refunds, which will be taxable, will be given on cessation of business to help meet restoration costs.

Moving to a larger environmental issue, I see that the effect of the Kyoto Protocol, which will come into force internationally once it is passed by the Russian Parliament, occupies a major slot on your conference's programme. It is therefore timely for me to re-state the government's policy on a future charge on emissions of greenhouse gases.

The government's policy is to introduce an emissions charge on fossil fuel and industrial process emissions no sooner than 2007, to create incentives to reduce emissions. The charge will approximate the international emissions price but be capped at NZ$25 a tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent.

The government has retained the option of introducing emissions trading as an alternative to an emissions charge if the international carbon market is reliable and the price is reliably below the NZ$25 cap.

Revenue resulting from the charge will be recycled into the tax system. This means a carbon charge will not increase the overall tax burden, but will be offset by tax reductions elsewhere. The amount of money involved is not large relative to the overall tax take. I am only now beginning to look at some of the options, but across-the-board tax cuts are unlikely.

The government's recent announcement that it would introduce legislation extending statutory privilege to tax advice provided by advisors such as chartered accountants has been welcomed by your Institute. Because of the importance of the measure to the Institute, the government agreed to include it in the taxation bill to be introduced next month. The reduced timeframe means that although a lot of policy development has already gone into the proposed legislation, more may be required at the select committee stage. I would encourage you to take part in that process so that the resulting legislation is robust and workable.

As regards the government's review of fringe benefit tax, I would like to assure you that we have considered what submissions on the discussion document have said. The most contentious issue – except, perhaps, the existence of FBT itself – is car parks. We recognise the need to explore ways of achieving better policy consistency while keeping compliance costs to a minimum, and trade-offs have to be made. There is no intention that the review be a revenue-gathering exercise. While fringe benefit tax is, in effect, a tax on employees' non-cash remuneration, its application needs to be consistent with an environment that is conducive to efficient business.

For example, the current treatment of work-related vehicles is anomalous as it relies on the type of vehicle rather than the use to which it is put – we are looking at how this can be improved. On car parks, the provision of a car park is clearly a fringe benefit to an employee who uses it regularly, but there are several associated, thorny issues – ultimately we need to consider whether the benefit is of sufficient magnitude to warrant the costs of measuring and taxing it – we have no intention of imposing extra costs on businesses for the sake of it.

We are looking at introducing changes in a bill next year.

To conclude, 2004 has been a very, very busy year on the tax policy front, as you will know, and next year promises to be at least as busy.

A highlight of the year will have to be the enactment in May of the three-volume Income Tax Act 2004, which was a milestone for the team who began the progressive rewrite of income tax legislation in the early 1990s. Again, consultation on the rewritten legislation with the tax community was a vital part of the exercise, and the contribution greatly appreciated by the government.

Another highlight of the year was the highly co-ordinated response across government agencies and Parliament, and the significant contribution made by your Institute and Federated Farmers to recovery efforts in the wake of the February storms. It was all extraordinary and appreciated, by myself and other government ministers, but in particular by those whose lives, farms and businesses were disrupted by the disaster. I shall end this speech by thanking all of you who helped bring the recovery effort together.

I wish you all the best for a very successful conference.

Stobo report on taxing investment income
========================================

The government today released Craig Stobo's report on the taxation of investment income. Mr Stobo was appointed in July to consult with the investment and savings industry on problems related to the taxation of investment income and develop options for reform of the tax rules. For more information see the government's [media statement](/news/2004/2004-11-16-stobo-report-taxing-investment-income#statement)
 and the report, "[Towards Consensus on the Taxation of Investment Income](/publications/2004/2004-other-report-stobo-taxation-investment-income)
".

Hon Dr Michael Cullen  
Minister of Finance

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Stobo report creates momentum for change

"A significant momentum for change now exists around some highly complex and difficult areas of tax law and much of the credit for that must go to Craig Stobo," Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today.

Dr Cullen was commenting on the release of Mr Stobo's report: _Toward Consensus on the Taxation of Investment Income_. He congratulated Mr Stobo on the high standard of leadership he had brought to the task, saying the government should now be in a position to outline in the coming budget its decisions in the area and to seek further consultation on the details.

"The motivating principle behind this work is that the economy works best when investment decisions are guided as much as possible by economic considerations and as little as possible by tax considerations," Dr Cullen said.

Mr Stobo, formerly Chief Executive with BT Funds Management, was appointed by the government in July to consult widely with industry and other interested parties to on how to deal with problems around the tax treatment of investment income.

A key issue was that direct investment in New Zealand shares does not attract a tax on the capital gain but that indirect investment via a managed fund does.

"Mr Stobo found majority support for excluding from tax the capital gains made from both sets of investments. His own preference however, stated in the report, is for an "Investment and Savings Tax" incorporating the elements of a risk free return method to tax a deemed rate of return on investment by managed funds.

"The difficulty I have with that approach is that it does not put the two sets of investments on the same tax footing and to that extent fails to eliminate the existing distortion," Dr Cullen said.

Other boundary issues identified in the report are:

*   The different treatment of income from offshore investments and income from New Zealand investments.
*   The tax preference given to grey list countries \[Australia, Britain, Canada, Norway, the United States, Germany and Japan\].
*   The difference between an individual's marginal tax rate and the tax charged on income derived from collective investment vehicles, notably superannuation schemes which are taxed at 33 per cent even if the individuals covered only attract the 19.5 per cent rate on their incomes.

Dr Cullen said Mr Stobo's brief had been to conduct a high level discourse and that much work remained to be done on the details.

"But because of the consensus Craig has generated around the need for change and around some of the directions that change might take, officials are now confident they can make real progress over a relatively short time frame on what have been stubborn issues.

"I want to put on record my gratitude to him for that not insignificant achievement," Dr Cullen said.

Technical inquiries to Helen Mackenzie \[tax advisor, Dr Cullen's office\] 471-9728
25 November 2004 Future information requirements for foreign trusts with New Zealand-resident trustees: amended proposal 1. On behalf of the New Zealand government, tax policy officials are conducting a second round of consultation on proposed changes that would require foreign trusts with New Zealand-resident trustees to provide certain information to New Zealand’s Inland Revenue Department. 2. The amended proposal outlined here is intended to strike the correct balance between ensuring that New Zealand is in a position to meet its commitments under its double tax agreements, and ensuring that the obligations imposed on foreign trusts are not onerous and do not give rise to legitimate privacy concerns. 3. The amended proposal differs from the previous proposal in that New Zealand- resident trustees of foreign trusts will be required to provide only limited information to Inland Revenue upon appointment and to maintain records in New Zealand so information can be provided to Inland Revenue if requested. Under the previous proposal, trustees would have been required to provide Inland Revenue with an annual disclosure statement, including a full set of financial accounts. Background 4. In June 2004 Dr Michael Cullen, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue, agreed, in principle, to introduce certain record-keeping and filing requirements for foreign trusts with New Zealand-resident trustees. The reason for proposing such requirements was to enable New Zealand to provide information on such foreign trusts when other tax authorities request it – as many are entitled to do under double tax agreements signed with New Zealand. Officials were directed to undertake consultation on the proposal. 5. A number of submissions we received in response to the first round of consultation suggested the development of a system to regulate New Zealand-resident trustees who provide trustee services to foreign trusts. From a tax policy perspective, the tax rules should not regulate who can provide or offer trustee services. 6. Although we do not favour regulating who can provide trustee services, there is a case for requiring at least one New Zealand-resident trustee of each foreign trust to be a member of an acceptable professional body whose members are subject to a code of conduct, ethics and disciplinary measures. Under the amended proposal, the onus will be on the New Zealand-resident trustee to maintain and provide the necessary records. Given this, requiring at least one New Zealand-resident trustee to be a member of an accepted professional body will provide assurance to Inland Revenue 2 that a trustee has the necessary expertise to maintain records of the required standard and will comply with the law. 7. Once consultation on the amended proposal is complete, the Minister will make final policy decisions based on officials’ recommendations and feedback received from the second round of consultation. Summary of the proposal 8. The proposal will require New Zealand-resident trustees to: • provide limited information to Inland Revenue upon appointment as trustee of a foreign trust; • maintain certain information relating to the trust in New Zealand and provide this information to Inland Revenue if requested; and • at least one New Zealand-resident trustee of a foreign trust to be a member of an acceptable professional body such as an accounting or legal body. 9. New Zealand-resident trustees who fail to disclose the requested information to Inland Revenue and to maintain records in New Zealand for New Zealand tax purposes will be subject to sanctions. They may be liable to New Zealand tax and criminal penalties for failing to keep records or provide the information requested. 10. The proposal is intended to ensure that New Zealand is in a position to meet its commitments, under its double tax agreements, to co-operate with other tax jurisdictions. We want to achieve this in a way that minimises any impact on legitimate transactions and commerce, as well as legitimate privacy concerns. 11. There is no intention to change the current New Zealand income tax treatment of foreign trusts that meet the necessary requirements under this proposal. 12. Under New Zealand law, a foreign trust is one that has had no New Zealand- resident settlor from the later of 17 December 1987 or the date upon which the first settlement was made to the trust. The income of a foreign trust is not liable to New Zealand income tax as long as the settlor remains a non-resident, no trust income is earned in New Zealand and no beneficiary of the trust is a New Zealand resident. Information to be disclosed to Inland Revenue 13. New Zealand-resident trustees of foreign trusts will be required to provide the following information to Inland Revenue upon their appointment, or the enactment of the proposal in relation to existing appointments: • the name of the trust or other identifying feature(s) such as the trust number and/or the date of settlement of the trust; 3 • the name and contact details of the trustee(s); and • the country of residence of the settlor(s) if the country is specified in the law or by way of Regulation (see paragraph 16-18). 14. If any of this information changes and a trustee is aware of the change, the trustee will be obliged to inform Inland Revenue so the information can be updated. 15. A specific statutory disclosure requirement similar to section 59 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will be required. 16. The New Zealand-resident trustee will be required to disclose the country of residence of the settlor to Inland Revenue only if the country requesting it is explicitly specified in New Zealand law. 17. Inland Revenue has agreed to provide automatically to the Australian Taxation Office, information relating to foreign trusts that have a New Zealand-resident trustee and an Australian-resident settlor. To ensure that Inland Revenue is in a position to provide this information automatically, New Zealand-resident trustees will be required to inform Inland Revenue if a trust has an Australian-resident settlor. Australia is the only country to which New Zealand is currently proposing to provide information on an automatic basis. 18. Trustees will be expected to take reasonable care to determine if a settlor is resident in Australia, based on the information that is available to them. If, for lack of information, a trustee fails to inform Inland Revenue that a settlor is resident in Australia, it will not result in the trustee being penalised for non-compliance. If a trustee does not take reasonable care to determine that a settlor is an Australian resident or they do not provide that information to Inland Revenue, the trustee may be subject to penalties for failure to disclose the required information. Record-keeping requirements 19. Trustees will be required to keep certain business records in New Zealand for at least seven years after the end of the income year to which they relate. If a trust ceases to have a New Zealand-resident trustee, the requirement to keep records for seven years will remain. 20. The records should: • correctly explain the transactions of the trust; • enable the trust’s financial position to be accurately determined at any time; • allow financial statements to be prepared; • include source documentation relating to sales, purchases and other transactions, and the assets and liabilities of the trust; 4 • provide details of settlements on the trust and distributions to beneficiaries (including their name and address); and • include a copy of the trust deed. 21. Section 22 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will be amended accordingly. Determining the residence of the trustee 22. The rules for determining if a person (an individual or a company) is a New Zealand resident are set out in sections OE 1 and OE 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and 2004. Individuals 23. Trustees of foreign trusts who are individuals (as opposed to trustee companies) will be treated as New Zealand residents if: • they maintain a ‘permanent place of abode’ in New Zealand, whether or not they also have a permanent place of abode outside New Zealand; or • they have been present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any 12- month period. 24. To cease New Zealand residence, they must be absent from New Zealand for at least 325 days in any 12-month period. 25. The ‘permanent place of abode’ test takes precedence over the others. For instance, individuals who maintain a permanent place of abode but have been absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in a 12-month period remain New Zealand residents. Companies 26. A trustee of a foreign trust that is a company will be treated as a New Zealand resident if the company: • is incorporated in New Zealand; or • has a head office in New Zealand; or • has its centre of management in New Zealand; or • the control of the company by its directors, acting in their capacity as directors, is exercised in New Zealand, whether or not decision-making by directors is confined to New Zealand. 5 Additional requirements for a trustee to be treated as a New Zealand-resident trustee 27. To be treated as a New Zealand-resident trustee, at least one trustee of a foreign trust will also be required to be a member of a professional body that is acceptable to Inland Revenue. In the case of a trustee company, a New Zealand-resident director of the company will be required to be a member of such a professional body. 28. Under the amended proposal, the onus will be on the New Zealand-resident trustee to maintain and provide the necessary records. Given this, requiring at least one New Zealand-resident trustee to be a member of an accepted professional body will provide assurance to Inland Revenue that a trustee has the necessary expertise to maintain records of the required standard and will comply with the law. 29. Acceptable professional bodies are likely to include, but will not necessarily be limited to, certain accounting and legal professional institutes or societies. Membership of these types of professional bodies is usually restricted to individuals who hold relevant qualifications. We would be interested in readers’ views on the types of professional bodies that should be included as acceptable. 30. Once legislation is enacted, Inland Revenue will develop administrative guidelines to assist in determining which professional bodies will be acceptable. Acceptable professional bodies are likely to be those that require their members to comply with the following requirements as a condition of membership: • adhere to the professional code of conduct and ethics; • be subject to a disciplinary process that enforces compliance with the code of conduct and ethics; and • follow certain ‘best practice’ guidelines. 31. In addition, members of such professional bodies would provide, or could provide, trustee services as part of being a member of that professional body. Requests for information about trusts from other countries Australia 32. When information provided by a trustee indicates that a settlor of the trust is an Australian resident, Inland Revenue will: • request further information from the trustee (such as financial records, distributions to beneficiaries and the identity of the settlor); and • automatically release the information to the relevant Australian Taxation Office on an annual basis. 6 Other signatory countries to double tax agreements 33. Information will be provided to other signatory countries to double tax agreements on a case-by-case request basis, when Inland Revenue considers that there are valid grounds for requesting the information. In accordance with the OECD Model Treaty and Commentary on Article 26, Inland Revenue will not entertain general ‘fishing expeditions’ from tax treaty partners for information on foreign trusts. Rules governing information collected 34. Any information provided to Inland Revenue by the New Zealand-resident trustees of foreign trusts will be subject to the existing tax secrecy laws. Section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 prevents Inland Revenue from providing information to a foreign jurisdiction except as permitted by section 81(4)(k) – \[reciprocal law or concession or reciprocal arrangement\]. Ensuring compliance 35. To ensure compliance with the proposed disclosure rules, a foreign trust with a New Zealand-resident trustee will be subject to New Zealand tax on its worldwide income if a trustee fails to disclose the required information to Inland Revenue (see paragraph 13). Trustees that do not maintain or provide information when requested may be subject to prosecution and criminal penalties. Non-compliant foreign trusts subject to New Zealand tax on their worldwide income 36. If a New Zealand-resident trustee of a foreign trust fails to disclose the required information to Inland Revenue, the taxation of the trust will be based on the residence of the trustee rather than the settlor. The worldwide income of the trust will be treated as trustee income, and taxed at 33%. 37. Failure to disclose the required information will create a tax liability against trustees. Trustees who expose their trusts to such a liability may also be breaching their fiduciary obligation to the beneficiaries of the trust, and therefore may be personally liable to the beneficiaries. Disclosure of the required information removes this liability. 38. If a New Zealand-resident trustee takes reasonable care in determining that a trust is not a foreign trust and it is later found to be one, there will be no retrospective liability for tax on the worldwide income of the trust if the trustee provides the required information as soon as possible upon determining that it is a foreign trust. Tax will be imposed prospectively if the trustee fails to provide the required information once the foreign trust status of the trust is established. 39. Taxing non-compliant foreign trusts on their worldwide income is intended to encourage trustees to comply with the disclosure requirements, not to impose tax on such foreign trusts. 7 Imposing a criminal penalty for failure to keep records or provide information 40. Trustees who fail to keep records or disclose information to Inland Revenue, as required under this proposal, will be subject to existing penalties under the Tax Administration Act 1994. Under this Act, a fine of up to $50,000 can be imposed, on conviction, for failure to provide information. 41. The penalty for non-compliance is imposed upon conviction. This requires the non-compliance to be detected, proceedings begun and conviction entered. How to make a submission on the proposal 42.
